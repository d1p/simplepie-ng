SimplePie NG
============

**SimplePie NG** is a modern, *next-generation* PHP package for working with syndication feeds. It has been re-written from the ground-up to take advantage of the changes that have happened in the PHP community since the original SimplePie was first released in July 2004 for PHP 4.3.

SimplePie NG is designed for professional-grade software engineers -- engineers who understand PHP and its community. It leverages the latest features of PHP without remorse for those who don't make the effort to keep current. Shared hosting providers need not apply.

It (will be) rigorously tested and strictly adheres to semantic versioning for marking changes and managing expectations around backwards-compatibility.
