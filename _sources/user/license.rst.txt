License: Why Apache 2.0?
========================

With all of the different *Free Software* and *Permissive* licenses out there, why am I selecting `Apache
2.0 <https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`__ for this project?

I have worked with a lot of engineers in my career who didn’t understand the first thing about software licenses. I even
had one co-worker once tell me that “software licenses really don’t matter, so don’t worry about it.”

We had been talking about it, and his belief was that GPL only matters if you redistribute. He was half-right.
`GPL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html>`__ and
`LGPL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html>`__ licenses do have specific rules around
redistribution, but they are *far* from the “only” thing that matters.

Short and Permissive
--------------------

Many projects use short, permissive licenses such as `MIT <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`__,
`BSD-2-clause <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`__,
`BSD-3-clause <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__, `PHP <https://opensource.org/licenses/PHP-3.0>`__,
`zlib/libpng <https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`__, `WTFPL <http://www.wtfpl.net/about/>`__, etc. These license are
fine¹ for small projects, and their brevity is often seen as a positive quality. But this same quality leaves things
legally murky.

Corporations can use these licenses without fear of lawsuits because most of them have been around a long time, and are
understood well-enough by IP lawyers.

SimplePie “OG” went through a few license changes in the earliest days, back before I understood anything about software
licenses. Since I either owned all of the code in its entirety, or Geoffrey and I owned the code jointly, we were able
to tweak the license unilaterally while we came to understand them better.

I started with `GPLv2 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html>`__ because I associated “GPL” with
“open source”. Then someone emailed me to let me know that GPL was bad (I don’t remember who it was, but they used the
phrase “cutting off my nose to spite my face”), so I changed it to
`LGPLv2.1 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html>`__. Then it was one of the `Creative
Commons <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/>`__ licenses before I learned that they were not designed for
*software* so much as *creative works* like art, photography, and music.

Finally we ended on `BSD-3-clause <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__. We briefly considered
`zlib/libpng <https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`__ and `MIT <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`__, but decided
that the difference between those and the BSD license weren’t enough to warrant another license change.

GPL, LGPL, AGPL, and “Free Software”
------------------------------------

The first thing to understand is that the license is pushed and promoted by `Richard
Stallman <https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html>`__. If you take the time to understand his politics and agenda,
you’ll understand why the GPL is the way that it is.

.. note::

    I’m going to be up-front about my dislike for Richard Stallman, GPL licenses on the whole, and the way that
    the *Free Software Foundation* handles its business. I have a fundamental philosophical opposition to the GPL because it
    takes away my freedom as a creator. Copyright is both good and fair when it’s not being `grossly abused by
    Disney <https://artlawjournal.com/mickey-mouse-keeps-changing-copyright-law/>`__ or the
    `RIAA <https://www.eff.org/wp/riaa-v-people-five-years-later>`__.

    Despite my personal disapproval of the GPL, I will do my best to describe it in an accurate and unbiased manner.

It is a *viral license*. What this means is that if you are writing code, and you pull-in some GPL’d code, your code is
now **required** to be released under the GPL. It *infects* the code that it touches, as it were. The GPL is written in
favor of the freedom of the end-user to use it however they want, and not the freedom of the creator to decide how it
can be used. From the perspective of the creator, the GPL is as restrictive as any proprietary license.

LGPL is designed to be *slightly* less restrictive, in that LGPL code stays LGPL, but it doesn’t infect your codebase.
`AGPL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.en.html>`__ is a variation of the GPL which says that if you modify
or integrate any AGPL code, you are **required** to release the source code. How does this impact usage by corporations?

Well, in nearly all cases, corporations won’t touch \*GPL code with a 10-foot pole. Unless they themselves are forking
GPL code (see `Amazon Linux <https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/>`__), they will keep any usage of \*GPL code
completely separate from all other code.

Lastly, the language in the `GPLv2 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html>`__ is intended for
*compiled software*, which SimplePie is not. This legal murkiness led the *Free Software Foundation* to develop
`GPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__ (and
`LGPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html>`__), but in doing so, they also changed the language around
patent rights, making `GPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__ a hard no-go for corporations.

So, why Apache 2.0?
-------------------

The `Apache 2.0 license <https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`__ has a few specific qualities that I was looking
for:

-  It is well-understood and defined, legally.
-  It is corporation-friendly.
-  It is *Permissive* and supports copyright (as opposed to copyleft).
-  It is broadly compatible with other *Permissive* licenses.
-  It is in wide usage in the industry.
