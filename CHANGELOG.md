# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0-milestone1

* Completely rewritten from scratch.
* Workflow redesigned knowing the things I learned from writing SimplePie 1.x.
* Stops trying to do things like HTTP handling and caching. There are better tools for those today.
* No tests yet. Mostly just trying to get a feel for the software.
* Strict coding standards and static analysis from the very beginning.
