				<p>I’m talking about Rock-&amp;-Roll as sung by charismatic young women
accompanied by proficient electric guitar.  I dunno if it’s a
					<em>trend</em>
					or anything, but I’m hearing a lot of it and I sure like it. Some of the
artists are wolves.</p>
				<h2 id="p-1">Sidebar: Men’s voices?</h2>
				<p>A dozen years ago I was asking

					<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Vedder">Why does everybody sound like
Eddie Vedder?</a>
					and while I don’t terribly miss those days, I notice that at
this point in this century all the interesting voices are women’s, and I
wonder when we’ll have some Y-chromosome voices behind the microphones I like
to listen to.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">Chelsea Wolfe</h2>
				<p>Wow, it’s a couple of years since I ran across
					<cite>Unknown Rooms</cite>
					,
which you can

					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009229FOO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009229FOO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20&amp;linkId=IV2XQIY3KAE7L5HV">get
at Amazon</a>
					but I didn’t, I got the full-rez bits at

					<a href="http://chelseawolfe.bandcamp.com/">BandCamp</a>
					and you probably
should too; unless you burn for the vinyl, which you can get from

					<a href="http://www.chelseawolfe.net/">her own site</a>
					.
It’s awfully good and if you buy it I’m sure you’ll like it,
but it’s not really in the spirit of this article because
it’s acoustic, and Chelsea is best known for floating her voice in front of a
wall of guitar noise, some by herself and some by

					<a href="http://ghostmarrow.bandcamp.com/">Aurielle Zeitler</a>
					(A.K.A.

					<a href="https://twitter.com/ghostmarrow/">@ghostmarrow</a>
					).</p>
				<img alt="Chelsea Wolfe" src="Chelsea-Wolfe-pic.png"/>
				<p>For example,
					<cite>Abyss</cite>
					(also available in bits from BandCamp and
on plastic from ChelseaWolfe.net).  Which is hard-ass spooky scary stuff, and
I suspect lots of you wouldn’t like it at all. But I sure do
and I can’t
wait to hear some of it live later this month when she plays my hometown.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">Wolf Alice</h2>
				<p>Somebody pointed me at their Glastonbury 2015 performance on YouTube
and I was hooked instantly.  But then go and take in the 2014 outing which is
every bit as good.  I’d drive overnight to see them.</p>
				<img alt="Wolf Alice" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/09/06/Wolf-Alice-pic.png"/>
				<p>In this case the girl is Ellie Rowsell and the axeman Joff Oddie, but
then Ellie plays nifty guitar and Joff sings sometimes.</p>
				<p>The performance is good but at the end of the day it has to be about the
songs and they’ve got some keepers. The big anthem is
					<cite>Moaning Lisa
Smile</cite>
					, which I recently used as an answer to “Why is it you listen to
vinyl, anyhow?” and it was a good answer.</p>
				<p>The deal is that Ellie isn’t just one singer; she can soar
like a folkie and snarl like Joan Jett and then go all Pop-Princess.  I’m a
fan.</p>
				<p>There’s only one recording,
					<cite>My Love is Cool</cite>
					, which I
ended up buying

					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=wolf%20alice%20my%20love%20is%20cool&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=wolf%20alice%20my%2Caps%2C213&amp;tag=ongoing-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;linkId=AJCSBFGIMWLEYDUU">from Amazon</a>
					on vinyl (but all they seem to have now is CD and compressed bits).</p>
				<p>The vinyl, an excellent double album with groovy graphics, included a
digital-download code, which is no surprise these
days, but what was a surprise was that about fifteen seconds after I hit
“Buy”, Amazon emailed me saying they had a download for me too.  I’m a geek so
I suppose I should check to see if these bits and those bits are the same
bits.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, it’s a totally outstanding record and if you like good singing and
good songs and good guitar playing you’ll like it.</p>
				<p>In one of the Glastonbury gigs, Joff is all Rock Glam while Ellie is
wearing a simple summer dress and then beat-up practical shoes with ankle
socks; is that pure rock-&amp;-roll style or what?</p>
				<h2 id="p-4">The Peach Kings</h2>
				<p>Guitarist: Steven Dies. Girl (and axewoman): Paige Wood. The quickest way to
get the idea would be to hop on over to YouTube and check out

					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ChPOCmaK8g">Mojo Thunder</a>
					(NSFW).
And then stay at YouTube looking for live cuts, which I did, and liked all the
ones I found.</p>
				<img alt="Peach Kings" src="Peach-Kings-pic.png"/>
				<p>Their marketing keeps saying they’re “sexy and relatable” and, yeah they’re
a nice-looking couple, and I guess if “relatable” means “nice straightforward
rock songs with major progressions and grabby hooks”, that too.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, their only recording is the
					<cite>Mojo Thunder</cite>
					EP, which you
can get cheap at

					<a href="http://thepeachkings.com/">their site</a>
					, but I recommend visiting

					<a href="http://thepeachkings.bandcamp.com/album/mojo-thunder-ep">BandCamp</a>
					and paying up a bit for the full-rez bits. The title tune will get right
under your skin, but all five tracks are going to reward a sit down and a
serious listen.</p>
				<p>Hey! Rock-&amp;-roll is in good shape!</p>

					by Isaac Marion, which I recommend.</p>
				<img alt="Warm Bodies cover" class="inline" src="warm-bodies-cover.png"/>
				<p>It’s hardly an obscure book; was quite popular and then there’s a
reasonably well-reviewed

					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008220BLG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008220BLG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20&amp;linkId=ALM5HEG7OZHUAAD5">movie version</a>
					. Over on GoodReads I found
people who liked the movie better, and the trailer looks amusing.</p>
				<p>Tl;dr: The story is mostly told in a zombie’s inner dialogue (who knew
they had ’em?) He meets The Right Girl and eats The Right Brain and big
changes start to happen.  The story is pretty silly, but the characters are
totally lovable and there are lots of good set-pieces.</p>
				<p>And brace yourself for the absolutely awful
truth about how humans and zombies teach their
children. (No, of course zombies can’t
					<em>have</em>
					children; but some

					<em>are</em>
					children.)</p>
				<p>Anyhow, if you think you might like an atmospheric well-written zombie
horror/comedy/romance, this is one of those.</p>

					by

					<a href="http://richardkadrey.com/">Richard Kadrey</a>
					, latest instalment in
the excellent
					<cite>Sandman Slim</cite>
					series.</p>
				<img alt="Killing Pretty cover" class="inline" src="kp-cover.png"/>
				<p>
					<cite>KP</cite>holds its own, better than some other
					<cite>Sandman</cite>
					entries.  There’s
plenty of wisecracking, LA
					<i>noir</i>
					, colorful violence, cool steampunk
magic, and disgusting
villains.  And explosions of imagination that’ll make you smile.</p>
				<p>But also something new: Kadrey is working on a larger story arc
here.  I don’t mean the series’ ridiculous-albeit-fun cartoon theology and
what’s happening with Hell-n-Heaven. I mean, Our Hero has grey hairs and a job
and a boss and a girlfriend with a career, and on several occasions passes up
booze for coffee.  We’re talking (gasp) adulthood!</p>
				<p>Which is cool, but the execution is a little lumpy; Kadrey’s boss’
complaints are stupidly unreasonable and stupidity just isn’t a smooth fit in
this larger storyline.  Having said that, the whole
Stark-gets-in-touch-with-his-feelings thing couldn’t have been easy but it’s
done deftly and well.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, the real message is, if you don’t know about
					<cite>Sandman
Slim</cite>
					and you’re the kind of person apt to be reading

				<p>The other day

					<a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/632260618599403520">this</a>
					, from

					<a href="http://verraes.net/">Mathias Verraes</a>
					, got thousands of
retweets.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“There are only two hard problems in distributed systems:
2. Exactly-once
delivery 1. Guaranteed order of messages 2. Exactly-once
delivery.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>That’s
really funny, but it dawns on me that it might not be obvious
why.  (Well, except to cloud infrastructure geeks.)</p>
				<p>It’s like this: In the cloud, you’d like to operate at large scale with high
reliability. (Take me out and shoot me if I’m ever heard uttering the phrase
“infinite scale” unironically.)</p>
				<h2 id="p-1">Lists</h2>
				<p>Here’s a list of the ways that you can munch data at a scale that
is, for the purposes of most apps, unbounded:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Sharding.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Which is to say, instead of trying to make one computer really fast, you
take racks-full of ordinary computers (“shards”) and deal out the incoming
data among them.</p>
				<p>Here’s a list of the ways that you can store data very reliably:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Replication.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So the messages or transactions or clicks or whatever flow in
at an insane rate and, through the magic of DNS trickery and load balancers,
get dealt out into shards, each of which can soak ’em up at some
well-understood
rate; and if they start flowing faster, you add more shards.</p>
				<p>Since you want to be really sure that not one single precious click gets
lost, you replicate, storing copies of each blessed little bundle of bytes
on multiple widely-separated boxes.</p>
				<p>The software that I know best which illustrates these principles is

					<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a>
					.
(I just use it, I don’t build it or know the details about how
it works.)

					<a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>
					is an open-source
alternative, said to be good.
Kinesis will soak up frightening volumes of data and is
very unlikely to lose any.</p>
				<p>If you’re observant, you
will have noticed that neither of the lists above has an entry #2.  Which is
OK, because in practice both these approaches work pretty damn well; as
witness the cheery growth of my employer and its competitors.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">Ointment, meet flies</h2>
				<p>There. Are. Limitations.  For example, the shards are (quite
possibly) being read by different machines, and those machines may not run at
exactly the same speed, and the incoming bits might not get dealt out exactly
evenly among the shards. So the data might not always come out in the same
order it went in.</p>
				<p>And that replication?  Well, we do it because sometimes
boxes crap out.  Which is OK because your bits are replicated, remember?
Except for maybe the box that crapped out was network gear and so two boxes
with replicas think each other are down and both helpfully deliver the goods.
Which means that your bits won’t get lost, but sometimes they might go in once
and come out more than once.</p>
				<p>“But wait!” you exclaim, “these messages are financial transactions and
they have to be delivered exactly once in the right order!”.  And while you
can scale that too, the basic shard-and-replicate stick may not turn
out to be exactly the precision instrument you were looking for.</p>
				<p>Be of good cheer: Hope is not lost.  There are tricks (mostly at the
application level) involving unique identifiers and progressive version
stamps and being really careful about

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotence</a>
					. Scaling
out remains possible; but pricier, trickier, and you have to know what you’re
doing.</p>
				<p>The really good news is that lots of applications these days can survive
dupes and ordering glitches just fine.  If you’re doing statistics or metrics
or certain classes of auditing and logging, scaling and retention has become a
matter between your credit card and your cloud vendor.</p>

things that are supposed to launch, and I’m putting in more evening and
weekend time, and so’s my team.  Which is unsurprising in high-tech
life.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The “Anytime Feedback” tool used maliciously.  Actually, I don’t see it
get used much at all.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>An unusual proportion of Type-A assholes.  I mean, this is a large,
sprawling business, and there is politics, and there are people who piss me
off sometimes. But it’s not, in my experience, worse than anywhere else I’ve
worked.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>People not expensing travel.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Horrible working conditions.  Well, I guess I’m speaking relatively,
because I personally hate the open-concept desks-in-a-row Internet-biz office
style, and the data is on my side, but Amazon’s is about industry standard,
and the “door desks” are actually pretty pleasing to the eye.</p>
						<p>(Actually, my own door desk is a motorized sit/stand thing and it’s totally
wonderful, I should write about it.)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="p-4">Diversity</h2>
				<p>Amazon sucks at gender diversity.  The industry sucks at gender
diversity. I don’t think we’re doing enough to address the problem.  I don’t
think the industry is doing enough to address the problem.  I bash away a
little bit myself, but frankly it’s discouraging.</p>
				<h2 id="p-5">Those “Leadership Principles”</h2>
				<p>Read ’em

					<a href="http://www.amazon.jobs/principles">here</a>
					.  I’m probably the wrong
guy to ask; too old and cynical and unimpressed by abstractions.
People bandy them about in everyday conversation but I mostly don’t.  To me,
they read like an unexceptional list of anodyne “good ideas for running a
business”. </p>
				<p>The “frugality” principle is, I guess, a little outside the mainstream. It’s
also pretty essential to doing useful cloud computing.</p>
				<p>And then there’s that first principle, “Customer Obsession”.  Yep; the
number of discussions about what to do and where to go that don’t include
frequent recourse to “what’s-gonna-be-best-for-customers” is about zero.</p>
				<p>Which reminds me of something.  Let me see, somewhere I used to work…</p>
				<h2 id="p-6">Amazon and Google</h2>
				<p>The differences between Amazon and Google practices and cultures are
fascinating, and I could write ten thousand words on them, but I’d
have to totally violate my confidentiality agreements with both employers, so
I won’t (mostly).</p>
				<p>But: If you take all the Amazon rhetoric I hear about customers and did a
cut/paste of “user” for “customer” you’d get more or less exactly what I heard
at Google.  Go check out the first of Google’s

					<a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/">Ten things we know
to be true</a>
					.</p>
				<p>And: In the big picture, the similarities totally
outweigh the differences.  Yeah, Google is lavish and Amazon is stingy.  But
when you’re making competitive Silly-Valley salaries, as at both, the
deltas are pretty well at the margin. (Also, the
					<em>real</em>
					money is in the stock options, not the
salaries.)</p>
				<p>The hiring and evaluation and promotion processes differ, and in ways that
matter, but an outside observer might not see them as dramatic.</p>
				<h2 id="p-7">So what happened?</h2>
				<p>I mean, how is it that
					<cite>The Times</cite>
					portrays a hell on earth, a
culture that would drive me to quitting in about fifteen minutes? I don’t
really need the money and certainly don’t need the grief.  I was really shaken
by that piece.</p>
				<p>I dunno, maybe some parts of Amazon have culture problems and some don’t?
Maybe things are different from the way they used to be?  Maybe Kontor and
Streitfeld ended up with an unrepresentative sample of interviewees?</p>
				<p>Maybe
(but I don’t think
so) everything really sucks here and I’m just too dense to see it.</p>

				<p>On a deck overlooking

structure of the view is all curvy mountains and towering evergreens and then
the separate blues of sky and sea.  I love it, but recently we hosted a
relative I’m fond of who’s been struggling with mental-health issues, who
after a few hours couldn’t take it and asked to leave: “Too much light and
space.”  And yeah, there’s as much as anyone could take.</p>
				<p>But grey days are different. Looking over the Sound, you’re in a room: Grey
sea floor, grey-green mountain walls, grey cloud ceiling.  It’s a really big
room.  This picture captures maybe a little of that.</p>

			<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
				<p>I use iTunes at home, and otherwise

					<a href="https://play.google.com/music/">Google Play music</a>
					, which really
isn’t terrible.  Since the Net is echoing with screams about
Apple’s cloud-music problems, now might be a good time for a few
words on the subject.</p>
				<p>But first, I should say that GMusic is probably only interesting if you’re
the kind of person who buys music sometimes; there are loads of options for
people who’ve migrated to an all-streaming life, and I have no idea if
Google’s is competitive.</p>
				<h2 id="p-1">“Buy music” you say?!</h2>
				<p>I strongly approve of it.  First, more money goes to the artist. Second,
there are times when I really want to hear that particular non-mainstream
track from ’99 or ’77 or ’55, or all the tracks on that non-mainstream album.
Third, when you buy music you get all the bits; I’ve explained at length

					<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2012/09/20/Hi-Fi-Harmonies">elsewhere</a>
					about
why I think avoiding compression is a good idea.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">How it works</h2>
				<p>I buy music on vinyl, on CD, and (when I can get it uncompressed) via data
download.  I load it into iTunes, which I hate but can (usually) make do what
I  want, in Apple lossless encoding.
I have a big beautiful high-end audio system at home that, when
I’m not listening to vinyl, I drive with iTunes.</p>
				<p>I have 11½ or so thousand songs, last time I checked.</p>
				<p>GMusic has this thingie where it auto-magically scans your iTunes folders
and uploads all the music into the cloud.  So what’s up there keeps in sync
automatically with what’s on the big music box.</p>
				<p>There are mobile apps
					<span class="dashes"> —</span>
					 the Android one
is decent, dunno about iOS
					<span class="dashes"> —</span>
					 and an OK Web interface too.</p>
				<p>You can play an album, or do a search and play the results, or make a
playlist and drop songs or albums onto it.  Unfortunately, there are no
search-based “Smart Playlists”.</p>
				<p>There are also a kazillion radio-stream thingies, one or more for
every artist you can think of, which cleverly combine tracks you have with
others that you don’t from the cloud.</p>
				<p>Here are some Miles-Davis-related
stations.  The music on these isn’t all Miles, but includes other tracks that
GMusic thinks are related. It’s usually right: You get Chet Baker, Herbie
Hancock, Coltrane, and so on.</p>
				<img alt="Miles Davis related radio stations on Google Music" src="Miles-davis-google-radio.png"/>
				<h2 id="p-4">Case studies</h2>
				<p>When I’m working in my office at Amazon, I like to have soft music
pulsing to combat the cubicle buzz outside, and it seems to help me think.
I’ve used those Miles stations, Arvo Pärt radio, J.S. Bach radio,
and old-school-Dub radio, all to good effect.</p>
				<p>When I’m driving back and forth to Seattle, I want high energy and
alertness, so instead of radio I usually put on “shuffle everything”.  Somehow
this seems to include Google-provided music I don’t own, so you get a lot
of surprises:

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Follow_You_into_the_Dark">I Will
Follow You Into the Dark</a>
					followed by

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Bird">Free Bird</a>
					followed by a

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Stokowski">Stokowski</a>
					Bach transcription.</p>
				<p>When I’m suffering travel frazzle in a hotel room, I put on

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferron">Ferron</a>
					or

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Savall">Jordi Savall</a>
					, and
know sleep is just around the corner.</p>
				<p>It’s not perfect. To start with, it’s not a backup service.  There are
sometimes ads (which you can make go away with the paid version, something I
keep meaning to check out).
But mostly it Just Works, no surprises.</p>

				<p>If it looks kind of grainy that’s because I’d fat-fingered the camera into
shooting at ISO6400. But the X-T1 is sufficiently resilient that this (like
many other of my photo-miscues) came out OK.  Which is especially true when
you shoot through the stupidly-good Fuji XF35mm.</p>
				<p>But wait! There are more cranes and they’ve got the mountains behind
them.</p>
				<img alt="Vancouver harbour cranes and North Shore mountains" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/28/FXT14541.png"/>
				<p>Immodest confession: This picture makes me happy. That has nothing to
do with the photo-technique (Fuji XF55-200 and substantial Lightrooming). It’s
because it captures at least a half-dozen really good reasons to live here in
Vancouver, a thing I’m seriously invested in.</p>
				<p>But wait! There’s something about that first crane, too… there’s our
Moon, nestling in its angles.</p>
				<img alt="Moon in crane" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/28/FXT14516.png"/>

			<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
				<p>A couple of months ago, ten people spent an hour sitting down with

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>
					,

					<a href="http://www.liberal.ca/">Liberal Party leader</a>
					and
potentially Canada’s next Prime Minister, to talk about

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-terrorism_Act,_2015">Bill
C-51</a>
					, anti-terrorist legislation from our Conservative
government. I was one of those people, and perhaps readers might be
interested in hearing about it.</p>
				<h2 id="p-1">Sidebar: Why now?</h2>
				<p>After the meeting I decided not to blog it, because I was worried about
ethics; nobody had said the meeting was private but nobody’d said it was
public either. Recently I mentioned this to a Liberal insider I know who’d
helped organize and he looked shocked: “Why not?! People ought to hear that
Justin’s having these conversations.”</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">Sidebar: C-51</h2>
				<p>People who are Canadians probably already have opinions; for those who
don’t,

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-terrorism_Act,_2015">Wikipedia’s
coverage</a>
					isn’t terrible.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://openmedia.ca/">OpenMedia.ca</a>got a bunch of Canadian business
leaders (including me) to sign an

					<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/how-c-51-will-undermine-canadas-business-climate-an-open-letter-from-60-canadian-business-leaders">open letter</a>
					to the
government condemning the legislation. In response, some Tory backbench
dullard

					<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/05/07/laurie-hawn-c-51_n_7232784.html">questioned
our values and suggested we reconsider our business model</a>
					.  Also,
Opposition leader Tom Mulcair sent us all nice emails.  Also, a few of us got
to meet with Justin Trudeau.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">The meeting</h2>
				<p>Trudeau’s opening statement was direct; not smarmy
or evasive or pandering.  It was along the lines of “We thought there were
some good things in the bill and we really didn’t want to give Stephen Harper
the chance to fight the election on the security issue, claiming to be the
only party tough on terrorism, because that’s where he wants to be.”</p>
				<p>Color me unconvinced. I think the
bill (which BTW I have read in its entirety) is a load of crap and unlikely to
save a single Canadian life. I also think Justin is wrong about the politics; more
on that later.</p>
				<p>After Trudeau was done, the rest of us politely but firmly gave him a hard
time. People from a fintech vendor  explained that their
competitive advantage against US vendors due to the wide (and correct)
perception that the US intelligence community will subvert any organization’s
privacy at a whim, but that Canada is more grown-up, could
evaporate. A social-media company executive groused about surveillance chill
on the great Internet conversation. A civil-liberties lawyer suggested that
policy should be evidence-based, and that there was no evidence that the
policies in advanced in C-51 would actually enhance Canadians’ safety.</p>
				<p>My big argument was that the Liberals have the politics wrong. Recent
events suggest that the actual terrorists here in Canada are drug-addicted
basement-dwelling losers; immensely less dangerous to us than
texting drivers, West Nile virus, or agricultural antibiotic abuse.  By and
large Canadians are
not frightened of these morons, and the Tory moves are chickenshit, and
the Liberals should just come out and say so.  </p>
				<p>If you’re in a serious well-organized and well-armed terrorist
cell, do you think Toronto or Calgary is going to feature very high in your
worldwide list of big targets? Me neither.
Curtailing one fingernail’s
width of our liberties to deflect gnats like

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_shootings_at_Parliament_Hill,_Ottawa">Zehaf-Bibeau</a>
					is cowardly, and stupid too.</p>
				<p>More on the political ineffectiveness of the Liberal position: Back on July
4th Stephen Harper gave a speech

					<a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/harper-urges-voters-to-avoid-risk-of-ndp-or-liberals-in-power">alleging that Justin Trudeau would
“gut” C-51 if elected</a>
					.</p>
				<h2 id="p-5">Take-away on Trudeau</h2>
				<p>He’s an impressive guy: good communicator, attentive listener, more direct
and less formulaic than other politicians I’ve met.</p>
				<p>In the election we’re having this October, I’m firmly in the
“Anyone but Stephen Harper” camp and might even vote tactically for the first
time in my life.  Right now, three months from election day, my take is that

					<a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">Mulcair and the NDP</a>
					are a better bet, both
strategically and tactically, for people like me.  The awful Liberal misstep
on C-51 is a significant part of the reason.</p>
				<p>But three months is a long
time and Trudeau would be an immense improvement on what we have now.</p>
				<p>I think he deserves considerable credit for showing up and listening.</p>

out of it.  Then Raziel came to our book club meeting, which was weird but good.</p>
				<h2 id="p-1">Sidebar: On Book Clubs</h2>
				<p>I can feel the eye-rolling coming back through the Internet at me. The
book-club notion had been opaque, but then I found myself
exposed to my wife’s because it was at our house sometimes. Seemed to center
around wine and munchies and argument, with a lot of laughing. And I’ve

					<a href="/ongoing/What/Arts/Books/">always been a bookworm</a>
					, so now I’ve
been going for years.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, I recommend the book-club thing.  All of us have known each other
for a long time (4 are members of the original XML Working Group).  Having a
frame to hang a couple of hour of structured conversation on really
ups the intensity of just hanging-with-friends.</p>
				<p>Also, you end up reading books you’d never have gone near. Sometimes
that’s a win and when it isn’t, maybe you got your mind expanded anyhow.</p>
				<img alt="cover of “When everything feels like the movies" class="inline" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/15/wefltm-cover.png"/>
				<h2 id="p-2">When Everything Feels Like the Movies</h2>
				<p>This is marketed as “young adult” but ouf, it’s heavy stuff. Told by and
featuring Jude, a flamboyant cross-dressing boy in a nowheresville high-school,
who is walking trouble; Can he escape via the bus to LA before something
awful happens?</p>
				<p>Parts are horrifying.  Jude is in a shitty place,
living among families that are broken and broke too, in a town with little to
offer.  His friends and crushes and enemies are so alive, jumping off the
page, and you can’t help but feel anger or admiration, but mostly I just
felt sorry for them.  High school sucked for me and most people I know, which is why
I wouldn’t normally choose a book about it. Yay book club.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, the book won prizes and became a news story when certain
decency-loving citizens objected loudly to it, on the grounds that it’s full
of lurid homosexual desire and yes, actual sexual activity.  If that’s gonna
shock you, stay away.</p>
				<p>All I need to say about the writing is that it managed to get this
straight greybeard totally identifying with a gay teenager.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">The meeting</h2>
				<p>We sat around and drank wine, ate blueberries, and a couple of hours just
vanished.
We’d never hosted an author and Raziel had never come to a book club, so I
think we were all kind of tense.  But everyone seemed to have fun.</p>
				<p>Raziel was
gracious when people were complimentary and willing to push back cheerfully
when he didn’t agree with someone‘s take on an angle of the book.  Um…
Most writers would love to sit around for a couple of hours with people
talking about their writing, n’est-ce pas?</p>
				<p>He’s actively working on a film version, and yep, there’s a first-rate
movie lurking in here. But that business is a heart-breaker, I hope he comes
out of the process unsoiled.</p>
				<p>I wondered if actually hanging with an author would change the way I felt
about the writing.  Nope. I’m totally more likely to buy his next book, just
because he’s now a person I know. But I probably would have anyhow, because this
one is good.</p>

				<p>We’ve had week after week of blue skies and warm air;
which in the green/grey Pacific Northwest begins to feel
oppressive, you can almost hear the plants, great and small, whimpering for
water.  After a while every morning‘s news told of new forest fires marching
up one tinder-dry mountain or another.
Which lent visual drama to the July 4th weekend but I have to
admit soured the

					<a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/Cottage%20Life/">Cottage-Life</a>
					ambience.</p>
				<p>The fires turned from up-country news story to local color; extremely
local and very colorful.  Here’s the night before and the July-4th morning.</p>

including

					<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/trending/smoky-skies-from-wildfires-snapped-by-residents-in-vancouver-1.3138949">the CBC</a>
					and ABC; did anyone reading this see it on any ABC
outlets?</p>
				<img alt="Smoky morning over Howe Sound" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/12/FXT14346.png"/>
				<p>There was a layer of ash that morning on our deck and outdoor table and
everything really, and now I have a speck in the top right corner of my
Fujifilm X-T1 pictures, probably because I changed lenses while ash fell.
The
smell of smoke was intense and exotic and constant.</p>
				<p>The kids went swimming anyhow under the red-grey sky but I have to admit
I felt uneasy about the whole thing; not least because we were sitting among
tinder-dry trees.  So we packed up and came home a little earlier than
necessary.  I was sort of hoping that we wouldn’t find Vancouver become
Bellona, scorpion packs roaming ruined streets under a writhing red sky.
(Pardon the

				<p>The city was a little less smoky but the sun was still in an extremely
filtered condition; here it peeks redly through a neighbor’s tree.</p>

				<p>We returned this last weekend and not only was the sky a reassuring
grey but there was actual rain

nearly enough, but still we welcomed it.</p>
				<p>Look at the leaves rejoicing.  That wood is wet, as driftwood on
Pacific Northwest beaches is supposed to be.</p>
				<img alt="Wet leaves and driftwood" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/12/FXT14416.png"/>
				<p>Don’t believe me that the wood was wet?  Here’s a wet dock and a wet float
and a wet boat and the ocean, which is the color it should often be up round
here, but hasn’t been.</p>
				<img alt="Wet woad, wet boat" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/12/FXT14427.png"/>
				<p>OK, but now it’s a bright Monday again, and the meteorologists looking
forward see only
fleeting chances of showers. I fear for the trees.</p>

					by P.W. Singer and August Cole, and read till 2:30AM. I just now
finished it.  Is it a great book? No.  But it’s a ripping naval yarn, an
old-fashioned war story. Also:
					<i>Rail gun!</i></p>
				<p>Warning: Spoilers!  But I read a few spoilers in advance and found they
didn’t take the edge off, much.</p>
				<img alt="Ghost Fleet" class="inline" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/07/07/ghost-fleet.png"/>
				<h2 id="p-1">Tl;dr</h2>
				<p>A near-future China with a government somewhat different from its current
regime launches a war of aggression against the U.S.A. and scores big
early wins, based in part on technological excellence and also plenty of
back-dooring and root-kitting.  Insurgency follows, and finally a big
set-piece battle.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">Respectful disagreement</h2>
				<p>Lead author Singer is a US defence insider, and he sure sounds like he
knows what he’s talking about; at least on military-tech issues.</p>
				<p>Having said that, I think that US/China war is not entirely implausible and
you don’t need to posit either a new Chinese regime, or continued dysfunction
in the US military’s acquisition process, to get there. It goes like this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>The Chinese economy gets in really serious trouble and a
substantial chunk of the people lose faith that they’re going to be
richer next decade, and decide they’ve had it up to here with corruption and
pollution and censorship, and they hit the streets.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The government decides (correctly) that their best bet is to play the
nationalist card, and launches Operation Reclaim Taiwan.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The US honors its treaty obligations and wades in.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There ya go, not that much of a stretch at all.  But
					<cite>Ghost
Fleet</cite>
					has a scenic backdrop that many will know, and is much prettier
than Taiwan.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">Problems</h2>
				<p>The characters; well, a couple of them strain up against the boundaries of
the page, but nobody ever quite made it into that third dimension, for me
anyhow; and some are just toons.
The dialogue, well, let’s just say it’s not Elmore Leonard.  In particular,
none of the Chinese characters gets much authorial love (that one really
bothered me).</p>
				<h2 id="p-4">What’s good</h2>
				<p>The choreography and plotsmanship is very competent; the story keeps moving
right along.  A few characters are fun; notably Carrie the
Black Widow, Markov the Pushkin-loving anti-insurgency
expert, and Vern the battery-tech geek.</p>
				<p>You gotta love the American Mujahedin (that’s what they call themselves),
sprinting away from IED explosions on mountain bikes.</p>
				<p>But seriously, it’s mostly the tech, the battle set-pieces, and the cool
weapons.  Me, I’m a
pacifist, I’ve never felt the slightest military urge and am glad to be a
citizen of a nation which won’t see war in my lifetime, nor my children’s.
But a lot of the best stories are war stories.</p>
				<p>And most of all, a really
					<em>really</em>
					big rail gun is about the coolest
thing ever.  This book has the biggest.</p>

				<h2 id="p-1">On Record Stores</h2>
				<p>So, there are two things you find in record stores.  The first, what with
vinyl’s resurgence, are lots of foot-square packages advertising the music they
contain, often with eye-grabbing visuals.  The second, almost every time, is
some pretty fucking cool music on the sound system.  Record stores, they’re a
good thing, and let’s hope we have ’em with us for a while.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">The Music</h2>
				<p>I now know a lot about West-African pop music of the mid-Twentieth century,
just from reading the voluminous liner notes.  Lauren raised her eyebrows when
I brought it home: “Huh?”  I said “African music, I like it because it’s

					<em>light</em>
					”, and I’ll stand by that. There’s a lot more that could be said
about rhythmic depth and good singing and all that stuff, but it’s the
essential lightness of touch in Afri-pop that’s uniquely charmed me.</p>
				<p>This is good stuff; 38 tracks by a bunch of people I never heard of, and
three  by the very young

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti">Fela Kuti</a>
					. There’s
nothing terribly shocking or soul-charging here, but if you can
listen to this stuff without smiling, you need treatment.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">Media</h2>
				<p>Been buying a lot of vinyl these days; my reasons are

					<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2012/10/15/Why-Vinyl">here</a>
					.  Every new LP I’ve
bought recently has included a download code so you can get decent-quality
MP3s too.  These are appropriate for travel and as housecleaning beats.</p>
				<p>Well, they would be if it weren’t for shambling undead drooling inflicters
of pain otherwise known as Apple’s elite iTunes product management unit.</p>
				<p>It’s like this: I have a whole lot of music. I regularly think “I feel like
listening to X while I do dishes.”  So I sit down in front of iTunes, type in
X (for example “Highlife on the Move”) and hit Play.  Right?  &lt;Insert
hollow cynical laughter here.&gt;Wrong.  Well, sometimes it works; just to get
my hopes up.</p>
				<p>I’m not giving a detailed route map through this particular trail of tears;
suffice it to say that the
					<em>single most common operation</em>
					a music
manager ought to support is now crippled in iTunes, as a matter of policy.</p>
				<p>How do I know it’s even possible? Because over at

					<a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/Cottage%20Life/">our cabin</a>
					, we keep an
ancient Blackbook running OS X 10.8, hasn’t been connected to the Net in
years and listen to the tunes off a USB disk.
					<em>That</em>
					version
of iTunes can
					<em>search for a fucking album and play the fucking
tunes on it</em>
					.</p>
				<p>There has to be an alternative.</p>

				<p>In which I have excessive Lightroom fun with a simple photo of some

					, one of
Vancouver’s nicer things.</p>

					<p>The way it came out of the camera. Under a bright
cloudy sky,
						<br/>
						the white balance (as expected from Fuji X-cams) is exact;
						<br/>
						they
looked just like this.</p>
				</div>
				<p>I thought the fun of the picture was mostly in the geometry, so why not try
it in B&amp;W?</p>

					<p>This is Lightroom’s built-in “B&amp;W Contast High”
preset, the contrast softened a little with the Tone
sliders, and a bit of grain for texture.</p>
				</div>
				<p>But at heart I’m a color kind of guy. I was thinking of how I might improve
the color, and to get ideas I looked at some of the Fujifilm vintage-film-look
presets.  OMG VELVIA!</p>
				<img alt="Leaves, Fujifilm “Velvia” treatment" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/06/28/leaves-4.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>No judgment on this one, just that Velvia selection.
						<br/>
						Every other time I’ve tried to use it the results felt garish.</p>

				<p>I wasn’t entirely persuaded by the monochrome version, but figured maybe
there’d be a nice stopping-place halfway down that road.</p>

				<div class="caption">
					<p>Tried to find a halfway point on the color intensity,
both with saturation sliders and by adjusting the balance,
and (something I rarely do any more) bumped the Clarity slider a
bit.</p>
				</div>
				<p>But in fact I’ve noticed that with vegetation shots,
					<em>negative</em>
					clarity is often a winner.  So let’s go all impressionistic here.</p>
				<img alt="Impressionistic treatment of leaf shot" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/06/28/leaves-2.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>The trick is negative clarity along with considerable
contrast crankage and a little color softening.  True to reality?  Not in the
slightest!</p>
				</div>
				<p>Photography is a nice hobby.  Photo processing is a related but distinct
pursuit; and its own reward.</p>

				<h2 id="p-2">2015</h2>
				<p>I’ll let you in on a little secret: Making computer software full-time is
a lot harder than doing it a little and writing about it a lot.  For the first
time in some decades, I spend all the time that I’m not in meetings about
software in front of a computer constructing it.  It’s high-risk stuff and
may never ship. Fortunately I still like programming and the environment is
pretty much free of toxic people.</p>
				<img alt="Blurred window" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/06/24/FXT14118.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>That thing about time passing faster as you age is
total crap.  At least with respect to planning meetings.</p>
				</div>
				<p>But, what with that and a family featuring a difficult daughter, I’m
tired a lot.  One symptom is less blogging.  Well, that’s also a
function of not writing about the day job.</p>
				<img alt="Dock pilings" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/06/24/FXT14177.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>That’s what I call aging gracefully.</p>
				</div>
				<p>I’ll tell you something though; blogging may not be the fashion nexus it
was a decade back, but it’s where everything that’s important about this
profession is said.  Start, for instance, at

					<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a>
					and try to
find something that’s not a blog.  (Yeah, I know, Reddit ewwww, but for geek
stuff it’s the place.)  Blogs burst outta the geekosphere round the
turn of the millennium, and maybe that’s the heartland we fall back on.
Which isn’t terrible. And while us nerds may exhibit poor
social skills, we write better than average.  My tribe.</p>
				<h2 id="p-4">Tired, you said?</h2>
				<p>So why not retire?  Because I totally don’t have trouble
getting up in the morning and cracking open a screen to see what’s new.  And I
wake up realizing why Plan D for payload subset extraction is just as flawed
as A, B, and C were; but E gleams on the horizon.  There’s work to be done!</p>

					<p>Boat bedtime.</p>
				</div>
				<h2 id="p-5">Busy, you said?</h2>
				<p>Oh, I didn’t mention Ingress and the camera and the boat and the island and
my geeky wife and
my son who’s turning 16 and will be taller than me by 17 and my Mom, all there
at 85. Plus I’m reading a lot.</p>
				<p>The years that flow by?  I notice the seasons intensely, but not really the
numbers attached.</p>

Water Knife</a>
					by

					<a href="http://windupstories.com/">Paolo Bacigalupi</a>
					, which is
terrific.</p>
				<img alt="The Water Knife by Paulo Bacigalupi" class="inline" src="twk.png"/>
				<p>What happened was, we’d flown from Vancouver to pick up a suitcase full of
magtapes (the old reel-to-reel kind you used to see on movie computers)
full of source code for some behemoth mainframe
thing, you couldn’t possibly transfer that much data over the network.
But there were issues.
					<i>[Will you get to the damn review already? –Ed. Oh,
right. –T]</i></p>
				<h2 id="p-3">Our book</h2>
				<p>This is a stylish action-packed page-turner with atmospherics that
get out there into William Gibson territory.  Phoenix is running
out of water fast
					<span class="dashes"> —</span>
					 the people who want it in Las
Vegas and California are meaner and richer and better armed
					<span class="dashes"> —</span>
					 and choked with refugees from Texas where all
the water’s long-gone.  Our heroes are a murderous enforcer for Vegas’ water-rights queen (the
“water knife”) and a plucky Pulitzer-prize winning journalist (blonde of
course).</p>
				<p>The postapocalyptica is polished and the plotting totally deft
and you gotta love Angel and Lucy.  There’s a glaring believability gap in
that people suffer grievous gunshot wounds and torture, then bounce back by the
day after tomorrow.  Also, some will gripe about the ending; I’ll just stay
out of spoiler territory and say I thought it fine.</p>
				<p>Just like the cliche says, un-put-downable; cost me quite a bit of one
night’s sleeping time.  2015’s best sci-fi so far if you ask me, and that
includes
					<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2015/06/04/Nemesis-Games">the latest
Expanse outing</a>
					.</p>

					, and
similarly with a flavor of environmental devastation.</p>

					is another book, Marc
Reisner’s

					,
which I read many years ago and now will again.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">Oh right, Phoenix</h2>
				<p>That Eighties trip we had a long evening to while away and so I and my
companion Gary, a South African dude with Asian genes who bailed when Chinese were
reclassified as white and became eligible for the draft but he didn’t want to
die for Boer glory, went mini-golfing,
played on way past midnight, which seemed like a good idea at the time, but
the next day we started late and he couldn’t get the Phoenix mainframe to
co-operate so we didn’t burn rubber out of the corporate parking lot till
way too close to plane time and had a sticky time explaining the extra
suitcase full of magtapes to officials at both ends of the trip.</p>
				<p>But anyhow, a lot of smart people don’t think Phoenix should really be
there at all for reasons of hydrology;
					<cite>The Water Knife</cite>
					lays
out a totally plausible and very ugly end-game for it.  And is a ripping yarn,
too.</p>

				<p>I’ve been writing this blog since 2003 and in that time have laid down, along with way
over a million words, 12,373 hyperlinks. I’ve noticed that when
something leads me back to an old piece, the links are broken disappointingly
often. So I made a little graph of their decay over the last 144 months.</p>
				<img alt="URI decay at ongoing by Tim Bray" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/05/25/decay.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>The “% Decay” value for each value of “Months Ago” is
the percentage of links
						<em>made in that month</em>
						that have decayed.  For
example, just over 5% of the links I made in the month 60 months before May
2015, i.e. May 2010, have decayed.</p>
				</div>
				<h2 id="p-1">Longer title</h2>
				<p>“A broad-brush approximation of URI decay focused on links selected for
blogging by a Web
geek with a camera, computed using a Ruby script cooked up in 45
minutes.”
Mind you, the script took the best part of 24 hours to run, because I was too
lazy to make it run a hundred or so threads in parallel.</p>
				<p>I suppose I could regress the hell out of the data and get a prettier line
but the story these numbers are telling is clear enough.</p>
				<p>Another way to get a smoother curve would be for someone at Google to
throw a Map/Reduce at a historical dataset with hundreds of billions of links.</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">This is a very sad graph</h2>
				<p>But to be honest I was expecting worse.
I wonder if, a hundred years after I’m
dead, the only ones that remain alive will begin with “en.wikipedia.org”?</p>

					, interest in work on “vocabulary” (by which they mean the
actual angle-bracketed thingies that go into HTML) seems pretty lacking.</p>
				<p>Me, I think HTML is done.  Which doesn’t mean I think that the whole
Web-programming platform is in a good state:</p>
				<img alt="Brower problems" src="Browser-problems.png"/>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>(I posted this on Twitter a year or two

				</div>
				<p>The browser-as-a-platform is based on a lousy programming language
addressing a lousy object model and using a lousy stylesheet language for
visuals.  Each of those could and should be replaced by something better.
HTML?  Not perfect, but plenty good enough.</p>
				<p>Not only is HTML finished; Even if we wanted to improve it, there are
no obvious candidates to do the work.
The W3C has repeatedly walked down blind HTML alleys. The WhatWG model was
never remotely sustainable.</p>
				<p>Let’s down tools and focus on more important problems.</p>

				<h2 id="p-1">Tl;dr:</h2>
				<p>While
					<i>Rocinante</i>
					is being fixed, Holden, Naomi, Amos, and Alex
wend their four separate ways around the Solar System.  War happens, and with
a new adversary. Billions die! Bobbie is back! Holden keeps a secret!
Amos has a hilarious scene
with Avasarala! Other set-pieces include a bike ride across a postapocalyptic
landscape and a 50-meter leap from spaceship to spaceship,
					<i>sans</i>
					spacesuit (not sure about the science on that one).</p>
				<h2 id="p-2">What’s good</h2>
				<p>Breaking up the crew lets the Corey twins stretch out and do lots of
character exposition; I particularly enjoyed the time alone with the
generally-underappreciated Alex.  The conversation is amusingly hard-boiled, as
always.  In learning some of Naomi’s back-story (she has an ex, and boy is he
ever bad) we get to know her better.
Just like
					<cite>Lost</cite>
					, only different.</p>
				<h2 id="p-3">What’s bad</h2>
				<p>Well, the ending; or lack of one.  The central problem around which the
plot advances is left 100% unresolved.  There’s at least a decade’s worth of
development and denouement left in the franchise, which is a good thing. I
guess, just like in HBO, at some point in Season Two you need a couple
episodes which are mostly new-story-arc launch.</p>
				<h2 id="p-4">Whatever</h2>
				<p>Like I said, if you’ve read them this far, you’ll read this one.  And
having read it, you’ll read the next one, presumably due for release in summer
2016.</p>

				<p>I’d like to have my pictures online, and I’d be willing to pay for service.
Here’s what I want; I don’t think any of the Cloud Photo services provide it,
but I’d be happy to hear I’m wrong.

				<h2 id="p-1">Google gets music right</h2>
				<p>I use iTunes to organize music and listen to it on the big high-end stereo
at home; the majority losslessly encoded.  I use Google Music when I’m in automobiles and airplanes and hotel
rooms.  It works great; when I get new music, whether on a shiny disk or
digital download, I import it into iTunes and Gmusic auto-magically loads it
into the cloud before too long.</p>
				<p>Since I’m a

					<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2012/09/20/Hi-Fi-Harmonies">deranged
audiophile</a>
					, I insist on CD-or-better quality for the big system at home,
whenever possible.
Now, Gmusic only uploads the compressed MP3 versions, but I don’t care.
I’m listening to that stuff in high-ambient-noise environments or in whatever
cheesy speakers a hotel room lets me plug my mobile into.  And Gmusic has all
sorts of nifty features for making playlists and discovering new music.</p>
				<p>(Notes: First, I don’t actually
					<em>like</em>
					iTunes, but I can live with
it.
Second, I’m sure Gmusic has competition that’s about as good.)</p>

				<h2 id="p-2">For pictures</h2>
				<p>What I want is more or less the photographic equivalent of Gmusic:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>I want to go on editing in Lightroom, and working from raw images for
maximum quality, on my own computer.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I want all my images, in their edited form, online. JPEG is fine; that
quality (as in, for example, the ones in this article) exceeds the quality of
most screens I’m apt to be showing them on.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I want the uploading to happen silently and automatically.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I want the metadata (tagging, geolocation) uploaded too.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I don’t particularly want to edit pix on anything but my own computer;
my MacBook Pro is beefy enough and always along on my trips.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I’d like the online service to have really slick slide-show tools that
know all about lots of different screen sizes and resolutions and just make
the pictures look great on whatever I’m going to use to show them, without me
having to think about it.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="p-4">Suggestions from the Net</h2>
				<p>I published this on a Saturday and by Sunday morning the suggestions were
rolling in.  I’ll keep updating this.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<a href="http://photos.chwojkofrank.com/">Tom Chwojko-Frank</a>points
out that SmugMug has a

							<a href="http://help.smugmug.com/customer/portal/articles/1491124">Lightroom
plugin</a>
							that claims to Just Work.  Wow, SmugMug; they were first a thing
when I was at Sun, ten years back.  We loved ’em corporately because they were
on our boxes; I loved ’em personally because their pitch was “Like Flickr
only better, but you have to pay for it.”  Looks like

							<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/smugmug/">they’re on AWS
now</a>
							; they’re following me around.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Paul Guinnessy

							<a href="#c1433015474.820442">points out</a>
							the

							<a href="https://support.picturelife.com/hc/en-us/articles/203513477-Using-the-Picturelife-plugin-for-Lightroom">Picturelife
Lightroom Plug-in</a>
							. Never heard of ’em but Paul says they’re good.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Then there’s the very slick-looking

							<a href="http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/folder-publisher">Folder
Publisher by Jeffrey Friedl</a>
							.  Someone somewhere pointed out that once
you’ve got the pix out of Lightroom you can auto-bridge to Flickr, but I lost
the suggestion.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Aravind Krishnaswamy, via John Nack, has details on

							<a href="http://jnack.com/blog/2015/05/30/tip-integrating-lightroom-with-google-photos/">Integrating Lightroom with Google Photos</a>
							using Friedl’s exporter.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Note: None of these are really
					<em>backup</em>
					services because the
originals are in camera Raw formats plus Lightroom sidecar files. These are
publishing/sharing services.  Also, it dawns on me that a huge proportion of
my photos, those of my kids and family, are non-public.  So I’ll have to see
how well that’s covered.</p>
				<h2 id="p-5">My plans</h2>
				<p>I’m torn, to be honest. The Friedl plug-in, which puts a layer of
indirection between me and the Cloud, feels like my kind of thing. But I think
like I owe SmugMug a try, they’ve been contributing to my paycheck for a long
time.</p>
