Apple says Metal will allow games and pro apps to &quot;tap into the full power of Mac graphics processors.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, Apple has updated windows management, made improvements to the pre-installed apps and Spotlight search, and improved the startup speed of apps, emails and music. El Capitan also adds a split screen view for multi-taskers and better copy/drag-and-drop options for Notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;OS X delivers unparalleled integration between Mac hardware, iOS devices, apps and online services, and has helped Mac sales outpace the PC industry every year for the last decade,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering earlier this year.&lt;i&gt; &quot;Customers loved last year's landmark OS X Yosemite release and made it the fastest-adopted PC operating system ever. With El Capitan, we're further refining the Mac experience with enhancements to window management, Spotlight and built-in apps, and improving performance so everyday activities -- from launching apps to accessing email -- are faster and more responsive.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/osx/elcapitan-preview/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/apple-s-new-operating-system-mac-os-x-el-capitan-to-launch-at-end-of-month&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/apple-s-new-operating-system-mac-os-x-el-capitan-to-launch-at-end-of-month#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

The service supports credit and debit cards from AmEx, Discover, MasterCard and Visa as well as gift cards, loyalty cards and store cards. Notably, most of the largest banks are supported but Wells Fargo, Capital One and Citi are &quot;coming soon.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regards to security, Google was very quick to note how secure using the service will be: &lt;i&gt;&quot;We know how important it is to keep your personal and financial information secure, so Android Pay is supported by industry standard tokenization. This means your real credit or debit card number isn't sent with your payment. Instead, we'll use a virtual account number that provides an extra layer of security. As soon as you make a purchase, you'll see a payment confirmation that shows where a given transaction happened, so it's easy to catch any suspicious activity. And if your phone is ever lost or stolen, simply use Android Device Manager to instantly lock your device from anywhere, secure it with a new password, or even wipe it clean of your personal information.&quot;&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/09/tap-pay-done.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/android-pay-is-finally-here&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/android-pay-is-finally-here#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

Signals emitted from two locations in the tip calculate the angle and orientation to produce broad or shaded strokes.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a good look at the Pencil:&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlYC8gDvutc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/take-a-look-at-the-high-precision-apple-pencil-stylus-in-action&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/11/take-a-look-at-the-high-precision-apple-pencil-stylus-in-action#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

We continue to evaluate other formats and look forward to receiving feedback as we work on implementing them,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; added the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft also got more technical about how VP9/WebM will work with the browser: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Our initial VP9 implementation in Microsoft Edge will support adaptive streaming using Media Source Extensions, and will be detectable using the MediaSource.isTypeSupported() API. It will be specifically targeted to meet the needs of websites that use VP9 to deliver video in combination with MP4/AAC or other audio codecs already supported by Microsoft. We are working on future support for VP9 for media tags and local playback, as well as considering support for additional audio formats likely to be used with VP9 such as Opus.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/09/08/announcing-vp9-support-coming-to-microsoft-edge/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/10/microsoft-edge-will-soon-support-webm-vp9&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/10/microsoft-edge-will-soon-support-webm-vp9#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

In the past decade the company has racked up $1.6 billion in settlements from companies like Dish, AT&amp;T, Motorola and Cisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Today's action should help address one of the questions regarding the value, breadth and applicability of TiVo's IP portfolio,&quot; &lt;/i&gt;said TiVo president and CEO Tom Rogers in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TiVo also made it clear that the lawsuit is to protect their future value: &lt;i&gt;&quot;This morning we filed a patent infringement suit against Samsung in the Eastern District of Texas. Our complaint asserts four patents, including the '389 Time Warp patent and the '195 Trick Play patent, both of which we have litigated before. Our complaint also asserts two patents that are related to the '389 patent but have expiration dates further into the future. Today's action should help address one of the questions regarding the value, breadth, and applicability of TiVo's IP portfolio post the 2018 expiration of the '389 patent.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://investor.tivo.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=106292&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2086163&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TiVo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/10/tivo-sues-samsung-over-patent-infringement&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/10/tivo-sues-samsung-over-patent-infringement#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

In addition, the company dropped the price of the Mini 2 to $269, a very compelling price for the tablet.&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Pic via &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/09/apple-ipad-mini-4-price-specs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/ipad-mini-4-priced-at-399-ipad-mini-2-drops-to-269&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/ipad-mini-4-priced-at-399-ipad-mini-2-drops-to-269#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn1.afterdawn.fi/news/600x400/AppleTV-Siri-Remote-Sept15.jpg&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; border=0 alt=&quot;Apple TV gets first major upgrade in years&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Apple is pursuing your living room again with the first major hardware and software revamp of the Apple TV since 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Apple TV device (which just looks slightly bigger on the outside) will run on a new operating system called tvOS, which is based on iOS. Apple will provide the tvOS SDK to enable developers to utilize the increased power under the hood, and especially the considerable remote control upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Siri Remote improves how you can select, scroll and navigate through your favorite content using a glass touch surface that handles both small, accurate movements as well as big, sweeping ones. It features a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope which developers can use to create motion-controlled apps and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its internal mic, the Siri Remote can be used to search TV shows and movies by title, genre, cast, crew, rating or popularity using your voice, and Apple TV now supports Universal Search like Microsoft's Xbox services, meaning you won't have to know which content is available from which app beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viewers will also be able to use voice commands during playback, such as asking &quot;Siri, what did he say?&quot;, which will prompt the playback to skip back a few seconds and enable captions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGe66lSeSXg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apple upgraded the Apple TV in 2012 to support 1080p video output, and since there was no word of a 4K upgrade today we can only assume it's not happening yet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the hood, Apple TV is powered with an A8 chip. The Siri Remote uses Bluetooth 4.0 and apparently will last for up to three months on a charge. When totally out of juice, it can be recharged using the Lightning plug. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So when is it available and how much does it cost? The new Apple TV will be available from October in more than eighty countries, available with 32GB or 64GB storage, priced at $149 and $199, respectively.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-tv-gets-first-major-upgrade-in-years&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-tv-gets-first-major-upgrade-in-years#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

It weighs 1.57lb (713 grams) for the Wi-Fi only model, and slightly heavier at 1.59lb (723 grams) for the Wi-Fi+ Cellular model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the hood it packs Apple's latest SoC, the A9X which boasts improvements over the A8X inside the iPad Air 2, including double the memory bandwidth. Apple decided to focus on its improvements over the A7 mostly though (iPad Air), claiming the A9X provides 2.5x faster CPU processing and 5x faster GPU processing over the A7. As for how much RAM is packed in the iPad Pro, honestly we have no idea right now but the suggestions around are that it has 2GB, just the iPad Air 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There isn't much to talk about in regard to camera improvements, the iPad Pro features the same 8MP iSight camera on the back and FaceTime HD camera on the front as the iPad Air 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It promises up to ten hours battery life (nine hours if you spend all of your time surfing) on a full charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlYC8gDvutc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the size of the iPad Pro, the price is also on the high end. For a 32GB Wi-Fi-only model, you will need to shell out $799. To upgrade to 128GB Wi-Fi only, you are looking at a bill of $949. There is only one Wi-Fi + LTE option, which comes with 128GB storage, and it will cost $1079.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iPad Pro will be available in November.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also unveiled today was the Apple Pencil stylus, a pressure-sensitive stylus with internal sensors that can detect position, force and tilt, and is charged by the iPad's Lightning port. It is sold separately to the iPad Pro at a cost of $99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iicnVez5U7M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-unveils-huge-ipad-pro-new-pencil-stylus&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-unveils-huge-ipad-pro-new-pencil-stylus#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

The new iPhone 6s is accompanied by the iPhone 6s Plus - available in gold, silver, space gray and the new rose gold metallic finishes - and both packing Retina HD displays and ultra-strong glass. Additionally, both use 7000 series aluminium so we're unlikely to see &quot;bending&quot; claims this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As expected, the iPhone 6s retains a 4.7-inch LED-backlit display (1334 x 750), and the iPhone 6s Plus keeps the 5.5-inch display (1920 x 1080). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apple paid special attention to &lt;i&gt;&quot;3D Touch&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, which is basically the &quot;Force Touch&quot; feature that Watch owners will be familiar with. With it, users can press down on elements on the screen with different levels of force to bring up content. For example, you can press down lightly to peak at a photo, or an e-mail on the relevant app, or you can press down with more force to get into the content itself. Apple calls this &lt;i&gt;&quot;Peek and Pop&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a demonstration of 3D Touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAG8iNNhjYE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both new iPhones also have significant camera and imaging improvements. Both feature a new camera with a 12 megapixel sensor which can be used to record 4K video content with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 and at 30 frames per second. The 4K video can be edited with the latest version of iMovie on the iPhone itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both also have an upgraded 5-megapixel FaceTime HD front camera, which is a significant upgrade on the 1.2-megapixel front cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. With iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple also has introduced Live Photos, which allow you to press on an image to reveal the moments right before a picture was taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tyz90bvcSU0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powering all of this is the new A9 chip, which Apple claims provides 70 percent faster CPU processing and 90 percent faster GPU crunching. It also has an embedded M9 motion co-processor - in previous models the motion co-processor was a separate chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new iPhones also support up to 23 LTE bands and promise improved battery life when using WiFi or LTE Advanced. Both run Apple's new iOS 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for how much these new toys will cost, the iPhone 6s is available with 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage options, priced at $199, $299 and $399, respectively (on contract). The iPhone 6s Plus starts at $299 for the 16GB model. Pre-orders are available from September 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. user may also be interested in the new iPhone Upgrade Program. Customer can buy an unlocked new iPhone and pick their carrier and receive a new iPhone annually along with AppleCare+. The price starts at $32 monthly for the iPhone 6s and $37 monthly for the iPhone 6s Plus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-unveils-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/apple-unveils-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

Lenovo/Motorola has partnered with Chinese company Mobvoiz to provide the search and voice recognition including the ability to dictate messages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the companies will use Sogou for maps, and downloading compatible apps means you will have to go through whatever local app store is available since Google's Google Play Store is not available in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/8/9273927/moto-360-android-wear-china-release&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Verge&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/android-wear-makes-its-way-to-china&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/android-wear-makes-its-way-to-china#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>

While still wildly popular, the company's new Galaxy S6 flagships have not lived up to lofty expectations and Samsung's stock has been hit hard. Overall smartphone shipments fell 3 percentage points in the Q2 2015, and Samsung also said it is no longer the top seller in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of the end of the Q2, Samsung had 100,000 employees at its headquarters, so the layoffs could be significant if true.&lt;!-- PAGE BREAK --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-08/samsung-to-cut-10-of-headquarters-staff-economic-daily-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/samsung-struggling-could-cut-10-percent-of-head-office-employees&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent link to this entry&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2015/09/09/samsung-struggling-could-cut-10-percent-of-head-office-employees#comments&quot; title=&quot;View user comments on this article&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;</description>
