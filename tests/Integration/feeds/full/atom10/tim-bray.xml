<p>Best of 2018 to you.  But this isn’t a real blog post, it’s a placeholder
to debug a subtle Unicode bug in my comment system that doesn’t appear on my
staging environment. <em>*sigh*</em></p>
<p>Aaaaand, that does it.  The bug was introduced when I switched over to Ruby
2.x, approximately five years after I should have. Ruby 2 is known to have
differences in UTF-8 handling.  That turned out to be OK, the bug was in the
fifteen-year-old Perl substrate.  I have to say I’m a different kind of person
than I was when I bashed out that Perl in 2002.  And while I don’t want to
diss Perl, I would never do anything like that again.</p>
<p>Oh well, pardon the interruption.</p>

Or don&#x2019;t.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Here’s my New Year’s Resolution: I’ll try to try to publish a short piece every day recommending a song that I think is
excellent, and apt to please at least some readers.  Let’s see how far into 2018 I get; a quick run through the collection
turned up around 240 candidates, so a whole year’s worth of songs
would be a stretch goal.  Read on for motivation, logistics, and mechanics.  Or just read the song notes, starting tomorrow.
Or don’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why?</h2>
<p>2018  will be this blog’s fifteenth year, and the fragments don’t flow as fast as they used to; I have to reach back
pretty far sometimes to achieve even three or four microessays a month.  Which is weird, because <span class='o'>ongoing</span> centers
on computing, and I’m intensely engaged at the white-hot core of Cloud, which as interesting a technology segment as there is.
Especially if money is your measure.</p>
<p>But… there’s this term “insider” and I’m one of those, <i>de jure</i> and for real, and I could write any number of
authoritative and amusing pieces on Hybrid Cloud or Serverless Economics or competing with Azure vs Google or, well, you get the
idea, but I couldn’t convincingly claim they were uninfluenced by my work at AWS or didn’t reflect views held by at least some
senior people.  And that wouldn’t do at all.  Might even be illegal.</p>
<p>I still find space to technologize here now and again when I think it can’t go wrong, but there’s writing energy
curdling in the back of my brain.  And I used to have fun here with the
<a href="/ongoing/What/Arts/Music/5%20Stars/">5★♫ series</a>, and music’s been a primary recreation for way more than 38 years.
So welcome to “SotD”, a tiny song-discovery service.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>“Song” doesn’t strictly imply a singer. I should strictly say “track of the day” but “song” is a better word.</p></li>
<li><p>It <em>does</em> imply some virtues of brevity and coherency; I won’t be recommending abrasive free-jazz jams or 70-minute
minimalist drones or gamelan explosions.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of it is going to be kind of old, because I am, but let’s see if we can have regular visits to this century. And I’m
determined to find something in 2018 to feature in 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll work on diversity, but Canadians, males, and electric guitars are going to be over-represented.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll restrict myself to things you can actually get, which sadly means I’ll have to skip that dub compilation on a
skeevy-looking CD I got in a skeevier-looking part of Sydney in 1991.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re probably gonna hate some of the SotDs.</p></li>
<li><p>I reserve the right to re-use some previous 5★♫ tunes.</p></li>
<li><p>Other things being equal, I’ll lean to great songs from the lesser-known, and lesser-known songs from the great.  Which
means, expect a few one-hit wonders. But big hits get to be big hits for
a reason, and anything that was a big hit before say 1990 comes from another planet anyhow.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-3'>Logistics</h2>
<p>This is the World Wide <em>Web</em>, y’know?  So I would very much like to link to every song. There are a lot of ways to access
music these days and in principle they <em>should</em> have links.  At a minimum, I think I ought to be providing iTunes, Google
Play, Spotify, and Amazon links, and would gratefully consider suggestions for other channels.</p>
<p>Of those, Google Play is the only one I use (<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2015/08/02/Google-Music">here’s why</a>) but so far I
haven’t figured out how to extract song URLs from its JavaScript maelstrom.</p>
<p>I believe firmly that Live Music Is Better, so wherever possible I’m going to link to live video.
Things being what they are, this means a lot of YouTubes; oh well.</p>

<p>Back in the late Eighties, for a few months I went to aerobics
class, and once every session the instructor put this U2 chestnut on and every time my beats-per-minute cranked right up.
Not in the slightest obscure, but worth revisiting at least once a year, ideally on this day.</p>
<p>U2 are pretty well dinosaurs now, but then I am too. And when they stomped the earth in the late Eighties, it shook. They brought
a whole lot of musical intensity to the stage, and the best live bass sound I’ve ever heard.  And passion: I recall
a hot summer night back, then an outdoor show; Bono’s arm was in bandages and a sling because he’d fallen off the stage a few nights
earlier.  But then they were swinging into <cite>People Get Ready</cite> and he said “Gotta have two guitars for this one” and
ripped the bandages off to play rhythm.  That’s rock&amp;roll.</p>
<p>Anyhow, <cite>New Year’s Day</cite> is a fine song; note what’s maybe Edge’s best ever guitar break, and the clever way he
switches between guitar and piano.  Also the, foundational
guitar isn’t guitar at all, it’s bass, one of Adam Clayton’s nicest outings.</p>

They both present text in nar&#xad;row columns and share a love&#xad;ly, sim&#xad;ple nav&#xad;i&#xad;ga&#xad;tion metaphor which un&#xad;for&#xad;tu&#xad;nate&#xad;ly has re&#xad;cent&#xad;ly bro&#xad;ken (on An&#xad;droid at least&#xad;).</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>A large proportion of the information I consume on my mobile comes from two apps: <cite>The Economist</cite>
(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-economist-us-world-news/id444518531?mt=8">iOS</a>,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.economist">Android</a>), and a whole lot of feeds via
Feedly
(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly-get-smarter/id396069556?mt=8">iOS</a>,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly">Android</a>).
They both present text in narrow columns and share a lovely, simple navigation metaphor which unfortunately has recently broken (on
Android at least).</p>
<p>In both cases, each story is presented in a single column that fills the screen from left to right and extends arbitrarily far
down, as long as need be for the piece’s body. The stories are side by side.  There are only two ways to navigate: Up or down
the columns, and right or left
between stories. Here’s a picture.</p>
<img src="Column-Nav.png" alt="Columnar navigation" />
<p>I’m sure other newspaper and information-dense apps must have adopted this metaphor because it’s just so intuitive.  It works
great on mobile because no matter how fat-fingered you are, the app only has to distinguish between vaguely-North/South and
vaguely-East/West and the right thing almost always happens.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a subtlety: If you swipe left to go to the next story, you want to bounce up to its top. But
if you swipe back, you almost certainly <em>don’t</em> want to bounce to the top of the previous story, because you
already read that, and you probably are going back because you accidentally swiped while reaching for a drink, or realized a
microsecond after you swiped that that paragraph was more interesting than it’d seemed when you launched your finger.</p>
<p>And if you’ve read a ways down story B and swipe back to A, then forward again to B, once again you don’t want to pop to the
top of B.  Which is to say, it should remember your scroll position, at least for the immediate predecessor and successor of whatever
it is you’re reading.</p>
<p>And, both apps used to. But sometime in 2017 they stopped, snapping remorselessly to the top of whatever column you swipe to, forward
or back.  It’s annoying as hell; maybe because I often change my mind about leaving an article and decide to go back.
And the fact that it happened in both the Economist and Feedly makes me wonder if something in the
Android app framework broke.</p>
<p>So I’m not sure who I’m mad at; the developers of two of my favorite apps separately, or just someone in the Android group.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and you think it’s you I might be mad at, well hey, no biggie, but please fix?</p>

Here&#x2019;s how.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>In 2013, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/04/09/I-bought-some-BitCoins">bought a few Bitcoins</a> from a dude in a coffee shop, paying with
hundred-dollar bills.  Later that year I
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/11/15/I-Sold-Some-Bitcoins">sold enough to get my money back</a>.  Then I forgot about them,
Bitcoin’s price gyrations occasionally registering in a corner of my mind.  But earlier this month I decided to find out if the
remainder could be turned into real actual money, and it turned out they could.  Here’s how.</p>
<p>Important note: This narrative applies
specifically to exchanging BTC for <em>Canadian</em> dollars, <em>in Canada</em>.  Some lessons may apply in other jurisdictions.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How I did it</h2>
<p>There are a lot of people out there on the Net who are eager to sell you Bitcoins, but when you want to sell them back
for hard cold cash, the offerings seem to thin out.  If you’re in the States and go poking around,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase">Coinbase</a> often seems to come up top of the list.
And in fact, when I publicized the fact that I was looking to sell, a few people pointed me at Coinbase.</p>
<p>Having said that, a lot of the names that would have turned up if you’d done the same research three years ago have left the stage,
some in colorful circumstances, often leaving stakeholders’ digital wallets empty.  So you want to be careful.</p>
<p>When I originally bought my digital cash, the Bitcoin-community dude who took my hundred-dollar bills recommended
<a href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a> as an online wallet provider, and I second the recommendation. They never
surprised nor disappointed me, and I was pretty impressed with the quality of their clients and the seriousness of their security
posture.  In the unlikely event that I decide to go back into cryptocurrency, I’d use them again. </p>
<p>I quickly discovered that the most visible US buy/sell services don’t really extend across the 49th parallel.  I was casting
about, looking at Canadian operators, and getting kind of depressed because the whole territory is more than a bit on the sketchy
side, and objective evidence that This Will Work For You is hard to come by.  Then, one day at work, I overheard a conversation
involving Jonathan, a colleague who’s buying a house, and he said “Yeah, I cashed in my Bitcoins to help with the down payment.”
Which got my attention right away; I asked him how and who exactly, and he said he’d used
<a href="https://coinsquare.io/">Coinsquare</a>.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: It worked. And here’s what I think is an important lesson:  Whatever your cryptocurrency circumstances may be, if they
involve real money,
the best thing you can do is find someone you know personally who has done whatever you’re trying to do, and follow a well-blazed
trail.  And, I’d add, follow it <em>quickly</em>; because while it might work today, in the world of Bitcoin, who can say whether
it’ll work tomorrow?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Details</h2>
<p>When I want to try something new, I appreciate a step-by-step guide, so here you go:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I set up a Coinsquare account. Other operators I’d investigated had elaborate and painful setup requirements,
including FAXes and notaries and so on.  Coinsquare offered “instant approval” and when I gave them a bunch of salient facts about
myself, they came back after a couple seconds’ latency and said “OK, you’re approved.”</p></li>
<li><p>I initially funded the Coinsquare account with a $100 bank transfer.  I just wanted to verify to my satisfaction that my bank
and Coinsquare could talk to each other.  A repeating pattern first became obvious here: My $100 showed up in
Coinsquare as $95.  On this and every subsequent transaction, the intermediaries leaned in and took a cut.</p></li>
<li><p>I transferred 0.1BTC from Blockchain.info over to Coinsquare; the BTC-ecosystem charge for this was tiny and felt appropriate,
and they showed up in my account at Coinsquare way faster than I expected.</p></li>
<li><p>I converted almost all the BTC to Canadian Dollars (CAD).  I was a little troubled when Coinsquare rejected my 0.09BTC transaction as
“too large”, but it accepted an 0.05BTC sale immediately followed by another of 0.04BTC.</p></li>
<li><p>I requested a transfer of most of the output (roughly C$2,000) to my bank account, to establish that channel worked.  Anyone who has
transferred money between financial institutions knows the drill: The funds vanish from your account within microseconds of you
pressing “Confirm”, then the sending institution sits on them for as long as they’re legally allowed to, then they do the actual
transfer which takes another microsecond or two, then the receiving institution sits on them for as long as <em>they’re</em>
legally allowed to, and then, some days later, the money lands in your account, often smaller than when you sent it, because
“Service Charges”.  In this case, my C$2K turned into C$1980. Damn,
have I mentioned how much I love the finance industry?</p></li>
<li><p>I poked around on Coinsquare and discovered their “wealth management” service, apparently aimed at high rollers, which had an
attached email address, so I sent them a note saying “I want to sell quite a bit more than 0.1BTC for CAD, can you actually do this?”
Almost immediately, the “concierge service” got back to me, saying “Transfer in the Bitcoin and we’ll give you a quote that’s good
for ten minutes.” So I did, and they did (at several percentage points off the then-advertised price of Bitcoin), and I took it, and
almost instantly, Coinsquare informed me that my account there contained a pleasing number of Canadian dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>I fired off another wire-transfer request, and after the usual multi-day delay, and with the usual slight diminution in
value, I had substantially left behind the role of “cryptocurrency investor”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Elapsed time: About ten days.</p>
<p>Obviously, I was somewhat annoyed by the succession of grasping digital hands that reached into my digital wallet to extract their
digital percentage every time I asked them to update a couple of fields in a database somewhere.  But on the other hand, since I was
selling the BTC for roughly sixty-four times my acquisition price, and I <em>really</em> wanted to get out of the market, I decided
to go with the flow, as in the flow of dollars out of my crypto-pocket.</p>
<p>But I have to say, buying and selling cryptocurrencies is a good business to be in; I haven’t added up the numbers, but
Coinsquare and my bank both got paid pretty well for doing some routine database updates.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why I did it</h2>
<p>I love Bitcoin.  It is one of the most intellectually elegant constructs I have encountered in my decades in the computing
profession.  The system has multiple moving parts that work together, doing multiple different difficult things, to accomplish an
effect that looks like it ought to be very useful. Whoever Satoshi is or was, I hope he she or they are still alive, sitting on a
beach somewhere and enjoying their craftily-gotten gains.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin has descended into bad craziness. You can’t actually use it as money, because money needs to have a
somewhat stable and predictable value. Also, its current global blockchain can only do a few transactions per second, so it obviously can’t
underlie more than a tiny sliver of any commercial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Those who currently buy it are making the classic “Greater Fool” bet, i.e. that it’ll keep
going up because it’s been going up, and some greater fool will come along and take it off their hands. This kind of bet can
run much longer than anyone thinks is reasonable, but then someday the music stops and most players won’t find a chair to sit
on.</p>
<p>Also, the concentration of Bitcoin ownership is worrying: Check out
<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-19/cryptocurrency-concentration-just-4-own-over-95-bitcoin">this story</a>, and
accompanying graph, over at ZeroHedge.  You can bet that if (I mean when) Bitcoin deflates, the loss is going to be mostly soaked up by
the people who’ve bought in recently, the 95%-plus of holders who collectively own less than 5% of BTC. What the graph doesn’t illustrate
is the proportion of real non-crypto money that the 95% have injected into the market, and stands to be lost.  I bet the answer is
“most of it”.</p>
<p>To go all nerdy, I think that cryptocurrencies have a bright future, when transactions are based on something more scalable than
proof-of-work, and when they are driven by a killer app that does something useful out of the box.  One example might be
<a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m going to have to pay tax on this.  Fortunately, since it’s a capital gain, the Canadian tax treatment should be favorable.  But
there may be bureaucratic difficulties, I have no idea how comfy the Canadian taxman is with this sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you’re in Bitcoin, now’s a good time to take money off the table.  Yeah, who knows, it might go up a whole lot more, but then
again it might not, and it would be totally unsurprising if there were a catastrophic deflation next Tuesday.  And I’ve rarely met
anyone who really regretted selling financial assets at a substantial profit.</p>
<p>Here’s the second important lesson: You can probably sell your
Bitcoins, but you probably can’t sell them fast. So now might be a good time to start.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>The IETF just published
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8259">RFC 8259</a> (also known as
“STD 90”). Editor, yr humble servant.
The legacy-ASCII full text is
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt">here</a> and there’s a nice-looking HTML verion
<a href="rfc8259.html">here</a>.
I think this is the last specification of JSON that anyone
will ever publish.</p>
<p>The story of how we got to RFC 7159, this RFC’s predecessor, is told in
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2014/03/05/RFC7159-JSON">JSON Redux AKA RFC7159</a> and I won’t re-tell it.  The reason 8259 exists is
that the ECMAScript gang went and wrote their own extremely minimal spec,
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm">Standard ECMA-404:
The JSON Data Interchange Syntax</a>, and there was reason for concern over dueling standards.  But, after a certain amount of
standards-org elephant-gavotte, each of ECMA 404 and RFC 8259 normatively references the other and contains a commitment to keep
them consistent in case any errors turn up.  Which is a good thing, but this text has been re-examined and re-polished so many
times that I doubt either side will ever revisit the territory, thank goodness.</p>
<p>8259 contains one new sentence: “JSON text exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed
ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].”  Given that, by 2017, an attempt to exchange JSON encoded in anything but UTF-8
would be irrational, this hardly needs saying; but its absence felt like an omission.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Which spec should you use?</h2>
<p>If you want to understand JSON syntax, you still can’t beat Doug Crockford’s original formulation at
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON.org</a>.  If you want to use an RFC as foundation for a REST API or some other Internet protocol, I
actually don’t recommend 8259, I recommend I-JSON,
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7493">RFC 7493</a>, which describes exactly the same syntax as all the other specs (by
referencing 7159), but
explicitly rules out some legal-but-dumbass things you could do that might break your protocol, for example using anything but UTF-8
or having duplicate member names in your objects.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What next?</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if the IETF JSON Working Group shut down forever.  On the other hand, we
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2016/04/30/JSON-Schema-funnies">still lack</a> a decent high-quality
JSON Schema language.  Also, JSONPath, which is damn useful, doesn’t have a proper definition anywhere.  So there’s work to be done
if anyone wants to do it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Thanks and apologies</h2>
<p>To the working group, its chairs and Area Directors and members.  Also, at one point in the process I got all grumpy and sulky
and they didn’t let that get in the way, just went ahead and got the job done.  The Internet owes them thanks.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I spent four nights in Las Vegas while at re:Invent. The city’s daytime aspect  is kind of flat and
low-contrast because who cares what it looks like then?  Photographers there come out like vampires after dark.
I took along the
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2016/11/18/Achromat-Photowalk.ong">ludicrous “Achromat” lens</a> for the sparklies, so got ’em if ya
want ’em.  Also hotel, music, and venue recommendations you won’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the sparklies.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10425.png" alt="Vegas streetlights, sparklified" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10454.png" alt="South Las Vegas Boulevard, sparklified" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10455.png" alt="Vegas, The Flamingo, sparklified" />
<p>That lens sure is fun. Not to mention the effect when you tell your table-mates you brought along your Las Vegas Lens and pull
a whole lot of tubular gleaming brass out of your bag.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Bellagio &amp; its fountain</h2>
<p>Veterans of the strip may wonder how this picture came to be. Reflections in a window were involved.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10466.png" alt="Bellagio and its neighbors" />
<p>The first time I’ve stayed there, and I think I’ll go back.  The rooms are nowhere near as glam as in recent-Strip joints like
the Wynn or Aria, but things pretty well just work, the casino is less sprawly, and it’s kind of in the middle of things, and then
there’s that view if you pay up for a Fountains room.</p>
<img src="Fountain.png" alt="Bellagio fountain" />
<p>That picture is an outtake from a
<a href="VID_20171130_234846.mp4">two-minute video</a> shot from my 20<sup>th</sup>-floor room, with faint tinny sound. Taken with the Pixel 2 and really
not bad; note how the vibration control squashes the effect of my chronically shaky hands.  Warning: It’s 124 MB!  The full-size 4K
version, which looks glorious on my 15" retina screen, is 710 MB; yow.</p>
<p>That picture doesn’t really capture the scale of the thing; here we are down on the street watching the watchers.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10490.png" alt="People watching the Bellagio fountain" />
<p>Sitting at the desk in my room working on my speech, I was amused by the fountain-maintenance process.  They could do better, because
every time I’ve watched the fountain, there’ve been annoying imperfections: jets that don’t jet, lights that stay dark.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10434.png" alt="Fixing the Bellagio fountain" />
<p>I’d like to see someone get ambitious with the fountain music, maybe something by Phil Glass or <i>*gasp*</i> a rock &amp; roll
piece.  That wouldn’t be very Vegas I guess.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Doubling Down with the Bastards</h2>
<p>That would be Thee Swank Bastards, a surf-guitar band, playing at the Double Down Saloon, located not that close to the Strip.
They offered a couple hours of pure pleasure.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10526.png" alt="Thee Swank Bastards at the Double Down Saloon" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/01/FXT10538.png" alt="Thee Swank Bastards at the Double Down Saloon" />
<p>The woman playing bass in the first picture spent most of the night in showgirl mode; her costume, especially the gloves, was
fabulous, and she threw in some tasteful striptease.  She and the band were having nearly-infinite fun and the standard
of surf-guitar playing was impeccable.  You can loathe America’s politics and many of its cultural tropes, but no other nation comes
close at the pure joyful ecstatic madness of low-rent rock&amp;roll; a tip of my hat across the border.</p>
<p>The Bastards leavened their set with appalling, filthy, dumb jokes whenever they stopped playing. The only one I remember is “What’s
the difference between Jesus and a picture of Jesus?”  “You only need one nail for the picture.”</p>
<p>As for the Double Down, it’s uh, sincere.  A whole lot of tattoos and beards and ripped tights.  The big sign on the wall says
“Shut Up And Drink”, the one on the bar with embedded poker machines says “Shut Up And Gamble”.  We thought about ordering the bacon
martini, but nobody did.  The Bastards play the Double Down the last
Wednesday of every month, and if you’re in Vegas I recommend dropping by.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>People, watching</h2>
<p>(The people are more interesting after dark, too.)</p>

<p>I actually still don’t like Vegas very much.  My camera does though, but it only comes out at night.</p>

<p><cite>The Atlantic</cite> published
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/?single_page=true">The Coming Software Apocalypse</a>
by
<a href="http://jsomers.net/">James Somers</a>, which is full of dire warnings and strong claims.  Here’s one: <i>Since
the 1980s, the way programmers work and the tools they use have changed remarkably little.</i>
My first programming job was in 1979, I still construct software, and I can testify that
that assertion is deeply wrong, as is much else in the piece.</p>
<p>I would very much like to place an alternative view of my profession before
the people who have consumed Mr Somers’, but I wouldn’t know how, so I’ll
just post it here; maybe an <cite>Atlantic</cite> reader or two will stumble across it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Oops</h2>
<p>When I read this piece I
<a href="https://twitter.com/timbray/status/914296228891865088">tweeted</a>
“Reading non-coders’ words about coding is… weird.” That was wrong because there’s
<a href="https://github.com/jsomers">plentiful evidence</a> that he’s a well-accomplished developer.  So, apologies. But he’s still
wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Wrong, you say?</h2>
<p>First of all, the people Somers describes, who write the matter-of-life-and-death logic at the center of the systems that dispatch
911 calls and drive cars
and fly planes, are a tiny minority<span class='dashes'> —</span> it’s like a dog-care piece focused on
wilderness search-and-rescue dogs.  There’s nothing wrong with that kind of dog, nor with the people who program safety-critical
systems, but I’ve never met one, and I’ve been doing this for almost four decades.</p>
<p>There’s another problem with Somers’ piece: its claim that writing code is passé, that we’ll be moving away from that into a
world of models and diagrams and better specifications and direct visual feedback.  This is not exactly a novel idea; the first time
I encountered it was in a computing magazine sometime around 1980.</p>
<p>Yes, the notion that you build complex interactions between computing devices and the real world by editing lines of code feels
unnatural and twisted, and in fact is slow and expensive in practice.  We’ve been looking for a better way since I got into this
game;  but mostly, we still edit lines of code.</p>
<p>And as for the sensible-sounding proposal that we just write down our requirements, not in code, but in something much higher level,
in such a way that a computer can understand them as written and execute them? That’s another old and mostly-failed idea.</p>
<p>So, Somers is wrong twice.  First, in asserting that software is moving away from being built on lines of
code (it isn’t), and second, that the craft of constructing software isn’t changing and getting better (it is).</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>So, what do you actually do, then?</h2>
<p>Glad you asked. All sorts of things! We developers are now some millions strong worldwide<span class='dashes'> —</span> almost
certainly more than ten million and I suspect less than fifty; but it’s hard to measure.</p>
<p>As in most professions, most of the work is strikingly pedestrian; discovering what our co-workers need their computers to do,
and also what their managers want, and trying to arrange to keep these tribes happy and at peace with their computers and each
other.</p>
<p>To a huge extent, that involves acquiring, deploying, and configuring software that was created by others.  Thus, a lot of time
in meetings, and then even more figuring out how to make the travel or scheduling or amortization app do what people need
done.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of us write software for rockets, for music synthesizers, for Pixar movies; all these
things have an obvious cool factor.  And others (surprisingly, among the most-admired) write “low-level” software,  useful only to
programmers, which underlies all the software that is useful to actual humans.  There are many kinds of
this stuff: for example “Operating Systems”, “Database kernels”, “Filesystems”, “Web frameworks”,  and “Message brokers”.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Software is getting better</h2>
<p>Let me be more specific: Compared to back when I was getting started, we build it faster and when we’re done, it’s more
reliable.</p>
<p>The reasons are unsubtle: We build it faster because we have better tools, and it’s more reliable because
we’re more careful, and because we test it better.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>Reviewing</h2>
<p>The big software builders (for example Amazon Web Services, where I work) have learned to follow
simple practices with big payoffs.  First, those lines of code: They never get put to work until they’ve been reviewed by a
colleague; in the vast majority of cases, the colleague finds problems and requests changes, arguments break out, and the new code
goes through several revisions before being given the green light.  For major pieces of infrastructure code, required approval from
two more reviewers, and ten or more revision cycles, aren’t terribly uncommon.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Unit Testing!</h2>
<p>Software is constructed
of huge numbers of (mostly) very small components; we use names like “functions”, “routines”, and “methods”.  They are
the units that Unit Testing tests.  The unit tests are other pieces of software that feed in many different pieces of data in and check
that what comes out is as expected. There are commonly more lines of code in the unit tests than the software under test.</p>
<p>We have
loads and loads of tools specifically set up to support Unit Testing; among other
things, when you look at those lines of code, there’ll be a vertical bar in the margin that’s green beside lines of code that have
been exercised by the unit tests, red beside the others.</p>
<p>These days, we don’t always demand 100% coverage (some code is just too routine and mundane) but we expect anything
nontrivial to be covered well by the tests.  I think the rise of unit testing, starting sometime not too long after 2000, has
yielded the single
biggest boost to software quality in my lifetime.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of testing (“Integration”, “Smoke”, “Fuzz”) and we use them all, along with tools that read your code
and find potential problems, just like Microsoft highlights your spelling mistakes.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Night and day</h2>
<p>It doesn’t sound like much.  But seriously, it’s like night and day. Does it sound a little tedious?  In truth, it is.  But
also, our tools have been getting better year over year; programming in 2017 is really a lot more
pleasant than it was 2007, 1997, or 1987.</p>
<p>It’s like this: You sit down to improve a piece of software, make a couple of changes,
and suddenly a lot of unit tests are failing, leaving ugly red trails on your screen.  (In fact, if you made changes and
<em>didn’t</em> break unit tests, you worry that something’s wrong.)  But then you dig into them one by one, and after not too long,
it’s all back to green; which is really a good feeling.</p>
<p>I’m not going to argue that the advanced methods Somers enumerates (being model-driven, state machines, things like TLA+) are
useless, or that they’re not being used; I personally have made regular use of state-machine technology.  But by and large they’re
side-shows.  We build software better than we ever have, and it’s just a matter of reviewing and testing, and testing and testing,
and then testing some more.</p>
<p>We’re not perfect.  But we’re really a lot more grown-up than we used to be.  And, relax: There’s no apocalypse on the horizon.</p>

<p>The concept is simple: After dark there are soft lights everywhere, many of them in little shrines you can visit and write a
message
or light a candle.</p>

<p style="display:inline-block;">There is music of some sort; this year, the performers were scattered round the graveyard,
synchronized somehow electronically, and the music was dreamy, full of sweet
slow shifting shapes</p>

Here are two  shot com&#xad;par&#xad;isons be&#xad;tween the Google and Light&#xad;room An&#xad;droid cam&#xad;era apps to see  what that means in prac&#xad;tice.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I got a Pixel 2, largely because it’s said to have a really great
camera, with software-driven magic<span class='dashes'> —</span> machine learning at work. Here are two
shot comparisons between the Google and Lightroom Android camera apps to see
what that means in practice.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why Lightroom?</h2>
<p>Given a choice,
I prefer the Lightroom app to Android’s.
It has better, more intuitive ergonomics,
including a level; makes the phone feel more like a camera.
Also, you can edit in the Android version of Lightroom,
which has basically the same controls as the desktop version I live in.
Also, it shoots and edits DNG “RAW” files.  Finally, anything you don’t erase
is synced through the Adobe cloud and is auto-magically there in my Mac
Lightroom’s “All synced photos” collection. (Yes, even in the Lightroom CC
Classic version.)  Not only that, but when I edit it
on the Mac, the edits are synced back to the phone, so I can show people the
improved versions while we’re having lunch.  A pretty sweet package, all
things considered.</p>
<p>There is a fly in the ointment. The Lightroom app’s pix’s names may end
with “.dng” but if you’re used to the massive depth of the files like the ones
I get from my Fujifilm XT-1, where you can pull lost beauty out of darkness or
dazzle, you’ll be disappointed.  Sure, you can pull the “Highlights”
slider down or the “Shadows” slider up, and it sort of works, but not like with
real camera files.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>When it doesn’t matter</h2>
<p>These days all cameras are great, given enough light and an appropriate
subject.  I’ve pretty well totally stopped using the 10-24mm wide-angle with the
big camera because my phone is basically Good Enough.</p>
<p>So if we’re going to compare these apps meaningfully, we need to work with
hard-to-take pictures that stress out the sensor; the most obvious examples
are low light and high contrast.</p>
<p>Well, in November in the Pacific Northwest there really isn’t that much
high contrast, but we got plenty of low light.  I tried for a different kind
of high contrast anyhow like so.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/18/LRM_20171117_172757-2.png" alt="Vancouver night street scene" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/18/IMG_20171117_172807.png" alt="Vancouver night street scene" />
<p>I’m going to call this one pretty well a wash. The Android-camera
version achieved slightly sharper focus, but that’s not really the point in an
impressionistic piece like this.  What’s significant is that I had to put in a
couple minutes photo-editing on the Lightroom DNG to get it to look as good;
the sky had a bit of grey luminance noise and the whole scene leaned
yellow.  Having said that, I <em>like</em> photo-editing.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn’t say, did I?  It’s Lightroom above, Android below.</p>
<p>So what the Android camera is doing here is taking whatever comes off the
sensor, putting it through a little photo-editing session right there on the
camera, giving me a JPEG, and saying, in effect, “don’t bother your pretty
little head about how I got this.”</p>
<p>Finally, I’m usually really happy with Lightroom’s photo-export software,
but in this case both pix lost some life, in particular in the trolley-wire
sparkles and taillight reds.  I’m going to have to try some new tricks.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: These are not terribly difficult or challenging for the
sensor: The objects in the picture are pretty well self-illuminating.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>When it matters</h2>
<p>Here’s a hard one, our new calico cat, asleep on the sofa after a hard
night of watching <em>Star Trek Discovery</em> with Mom &amp; Dad.  This is a
softly-lit book-lined room with black furniture and a dark floor.  And, in
this case, Android pretty well wiped the floor with Lightroom.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/18/LRM_20171117_222446.png" alt="Cat, by Lightroom" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/18/IMG_20171117_222438.png" alt="Cat, by Android Camera" />
<p>Once again, Lightroom above/Android below.  That Lightroom version has been
<em>heavily</em> edited, and it’s still not close.  The Android version has
truer colors, better focus, and less noise.  I’m seriously impressed with
whatever is going on inside that app.</p>
<p>You know, when you look at the two of these side by side in Lightroom on my
15" Retina Mac screen, it’s like night and day.  But as I look at the 720-wide
presentation here in the blog draft, I wonder if the differences really matter.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>More on the Android app</h2>
<p>It’s nice, but trying too hard.  No, I don’t want a little slab of video
prepended to my photos so they shimmer into place (and can’t be edited).  No,
I don’t want color-balance modes, since the ML seems to get that right.</p>
<p>Also, since everything is apparently auto-magically cloudified, there ought
to be an easy/automatic way to get the full-rez versions of the pix out of the
cloud and into Lightroom, but I haven’t found it yet.  For the moment, I share
from the phone to Dropbox, and Lightroom is happy pulling from there.</p>
<p>Also it’s dumb that I have to switch apps to edit the photo I just took,
and then the editing controls are all presets and oversimplification.  Having
said that, the app has a Chromecast button, which is super nice.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>What next?</h2>
<p>For shots that don’t challenge the camera, I’ll go on using Lightroom; it’s
a better shooting experience and better integrated with my workflow.  When it
gets tricky, I’ll bring that Android ML to bear.</p>

thing, whose ugliness I’ve long found magnificent and which today I took the
time to tour and photograph.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Turns out this huge steel thing is afloat, actually;
here’s how it’s fastened to the land.  Those are <em>big</em> chains and huge
truck tires.</p></div>
<p>What happened was, I was out winterizing the boat. Vancouver missed autumn
this year, snapped over from 18°C Indian-summer to basically zero more or less
overnight.  Today a few snowflakes drifted down and I was wearing a nontraditional
Canadian boating toque.  You can see snowflakes in all but one of
today’s photos, if you look closely.</p>
<p>I’d neglected my camera and was thus shooting with the Pixel, really
not much of a handicap for daylight photos when they’re close-ups and big landscapes.
Here are one of each.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Wow, this thing is, well, “going back to nature”
doesn’t feel like the right phrase.  But there’s definitely an entropy
gradient.</p></div>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/04/IMG_20171104_122108.png" alt="Boat approaching Horseshoe Bay" />
<p>I’ve been using the Lightroom camera app, which is a little on the
slow side but has nice controls and pulls the raw bits off the sensor, and
I like the app’s editing primitives.  But in recent weeks it’s
become unusably crashy<span class='dashes'> —</span> I’ve already
cleared its data once to no effect<span class='dashes'> —</span> so my
fallback is the well-regarded native Android Camera app.  It’s quick and the
pix look good, I have to say.  And while Lightroom claims to be shooting RAW
and indeed emits DNG’s, they don’t contain anything like the amount of hidden
potential a good RAW file from a real camera exhibits.  So the native Android
JPEGs are not making me unhappy.</p>
<p>I have to shuffle them through DropBox to get them on the Mac so I can
prettify them with Lightroom; I miss Adobe’s nice smooth mobile/PC sync.
Anyhow, I thought Lightroom did a nice job on this monochrome.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/04/IMG_20171104_121916.png" alt="Vintage Nautical" />
<p>This float is quite a structure.  It’s not solid, it’s sort of a frame so
you can look down at the ocean in the middle.  Well, you could, except for
that piece of water is stacked up with old styrofoam, the kind that’s used to
make floating docks float.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/11/04/IMG_20171104_122212.png" alt="Vintage Nautical" />
<div class='caption'><p>This picture isn’t beautiful or anything, but<br/>
there’s a <em>lot</em> happening, top to bottom, left to right.</p></div>
<p>As for the boat, I installed its low-level winter heating apparatus, ran
the engine for a bit, set up support poles to protect the canvas cover from
heavy snow,
and adjusted the lines against winter storms; then went
for a burger and beer at the waterfront alehouse.</p>
<p>That’s a satisfying early-winter half-day.</p>

So why don&#x2019;t I tell ev&#xad;ery&#xad;one?</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Sometimes when we’re trying to hire a senior employee, I get asked to do a
“sell call”, tell them what it’s like to work here.  Since I’m coming up on
three years and haven’t quit, I guess the supposition is that I’ll be
positive. Since these candidates are outsiders and some of them don’t
come to work for us, nothing I can say can be a secret. So why don’t I
tell everyone?</p>
<p>Before I dive in any further, everything here relates to AWS, not
Amazon as a whole. It might be true of the retail side too, but I don’t
know because I don’t work there.</p>
<p>So, what <em>is</em> it like to work here?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Customers</h2>
<p>That’s the big deal.  AWS has over a million and you get to meet them all
the time, and while there are lots of geek introverts who might not like that,
I do. Anyhow, lots of the customers are geek introverts too.</p>
<p>When you ship low-level horizontal general-purpose technology, there’s no
way to predict what people are going to do with it.  Which in practice means
that you’re going to be shocked by the way it gets used.  For an old guy like
me it’s hilarious to hear the kid engineers looking at a bug report or feature
request and saying “WTF, why would anybody want to do <em>that</em>?”</p>
<p>Me, I like computers, and I like hearing about interesting things people do
with them, and it makes me happy when the things they do work out well,
especially when I helped build what they’re using.  I
could tell you stories that’d curl your hair (or straighten your wavy locks) but
they’re not mine to tell.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if you like talking to customers you’ll like working here, and if
not, probably not.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Uptime</h2>
<p>It matters more than anything. Some of our services are cooler than others,
but what I think customers care about most is confidence that
the services, cool or boring, will be there 24/7/365.  What that means is that
everything has to be automated, and much of the most brilliant engineering at
AWS, done by some of the smartest people, does its work behind the scenes
where nobody will ever see it.</p>
<p>So if you’re the kind of person who, for example, thinks figuring out a better way to
automate detecting hot-spots in back-end clusters and re-routing traffic to
cool things down is interesting work, then you’ll like working here.  If not,
maybe not.</p>
<p>Only <em>maybe</em> not,  because we have lots of people who wrangle JavaScript
frameworks and mobile SDKs and build tools and database kernels all day.  But
operational automation, that’s the heart of the matter.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Being document-driven</h2>
<p>Go ahead and Google “Amazon six-pager” if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who’s OK with spending a lot of time
constructing carefully-written narratives, and being in meetings that start
with 20+ quiet minutes while everyone reads the narrative,
you’ll like working here, and if
not, definitely not.  Disclosure: I’ve written over a million words on this
blog so I’m seriously  predisposed to like this part.</p>
<p>There is one downside: Suppose you’re an author of the document being read.
It can be simultaneously
crushingly boring and twitchingly nervous while AWS’s senior leadership plows
their way through your words in stony silence.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The actual software</h2>
<p>I don’t think anyone would be surprised.  The services are usually conventional
RESTful services, usually composed of multiple microservices, usually
in mainstream programming languages using mainstream programming
frameworks, We use conventional compilers and debuggers and IDEs and
frameworks for HTTP and unit testing and integration testing and dependency
injection and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s some secret sauce voodoo down in the infrastructure that’s
pretty magical.  But most of us don’t work on that most of the time.</p>
<p>What’s unusual is the proportion of the code focused on availability
and data durability.  But you already knew that.  We also care a lot about
doing better than O(N), because N is typically so freaking huge at Amazon. I personally
seem to end up working mostly on message processing of one kind or another
which is sort of stuck on O(N) in the number of messages, so we’re often left
with micro-optimizations.</p>
<p>You know what makes me happy? One little library I
wrote is currently being used by several different teams to efficiently do a useful thing
on a million-ish messages per second in aggregate.  There aren’t that many
places where your code gets that kind of opportunity.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Organization and culture</h2>
<p>The teams at AWS have a huge amount of independence.  If you’re on a team that’s
trying to ship something or operate something or improve something, that’s
generally great; nobody will get in your way.  On the other hand, if you’re
trying to build something that works across multiple service teams, it can
give you grey hairs. But I already had those; and it’s mostly a feature not a
bug.</p>
<p>Corporate “culture” is a thing I find it hard to be articulate about. I
find the asshole density nonzero but lower than average.  We are trying to do very
difficult things and we fail a lot; Mature technology companies try make
those teachable moments, and we do a pretty good job of that.  There is
<i>[*gasp*]</i> politics.  I’m going to argue that the proportion of really bad
managers is unusually low; but that’s just an anecdote, wouldn’t know how to
measure it.</p>
<p>My time rarely feels wasted.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Money?</h2>
<p>If you work in a tech job at any large high-tech company, you’ll
be well-paid by any reasonable standard.  Want more than just “well-paid”? The brutal truth is that the way
high-tech compensation is structured, you’re making a bet on your employer’s
share price.  If it goes up really a lot while you’re working there, you’re
gonna make out like a bandit, and if not, not.  All these things are as true
at Amazon as anywhere else. Welcome to twenty-first
century capitalism.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What sucks?</h2>
<p>After I’ve talked through all this stuff, the person who might come to work
for us wants to hear about the downside.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>I guess the biggest one is that we’re not perfect at operational
automation, so everything we fail to automate, every combination of compute and
network and storage failure we weren’t smart enough to auto-remediate in
advance, has to be dealt with manually.  Which means people have to be on-call
and yeah, sometime the phone goes off after midnight.</p>
<p>The good news is, we’re getting better, learning how to build automation in
at the core.  Which means that the fresh new AWS services are better at
self-maintaining and self-healing, so on-call sucks less.
On the other hand, the older services tend to have bigger teams and thus
less on-call time per person, so it evens out.</p>
<p>But there are some people who sufficiently dislike
the prospect of that occasional wee-hours page that they just don’t want to
stick around with us.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>I dislike our office-automation setup, but then I’m the kind of person
who really likes Google Docs and Calendar and Gmail, so maybe I’m an outlier.</p>
<p>One more thing:  Most jobs at AWS, you’ll never be able to
explain to civilians what it is you do for a living.  I generally say “I help keep
the Internet running” and you know what? That’s not a total lie.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>On balance</h2>
<p>I could go on about diversity and work environments and benefits and
process and promotion and so on, but at the end of the day it’s just another
high-tech company, nothing surprising.</p>
<p>I don’t <em>really</em> need the money, but I haven’t quit.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Recently I went out for a live metal triple-bill, with
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tokyodionysos/">Endon</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumac_(band)">SUMAC</a> opening for
<a href="http://www.borisheavyrocks.com/">Boris</a>, whom I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2011/10/13/Pictures-of-Wata">covered here
before</a> (with groovy pix). More pix today, with words on the history and
meaning of metal, and how to photograph it.</p>
<p>Endon, the openers, are described as
<a href="https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/rzeb35/endon-interview-57a206a19bea6ddf702dde02">catastrophic
noise metal</a> and yeah, they were pretty catastrophic.  A little too
abstract for me, but sincere and really trying to bring it.  Didn’t get any
pix.</p>
<p>Here’s my problem: I wholeheartedly love this music, in particular live,
and yet I have to acknowledge that it’s sort of, well, ridiculous.  The volume
is much louder than can be sanely necessary.  The choreography is all moves
invented around 1970 by Robert Plant or Jon Anderson or someone like that.
The musical content is built monomaniacally around a single sound, that of an
overdriven guitar amp.</p>
<p>SUMAC (on <a href="https://sumac.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>) are
<em>very</em> traditional metallistas; the poses, the riffs, the look, the
barked vocals.</p>

<p>Metal is harder to photograph than many other genres, because they like to
keep the stage dark, and bathed in subdued reds and blues that stress out the
poor sensor.  Sometimes you get an incredibly dramatic color treatment, but
often the best bet is just to switch to high-contrast B&amp;W.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says the guitarist is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Turner">Aaron Turner</a>
and the bassist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cook_(musician)">Brian Cook</a>,
but their picture doesn’t look like this guy.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Analytics</h2>
<p>Metal’s not just one thing, there are many linked strands in its fabric.
Check out
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_genres">Heavy metal
genres</a> over at Wikipedia (part of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Metal">WikiProject
Metal</a>).  For more fun,
consider the heavy-metal documentaries by Canadian sociologist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dunn">Sam Dunn</a>.  I haven’t seen
them all, but I can heartily recommend
<a href="http://amzn.to/2xHUvQ6">Metal<span class='dashes'> —</span> A
Headbanger’s Journey</a>, his first, which dives deep, deep, deep, on the
subject and is also full of heavy guitar riffs.  Best played loud.</p>
<p>Dunn points out that while you can argue all you want about the birth of
metal, Black Sabbath usually gets the most votes.  I’d go further: It helps
that I’m old and was thus there at the time.  It was in 1970; I was fifteen
and we were visiting my cousin who was a couple years older and infinitely
cooler.  “Come listen to this record” he said, and put on Sabbath’s eponymous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(song)">Black
Sabbath</a>.  Go listen (not to the flavorless sample on the Wikipedia page,
the real thing’s all over the Internet).  It’s all there, and I mean
<em>all</em> there in the first 1:08. Portentous
thunderstorm noise, church bell, then four repetitions of a beautifully-heavy
three-note riff. No vocals, no nothing, just that awesome guitar tone.
I hadn’t imagined that such a sound could exist in this world and my
life was never the same after.</p>
<p>There’s more to the song, some pretty good singing from Ozzy and of course
the explicitly Satanic lyrics. But Heavy Metal is basically about taking those
sixty-eight seconds and building a hundred subgenres and a rabid following
around them.  I don’t think the occult angle was initially necessary; but it
was a clever
move by Ozzy and Geezer, and got dragged along with that guitar sound
in later years.</p>
<p>Enough history and sociology.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Boris</h2>
<p>Like I said, the <em>good</em> pictures of Boris are
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2011/10/13/Pictures-of-Wata">here</a>.  On this
outing, the lights were darker and the fake-fog flow almost continuous.  This
time around, they obviously and by design wanted to play behind a curtain of
bright red/blue/violet smoke; which as an artistic choice, is nicely
harmonious with their music, which itself is nicely harmonious albeit
crushingly loud.</p>
<p>For this outing, I rented the
<a href="http://amzn.to/2z9xbaa">Fujinon 23mm f/1.4</a> from
<a href="http://www.beauphoto.com/">Beau Photo</a>, and the
wide-open/wide-angle combination was helpful.  But it was still tough; here’s
what I got.</p>

<p>Pro tip: When the last opener quits playing, you can
almost always snag a great photographers’ spot up near the front of the stage.
And then, after the first few songs, it’s polite to turn it over to a fellow
fan. On this occasion I was dead center and had the rare experience of live
metal in stereo, with Wata’s amps to my left and Atsuo’s to my right. Cool!</p>
<p>Yes, Wata picked up an accordion for a couple tunes.  The general sound is
remarkably like her guitar, but doesn’t allow for her rare-but-wonderful
excursions up the neck into screaming-treble territory.</p>
<img src="Altar-small.png" class="inline" alt="Altar" />
<p>Damn, I love their music.  Wata’s guitar tone is up there with the greats,
and the beauty of their crushing melodious drone is not equalled by
anyone except maybe
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunn_O)))">Sunn O)))</a>; and it’s
worth mentioning that the Boris/Sunn O))) collaboration
<a href="http://amzn.to/2ymQZIg">Altar</a> is a very beautiful piece of
music.</p>
<p>Other Boris outings that I strongly recommend are
<a href="http://amzn.to/2hHb8kf">Pink</a> (from 2005) and the much more recent
<a href="http://amzn.to/2zn8sQF">Attention Please</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Why it’s OK to love Metal</h2>
<p>I mean, I’m old and completely out of fucks to give about what others think
of my tastes.  But still…</p>
<p>First of all, Metal is <em>serious music</em>. Given the size of the crowds
at this point in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (small), it’s no road to
riches.
And the players are completely oblivious to issues of packaging and
pandering.  And if you actually listen closely past the surface of the roar,
the music is constructed with care, and then obviously the result of endless
practice and dedication to the craft.  It may lack a backbeat and a catchy
chorus, but there’s beauty aplenty in there.</p>
<p>I’ve quoted Sasha Frere-Jones, erstwhile <cite>New Yorker</cite> rock
critic, before on this subject, but he said two things that are worth
repeating. First, “Get past the novelty, though, and you find a level of
passion and an attention to detail that make a number of mere rock bands look
lazy.” And “You may eventually find a TV that is sufficiently large that
it makes going to a movie theatre pointless, but you are never going to
replicate anything like a black-metal show at home, no matter how fancy your
stereo is.”.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Metal people</h2>
<p>There are very few gatherings in the world at which I feel totally at
home.  Examples are O’Reilly’s OSCON and an Amazon principal-engineers’
gathering.  But a metal concert is another.  Here’s the cute end of metal
style.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/10/13/FXT10247.png" alt="Metal fans" />
<div class='caption'><p>Aren’t they adorable?</p></div>
<p>When I was young, I aspired to hair like that, but mine was always too thin
and stringy, and now I don’t have much.  But the crowd included grizzled
hardasses with facial tattoos, a couple of subgroups of Japanese extreme-music
culture that I don’t begin to understand, and then a lot of ordinary people
off the street who just share the love of this extreme, crazy, deadly-serious
art form.</p>
<p>It’s OK to crowd up to the front and stand there like a post. It’s OK to
head-bang when the beat picks up. It’s OK to sit motionless in the back row,
eyes closed. It’s a perfectly fine thing, in 2017, to be a greybearded
metal-head.</p>

<cite>The Economist</cite> addresses the fact that financial-asset prices
(stocks, bonds, and the like) keep drifting up and up in a world where
inflation
doesn’t; are we in a mega-bubble? What’s really going on? Looks obvious to me,
but then I’m a left-winger.
I think it’s all a straightforward consequence of economic efficiency and
class warfare.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Inflation?</h2>
<p>It stays low because our globalized economy is hyperefficient
at making the things we want, extracting the fuels we burn, and growing the
food we eat. And also flexible enough that it can scale up and down to meet
demand without apparently kicking off waves of inflation or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>All of which is true, but I think the effect of class war is even
bigger. Let’s start with a picture.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/10/07/IMF.png" alt="Labor is losing out" />
<div class='caption'><p>From
<a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2017/04/12/drivers-of-declining-labor-share-of-income/">Drivers of Declining Labor Share of Income</a>,
published by those commies at the International Monetary Fund.</p></div>
<p>Unions are in retreat and conservatives rule in the great economies of
the developed world. Generation Z is being forced into the gig economy, into
low-agency, low-paying, no-commitment jobs where being a shift lead at
Starbucks is an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>When you don’t have to pay people much, well yeah, you get low
inflation.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Financial Boom?</h2>
<p>When it’s the prices of household goods, they call it “inflation”. When it’s
financial assets, they call it “a bull market”.  But the cause is the same:
Too much money chasing too few targets.</p>
<p>It’s like this: There’s a surplus of
accumulated wealth (<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2014/05/01/Piketty-Capital">see Piketty</a>), and the people who hold it can’t possibly
spend it on
goods and services<span class='dashes'> —</span> how many yachts can you
waterski behind?  So they throw it at financial products, which then
inflate.</p>
<p>I think this is bleedingly obvious, but that’s possibly because I’m a
citizen of the technology scene, and of Vancouver.
In the venture-capital business, there’s just way too much money chasing way
too few unicorns.  Go to a
startup showcase sometime and hear the pitches, see who’s getting funded. If
you’re like most people, you’ll leave shaking your head.</p>
<p>I also sit in Vancouver, which <em>is</em> experiencing severe inflation,
in our housing sector.  Since Vancouver is a relatively low-paying city, not
just on a world scale but compared to its Canadian peers, it’s obvious that
global capital is part of the problem.  Our real-estate frenzy has become an
international news story (it appears in the <cite>Economist</cite> piece
linked above), but I un-humbly think my own 2015
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2015/11/29/Game-of-Homes">Game of Homes</a>
captures the essentials pretty well.</p>
<p>So, what do Vancouver real estate and financial instruments have in common?
Limited supply, that’s what.  Check out
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/business/dealbook/fewer-ipos-regulation-stock-market.html">A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It’s Not the Fault of Red Tape
</a>;
not only has the IPO rate plunged (from 706 in 1996 to 105 in 2016), so
has the number of public companies (from 7,322 to 3,671).  Declining supply,
increasing demand, d’oh.</p>
<p>Other financial assets, e.g. bonds, may not be as supply-starved (I couldn’t
turn up good numbers) but it stands to reason that when companies all over
the world are reporting robust profits (class war, remember?) they probably
don’t need to borrow as much.  And (as <cite>The Economist</cite> notes) when
investors are driven to buying 100-year bonds from Argentina, a nation that
has defaulted on its bonds six times in the last 100 years, you know they’re
getting desperate.</p>
<p>More evidence, were any needed, of the global capital surplus?  How about
the
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18944097"><em>$21 trillion</em></a>
being hidden from the tax-man here and there around the world?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What next?</h2>
<p>Beats me. The sad thing is, I don’t see any reason why things can’t go on
the way they are for the foreseeable future.  Objectively, it would probably
be good for the world if a lot of the accumulated wealth was just
vaporized. Unfortunately, the only way that seems to happen historically is in
major wars, as Piketty’s graphs illustrate.  Which nobody wants.</p>
<p>Then there’s the leftist world-view, for example
<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/06/04/On-the-Left">On
the Left</a> from last year.  Tl;dr: Tax wealth, force radical transparency on
asset ownership, jail business criminals, offer universal basic income. Works
for me; but I’m still looking for the right political party.</p>
<p>There’s just too much money out there not doing anything particularly
useful.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of client applications: The first kind has a “refresh”
or “reload” button to make sure your app’s in sync with its server’s view of
the world.  The second kind is broken.</p>
<img src="refresh.png" alt="Refresh" class="inline" />
<p>Of late, I have to deal regularly with several apps, notably including an emailer
and a car-sharing service, that lack such a button.  I can
imagine why<span class='dashes'> —</span> a customer-focused product manager
said “Steve Jobs taught us that fewer controls are better and we should just
take care of making sure we’re in sync with the cloud. So lose the
button.”</p>
<p>Except for, it doesn’t work.  Apparently nobody in the world is smart
enough to arrange for flawlessly reliable hands-off client/cloud
synchronization. There are times when you <em>just know</em> that what you’re
seeing on the screen is <em>wrong</em> and if the stupid app would
just take your word for it that
its world-view is stale and ask for a brain transplant from its server,
things would be OK.</p>
<p>The car-share app is particularly aggravating, showing me a map dotted with
nearby vehicles when I know for sure that this time of day I’ll be lucky if
there’s even one within walkable distance.  Since it totally refuses to sync,
I have to switch to the Android “recents” screen and kill it.  When I
re-open the app, it’s OK.</p>
<p>Why might this happen?  Well, maybe switching from WiFi to cell data (or
vice versa) left some layer confused about network truth. Possibly, because
your app was written in a programming language with multiple threads and shared mutable
state (silly, <em>silly</em> programmer), the cache is malfunctioning. Maybe
that same thing happened on the server.  Or in the CDN. Or maybe there’s an
obscure hiccup in a distant node_modules dependency that
you’re tickling.</p>
<p>Dear product managers: Show some humility. When a customer really thinks
your app is wrong <em>and</em> they know how to fix it, don’t get in their way.</p>

<p>Or at least, your employer might be. Over the years we in the tech sector have
gotten used to being well-regarded. After all, we
make people’s lives better, on balance.  That’s changing.  At the moment
it’s rumblings from thought leaders, not pervasive popular anger.
The other thing that’s new is that they’re
thought leaders who are progressives and liberals; just like most of us
in the tech professions.
It notably involves the M-word and those of us on the inside need
to be thinking about it.</p>
<p>The general public, by and large, love reading the news of their friends
and the world on Facebook, buying stuff cheap on Amazon, using Google maps and
mail for free, and using recent Windows releases at work.</p>
<p>But these days, it seems like every other day I read a chilling anti-tech
rant, usually written by someone smart, articulate, and (like me)
leftist.  Here are a few recent offerings:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-serf-on-googles-farm">A

“Google is so big and so powerful that even when it’s trying to do something good, it can be dangerous and frightening.”</p>

for Facebook:
“Facebook’s ‘internal policies’ amount to a kind of Stepford Wives version of civic liberalism and speech and privacy rights, the outward form of the things preserved while the innards have been gutted and replaced by something entirely different, an aggressive and totalizing business model which in many ways turns these norms and values on their heads.”</p></li>

<h2 id='p-2'>Disclosures</h2>
<p>I’m not going to claim my curation is unbiased.  I left out Microsoft
because, weirdly, nobody seems to hate Microsoft that much any more.  I
certainly don’t.  I left out Twitter because it’s not actually a company, it’s
a dysfunctional non-profit that accidentally provides a valuable service.
I left out Amazon (although it appears in a few of those pieces) because
I’d have no chance of coming anywhere near balance.</p>

at the tech giants from every which direction, but always ending up banging
out the monopoly melody.  Sometimes they say “corporate concentration” or
another euphemism, because being anti-monopoly sounds kind of old-fashioned;
and anyhow, shouldn’t you be talking about Comcast or United?</p>
<p>Not any more.  A lot of smart people think it’s good economics, good
policy, and good politics to aim the anti-trust gun at the tech sector.
I’m not saying they’re wrong. I’m also not predicting that they’ll get any
traction, particularly in the America where the short-term focus has to be on
combating Nazis and pussy-grabbers.</p>
<p>But this is a trend that nobody in technology leadership should ignore.</p>

<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/">No Man’s Sky</a> the game, which I’ve
been playing again lately.  It’s been accused of being mostly

<div class='caption'><p>Oh, just flying my starship over the landscape of<br/>a
planet I recently discovered and named. As one does.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>Updates</h2>
<p>No Man’s Sky launched just over a year ago, preceded by a massive hype wave
and followed by howls of disappointment when it fell short of
expectations. There’ve been three major updates, each with massive
additions. and it’s becoming increasingly like a “normal” game, with missions
and NPC’s and economies and so on.</p>
<p>Its biggest charm probably remains that it’s an <em>easy</em> game,
occasional flashes of excitement, but mostly just cruising along from star to
star, enjoying the views.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/09/17/NMS_20170915233930.png" alt="Nice view in No Man’s Sky" />

<p>The game is starting to add inklings of multi-player, and multiple players
are self-organizing, most notably to create
<a href="https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Galactic_Hub_Project">The Galactic
Hub</a>, which I hope to reach some day.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Aliens!</h2>
<p>In <cite>NMS</cite> they’re, more than anything, fun. The planets have
their own procedurally-generated menageries, but there are three main species
you can actually have relationships with, and learn the languages of.  There’s
lots of back-story that you soak up as you move through the game.  Here’s a
Gek.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Aren’t they cute?</p></div>
<p>The beasts in <cite>NMS</cite> are chatty and come in all sizes, shapes, and colors.
They’re more playful than scary.  And like I said, it’s an easy game, any
creature that attacks you is pretty well toast.  But, here’s Jabba the Flowerpott.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/09/17/NMS_20170910220134.png" alt="No Man’s Sky with fat alien" />
<h2 id='p-3'>My experience</h2>
<p>In the picture just above, that’s my current starship, parked on the left.
Nice  ride, eh?  For the cognoscenti: A decent little Samamoga
27-slot B-class fighter, modest stats but a reliable pirate-killer.
Which sort of sums up my playing style.  I’m busy, with a
job and family; thus not a serious gamer.  One of the
really nice things about <cite>NMS</cite> is you can do it for an hour here and an hour
there and keep progressing and never really get stuck.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/09/17/NMS_20170907234711.png" alt="Ship parked on peak, No Man’s Sky" />
<div class='caption'><p>Good parking spot!</p></div>
<p>I restarted after the 1.3 update (like a lot of others) and
I’m going to keep playing till I get a freighter.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Gender</h2>
<p>The three primary alien races you deal with do not participate in the human
notion of gender. Thus, when individuals are mentioned in text (and there’s a
lot of text in <cite>NMS</cite>) it’s always in a scrupulous third-person:
They, them, their.  It’s amazing how quickly you get used to it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the beasts that populate the planets <em>are</em>
gendered, and while male and female do appear, one also finds Asymptotic,
Asymmetric, Orthogonal, Prime, Radical, Indeterminate,and Vectorised.</p>
<p>So the authors of <cite>NMS</cite> are having some real postmodern
twenty-first century fun; which on balance is a fair description of the whole
game.  I’m still on board.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Our media, pro and social, echo with blasts of self-righteous anger over
proposed legislation which would eliminate a few
popular tax dodges. Weirdly, I see no-one arguing the other
side; that the tax proposals are reasonable.  I think I’m
qualified to make that argument, so I will. <i>[If you’re not Canadian, you
can probably stop reading here.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The proposed tax changes</h2>
<p>They’re summarized pretty well
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-tax-changes-wealthy-consultations-tuesday-1.4210201">here</a>.
Basically, if you have a business and it’s incorporated<span
class='dashes'> —</span> say
you’re a doctor, lawyer, contractor, accountant, that kind of thing<span class='dashes'> —</span> you can use
your corporation for tax
tricks, the effect being that you pay less tax on the same income.</p>
<p>The tricks have been well-known for years; every competent financial
advisor and wealth manager in the country tells every client about them.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Disclosures</h2>
<p>(And I wish a few more people publishing op-eds on this subject would offer
theirs.)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I have a good income and pay a lot of tax.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve had capital gains over the years, from a successful
startup and a couple of lucky investments.</p></li>
<li><p>My wife and I have a corporation, which is useful in supporting
the consulting businesses both of us have run from time to time.
But we’ve hardly ever been able to use any tricks; one time
by accident and acqui-hire the corporation ended up with pre-IPO Twitter
shares, and we did save some tax bucks when we sold them.</p></li>
<li><p>I was a co-founder of a company that currently has just over 14,000
employees.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t vote for the government that’s making the proposals.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My feelings on tax generally? My bills are shocking, but on the other hand
I’m a heavy direct user of government services: roads, bridges, public transit,
bikeways, libraries, athletic facilities, public broadcasting, health care,
emergency first responders. Plus, having grown up in a third-world country, I
have a hearty appreciation for the rule of law and the social safety net.  So
yeah, I’d like a lower tax bill and I might vote for a party that had specific
proposals on paying for one with cutbacks on the parts of government I
don’t like.</p>
<p>But I generally do think that people who make about as much money as me
should pay about as much tax as me.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The complaints</h2>
<p>It amounts to a bunch of well-off people who are going to start
paying the same tax rate I do explaining why they shouldn’t have to, because
they work hard, create jobs, and are just all-around nice people.</p>
<p>Here’s
<a href="http://www.greaterfool.ca/2017/09/04/the-burden/">an
anesthesiologist</a> who’s so upset that, he says, he and the other doctors
are going to go mini-John Galt and start working less.  </p>
<p>Here’s a
<a href="http://www.greaterfool.ca/2017/08/29/fair-is-fair/">guy who pays
$225K in tax</a> and says he’s “already contributing FAR more than his fair
share”.</p>
<p>The complainers complain that they don’t get a pension.  Neither do I; in
fact <em>nobody</em> does any more, except civil servants.</p>
<p>They also bitch about not getting paid vacation or “any other benefits”.
Oddly enough, when we’re on vacation in sunny destinations, we tend to
encounter lots of doctors and lawyers and contractors and so on, so somehow
they manage to get away.  And now that we’re older and know a few retirees, I
gotta say that the small-biz-owner contingent seems well-represented among
those in their “golden years” where by “golden” I mean “rolling in dough”.</p>
<p>Also, do the math: Anyone who’s paying $225K in tax is a very well-off
individual, with lots of room to save for retirement, and enough cash-flow to
visit Maui or Cabo every winter.</p>
<p>But they do have a point; It wouldn’t seem completely insane
to me if there were tax deductions for those whose employment situation is
low on benefits.  But that should be done explicitly, rather than
nudge-nudge-wink-winking at
small-biz corporate fiddles.</p>
<p>That aside, I’m sorry but I just don’t see any reason why someone who makes
my kind of money shouldn’t have to pay my kind of
taxes, just because they’re a small business.  And in the testimonies I read,
they come across as hypocrisy-drenched greedheads.</p>
<p>If you want lower taxes, I think there are two good courses of action: Move
to a jurisdiction that has them, or do the political work to elect a party
that will cut them (and correspondingly, services).
Spare me, please, the “supply-side” fantasy in which
tax cuts generate increased revenue.
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kansas-experiment-with-tax-cutting-failed-on-its-own-terms-2017-6">It’s
been tried</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>So, tax all income equally?</h2>
<p>Maybe.  In Canada, the tax on capital gains is half that on salary.
The idea is to encourage people to start businesses and
invest in other businesses.
I’ve created businesses and invested in them too, so it’d be easy for me to
say “Look, it works” and maybe I’d be right.  But maybe not; I probably
would have gone ahead and done those things anyhow.  It’s amazing how many tax
policies officially aimed at one good end or another seem mostly to result in
rich people paying less.</p>
<p>Also I’ve started
to hear progressive economists arguing against this kind of thing.  And a
hard-line policy of “income is income” has the advantage that people don’t pay
tax consultants to fool around and try to make one kind of income look like
another.  So it’s not a slam-dunk.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>What’s going to happen?</h2>
<p>The politics is interesting.  The people lined up against the tax proposals
have loud, well-funded voices, and donate lots to
political parties, so their concerns are going to get careful attention from
legislators.  And it’s easy to convince the public that any government tax
tactic is a grubby revenue grab.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day the noise is coming from a bunch of fat cats
trying to pay less tax than other fat cats, based on what feel like
really flimsy arguments. They exude entitlement.  I think the politics on this
one could go either way.</p>

spy thriller gracefully mashed up with a pre-war murder mystery set in Hitler’s
Bavarian country getaway, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghof_(residence)">Berghof</a>.
It’s a repeat appearance for Kerr’s Bernie Gunther,
an appealingly hard-boiled veteran socialist cop who finds himself working for
National Socialist management.</p>
<img src="Prussian-Blue.png" alt="Prussian Blue by Philip Kerr" class="inline" />
<p>And yep, there are Nazis in this story; the real not tiki-torch flavor.  A
couple of mega-Nazis, Bormann and Heydrich, and some relatively minor odd fish
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Brandt">Karl Brandt</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerdy_Troost">Gerdy Troost</a>.</p>
<p>Nazis are convenient for a novelist, because they are reliably evil and
twisted, so he can economize on characterization and leave room for plot and
atmospherics. Having said that, he cuts Troost a little slack; you’d have to
be a better historian than me to know whether that’s a travesty or not.</p>
<p>Did I mention atmospherics? You’ve come to the right place. While
substantial parts of the novel aren’t at der Führer’s country
digs, the ones that are bask in deep you-are-there weirdness, and (I
thought) a pretty deep take on what it’d be like for the yokels in a pretty
backwater when the Fascist architects come to put up palaces.  Some,
predictably, react a lot better than others.  But Kerr doesn’t pretend the
presence of any serious resistance.</p>
<p>Hey, and here’s a fascinating little sidelight: The lead contractor for the
Berghof construction was a company called Polensky &amp; Zöllner; some part of
which
<a href="http://www.polensky-zoellner.com/">apparently still exists</a>, albeit
in Abu Dhabi.  Their motto: “All knowledge comes from experience”.  And yeah,

So let&#x2019;s use that as a club to bash away at  the prob&#xad;lem.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>There’s a plausible case that capitalism <i>per se</i> isn’t the problem.
Concentration is: Variations range from “too big to fail” to
good old-fashioned monopoly.
It’s painfully obvious that the
acquisition of one monster telecom or bank or airline by another does neither
their customers nor the economy as a whole any good.  It’s tough to write
anti-monopoly law, because how do you quantify market power?
However, you can quantify size. So let’s use that as a club to bash away at
the problem.</p>
<p>Specifically: Pick a number <i>X</i>, and pass legislation decreeing that
no company can have more than <i>X</i> full-time-equivalent employees.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How big is <i>X</i>?</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some data:</p>
<table >
<tr><td class="empty"></td>
<th>Employees (K)</th></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Accenture</th><td>410</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Alphabet</th><td>70</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>British Airways</th><td>40</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Cemex</th><td>40</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Comcast</th><td>150</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Facebook</th><td>17</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>GE</th><td>290</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>GM</th><td>200</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Goldman Sachs</th><td>30</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Lenovo</th><td>60</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Microsoft</th><td>110</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Netflix</th><td>3.5</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Qualcomm</th><td>30</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>RBC</th><td>80</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Samsung</th><td>300</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Siemens</th><td>340</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Sony</th><td>120</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Tesla</th><td>30</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>United</th><td>80</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The numbers aren’t perfect, mostly sourced from Wikipedia, rounded down to
the nearest 10K above around 30K.  Some people say Samsung has over 500K. The
Tesla number is after acquiring Grohmann and SolarCity in late 2016.</p>
<p>I’m going to say <i>X</i> is maybe around twenty thousand.  Every single
one of those companies that’s 20K+ could, I think, be broken up into saner,
sounder, smaller chunks that would be decent, profitable, high-quality
businesses.</p>
<p>I guess maybe you couldn’t have a telecom that owned a national network and
also had kiosks in every mall.  Or an Internet giant that did email
<em>and</em> operating systems <em>and</em> cloud.  Or a bank that operated
branches in every town of a vast nation.  Or an automotive company that sold a
full line of personal, recreational, and business vehicles on seven
continents.  All these things seem OK to me.</p>
<p>The picture would be weirdly different: A successful young company
approaching size <i>X</i> would have to make painful choices about which
business it really wanted to be in, and walk away from the rest. This doesn’t
sound terrible.</p>
<p>You could still grow financially if you could figure out a force multiplier
for the abilities and energies of your employees.  This doesn’t sound
terrible.</p>
<p>Companies could still be extremely powerful; look at Facebook.  But I still
think that, broadly, smaller companies are less so.  And further, it’s very
likely that this marketplace has a lot more competition than we see
currently.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Enforcement</h2>
<p>We fortunate citizens of the developed world
live under the rule of laws not men, but an unfortunate corollary is that
businesses will game the rules right up to the edge and beyond.  So the rules
would have to be pretty well cinched down.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There’s no distinction between
employees and contractors; the number of workday hours you pay people to work
can’t exceed
8 times <i>X</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not distinct employees, it’s how many are working on any given
day.</p></li>
<li><p>(Anti-<i>keiretsu</i>):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If any company owns more than 5% of the equity
of another, directly or indirectly, they are considered a single company
for the purposes of this legislation.</p></li>
<li><p>If any company derives more than 25% of its
revenue from another company, likewise.</p></li>
<li><p>If any legal entity owns more than 5% of the equity of more than one
company, likewise.</p></li>

<h2 id='p-3'>Punishment</h2>
<p>Laws are always violated, and it’s crystal-clear that certain sectors of
the business community see fines and other forms of financial penalty as just
another cost of doing business.</p>
<p>So I propose a system where there is only one penalty.  Should a
corporation be convicted of exceeding size <i>X</i>, its chief executive and
Board of Directors at the time the violation started to occur, and any
successors, would be subject to imprisonment until the illegal condition is
corrected.  So simple!</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>This idea is completely crazy and could never happen!</h2>
