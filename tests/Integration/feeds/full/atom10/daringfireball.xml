                <p>Mark Gurman  and Alex Webb, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Apple Inc.’s Jony Ive, a key executive credited with the look of many of the company’s most
                        popular products, has re-taken direct management of product design teams.</p>
                    <p>Ive, 50, was named Apple’s chief design officer in 2015 and subsequently handed off some
                        day-to-day management responsibility while the iPhone maker was building its new Apple Park
                        headquarters in Cupertino, California. “With the completion of Apple Park, Apple’s design
                        leaders and teams are again reporting directly to Jony Ive, who remains focused purely on
                        design,” Amy Bessette, a company spokeswoman, said Friday in a statement.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I can&#8217;t decide if this is actually news. It was public knowledge that Ive was spending a lot
                    (most?) of his time on Apple Park and other architectural projects (retail), but that obviously
                    wasn&#8217;t going to last forever. I suppose it&#8217;s news, though, insofar as there was some
                    speculation that he had one foot out the door. This should put an end to that.</p>
