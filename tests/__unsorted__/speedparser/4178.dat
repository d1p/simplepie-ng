Startingwith a synth, a drum machine, and a guitar amp, he'd work the filter knobsuntil the paint rubbed off while dreaming of standing on stage in front ofadoring fans and flashing lights.                 From such humble beginnings, Stewart stepped up his knowledge ofsynthesis, drum programming and mixing. His early techno enthusiasmexpressed itself in a line of recordings which began with Detroit-basedlabels in 1997, leading eventually to larger projects with well-knownEuropean techno labels such as Minus, Tresor, and Mille Plateaux.In 2001, he founded his first imprint Persona Records which released almost 50 EPs and albums byhimself and other talents such as Touane, Reynold, and Andrea Sartori. Ten years later in 2011,Stewart founded Son of Cataclysm as an artistic reaction to the economic and human rightscrises of our time.Successes with Persona and other independent labels have brought Stewart's shows to worldwideaudiences for 15 years. Stewart has been a fixture on the global club circuit from Tokyo to Berlin,New York to California and all world capitals in between. Always playing live original music hasendeared Stewart to fans who are looking for soul and wisdom in their entertainment. A step beyondthe simplicity of hedonism and personal abandon, Stewart Walker has built a legacy as a technomusician who still believes in the sound of the future.Selected Stewart Walker Discography:1999: Stabiles - Force Inc/Mille Plateaux2002: Live Extracts - Tresor2004: Grounded in Existence - Persona2007: Concentricity - Persona2011 - Artifacts of the pre-Apocalypse - Son of CataclysmSelected Websites:www.stewartwalker.comstewartwalkernews.blogspot.comwww.facebook.com/stewartwalker.livewww.sonofcataclysm.comwww.facebook.com/sonofcataclysmwww.soundcloud.com/sonofcataclysm</description></item><!-- put more items here --></channel></rss>
