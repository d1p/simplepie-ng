             <title>Vivian Maier Mania! A Preview of The Street Photographer&apos;s Upcoming, Posthumous Exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery</title>
             <description><![CDATA[If the name <b>Vivian Maier </b>is unfamiliar to you, that's because the prolific street photographer was essentially unknown throughout her lifetime. Now, three years after her death, Maier is posthumously being recognized as one of the greatest American street photographers of the 20th Century. It all began when Chicago real estate agent/local historian John Maloof bought 150,000 of Maier's negatives, over 3,000 prints and several of her original cameras for $400 at an auction house; began posting them onto a <a href="http://http//vivianmaier.blogspot.com/">blog</a>; and Maier (who died in 2009 at age 83) went on to become an online sensation. Maier, who was born in 1926, and spent most of her life living in New York City and Chicago, worked as a nanny, but wandered the streets on her days off, masterfully capturing the characters and street scenes she happened upon -- but sharing them with no one. At long last, her work will have a larger audience, with a show at <a href="http://www.stevenkasher.com/">Steven Kasher Gallery</a> opening December 15th, a corresponding show at <a href="http://www.howardgreenberg.com/">Howard Greenberg</a> opening the same day, and a book, published by <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com/">Powerhouse</a>, <i>Vivian Maier: Street Photographer,</i> out that month. There's also a documentary about her, and Maloof's discovery of her photos, slated for a release in 2012. Above, to sate your ravenous appetites before the upcoming onslaught of Maier-related events, check out eight of the images from the <b>Steven Kasher exhibit</b>.<br /> ]]></description>

             <title>Apparat&apos;s &quot;Song of Los&quot; Is Our Music Video of the Day</title>
             <description><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/29296792?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" width="500"></iframe></div>


<br />If you love sci-fi films, be sure to watch this new video from the 
German artist <b>Apparat</b> for "Song of Los" from his new album, <i>The Devil's 
Walk</i>. i=It was made by the L.A.-based director <b>Saman Keshavarz</b> and, dare 
we say so, the kid's got talent. More of a short film than your usual 
music clip, the simple tale of robot love surprises with its plot 
twists and impresses with a great story told with a low budget. Apparat
 (aka Sascha Ring) has done recording on his own and with Modeselektor 
under the name Moderat and was once a part of the Shitkatapult label. 
&nbsp;This is his first release on Mute Records and it came out last week. ]]></description>

             <title>Tarantino-rama! Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown On Blu-ray</title>
             <description><![CDATA[<img alt="pulpf1.png" src="http://www.papermag.com/uploaded_images/pulpf1.png" class="mt-image-none" height="315" width="280" /><img alt="jackbrown1.png" src="http://www.papermag.com/uploaded_images/jackbrown1.png" class="mt-image-none" height="307" width="261" /><br /><br /><br /><b>Quentin Tarantino</b>'s <i><b>Pulp Fiction</b> </i>and <i><b>Jackie Brown</b></i> (Lionsgate/Miramax) are finally available on Blu-ray. <i>Pulp Fiction</i> (1994) was like a gangster <i>Arabian Nights</i>, weaving the lurid stories of drug dealers, hoods, crooked prize fighters and their molls into a blackly comic tapestry that distilled Hong Kong action films and film noir into something unique and groundbreaking. <b>John Travolta</b> doing a mean twist with <b>Uma Thurman</b> was also pretty remarkable. Starring <b>Samuel L. Jackson</b>, <b>Bruce Willis</b>, <b>Harvey Keitel</b> alongside Travolta and Thurman, it's a wild ride that still scrambles your brain. <i><b>Jackie Brown</b></i> (1997) is based on <b>Elmore Leonard</b>'s <i>Rum Punch</i>, and stars the great <b>Pam Grier</b> as an aging airline stewardess who supplies her meager income by transporting money from Mexico to an arms dealer (Samuel L. Jackson). When she is arrested by the feds (one of them a twitching, hilarious, <b>Michael Keaton</b>, she cooks up a convoluted sting operation. <b>Robert Foster</b> is wonderful as a ruefully smitten bails bondsman. And Grier, who rose the ranks from Philippine women's prison movies to blaxploitation classics like <i>Coffy</i> and <i>Foxy Brown</i>, is lovingly celebrated from the great opening credits walking through the airport to the last killer scene in the car listening to <b>Bobby Womack</b>'s <i>Across 110th Street</i>. The Blu-rays look sensational and are packed with documentaries, audio commentaries, deleted scenes and scores of other extras. <div><br /></div>]]></description>

             <title>Hail Mary</title>
             <description><![CDATA[Back in1992, Andre Harrell, then CEO of Uptown Records, told me that he had a new female singer from Yonkers who was going to become a superstar. Her cover of Anita Baker's "Caught Up in the Rapture," recorded at a local mall, had landed in his hands and Harrell's intern at the time, a young producer by the name of Sean Combs, had requested to take on this project. I was the newly-appointed associate editor of the newly-launched music magazine <i>VIBE</i>, and Uptown's publicist Lisa Cambridge gushed to me that this young artist's style was "glam meets hip-hop meets rock 'n' roll." And the hair... she promised it would be like nothing I'd ever seen before. So she sent over a cassette tape with "What's the 411?" written in Sharpie across the front. As soon as I pressed play and heard "Real Love," with those textured, beautiful and imperfect vocals, I was turned out. Her sound was both deeply powerful and eerily familiar.<br /><br />Several days later, I was sitting across from a 21-year-old Mary J. Blige at an Italian restaurant in midtown Manhattan. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Clad in a red leather motorcycle jacket, matching shorts and black Dr. Martens; her hair styled in an impressive copper-colored beehive piled high on top of her head; and a small scar under her left eye -- she was so fierce. Though dressed to thrill, Blige was quiet, distant and shy.<br /><br />Finally she spoke. In a heavy New York accent, Blige ordered her lunch: "I'll have the... scrimp scampi," she said assuredly. It was then that I officially fell in love. She was confident and tough -- but vulnerable, and visibly (and endearingly) rough around the edges.<br /><br />That first album, <i>What's the 411?</i>, executive produced by Combs, went on to change the R&amp;B landscape, and by the mid-'90s, Blige was known as the "Queen of Hip-Hop Soul" for her ability to merge the soulfulness of R&amp;B with the beats and edge of rap music.<br /><br />Over 50 million records sold, nine Grammys and two American Music Awards later, Blige is worlds away from that high school dropout I met nearly 20 years ago (she even got her GED in 2010). In addition to producing hit records, the 40-year-old powerhouse can now add successful businesswoman (last year saw the launch of her fragrance line in collaboration with HSN), philanthropist (she runs the Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now -- FFAWN -- and has been active in relief efforts following the earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Katrina) and actress (she has two major films in the works) to her résumé.<br /><br />All this, despite several decades dealing with sexual, emotional, drug and alcohol abuse. But Blige never let those demons get the best of her. Instead, she used music as a form of therapy, and has gone on to grow her multimedia brand built on themes of self-empowerment and emotional evaluation. These days, she speaks calmly and with purpose, at times even channeling a self-help guru. When describing her new album, out this November, <i>My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act I)</i>, a follow-up of sorts to her 1994 classic <i>My Life</i>, she explains, "I wanted to make sure everyone understands that this is me taking things to the next level. It's about learning how to live after the drama."<br /><br /><img alt="maryj-blige-header2.jpg" src="http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/uploaded_images/maryj-blige-header2.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="400" width="600" /><br /><br />Upon its release, <i>My Life </i>was an instant critical success. The record, also produced by Combs, established her signature sound -- lush rhythms mixed with old-school hip-hop beats and raw, soulful emotion and was crowned one of the greatest albums of all time by <i>Rolling Stone </i>and <i>Time</i>. It also marked her long tradition of expressing the hurt and drama of her life through music; she took us to the dark side.<br /><br />She followed <i>My Life</i> with a slew of hit-making, soul-baring albums, each album title -- No <i>More Drama</i>, <i>The Breakthrough</i>,<i> Growing Pains</i>, <i>Stronger With Each Tear</i> -- telling her story. With the release of <i>My Life II</i>, almost two decades later, a sober and happily married Blige (she's been married to her former manager Kendu Isaacs since 2003) returns with an album about what happens when you get through the pain and suffering. The songs are heavy on the bass lines and romantic themes, like "Someone to Love Me (Naked)" -- and lest you think turning 40 has turned her into a soft-rock songstress she's joined on the track by her old friend Sean "Diddy" Combs and hip-hop's man-of-the-moment Lil Wayne. Then there's the lush, upbeat anthem, "25/8" on which she declares "I got so much love for you boy / I need another hour and a day so I can love you 25/8." "I've been learning how to weather the storm with each album, and with this one," she says, "I want to make clear that the journey continues in every positive way. Every time you conquer something there will always be bigger challenges."<br /><br />Next up she'll be conquering the big screen. This summer, she wrapped up <i>Rock of Ages</i>, the film based on the campy Broadway musical that celebrates glam metal rock hits from the '80s (think Journey, Styx, Whitesnake, et. al.), and features a bold-faced ensemble cast including Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand and Paul Giamatti. Blige began her acting career in 2001, appearing in the indie film <i>Prison Song</i> opposite the rapper Q-Tip. In 2009, she had a supporting role in Tyler Perry's<i> I Can Do Bad All By Myself</i>, and she's appeared on TV in shows like <i>The Jamie Foxx Show</i>, <i>30 Rock</i> and <i>Entourage</i>. In 2004, she even joined the Off-Broadway cast of <i>The Exonerated </i>as a woman who spent 20 years in prison for a crime she didn't commit.<br /><br />"All I can say is I had a blast," Blige says of playing her <i>Rock of Ages</i> character, Justice Charlier, the maternal owner of a seedy gentleman's club. "Tom Cruise was always just so helpful and constantly giving. Just watching him and Catherine Zeta-Jones transform into their characters, it was like, OMG these people are incredible!"<br /><br />For Blige, who remade the classic Led Zeppelin anthem "Stairway to Heaven" last year, <i>Rock of Ages</i> feels like a natural fit. "When I was five years old there was soft rock on the radio and there was rock 'n' roll on the radio, you would hear 'Bennie and the Jets' and Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr.'s 'You Don't Have to Be a Star,'" she says getting nostalgic. "Everything wasn't so segregated and I got a chance to hear everything."<br /><br />She adds, "My father had a Grateful Dead album in his crates and he used to play all that stuff. So I got introduced to rock 'n' roll on my own as a teenager. When MTV was big we would all tune in to watch Pat Benatar, Journey, Tears for Fears, Duran Duran and U2. I love it all!" she continues. "I just love music period... great music."<br /><br />After that, Blige is getting back to her soul roots, and gearing up for her next big role, playing the iconic songstress and activist Nina Simone in an upcoming biopic. "Nina was different from me in a lot of ways. She was courageous and confident. I'm just growing into that," Blige explains. "But she was like that ever since she was a little girl -- she was never afraid during a period when there was so much racism. She was always bold. I have a lot to draw from -- all the trials and tribulations and battles. But my God, I hope I can do the work and pull it off."<br />Despite playing these many characters -- and the fact that her Dr. Martens have long been replaced by sky-high stilettos -- Blige has a firm understanding of where she came from, and what her fans expect from her: "Everybody is saying to me, 'You have to be like this person, you have to be like that; you've got to be younger.' I know that doesn't work for me. I just want<br />my fans to be happy about the direction I'm going in. I'm never going to stop doing me."<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Styled by Marni Senofonte<br />Hair by Dante Blandshaw at Break Management using Aveda <br />Makeup by D'Andre Michael For U.G.L.Y.

             <title>The Wild Ones</title>
             <description><![CDATA[<img alt="mquan_wf_9641_mm.jpg" src="http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/uploaded_images/mquan_wf_9641_mm.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="308" width="600" /><br /><br />Rock 'n' roll supergroups (see: Traveling Wilburys, Asia, Them Crooked Vultures, etc.) are usually created on a whim and primarily exist to satiate fans' desires to see their rock idols join forces, like Greek gods assembling on Mount Olympus for a jam session. So last fall, when rumblings emanated from the Portland, Oregon, indie rock scene about a new band featuring Carrie Brownstein (former guitarist and vocalist from Sleater-Kinney, and star of IFC's sketch comedy hit <i>Portlandia</i>), Mary Timony (former guitarist and vocalist from Helium), Rebecca Cole (a multi-instrumentalist from the Minders) and Janet Weiss (the drummer from numerous bands, including Quasi and Sleater-Kinney), it was obvious that, despite the dream team line-up, this would not be a supergroup by definition. The explosive combination of Brownstein's mod- rock wail, Timony's honey-dipped vocals and expert guitar work, Cole's playful organ flourishes and Weiss's thunderous drumming (it sounds like she's playing with Thor's hammer instead of drum- sticks), established this new project, Wild Flag, as a vital band with the potential to shake-up the rock universe.<br /><br />Even though the Wild Flag roster is loaded with all-stars, their origin story is a modest tale. In the summer of 2009, while recording a soundtrack for the Lynn Hershman-Leeson documentary <i>!Women Art Revolution</i>, Brownstein enlisted Weiss and Cole to assist with the score. "We busted a bunch of tunes out, and the lady who was working on the film wanted vocals, so Mary got involved," Cole says. "That was the genesis of Wild Flag. It initially felt like we were just working on the soundtrack for this film. It didn't feel like the try-out for a band."<br /><br />"It happened so quickly," Washington, D.C.-based Timony adds. "Carrie emailed me some tracks to add vocals to. Then I ended up flying out [to Portland]. And now I'm in this band."<br /><br />Before the band publicly announced its existence, rumors swirled on music blogs about the secretive project. Yet despite the building buzz, Brownstein routinely denied in interviews that Wild Flag was even a thing. "We needed time to let it incubate without being in the public eye," Weiss explains. "There needs to be an element of surprise. You can really sneak up on people with a new band. At our first shows, we wanted to catch people wide-eyed and capture their attention."<br /><br />True to the band's clandestine ways, Wild Flag played their first shows on an under-the-radar jaunt down the West Coast last November. "Our first tour started out very small in an art gallery in Olympia playing to less than 100 people," Brownstein says. "We wanted to be a new band who earned their audience."<br /><br />Watching YouTube videos of Wild Flag's early performances in sweaty clubs, kicking out Rolling Stones and Patti Smith covers alongside their new jams, it's obvious that they weren't relying on their impressive résumés to build a following. "We were playing stages that were the size of a postage stamp," laughs Weiss. "Some nights, the four of us literally couldn't fit on the same stage." Tickets to these shows were tough to score despite the fact that the ladies hadn't even released a single yet. "To be honest, I've never experienced people being this interested in a project I'm doing," Timony says. "I mean, people were interested in Helium, but those shows were more subdued. Wild Flag is definitely more of a live band."<br /><br />After getting off the road, Wild Flag hunkered down in the studio in April of 2011 and cut their debut self-titled LP, which hit shelves earlier this month. The record is a slight departure for all parties involved: it's poppier than Sleater-Kinney and it rocks harder than Helium. The result is an electrifying mix of brash guitar rock, power-pop and post-punk snarl. "The record is vibrant," Weiss says. "There are a lot of fast songs, and it has a swagger. And you just can't manufacture the intoxicating energy of a new project."<br /><br />"With Mary being such an accomplished guitar player, and with the addition of Rebecca who plays these melodies on the key-bass, it really allows for the dynamic to fluctuate in ways that can showcase and highlight different elements of the band that I was unable to do in Sleater-Kinney," Brownstein says. "With a three-piece, everyone is sort of 'on' all the time. The energy is very focused. But in a four-piece, and with another guitar player and bass, you can have that energy shift around."<br /><br />After their album's release, Wild Flag will hit the road again this fall as soon as Brownstein wraps on the second season of <i>Portlandia</i> (which is due to air on IFC in January). Despite having a modest hit on TV, Brownstein demurs at the thought of fans com- ing to see Wild Flag based on her comedy work. "I think there will be some crossover," she says, "just in the way that people who know me from Sleater-Kinney see me in <i>Portlandia</i>, and they're like, 'Ah! What is this? She should be playing guitar.'" Now that she's back shredding on her axe, what will her comedy fans think of her new band? "If people have only seen me in Portlandia, and they come to see Wild Flag, they're gonna be scared." ★<br /><br /><br /><i>(l-r) Carrie Brownstein, Mary Timony, Janet Weiss, Rebecca Cole<br />Makeup: Karyn Carmona at Gold + Arrow<br /></i><div><i><br /></i></div><div><br /></div>]]></description>

             <title>Slash Forward</title>
             <description><![CDATA[<img alt="dj_rupture.jpg" src="http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/uploaded_images/dj_rupture.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="698" width="600" /><br /><br />According to Jace Clayton, aka DJ /rupture, the slash in his name represents "a rupture, a little break." But it also comes in handy when describing what he does: The Brooklyn-based DJ/producer/designer/author/software engineer relocated to Spain and Morocco for the summer and then spent August touring the continent -- all while releasing an R&amp;B-tinged EP he helped produce for performance artist Kalup Linzy featuring ubiquitous actor James Franco, and designing a streetwear line called Tropical Systems, via Dutty Artz, the record label turned Wonka-esque culture factory he runs with collaborator Matt Shadetek.<br /><br />This fall, Clayton will release a new album -- a soundtrack to an imaginary reworking of The Shining taking place in modern-day Dubai -- with his strings-heavy band Nettle, and head to Holland to work on software that will rearrange traditional Dutch music based on parameters created by changes in the stock market.<br /><br />After that? A book about contemporary music published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2013. And that's just what he's ready to talk about now.<br /><br />"Music is so available these days, which is awesome, but if I'm really going to spend time bringing something into that world, that something has to be interesting and unique," Clayton says from Barcelona. For the multitalented Massachusetts native, that could mean anything from producing a dance track to throwing a party or playing a show at an abandoned cinematek in Marrakesh, like he'll be doing this month.<br /><br />Clayton's come a long way from the early aughts when he first shot to fame -- working with Kid606 and getting recognized by Spanish teens in grocery stores -- thanks to 2001's Gold Teeth Thief, a mixtape that sampled everything from dancehall to Arabic music to Paul Simon.<br />"Naturally I've got a lot of influences," Clayton says, "but in terms of the spaces that I move through, I suppose there aren't any. It's just about getting inspiration from lots of different types of people." So, what's next? Clayton responds without missing a beat: "I hope things get weirder." <div><br /></div>]]></description>
