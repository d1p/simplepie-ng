&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who dont believe in magic will never find it. — Roald Dahl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland was wonderful. Magical. Enchanting. I could gush about it for hours, literally,  but I think I’ll just try to react rather than describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing experience, one I won’t soon forget. And I think the problem I’m having with this whole process is the strong almost violent physical reaction to the idea that the weekend was coming to a close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend was so beautiful and amazing that the addictive side of my personality is literally hijacking all thought of this potentially not being every day of the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like a better version of me, when I was there. Not really different, just fucking off-my-rocker &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;. Pouring heart and soul into every moment. The happiest I’ve been in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the weekend feeling fortunate that I was even getting the chance to go up there and meet people and see Portland but now that the weekend was over I feel like there is so much more I want to say and there is so much more I want to contribute to that place. I don’t want to button it up and put it on the shelf. I want the next chapter to start, and that churning desire in me… I hope it came across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other candidates I met were (as expected) incredibly wonderful and talented. I don’t think I’ve been in better company, or at least felt spoiled to be in such good company since the beginning of college maybe. When everyone was fresh and atwitter with creative inspiration and potential. Truly amazing spirits doing The Good Work &amp; fighting The Good Fight. I want a chance to work with 12 of those individuals. I want a chance to encourage them and be encouraged. Standing in a place filled with such inspiring people, having amazing conversations… I really truly did not want it to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of the weekend griping over the SF job, but even in the short time I’ve been back (4 days) it’s been getting much better. I feel like I’m better equipped to enact the changes I want and I’m slowly pushing the job to be what I thirst for, based on some very poignant advice I got this weekend. But I still need to wiggle into an environment that will be responsive. I may be finding a way to cope with the situation now but I’m might burn out giving so much more of myself and feeling discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want my work to get better. I want to make better things. I want to continue to say ‘fuck you’ to the idea that I have to define my skill set. I want to have someone tear my ideas apart because the shreds that will be left will be the best parts. I want to make a fool out of myself. I want to laugh. I want to scorch my name INTO THE FUCKING EARTH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want this so achingly bad because in my beaten-down pessimistic-dreamer sort of way, I stopped believing something this amazing could really exist. Now that I know it does, now that I know what I’d be missing out, the waiting and the hoping is a million times harder.&lt;/p&gt;

I won’t be replying to non-essential work e-mails. I will be out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite the impossible-to-suppress bout of travel anxiety and slowly growing agoraphobia I’m rather excited! I get to see a new city, and drink good coffee and beer, and see one of my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I made the mistake of telling one of my fellow interns why I’m leaving, and telling the group today where I’m headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just in case it ever snakes around or gets blown out of proportion in the rumor mill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been told directly to “keep my options open” and that this internship doesn’t always lead to a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am taking a meeting for a program that starts after my loose contract ends here in San Francisco when, in my mind, I return to free agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This in no way means I am unhappy here or looking to jump ship immediately. I am just getting started here, and turning tail now would be so very against my nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it boils down to, though, is that this is when the meeting is, so this is when I’m going. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the record, I understand that for your professionalism you’re supposed to keep quiet when you’re looking to leave a job for any reason but this is an internship specifically. Until I have a signed contract and benefits, my loyalty is to my career overall and I think being expected to lie about it or conceal it is a shady practice. I will always be honest when asked out-right. It kind of sickens me that I’m worrying about having told my co-workers the simple truth of where I’m going this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I’m overreacting, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More vague updates during/after the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10505963230</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10505963230</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 22:28:00 -0400</pubDate><category>optimism</category><category>the internship</category><category>the program</category><category>postgrad</category><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category></item><item><title>Day 268 (slightly later) - It’s always darkest before the...</title><description>&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://assets.tumblr.com/swf/audio_player_black.swf?audio_file=http://www.tumblr.com/audio_file/10349718968/tumblr_lrpgbmW9551qfda96&amp;color=FFFFFF" height="27" width="207" quality="best"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 268 (slightly later) - It’s always darkest before the dawn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shake it Out” - Florence + the Machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am done with my graceless heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt; So tonight I’m gonna cut it out and then restart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt; Cause I like to keep my issues strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt; It’s always darkest before the dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exactly what I needed. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10349718968</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10349718968</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 02:21:00 -0400</pubDate><category>postgrad anthem</category><category>post-grad</category><category>post grad</category><category>song</category><category>music</category><category>tune</category><category>florence + the machine</category><category>florence welch</category><category>optimism</category></item><item><title>Day 268 - Sing me "Happy Birthday"</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of exciting things and a lot of not so exciting but still relevant things are happening for me right now and I really wish I could talk about them all candidly but part of using this blog as an outlet meant giving it up as a secret and now it’s circling back on me (I can’t very well use it as an outlet now that my cover’s blown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say that things are okay for me right now. Not great, but okay. Do I wish they were better? Yes. Do I wish getting out here had meant all the changes I’d like it to mean? Yes. But in a way, not having it mean anything in itself is really meaningful. I don’t mean to be cryptic. I’ll try to break it down the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out here I wanted to make a change in myself. I can be kind of cold when you first meet me, not out of shyness but literally out of rationale. It’s not like I have a social problem like someone with Asperger’s (I have empathy in spades) but the national awareness of conditions like that has helped other people respond to me better. I don’t think it’s necessary to make friends with someone when you first meet them. Most meaningful friendships in my life have come after I’ve gotten to know someone for awhile. The people I meet and quickly decide to be friends with are transient people, and not one of them remains for more than a year. So to me, I know if I meet someone and they lay there on the fringe of my social circle they hold the most potential for relationship investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you move to a new city and you start a new job do you have the luxury of waiting around to see what develops into a friendship? Or should I play up the falsity I can play up, where I fake it until I make it. Would I rather be liked immediately or be honest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;I guess by now I’ve decided on honest. I’ve met all the people I’m likely to meet at work, and I get along fine with everyone, but there isn’t a single person I’d really like to spend time with when the day is over. I look forward to crawling back to my studio alone and pouring myself into bed. I think. I have time to think. I have time to consider what’s wrong and right in my life philosophy. I have time to observe and process things that go on at work. Is a place that encourages this or that the place I want to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting in touch with my friends has helped much more this week. Video chats and quick conversations are not to be trifled with. It’s nice to know people care about you no matter how far or inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me, you know I’m not fond of my birthday. When I was a kid my birthday was always disasterous, my parties were always huge spectacular failures either literally or emotionally and when I got to college it only got worse. The entire week of my birthday I plunge into a funk, and I celebrate only after the actual date of my birth (the most I’ll do day-of is a pampering day or a relaxing one-on-one lunch date or something similar, nothing big). Since I’ve arrived in San Francisco it has felt like birthday funk week, that’s the best I can describe it. A suspended feeling of lurch, waiting for something ominous and deeply life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will it ever come? Am I missing it by assuming it’s all right to sit and wait?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come soon, I promise. I’ll get over my prudishness about mentioning details at some point and I’ll gush about the work and the work environment and about why I’m leaving the state on Thursday. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10348978273</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10348978273</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 01:50:00 -0400</pubDate><category>postgrad</category><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>postgradlife</category><category>The Internship</category></item><item><title>“Not Your Year” - The Weepies

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;I had a really shit day today. Actually, I had a pretty great day it just turned shit in the past half hour, and I am now dissolving into tears to this song because it’s the song I need after a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; bad day. When you don’t know what you’re doing and you don’t know why this is happening to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;em&gt;Maybe maybe it’s just not your year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10232708376</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10232708376</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2011 02:01:00 -0400</pubDate><category>postgrad anthem</category><category>postgrad</category><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>song</category><category>music</category><category>tune</category><category>the weepies</category><category>pessimism</category></item><item><title>The GOOD Guide to Hustlin'</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.good.is/tag/good-guide-to-hustlin"&gt;The GOOD Guide to Hustlin'&lt;/a&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10133240417</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/10133240417</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 15:37:19 -0400</pubDate><category>postgrad</category><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>optimism</category><category>recession</category><category>funemployment</category><category>link</category><category>wisdom</category><category>good magazine</category><category>good</category></item><item><title>Day 260 - Expectations vs. Reality</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling really overwhelmed. Today is my third day of the internship, my 6th day in San Francisco, and I’m already struck with that feeling that maybe this wasn’t the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gone through enough experiences to know that things that come easy aren’t really worth doing. “Labor pains” are a real aspect of life, as are “hard decisions.” I just wish I had gone more than a week before this thought settled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quitting. This is normal post-decision flux. I’m basically just lost in thought. I feel very alone and disconnected out here so far. I’m too tired to keep up with friends after I get out of work, and I feel like I should be home with my family not here on my own. And all this 9/11-10-year-anniversary-milking the media is going through is not helping my developing homesickness. I’m a very proud New Yorker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t help that I’m the only new person in the program right now, and the first in awhile, so I can’t tell if the skill discrepancy is due to prior knowledge or on the job training. Either way, I can tell that on a technical level the people I’m working with are much more trained than I am. I feel so homespun next to MFA and BFA holders. I feel  intimidated (not something I’m used to) and uncertain if I’ll be able to break out of assignments that are based in technical skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid I’m not making the right impression. I’m afraid my personality might be too abrasive. I’m afraid of breaking up a club that doesn’t want or need me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s only day three and there’s a lot more to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/9996014535</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/9996014535</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 11:24:41 -0400</pubDate><category>pessimism</category><category>optimism</category><category>The Internship</category><category>postgrad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>postgradlife</category><category>post grad</category></item><item><title>Day 252 - Making it*</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(*Tacking on to the theme of this morning’s link and this afternoon’s editorializing on that link)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you guys listen to podcasts? I really love podcasts. It’s an unhealthy love, I think. An addiction. When I was commuting I found I really couldn’t do much of anything except listen to an hour long podcast (usually &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Radiolab&lt;/em&gt;) and I’ve fallen out of the habit of listening to them but I got caught in a conversation about &lt;em&gt;the Nerdist&lt;/em&gt; and realized how behind I was in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, while I was downloading my back catalog I started trying a whole bunch of Nerdist Industries podcasts I’d never heard before including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/making-it-with-riki-lindhome/id451494319"&gt;Making it with Riki Lindhome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which is amazing for 3 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Riki was a supporting actor in my favorite show (of all time): &lt;em&gt;Pushing Daisies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riki is half of my favorite joke band &lt;a href="http://www.garfunkelandoates.com/"&gt;Garfunkel and Oates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The podcast is all about talking to people with awesome jobs about how they got there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really suggest subscribing to it. Give it a shot with episode 2 where Riki interviews &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2177528/"&gt;Kate Micucci&lt;/a&gt;, the other half of G&amp;O, who talks about her struggles to gain a footing in acting and how the DIY creation era we’re living in has really helped her (she is not only an actress and musician, but an artist, a comedianne, a writer, and everything in between). A taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KM&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no excuse to be sitting around and waiting for something to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RL:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you tell people when they ask you, when they’re just starting out, and they ask you what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KM:&lt;/strong&gt; I know you and I have talked about this but it’s so much of “make something and put it on YouTube.” That changed my life and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RL:&lt;/strong&gt; …it changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KM&lt;/strong&gt;: And it’s because, it’s so easy, it is so easy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RL:&lt;/strong&gt; You never know what it is that you put out there that might touch someone. You have to keep generating content.&lt;/p&gt;

Generation Limbo

“You have to make opportunities...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lquxneTQnm1qzf95do1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gabydunn.com/post/9673373770"&gt;gabydunn&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to make opportunities happen for yourself, and I think a lot  of my classmates weren’t thinking in that way,” he said. “It’s the  equivalent of setting up your own lemonade stand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is exactly why I started &lt;a href="http://100interviews.com"&gt;100 Interviews&lt;/a&gt;. You can’t just sit and complain and expect things to come to you post-grad without working hard. REALLY hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re passionate about something, beyond it being your college major, there is nothing to stop you from doing it. I did 100 Interviews while working a full-time job and doing comedy. And because people saw me working on journalism in my free time, I’ve had opportunities in journalism beyond what I would have ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can not say it enough. Make things happen for yourself. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one is going to hand it to you just because you have a degree.*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; If you love something, then just start doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update to this morning’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This. A million times over. Thank you, Gaby Dunn for putting my sentiment into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to what she’s saying… it doesn’t matter if you’re tending bar or working part time, if you want to work in a creative industry you MUST MUST MUST just keep doing your own stuff in your free time, passion projects will get you noticed, and it might be the only way. Work, keep working, and do it as hard as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Be undeniably good. When people ask me how do you make it in show business or whatever, what I always tell them and nobody ever takes note of it ‘cause it’s not the answer they wanted to hear — what they want to hear is here’s how you get an agent, here’s how you write a script, here’s how you do this — but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’ If somebody’s thinking, ‘How can I be really good?’, people are going to come to you. It’s much easier doing it that way than going to cocktail parties.”&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know your competition.&lt;/em&gt; Seriously think about your approach and what can make you different. Things that set you apart are almost always going to be positives when factoring into your chances. Whether it’s cold calling, sending a physical resume, sending a package, networking through fellow alumni, just figure out whatever other people applying to that job are doing and do something more in addition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be yourself.&lt;/em&gt; If you lie in an interview, not only is it bad karmic form but you’re likely transparent. And worst of all, if you are lying and the interviewer buys the lie, you’re both going to be unhappy when the working situation isn’t what was agreed upon in the interview. I took a risk in my last interview (the one that got me an offer) and explained some experience and why I omit it from my resume. I’m fairly certain this is what got me the job. So be genuine, it’s simple but so hard to forget in the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Form systems are unreliable and hard to beat.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re submitting your res in text form, they’re scanning for keywords, and the system decides if a person will even glance at your application. Think of it like a giant digital strainer, it sucks, but it will force you to include the right keywords in your resume. Don’t lie, but you can be hyper-specific. The better your descriptions, the better chance you have of beating that system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re stressed about an interview:&lt;/em&gt; Arrive a half-hour to an hour early, find the building, and then go get a cup of coffee. Knowing where you’re going will help relax you. List all the reasons why you are capable for the job (I suggest on paper), knowing and believing it in your head will help with your confidence. Right before you go in to the building, skip on the sidewalk. It’s a proven technique to break nerves (you can’t help but smile doing it!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find out how the interview went from a third party.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t personally like asking about salary in the interview. Given that most interview processes are at least 1-4 rounds long, I like to save it, but that question is a great way to get in touch with HR. Call or e-mail the department after your interview with questions you ‘forgot’ to mention (salary, start date, benefits, basically things HR would know better anyway) and see their reaction. 9 times out of 10 they will call your interviewer to get a good idea how serious of a candidate you are. Glean from their tone, excitement, niceties how well you did (it will be more telling than your interviewer’s “It was great meeting you, we’ll be in touch”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep baby powder in your bag on interview day.&lt;/em&gt; This tip is for the ladies, though if you’re a fella it applies as long as you’re willing to do it. It’s the perfect touch up deodorant, is smell-less under a fresh spritz of perfume/cologne, and acts as a great dry shampoo. For summer interviews it is a must must must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to age-old advice.&lt;/em&gt; You won’t find a single list of job-search rules that doesn’t list “make sure there are no typos on your res/cover letter,” “arrive early to your interview,” “ask questions in your interview,” and “research your interviewer if possible.” These are not bullshit, and you have probably ignored at least one of the rules at some point or another. Don’t. They are cliche for a reason. You will appear and feel way more prepared the more serious you take this whole process. Being half-assed about it will only give a half-assed impression… is that what you really want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be prepared.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re going for something creative, have a book and prepare it with care. I had to shell out $100+ for my book, the case and printing costs, and I keep it in a neoprene case to avoid scratches. When you take yourself seriously, and take your work seriously, they will (say it with me) take you seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be realistic about what you are suited for.&lt;/em&gt; This is so important. Aiming too high, or too low, will lead to disappointment. Figure out where you want to be in 20 years and think about how to start. You may not end up there in 20 years, but that means right now that corresponding entry level position is probably right for you. Don’t be afraid if it’s not at the company you want to be at eventually, most industries are encouraging of lateral hopping. Earn the title, then find the place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one is really an expert.&lt;/em&gt; Least of all me. Trust your gut above all else (see: Be Yourself, above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;*I kind of promised myself if I ever did a “tips” series that I would call it this. Because it’s fucking hilarious.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;**A degreed playlist is now in the works!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;***Thank you for reading. Thank you for asking.

I’m headed...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpxz4sTOdC1qfda96o1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 231 - The Easy Choice vs. The Right Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m headed to San Francisco. I will be interning for an advertising agency that has created some of my favorite ad work of the past few years, an agency that first made me realize that advertising could me more than a basic selling mechanism. It’s an agency responsible for one of the weirdest manias of the 1990s, and that is distancing itself from a repealed portion of the same campaign from just this year. It’s an agency that has proved its longevity, its dedication to fresh ideas, its vitality, and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they wanted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Day One, I’ll walk into the offices ready to give my all. I’m not moving out there for anything less than a stellar experience. Any job is only as good as the effort you put in to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying I’m not scared, and I’m not saying I didn’t almost take the job here in New York. If you had asked me a few days ago I would have told you I was staying (I told my parents and my closest friends this at least). But I was afraid to move across the country alone, and I was afraid of being homesick. I was afraid of being away from my family, a unit that I consider contains my best friends as well as those related to me, and which only recently became “whole” again with most members in touchable distance. I know a grand total of 5 people in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But saying no to the money and the ease of being here means saying yes to a whole new world of work and opportunity. I am only 21 years old and nothing about me or my decided upon career path is about sacrificing or settling for anything less than the best. If you took both choices and matched them up, SF vs. NY, the New York job won out in almost every category but career fuel. This internship is rocket grade. It has the potential to sling shot me into the top tier of agencies, of work, of job titles; which made this decision so very difficult. The comfort zone vs. the stratosphere. Admittedly, I have the incredible good fortune of having parents who are supportive and amazing about this. I really couldn’t even consider turning down the job without them behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my t’s are crossed and my i’s are dotted and my fate is (pretty much) sealed. Starting September 3rd and until the end of 2011, I’ll be on the opposite coast chasing down my dreams for the next chapter of this saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck, I think I’m gonna need it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8935971505</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8935971505</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2011 23:02:00 -0400</pubDate><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>postgrad</category><category>optimism</category></item><item><title>Day 226 - Pro/Con</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been the craziest week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the exposure generated by one little piece in an industry blog got me enough attention to make real changes in my life. I got offered the perfect internship with a traditional agency that influenced how I first began to think about advertising when I was a kid. The opportunity requires a cross-country move, and being in debt to my parents, but the opportunity is worth the struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I finished the interview process for a job I was called in for before all this crazy mess. The vacancy is at a digital agency here in New York. Today, I was offered the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I’ll be working in the creative side of an ad agency, and it just feels… amazing that all this hard work is paying off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I’ll be sitting down to craft a huge pro/con list. I’ll attempt to compare qualities that don’t compare directly, and I’ll attempt to make a decision. My mind already is protesting the work. Any perspective is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job interviews: &lt;/b&gt;10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job offers: &lt;/b&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8715134043</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8715134043</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2011 21:45:00 -0400</pubDate><category>Postgrad</category><category>Post grad</category><category>Post-grad</category><category>Interviews</category><category>Job interview</category><category>Funemployment</category></item><item><title>Are you only applying in NYC? Try Baltimore, Boston and DC.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have mainly been applying in NYC because I’m local and the interview process goes much smoother when you can hop on a train and be in the offices within two hours but I am absolutely willing to relocate for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to school in Boston, so I’ve applied to most of the agencies I’m interested in there already. Granted, it was before I started this new approach and before I had a little bit of buzz going (it was basically just system applying/resume sending). My problem with Boston firms was that the design agencies were pretty strict about having to have a degree in design, and Boston agencies on a whole have a general lack of ambition (with the notable exception of a handful). When the nibbles I had didn’t pan out, like most post-grads I had to move back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I haven’t looked into the mid-Atlantic region as much as I probably should. Research is in my future! Thanks for the tip, Anon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8520788969</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8520788969</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2011 14:02:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Day 218 - Everything’s coming up Milhouse*
I don’t...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp9mnmOGaH1qfda96o1_r1_500.png"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 218 - Everything’s coming up Milhouse*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go to portfolio school. I gave myself the rough deadline of 6 months after graduation before I would begin thinking about post-grad academia (including portfolio and grad schools) but somehow I just can’t keep the thought process sustained. I went to info sessions for Miami Ad and for Creative Circus when I was an undergraduate and I suppose I was just upset that their standards for admission were so low. A rep from Miami Ad actually told me that you don’t need to know anything about art direction or design before joining the school, that you could study something totally different in your undergrad and come to the program with a whim and zero skills. The thought of being in a class filled with people like that irks me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave myself six months to go on interviews and try to get full-time work without the added line on my resume and I feel like the decision has been proven appropriately prudent; in interviews it’s been mentioned my portfolio is comparable to someone who has attended a program. But I’ve become more aware there is one school I’d like to attend… WK12 at Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, Oregon. It would mean a move across the country and a total and utter leap of faith but goddamn I want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the approach I talked about &lt;a href="http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/6780837586/day-177-and-now-for-something-completely"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and started compiling an interactive cover letter, tossing together bits and pieces about me, my likes, and my work. I had a photoshoot in my dining room that I had to basically scrap and start over with (lesson learned: I am not a photographer) and I had to rely on my least favorite design trope, the drop shadow, but by golly I used my remedial CSS and I made it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/agencyspy/girl-spoofs-wk-12-site-with-hopes-of-getting-in_b21422"&gt;I got a write up&lt;/a&gt; in (my favorite) advertising blog &lt;em&gt;Agency Spy&lt;/em&gt; for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what this means, and applications are still open so it’s not as though I expect to hear anything official but it’s really rewarding to just have it out there being seen. Being seen by people other than the intended audience. Being poked around and played with. I am slightly blushing at the thought that I’m publicly displaying a TARDIS and featuring a 5-minute long &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; clip but WHATEVER. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I had an interview postponed on me at the last minute (I was already on the train en route) and I felt like crap. I kept saying “something’s gotta give” because I am getting pretty tired of chasing this dream that I’ve had forever and it’s getting to the point where I’m thinking I should consider shelving it for now. And then this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what the outcome–and I mean that sincerely–I’m just happy with the way this project turned out and over the moon about the blog posting. It feels really good to be validated, even if it’s only a teeny tiny transitory bit.&lt;/p&gt;

You did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you tell me the news, I may feel gob-smacked, but you have to let me recover. In the end, I am happy for you. Let’s celebrate! We’ve been on this post-grad walk of life together and you’ve reached the promised land. Well, I should say “your” promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any job search, especially this first one, you should never ever compare yourself to someone else. It’s so important to work on you and focus on your goals and try not to worry when people all around you are getting hired. Your industry is likely different, your skill set is likely different, and you’re a different person. It’s comforting to accept it as a coping mechanism for life in general but if you apply it to only one thing, it should be this. It is a good sign that anyone is getting hired at an entry-level, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to my friends who have found their promised land. Their full-time job. I want to take a moment to discuss a few things with you, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t start using the Royal “We” when you describe drug tests you have to go through, vacations you want to go on, the hours you’ve been toiling, or the commute that is killing you. I am not hired yet. You are fully aware of this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I promise only to be as gracious as you are when you talk about any of the following: salary, perks of the job, cute guys in the office, work travel, celebrities you brush with, etc. The more you brag, the more my patience wears thin. I am excited for you but the excitement does have a ceiling. Please don’t make me reach it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please do not forget about your unemployed friends. You do not need to buy me dinner when we meet, you do not need to pay for my beers, but you do need to call me every once in awhile. I realize your schedule is more hectic than mine and my lack of calling is called ‘giving you space to adjust to your new schedule’. If you want to meet for a drink after work, on occasion I’d be happy to come in to the city and meet you. All you need to do is ask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget what it’s like on this side. Don’t forget the crippling rejection of a job you wished for slipping through your hands. Don’t forget the gnawing anxiety of living with your parents. Don’t forget the laugh-to-keep-from-crying hysteria of filling the hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, and most importantly, your strategy for getting hired is yours. We all have taken different approaches and we are (see above) different people. I’m happy you got a job you feel comfortable with taking. It’s a possibility that I have been holding out for more. Smugness and condescension suit absolutely no one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signed,&lt;br/&gt; Your still-searching friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8093803108</link><guid>http://degreed.tumblr.com/post/8093803108</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2011 14:37:00 -0400</pubDate><category>optimism</category><category>post grad</category><category>post-grad</category><category>postgrad</category><category>postgradlife</category><category>funemployed</category><category>funemployment</category></item><item><title>Day 211 (barely) - Killing it rn </title><description>&lt;p&gt;Items ingested, in order, in my kitchen, at 3:00am, as a mid-project snack:&lt;/p&gt;
