Also in the car are a child size backpack and a seatbelt that’s been cut away, leading to thoughts of a kidnapping. When Brennan confirms that the woman gave birth 5-8 years ago, Booth pressures her for a guess at any hint to the woman’s identify so that they can try to find the child. <span
id="more-43621"></span>Brennan says she was most likely an eastern European who immigrated about 10 years ago and Angela does a facial reconstruction. They run the reconstruction against similar photos and they spot a match: Paulina Decker, recently separated from Carl Decker, one child: Donovan Dimitri Decker. Booth and Brennan head to his house, but from the look of dust on everything, he’s been gone a while. Booth spots some surveillance and discovers that they’re U.S. Marshals. Decker is a witness in a federal case against his former employer, an armor company. He’s in a safe house and the feds don’t wants him to know about his wife and son, fearing that he’ll back out on his testimony.</p><p>Since they can’t talk with Carl, Booth and Brennan pay a visit to Paulina’s sister, who Paulina and Donovan were staying with. Sister says that Carl was cold and angry and that Paulina thought he was having an affair. When they visit Carl’s bosses at KBC, the company says that Carl was paranoid and alienated everyone he worked with so they had him investigated. Carl was alleging that the company knew that armor it sent to U.S. troops was faulty, but the big boss says he would never risk the lives of soldiers… he was a ranger himself.</p><p>Brennan’s team discovered that Paulina was already dead when she was burned, but was electrocuted and tortured before she was killed, possibly to the point of seizures. When Decker can’t talk to his son (a condition of his testimony), Decker runs from the witness protection handlers. The Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Weeks thinks that KBC put a hit on him and his family. Knowing, via father’s instinct, that Decker will be heading to KBC to take them out first, Booth heads there and finds Decker holding the CEO at gunpoint, demanding the man make the call to release his son. Brennan, via genius to genius communication, tries to talk to Decker rationally. He puts down his gun, but says that they took away his son’s best chance.</p><p>Back in an interrogation room, Decker reveals that he feels like he’s responsible for the soldiers dying. He knows, analytically, that the soldiers’ lives are worth more than his son’s, but he can’t let his son die… he’ll shut up to save him. The only way he’ll testify is if he sees Booth recover his son. He gives Booth their code word: Paladin. A piece of mail arrives for Booth: a note saying “Back off” and a child-sized finger in a box. Brennan confirms that it belongs to an 8-year-old boy and Booth pressures her to work her magic and figure out where he is, if he’s still alive. Brennan responds to his desperation by saying that he was still alive when the finger was cut off. It was cut with a hatchet on a wooden surface and chemicals lead her to think it was a mechanic’s bench. She tells him to look for abandoned gas stations that are off the grid.</p><p>Booth pinpoints a rural station fitting that description and calls in SWAT backup. Booth lays out the plan: he’s going in first, straight for the kid. Brennan wants to help (seriously, Brennan, I love you, but HOW?) but Booth tells her to hang back. They head in and we see Booth the marksman in action and he is good. He spots the crying child and tells him not to look at the (now dead) men anymore. Donovan freaks out, but Booth says “paladin” and Donovan calms down and lets Booth carry him out. Outside, the EMTs check him out and bandage his hand as his father arrives and breaks down crying.</p><p>In the B-story, a woman from the CIA is performing a security review of the Jeffersonian employees. We find out that Angela has a husband she married on some island and didn’t think was a legal ceremony (I love how that comes back later in the series). Hodgins is offended that the CIA deems him to be harmless and doesn’t need to review him right then. Zack is adamant that he couldn’t be bribed or threatened to reveal confidential info, but with a reasoned argument and after he checked with Angela and Brennan and Booth and maybe Hodgins… the woman stops listening. Dr. Adams is grilled about an environmentalist that it’s implied he has an illicit sexual relationship with. He assures the investigator that he’s faithful and that he and Lily Marsden just enjoy arguing.</p><p>Brennan’s review is an exercise in awesomeness. The interviewer asks why she was in Cuba and Brennan responds by asking her security clearance. Interviewer asks if she met with Juan Guzman. Rather than answer her question, Brennan calls someone and hands the phone to the woman. We hear the woman say “Yes, sir… yes… I’ll wait here.” Brennan asks if there are any more questions and the woman reveals that the entire review has been disbanded. She’s to wait there until someone comes to destroy her notes. Brennan is a bad ass.</p><p>In the C-plot, the child-centric case reveals that Brennan is against the concept of having children. She especially doesn’t understand how Booth, of all people, knowing what happens in this world, could bring children into it. She touches a sore spot when she suggests that it was an accident. Booth tells her that she’ll change her mind someday.</p><p> </p><p> <br

Because, trust me, if the end of this season doesn’t leave you a sobbing mess, well, I just don’t know.</p><p>As the police gawk at the unphotographable Mitchell, he pleads with Annie to help him get out. She doesn’t want him to get out, though. He tells her that he isn’t the same person who killed the Box Tunnel 20; he’s trying to stay human. He explains that’s why he left Herrick alive and reveals the “Wolf-Shaped Bullet” prophecy to Annie. Annie reminds him that she, of all people, wouldn’t think it was worth it. The victims need their justice. Herrick, in all his Vampire goodness, arrives and breaks Mitchell out. Annie pleads with Mitchell to stay, but he explains that he needs the secret from Herrick. Before he can get it, though, Herrick knocks him out. <span
id="more-41591"></span></p><p>At the house, Tom arrives looking for McNair and finds the bodies of Reed, Nina, and McNair. He calls it in and Annie overhears the call in the station. She pops over to the hospital, where Nina is being worked on. Turns out, Herrick only stabbed her, he didn’t snap her neck like I thought last week. As Annie looks around the room, one of the police offices from the scene flatlines. Instead of his door appearing, his bloody body sits up and sings, to the tune of “Three Blind Mice:”</p><blockquote><p>What’s that barking/It’s all starting. Like a row/of dominoes. Can you stop them falling/Someone’s due a mauling. Here it comes/the wolf-shaped gun. Annie, listen/here’s your mission. Mitchell’s toast/if you’re a scaredy-ghost. Come to purgatory/stop shit getting gory. Or the big bow wow/ends his story now.</p></blockquote><p>The door appears for the young cop and Annie says she’ll go with him.</p><p>As Tom buries McNair’s body, we hear the letter he wrote before the moon:</p><blockquote><p>Tom, if you’re reading this, then I’m dead. Somewhere in this house is a vampire. He’s the one I’ve always been searching for. He was there when I became this creature. And tonight, I tried to kill him. If I had, I would have been able to stop. But I wasn’t doing this for me. Or the man I killed two months ago. Or even your parents. This was for you. My Tom. This must be the final act. Tom, I want you to live a different life now. One that’s decent. You see, we’ve lost everything that was harmless and mundane. When I sat down to write this I realized I’d forgotten how to hold a pen. It’s so long since I did something so ordinary. I was selfish. I turned you into a weapon for my own war. The things I’ve asked you to do, they make me ashamed. Let it end. I want you to be home now. Stop this chaotic, violent life. Make this the end of that story. I die tonight, but don’t avenge me. It’s getting dark. I have to go. Always know that I love you, Tom. I wish I really had been your father. Your comrade, Anthony Michael McNair.</p></blockquote><p>Mitchell wakes up in the wolf fight cage. A precaution, Herrick explains. He doesn’t know where Mitchell’s loyalties lie: one minute, he’s letting George kill Herrick and the next, he’s massacring 20 people. Herrick wants to pick up where he left off, but he needs to know that Mitchell will be at his side. See, Herrick’s got a plan: he’s going to get rid of the werewolves, then the ghosts. Mitchell tells him to do whatever he wants; he knows his normal life with Annie and George is over. Herrick accuses him of saying whatever will get him out of the cage and Mitchell says that finally, Herrick has it figured out. Mitchell’s always been an opportunist; always done whatever it takes to survive. Vampires piss him off, so he runs to humanity. Humans betray him, so he slaughters a bunch of them. He can be the villain if that’s what he needs to be. “There’ll come a day when one of us finally kills the other,” Herrick says. Mitchell says it won’t be today and Herrick wants him to prove it. He has George brought into the cage.</p><p>In purgatory, Lia finds Annie and says she sent the message. She leads Annie into a room where they can see Mitchell and Herrick on the screen. Annie is horrified when she realizes that George is the Bullet. She wants to go help them, but Lia won’t let her. Annie asks Lia what’s going on and Lia reveals that she made it all up. She wanted revenge, wanted to punish Mitchell, so she wanted to drive a wedge between the two men. The prophecy was never real, but Mitchell’s made it into a self-fulfilling one.</p><p>Mitchell tells Herrick that he’s got the dates wrong, but quickly realizes that Herrick wants them to fight mano-a-mano. Herrick reveals to George that Mitchell killed the Box Tunnel 20, but Herrick is disappointed to find that George isn’t surprised. Herrick starts telling George how Mitchell was trying to get him to turn back; oh, and by the way, he killed McNair. Oh, and left Nina for dead, too. Mitchell shakes his head. George shakes the cage and screams in agony. Herrick explains that by leading Reed to him, Mitchell lit the fuse and then walked away. Mitchell tells George not to listen to Herrick, but George runs at him and attacks him as Mitchell apologizes. Mitchell realizes that George is the bullet as Herrick throws a wood stake in the cage. Tom enters the fray, though, and is about to kill Herrick, but Mitchell holds George at point in return. Tom lets Herrick go and Mitchell ushers Herrick away, telling him that Herrick needs to kill George publicly, make a statement. Mitchell lets George out and promises to kill Herrick, but explains that he needs to know something first. George tells him to shut up. “You don’t say my name now, you don’t even look at me now. You are not my friend. You’d better go. Your boss is waiting.”</p><p>Annie turns the TV off and asks Lia why she was brought here. Lia says that it was still to punish Mitchell, to deprive him of Annie. Annie realizes she was a weapon, too, in this game of Lia’s. Lia corrects Annie: it was revenge. It was setting the world straight agin. She explains that they’re in her room, what effect her death had on her parents, her brother: she did this for him. Annie asks about Nina. Collateral damage, Lia shrugs. Annie changes tactics, says what the hell, besides, when Nina gets there, she’ll need a friendly face. And they’ll have to watch George now that he’s lost Nina and the baby; watch him turn hard. She tells Lia that George, Nina and the baby are like her comrades— the last victims of the Box Tunnel Massacre. Lia is hurt and Annie tells Lia that she’s out of her depth. Grief and revenge aren’t things to get drunk on. Lia doesn’t know how to undo everything. Annie tells her to let her go back and see Nina, who hasn’t arrived yet. Lia doesn’t want to be alone, so Annie tells her to find Gilbert.</p><p>Back in the ward, Annie strokes Nina’s hair and whispers in her ear. Nina jolts and breathes in. George arrives with Tom and he and Annie share a smile as he’s pushed back out by the nurses.</p><p>Man, this is a packed episode. We’re not even remotely done yet.</p><p>Herrick and Mitchell sit in a car. Herrick says that it’s all just beginning. He guesses it’s about time he explains the trick. He got lucky; if he’d been staked, there’s no way back from that. Mitchell stops him. He doesn’t want to know anymore. Herrick wants to head back to England, but Mitchell wants to show him something first. They look out on a sunrise over a rocky beach and Herrick remarks that the world will soon be theirs. “Don’t you understand? It always was,” Mitchell says as he stakes Herrick. Herrick smiles as he turns to dust.</p><p>At a police station, a well-dressed team enters. The Main Man quiets everyone down and turns on a walkie-talkie, which is broadcasting an altercation. Main Man informs them all that was the Box Tunnel 20 killer going down; someone else did their job. They’re all fired. Someone asks who he is and he introduces himself as Edgar Wyndham: “I’m from Head Office. I am the man from Del Monte. I am the wrath of God.”</p><p>At the house, George and Annie sit and read about the person who went down for Mitchell’s crime. Nina is in the kitchen making some tea. Annie can’t believe how quickly she’s recovered, and how much she’s showing. George sees Mitchell outside. The former roommate comes in and Annie explains that they can’t go back to the way they were. Mitchell knows. He takes out a stake and asks George to kill him. Annie tells him that Lia made it up, there’s no wolf-shaped bullet, but Mitchell knows it doesn’t matter. He’ll kill again, he needs to be stopped. Nina asks why he can’t do it himself and Mitchell says that it has to be the final piece of George’s story with him. Nina calls bullshit on the dramatics, but Mitchell reiterates, “He has to kill me because he has to disown me.” George takes Annie and Nina into the kitchen and Annie says that Mitchell’s right, he’s a ticking time bomb. The girls are for it, but George isn’t, suggesting they just exile him. Annie says that letting him go is still a decision. George goes out to Mitchell and asks where Herrick is. Mitchell explains that he’s proper dead. George asks what Mitchell sees when he looks at him.</p><blockquote><p>Mitchell: My friend.<br
/> George: That’s good.<br
/> Mitchell: A werewolf.<br
/> George: Okay.<br
/> Mitchell: I want to pull your spine out through your mouth.<br
/> George: What’s happened to you?<br
/> Mitchell: It won.<br
/> George: So who am I talking to?<br
/> Mitchell: An echo.</p></blockquote><p>George suggests Scotland, keeping him in the attic, forgiving him. Mitchell says it’s not George’s place to forgive him. He tells George that it would be heroic. He tells George that he was using him, taunts him, tells George that he betrayed humanity just to have a roommate. George asks if Mitchell really wants him to believe this. Mitchell breaks: “No. Of course not. Oh please, George. God, I can see their faces! Not just the people I’ve killed but the people I’m going to kill. I’m so scared. I want to tear my eyes out. Is it going to be another train next time? Oh, Jesus, or a school? It’s all so inevitable. Please do it. Please. You need to stop me. And if you can’t do it for me you have to do it for them. Please. Please.”</p><p>Nina and Annie are with the boys now and they cry as they nod at George. George tells Mitchell to stand up and asks if this is really happening. Mitchell assures him, “This is a good thing you’re doing. That stuff I said is not you. Remember once I told you that anything that happened would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if it wasn’t for you two.” To Nina: “Look after him. And look after the baby. I guess I’m finally doing the decent thing.” Nina tells him this is what they’ll remember. Annie goes in for one last kiss. Mitchell tells her that she was the love of his life and she returns the sentiment. He thanks all of them for making him human and takes his jacket off. As George pulls his arm back to stake Mitchell, a nursery rhyme comes over a bullhorn. Wyndham enters. Mitchell explains that he’s with the old ones (and he’s clearly learned the secret of not having to be invited in). Wyndham tells Mitchell that the old ones think that Mitchell needs to stay alive, that he could be useful.</p><blockquote><p>You’re going to dance for me. You are going to kill and rampage. {to George} You are going to be my attack dog. And the day that you say no is the day that I crucify George and Nina. In Regents Park. What about the rest of you. What about Annie. Now, I think you’re more powerful than you imagine so I’m going to keep you around. Besides, there are going to be a lot more ghosts. And then there are the history makers. A werewolf impregnated by another werewolf. We’ve never seen the like. The others want you culled. I’m the curious type. I want to see exactly what it is that’s going to pop out. But there’s something I want you to do in return. I want you to pass on a message. To every werewolf, every ghost, every vampire that you meet. You tell them the world is under new management now. It is year dot. You tell them this. The age of the vampires has begun.</p></blockquote><p>George picks the stake back up and stares down an incredulous Wyndham. “I’m doing this because I love you,” he says to Mitchell. Mitchell Han Solos it with an “I know,” as George turns and stakes him. George, Nina, and Annie face Wyndham. “I think you’ve got a fight on your hands.”</p><p>While I knew that Aidan Turner would be leaving the show, it didn’t make the way he left any less emotional. It is somewhat infuriating that our family has been torn apart by one revenge-filled young woman, but Mitchell did have a lot to make up for.</p><p>I can’t wait to see where they go in season four… a werewolf baby and the introduction of the Old Ones? I’ll be watching.</p><p><em>Transcript Quotes Courtesy <a

There are balloons, he’s dressed as a ringleader, it’s very circus-like. In the cage, a man in a suit cowers in the corner as a naked man lays in the middle of the floor, dead. Herrick is at a loss because this is just so unusual. We see that the man in the suit is McNair. They put him, an ordinary human, up against the werewolf and somehow, McNair won. Herrick acknowledges that it’s a lot to take in, realizing that monsters are real and humans are just allowed to exist in their world. Herrick is impressed with the man and his ability to survive unharmed. McNair says that he wasn’t unharmed as he shows Herrick the scratch. “Oops,” Herrick replies as he starts laughing. <span
id="more-40845"></span></p><p>Back in the present, Mitchell is still trying to convince Annie that giving up Daisy as the Box Tunnel killer is a bad idea. He describes it as First Contact. There’s no infrastructure to sort it out now. Annie asks what if it was her on that train, dead. Mitchell replies that he’d tear the world apart. “That’s the correct answer.”</p><p>Reed sees her boss and tells him about Daisy, but the only Daisy Hannigan-Spitare she could find died in an air raid in 1941. She thinks Mitchell’s concealing something and tells her boss about the scrapbook. Annie, who has been eavesdropping, is shocked to hear about it. Boss tells her that they have a list of suspects with a history of violence; arrest one of them or get fired, basically.</p><p>At home, Nina shaves Herrick. He asks if she trusts Mitchell, as he’s been telling the man that he’s a vampire. Herrick reveals that he could hear the woman’s blood, which doesn’t happen with Nina, George, or Annie. Nina tells him that whatever he is, it doesn’t have to define him. Herrick says he’s hunger now, that’s all he is. He has dark desires and can’t sleep. Nina tells him not to become comfortable in this house: “Stay separate, stay appalled.” He tells her that he showed Reed the scrapbook. Nina is conflicted.</p><p>Downstairs, McNair and Tom arrive and McNair is injured. He says it was vampires, payback for the dogfight. He’s surprised that they haven’t come for Nina and George yet. He says they must be off-limits because of the poster boy they live with. McNair notices Nina’s demeanor and says something’s changed. Besides the fact that she appears to be showing already. Nina shrugs it off.</p><p>George tells Tom that he should be living up his twenties, not traveling around killing vampires. He offers to let him stay there, but Tom doesn’t think McNair would like that. When they rejoin the others, McNair says that they should maybe stay a while. It’s a full moon tonight and he’ll change in the basement, since he’s injured.</p><p>Annie is in the bathroom with Reed and she’s rationalizing the scrapbook. She thinks that Mitchell must be investigating it himself, since there’s no infrastructure, of course. Reed resolves herself to get John Mitchell. Annie says that’s great. Sort of.</p><p>Mitchell arrives home and sees Tom and McNair. George says they’ve got guests. Mitchell says it’s fine and heads upstairs. Annie tells him not to go far. Mitchell goes to see Herrick; it’s a full moon and tonight is standing room only for wolves, so he wants to know how Herrick came back to life. Herrick freaks out at the riddles, he doesn’t know what Mitchell wants from him. Mitchell knows there’s one way to bring him back, but he won’t do that. Yet.</p><p>Annie tells George and Nina that she knows who did the Box Tunnel killings, Daisy. George is shocked and then says, “Who?” Nina asks about the scrapbook. Annie says that was him investigating, that’s what vampires do. Nina is shocked that he didn’t do it. George is shocked that it was Daisy, but says that it makes sense. She was pretty wild, surprisingly strong, and nimble. Nina reminds him that they can hear him.</p><p>Mitchell comes downstairs and finds Reed back again. She asks about the scrapbook. He says it wasn’t him. He explains about Graham putting it together, he thought it was gross. Says he burnt it. Annie wonders why he didn’t just say. Upstairs, Herrick wakes from his sleep because he hears Reed’s blood. Reed wants to talk about Daisy now and asks why he gave them the name of someone who died 70 years ago. Mitchell says she was a fantasist, always coming up with stuff. Reed says he’s dicking her around. She knows because of his body language and speech. She wants to speak to Uncle Billy again. Mitchell says it’s not a good idea. She says she doesn’t bite. Mitchell changes his mind and goes to make sure Billy is presentable. Herrick doesn’t want to speak to her; he can’t be trusted. “The first time we met we were soldiers,” Mitchell tells Herrick. “Men have to do things that they never dream of. Things that seem terrible, but in a war, these things seem heroic, they can save lives.” Herrick says they’re not in a war, but Mitchell insists that they are. Tells him that things that seem bad are actually brave. Herrick implores him to keep the woman away. Mitchell tells him to be brave enough to let nature take its course.</p><p>Outside, Annie asks what he’s doing. Tells him to give up Daisy. He says if that happens, everything ends and that he’s dealing with it. Downstairs, Nina confesses to Reed that she’s the one that reported him to the help line; she got the wrong end of the stick. She gives her Daisy’s name again. Reed points out she died in 1941 and doesn’t like that people in this house keep lying to her. Mitchell takes Reed upstairs to Herrick. As soon as he closes the door, he’s wracked with guilt. Reed talks to Herrick, but all he hears is blood pounding as he comes closer to her. Mitchell pulls her out of the room, just as Herrick’s teeth come out. Mitchell says that Billy’s not in the right state and she needs to come back some other time. On her way out, Reed grabs a glass she’s handed to Mitchell earlier and puts it in a fingerprint bag.</p><p>The wolves get ready for the moon that night, George and Tom by getting the chickens ready and Nina by tidying up and checking out her definitely showing belly. George, Nina and Tom head out for the night as McNair stays at the house. After Annie pops away, McNair writes a note.</p><p>Reed (followed by Annie), heads down to where the Boxcar is stored to meet up with Agent Cooper, who has the results on the fingerprints. He found two matches: Sheffield, 1960, which seems unlikely, and the Box Tunnel Massacre. Annie says that’s can’t be true. Cooper says that the prints were in some of the blood; he was definitely around post mortem, so he has to be the guy. Cooper says he suspects the concern is she’ll find something else. And then he punches her. I did not see that coming.</p><p>Mitchell comes home and calls out to see if anyone’s there. No one answers so he relaxes, sighs, “Prophecy, my ass,” and grabs a beer. He sits down as McNair comes from around the corner and puts on his vampire killing necklace before heading upstairs.</p><p>Cooper explains that they’ve gone to a lot of trouble covering this up. Mitchell really made a mess of this one. He says she’s good at what she does and they generally like that, but just went too far. She says she’s arresting him and he says she’s not really getting this. They can’t really be arrested. Says her friend the ghost left her, too. Cooper comes around the corner for her but he reveals that he won’t kill her; she’s been head-hunted. Evolutionary promotion. Annie pops up behind him and stakes him.</p><p>McNair enters Herrick’s room. Says he would never forget that scent. Herrick says he’ll scream and Mitchell will come. McNair says that’s the plan: two for one. He tells Herrick about all the teeth on his necklace: Marco, Daisy, the open space is for him. Herrick says he’s not the same man. McNair starts to change. Mitchell takes a look at the board and snarks, “Look at me, I’m a saint,” before leaving. Upstairs, McNair changes in front of a terrified Herrick. Herrick holds his knife out (that he snuck earlier while Nina was changing the sheets) as McNairWolf charges him.</p><p>Nina and George head to the hospital in the morning to see if they can get snuck in for an ultrasound. Nina says she’s 8 weeks, but the doctor says that can’t be right, she must be at least 16. Or having a giant. Uh-oh.</p><p>Mitchell comes home as Reed waits outside in her car. Mitchell senses something isn’t right and runs upstairs. McNair’s naked dead body lays on the ground. Herrick says that McNair became a monster and attacked him. Downstairs, Reed calls in for an assist to arrest John Mitchell. Mitchell runs down and sees Annie, who says she knows. She asks if Daisy was even involved. He says yeah, but it was his idea. She says that’s the most honest thing he’s said in months. She is heartbroken: “There was this cancer in between them and you let me fall in love with you.” She explains how she killed a vampire; she never killed even a fly before. “It spreads, Mitchell, what you’ve done is contaminated us all.” Annie tells him to turn himself in. She knows there’s still good in him from all the help he gave Sasha and Adam and Tom.  He says everything would be torn apart, the entire world. Annie says she’ll stay with him. Mitchell says it’s not about punishment, he wants to be punished, but it can’t happen like this. The police bang on the door. Mitchell tells her to get him out of there. If they arrest him, he’ll have to kill them all. She says he has to do this for her. The police burst in and he runs. He tells them to let him go or he kills everyone in this room. Annie begs for him to let this happen. He surrenders. Reed comes in and places him under arrest. He tells her she has no idea what she’s done. But he could be speaking to Annie, too. After he’s taken away, Reed goes back in the house and laughs, relieved. Then she thinks about the attic and asks if anyone’s checked. She goes up there and sees McNair’s body just before she’s attacked by Herrick.</p><p>Mitchell is brought into the station and the police heckle him. Mitchell tells the guy checking him in that he can’t do this, it can’t happen like this, not in Wales. Guy asks where Reed is; this is her collar, after all.</p><p>In the attic, Herrick is covered in blood as he leans down next to Reed’s body.</p><p>Nina and George walk home. Wolf gestations are shorter, so maybe that’s what’s happening, they speculate. They find the police tape and Nina says they’ve come for Mitchell. She reveals that she reported him and apologizes. George freaks out that they’ll take his photo. He says she’s put them all in danger and goes to get Mitchell from the station. Nina wants to come, but George says she’s going nowhere near him.</p><p>At the station, they fingerprint and DNA swab Mitchell. Guy says no one’s answering their radio at the house. And it’s time for Mitchell’s picture.</p><p>Nina enters the house, and calls out for anyone, but there’s no one. She doesn’t see the dead bodies in the living room. She goes to the kitchen and behind her is Herrick in a police outfit. He says he has something of a dilemma and we can tell by his voice that the old Herrick is back. She asks why he’s wearing that. He says that her boyfriend tore him, literally, limb from limb, so undignified. Nina realizes what’s happened as he grabs her by the throat. Herrick describes the pain, says he wants George to suffer now. For days, weeks, months; obviously, the best way is to kill her. His dilemma: she was kind to him. Her lets her go. “My quarrel is not with you,” he explains as he leaves. Nina breathes for a moment, but Herrick comes back in the side door and snaps her neck. NOOOO!!!!!!</p><p>The police fight with Mitchell to get him in place for his picture. As the camera flashes and takes his picture, he sighs “Oh, God.”</p><p>Nina’s (presumed) death is definitely one of the most shocking moments in this entire series for me. While it’s totally in character for Herrick as we knew him, I just didn’t think they’d lose Nina. While I’m sure they’ll find a way out of the whole “Mitchell’s arrest revealing the vampire world,” it does seem like there’s no way back from this point for the characters. I can’t wait to see what happens in the finale episode.<br

Mitchell wanted to turn someone that wasn’t exactly quality material. Herrick lectures him about choosing who he turns carefully: building proteges, heirs, secret keepers, even saviors to bring you back from death.<span
id="more-40285"></span></p><p>Back in the present day, Mitchell has momentarily switched from his plan of trying to kill Herrick to trying to make him better. He feeds Herrick some of his own blood, in the hopes it will bring his memories back, but it’s not enough; he needs human blood. Coincidentally, Nancy Reed, a detective investigating anonymous leads on the box tunnel massacre, arrives and she’s hurt her knee on her way up the steps. Nina cleans her up in the bathroom and Herrick can smell the blood, even going to suck on the bloody tissues once she leaves.</p><p>After she gets cleaned up, she asks to speak to Mitchell. An anonymous tip was called in that he might know something about the murders, but he denies any knowledge. Nina stares at him as Reed announces that she’s done there. As Mitchell walks her to the door, Annie wonders who would have given them Mitchell’s name. Nina suspects they’ll never know, but Annie thinks that Mitchell will want to find out. On the contrary, though, Annie’s the one obsessed with it and Mitchell wants her to drop it. She knows that he’s holding something inside and she gets him to open up about Daisy. Instead of confessing, though, he makes it sound like Daisy did it by herself. He doesn’t want to turn her in because it would shed light on the vampire world.</p><p>Annie, being Annie, won’t let it go and eavesdrops on Detective Reed as she works. Reed is pleading with her boss to let her check John Mitchell out again, but her boss thinks it’s a dead end and puts her on desk duty. Annie checks out Reed’s case board and notices Lia’s face as one of the box tunnel victims. When Annie shows the picture to Mitchell, he says he doesn’t recognize her. Annie explains that she was in purgatory and that she thinks she needs to help Reed solve the case for Lia. She’s left a Post-it at Reed’s desk saying, “Ask John Mitchell what Daisy did.”</p><p>Detective Reed pays Mitchell another visit and asks about Daisy. Mitchell says that he knows a Daisy. Thinks that Hannigan-Spitare is her surname. And that she did mention the box tunnel attacks after they happened, but he can’t remember what she said, though. He doesn’t know where to find her, either. Before she leaves, Reed goes to use the bathroom and finds Herrick being ultra creepy at he door when she’s done. He tells her that he wants to show her where Mitchell buries his nightmares. She goes with him, because she’s apparently never seen a scary movie before, and Herrick shows her the box tunnel scrapbook. As she rushes down the stairs, Mitchell spots the book in her bag and confronts her. She gives him the book back, but she knows she’s on to something.</p><p>Later that night, Mitchell makes a fire and destroys the book. Would have been better to do that a few weeks ago, wouldn’t it, Mitchell?</p><p>In the B-story, George sees the obituary notice of his father and, as he lurks at his dad’s funeral, he encounters George Sr.’s ghost. George explains how being a ghost works to him and Dad explains that things at home changed after George disappeared; mom Ruth took up with George’s old gym teacher and Dad moved out. George tries to help his dad move on, but George Sr. suspects that a reconciliation between George and his mum would help that happen. George doesn’t feel he can burden her with his secret, though. Eventually, though, he goes to speak with her, giving a cover story of having been sucked into a cult. It’s not a happy reconciliation as Gym Teacher Boyfriend is a bit of a prick about the whole thing. When George and Nina get back to his dad’s caravan, they find the ghost eating and the story unravels. George Sr. didn’t really die; there was a homeless man found in his shed after a fire, but he used it as an opportunity to start over. It went too far, though. Nina and George implore him to try and win his wife back, ensuring him that she still loves him.</p><p>At a welcome home BBQ that George’s mum had planned, they bring George Sr. Ruth can’t believe it. Gym Teacher (who’s name is apparently Marcus) is pissed and wants to throw him out. George Sr. finally fights back for his wife and punches Marcus. Ruth admits that she still loves George and Marcus is the one sent packing. As the reunited family sits down together, George finally says the words out loud to his family: “I am a werewolf.” His dad asks if he’s taking medication and assures him it’ll get better. Nina gives him a supportive wink.<br

And after George finds him in the psych ward, George and Nina take him in to keep them all from being exposed. Mitchell’s not too pleased with that decision, though.</p><p>This episode is a bit all over the place (especially with the social worker plot), but a few really important things go down, so we’ll be cutting to the chase quickly.<span
id="more-39337"></span></p><p>George is hanging out in the psych ward of the hospital one day (why? who knows?) and notices someone who looks a helluva lot like Herrick. A quick glimpse at a security mirror with no reflection confirms it: Herrick is alive, crazy, and standing right in front of George. He calls Nina (who was previously showing Annie an ultrasound – wolf fetus is still alive!), who makes a quick decision to get a very confused Herrick out of there, claiming he’s her Uncle Billy.</p><p>When they bring Herrick home, Mitchell wants to do the sensible thing and stake Herrick, so he breaks a chair leg off and starts chasing the confused vampire. Annie and Nina plead with George to do something to stop Mitchell, but George stands still. Nina finally pulls Mitchell off Herrick as the doorbell rings. Annie looks out the window and guesses by the looks of the woman that it’s social services and George tells Mitchell to be normal as George answers the door. The case worker is a bit scattered as she talks with Nina. During pretty much any time in the episode until I mention her again, just assume she’s being scattered and completely oblivious to what’s going on. Because that’s what’s happening. I think she must spend three hours wandering around this house.</p><p>Upstairs, as Herrick lays in the tub, George talks to Mitchell. He’s worried that it’s all going to happen again and doesn’t understand why the vampire that he tore to shreds with his werewolf teeth is in his house. Mitchell has no clue and just wants to get rid of Herrick. He thinks that the whole amnesia thing is a ruse. As Herrick passes by a mirror, he sees his lack of reflection and screams. Nina runs upstairs to comfort him and explains that it’s a trick mirror to calm him down. She tells him about the case worker and he suggests that he should tell her about “the dark one” attacking him. Nina asks him not to and he wonders if it would get her in trouble. He says he won’t tell her, for her sake. Uncle Billy Herrick is getting very attached to Nina. This won’t make things complicated at all.</p><p>As the case worker entertains herself downstairs, the doorbell rings. Since the three visible people in the house apparently can’t hear it, the case worker answers it herself. It’s Cara. Remember Cara? Crazy Welsh vampire we last saw bleeding herself out to bring Herrick back? Yep, that Cara. And she’s still completely insane. Annie screams for Mitchell, but the caseworker invites Cara in before Mitchell can get down there. Mitchell puts on a smiley face and explains that she’s a raver who’s going to crash there between festivals. Seems legit.</p><p>Nina and George take some time out (because it’s not like they have a case worker downstairs that they’re trying to make think everything is completely normal) to have a conversation about how Nina isn’t comfortable with George being okay with Mitchell’s plan to kill Herrick. George says he knows she won’t understand, but Herrick is dangerous. Nina brings up the baby card. Oh, and Herrick has totally overheard all this.</p><p>Cara and Mitchell have their own heart to heart. Of course, she’s looking for Herrick, but has no idea he’s there. She’s come to find Mitchell so that Mitchell can help her find Herrick and make him right again. Mitchell confesses the “wolf-shaped bullet” prophecy and demands to know how she brought Herrick back. She says she’ll tell him after they make Herrick right. Annie pops down, reminding Mitchell about that pesky case worker, and Annie babysits Cara long enough for Cara to give some exposition. Cara explains how Herrick made her, so romantically, out by the bins. Herrick said that she was his “bride and glory.” Annie says they do have stuff in common. Her fiance killed her, too. Cara says he didn’t kill her, he made her part of the master race. Annie accidentally reveals that he’s upstairs. Cara rushes past her and runs up to get him. Mitchell runs after her. Herrick backs away from her and hides behind Nina. He says he wants her gone, that she’s done disgusting things to him (in the psych ward, he was babbling about a woman trying to make him drink blood). Cara implores him to remember and he walks toward her slowly, but instead of recognition, Herrick calls her an obscene bitch. Cara says she’s nothing without him and he confirms that she’s nothing and pours salt on the wound, telling her “Don’t you look ugly when you’re crying?” Mitchell leads her out, but she runs back, grabs a wooden knitting needle and runs, staking herself instead of him. As the dust settles, the case worker finds them all.</p><p>Annie finds Mitchell with the trash and wants to know what he so wanted to talk to Cara about. Mitchell yells at her, saying she can’t have all of him. He’s cruel to her, tells her that it’s just not going to work. She heads back in and cries, messing with the electricity, adding to the completely normal atmosphere of the house.</p><p>The case worker finally gets to interview Uncle Billy and she asks if he feels happy and safe there. He holds Nina’s hand and says of course. He says he’d like to stay, just the five of them. Annie shakes her head at him. Herrick catches on and says he meant the case worker, she’s his friend. She says that’s sweet and asks to speak to Nina one on one. George takes Herrick upstairs and thanks him for not saying anything.</p><p>The case worker has some concerns (gee, really) and as she tries to look up the file on her computer, she says there’s no previous record of him in the system. She says that she’ll have to call someone and Nina says she will, too: the case worker’s manager. Nina kicks up a fuss to distract from the fact that, oh, there’s no previous record. How dare she delete the record after showing up late and talking bollocks. Nina promises to unleash a shit storm on poor case worker Wendy.</p><p>Upstairs, Herrick asks George if he had done anything to the younger man. George tells him to stop, he must remember, but Herrick says he doesn’t. George shows him his Star of David but Herrick isn’t affected. He’s not an anti-Semite, gosh!</p><p>Wendy confides in Nina that she’s not coping well as her manager calls again. Nina says they’ll just write it up and pretend nothing ever happened.</p><p>Herrick asks George again what he did. And if George did something to him. Herrick apologizes. He congratulates George on being a father. Herrick tells him to have more faith in himself – he’ll be a good father. It’s so creepy to see Herrick being so nice, but it reminds you what a great actor he is.</p><p>Nina stops Mitchell in the hall after the case worker leaves and tells him that she doesn’t agree to executing Herrick. Mitchell tells her that Herrick will annihilate her, George and the baby once he remembers who he is. Nina says she thinks that there’s a poison in Mitchell that’s always been there and always will be and Mitchell realizes that Nina is going to be the bullet. He says he doesn’t need her permission and runs upstairs, but George stops him, pointing a cane at Mitchell’s heart. Mitchell says he won’t do it. Mitchell calls him a fucking dog and tells him to get out of the way. George backs him into a room and yells that he never wanted to be a killer. He did it for them before and he’s doing it for them now. Herrick doesn’t remember; he’s ordinary, George protests. Mitchell says George has no idea what it’s costing him, but won’t tell him what it is. George says he has to stop Mitchell because he can’t stop himself.</p><p>Herrick watches a train set go around as Annie comes in. Herrick says she really intrigues him.</p><p>George says that Mitchell is his best friend, but he will erase him from his life if he doesn’t stop being so quick to murder. Mitchell breathes deeply. George heads downstairs to see Nina.</p><p>Herrick stalks around Annie and wonders why the “idiot woman” couldn’t see her. Annie says the woman was nice. Herrick says she doesn’t fit in. She’s peripheral. He wants to know how she does it. He asks what she is. Annie says she’s onto him, that’s what she is. Annie runs to Mitchell and says she’s not doing the crying thing and doesn’t really want to talk to him. Mitchell tells her that George won’t be his friend if he stakes Herrick and he feels like he’s losing his mind. Annie says she’ll do it. She thinks he does know who he is. Mitchell tells her to just not go near him. Mitchell will manage him, they just have to make sure he doesn’t feed.</p><p>Herrick watches his train set again and then feels a loose board in the floor.</p><p>Annie wants Mitchell to let go of her hand. He says he said things he didn’t mean. He said it because he was scared. They’re for eternity and that’s terrifying. But he doesn’t want to live without her. He can’t. He cries and she hugs him, but she feels uneasy about it. Nina takes Herrick some tea and he says he found something that she should see. He shows her the scrapbook and asks who would do such a thing. Nina says they have to leave as she thinks about how Mitchell didn’t want anyone coming up there. Herrick says they must be careful – they’re the only ones who see what kind of man he is. Nina staggers downstairs, backing away from Mitchell, claiming she feels sick. Mitchell calls for George. Nina collapses and throws up on the stairs. Annie helps her to the bathroom and she takes another look at Mitchell before heading in. Mitchell stops George and tells him “I choose you.”</p><p>Later that night, Nina watches as the three original roomies make dinner and then she runs out of the house. She goes down the street and makes a phone call. George comes out to the empty living room and finds Nina returning outside. She says she needed some air.</p><p>Mitchell heads back upstairs with a stake in his pocket. He visits Herrick and sits down in front of him. He says if this amnesia were a bluff, he’d be cracking by now. Mitchell tells Herrick who he is and says that he wants to know how he came back. He’ll make him tell everything. We hear Nina’s phone call – she called the anon boxcar line. Told them to come to Barry Island, talk to John Mitchell. Herrick looks out the window and says it’ll be the most beautiful day.<br

isPermaLink="false">http://persephonemagazine.com/?p=38740</guid> <description><![CDATA[In the Spring of 2009, Parks and Recreation debuted on NBC. Maybe you heard about it because you liked Amy Poehler from SNL. Maybe you heard that it was kind of like The Office, but without Steve Carrell. Maybe you watched an episode or two but didn't bother to add it to your TiVo Season Passes. If you haven't already spring for a HuluPlus subscription just to watch all the episodes in the past month, this love letter should explain why I did and you should. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Due to technical difficulties of Netflix being down when I usually watch each episode, this week’s <em>Bones</em> recap is postponed.)</p><p>Dear <em>Parks and Recreation</em>,</p><p>First, I have to admit that I was one of the early naysayers. I was really excited about the show when I first heard about it. I loved Amy Poehler on <em>SNL</em>, and really liked Rashida Jones on <em>The Office</em> and a British show called <em>NY-LON</em>. I watched the first couple of episodes, but it just didn’t grab me. Plus, our NBC channel wasn’t HD and I think there were already two other things scheduled on our TiVo at that time. Sadly, you fell by the wayside.<span
id="more-38740"></span></p><p>I occasionally saw mention of you. People said you were getting better. I thought about giving you another chance, but just didn’t get around to it. But within the past year, you exploded. I saw the phrase “Best Show You’re Not Watching” a lot. Adam Scott (amazing on <em>Party Down</em>) and Rob Lowe joined? Wait… Megan Mullally guest stars? And Parker Posey? I LOVE them! What really sealed the deal, though, were the ladies I follow on Tumblr. Tumblr frickin’ <strong>LOVES</strong> you, <em>P&amp;R</em>… I just want you to know that. Almost as much as it loves <em>Doctor Who, Supernatural</em> and <em>Sexy Medieval Wolf Dragon Blood and Guts Hour </em>(otherwise known as <em>Game of Thrones</em>… I haven’t seen it, so I’m just assuming that’s what the show is about). So… like that jerk who doesn’t see how beautiful his best friend is until he walks away from her, I came crawling back to you, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. And it has been beautiful. Except for that part where you made me shell out for a HuluPlus subscription because Netflix didn’t have season three. But that’s not your fault, baby… it’s mine. I promise I won’t forsake you again, and here’s why (in no particular order):</p><p>I love Mark Brendanawicz. I love that he is the Only Sane Man amongst the chaos of the Parks Department. I love that he’s a little bit of a man-slut. I love that he admires Leslie’s passion for her work. I love that he gives Ann a Christmas present of not attending a Pacers game with him. I love that he left when it was time, rather than stay on and pine over Ann.</p><p>I love Jerry. I love that Jerry still comes to work, day in and day out, just waiting for retirement, despite the fact that he is the office punching bag. I love that we see that he still has insecurity, though, because of the taunting. I love that he goes home to his wife and kids, who must be the most supporting family in the world to make the man who has to deal with what Jerry deals with.</p><p>I love Donna. I love that she is to <em>P&amp;R</em> what Barney is to <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. I love how we have no idea how she affords a Benz and three shares of the Snakehole Lounge on a single person’s government salary. Is she independently wealthy? A trust-fund child? Secretly a hit woman? I doubt we’ll ever know and I love it.</p><p>I love all the recurring characters. I love Jean-Ralphio and how Ron immediately knew he wanted “the opposite of that.” I love Tammy 2 and how much chaos she brings into Ron’s life. I love Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Joan Callamezzo, and Perd Hapley, the media king and queens of Pawnee. I love the Christian lady who opposes every decision and I love the dad who wants <em>Twilight</em> in the time capsule because of his daughter. I love that the recurring characters ride that fine line between ordinary and caricature – if you’ve ever lived in a small community, you know them. You’ve rolled your eyes at them.</p><p>I love that the writers allow the stories to tie themselves up in a reasonable amount of time. A pit takes twelve episodes to fill in and it’s not even at it’s end-goal of being a park yet. The Harvest Festival wraps up in six and it’s swiftly on to the next project. Individual plot threads don’t overstay their welcome, yet don’t feel wrapped up too quickly, either.</p><p>I love that (other than Jerry) the humor isn’t mean-spirited. That’s not to say that everything is roses and candy all the time, but these characters all have a deep appreciation for each other and almost every episode leaves you with a good feeling, which seems rare in a sitcom right now.</p><p>I love that the writers trust their hilarious cast and allow them to improv. It makes for genius moments like this:</p><p>I love Ron Swanson. I love that he opposes the very things that keep him employed. I love that he’s a crotchety bastard, but one that cares about his employees, even though he’ll deny it to your face. I love that he knew when he needed to intervene for April and Andy. I love that he fights for Leslie to keep her job because he knows that she is the yang to his yin. I love that he gives Tom honest advice when Tom is thinking about leaving. I love that he has a poster of bacon and eggs in his office.</p><p>I love April and Andy. I love how far each character has grown through their friendship and their relationship. I love that their relationship simultaneously makes absolutely no sense and makes all the sense in the world. I love that they’re finding their own way in the world and don’t care if anyone thinks it’s weird. I love that their fights, like all things on this show, take exactly the right amount of time to run their course. I love that I don’t know what to expect next from them.</p><p>I love Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger. I love that they mirror Ron and Leslie. I love that Chris’ return didn’t feel shoehorned in. I love that Ben is the cynical, jaded, opposition to Leslie…the young mayor with the chip on his shoulder who got his optimism crushed down so early. I love that Leslie is bringing the optimism back to his life.</p><p>I love Ann Perkins. I love that we see her at her best and at her worst. I love her relationship with Leslie and love feeling that I finally have a pop culture female friendship that I can relate to (that and <em>Bridesmaids</em> have made my year). I love that their friendship is the centerpiece of the show. I love that it’s not about one being jealous of the other or one secretly hating the other. I love that it’s a friendship built from genuine mutual admiration and affection and I love these two so much.</p><p><a

class="alignnone" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lohr3t0oAd1qk0gvbo1_500.png" alt="" width="500" height="270" /></a></p><p>I love the <em>P&amp;R</em> fans. I love that there are<a

I love that she admires all female politicians, even the ones she doesn’t agree with. I love that she roleplays how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss. I love that she loves every single person she works with, even Jerry. I love what an amazing, strong, female role model she is and truly hope kids grow up wanting to be just like her. I love that I fall more in love with her and with this show every episode and I love that I hate that I’ll have to wait until September for more episodes.</p><div

id="more-38093"></span></p><p>It’s a big day at the Jeffersonian as Dr. Goodman brings in the remains of what is very possibly an Iron Age Warrior. It’s up to them to confirm that. Goodman would do it, but he has a museum to run, so it’s up to Brennan and Zack. They’re excited, because, you know, it’s what they’re actually there at the Jeffersonian to do, but killjoy Booth arrives and convinces Goodman that it’d be good press for Brennan to come out to LA to help him investigate a body found in pieces near LAX. Besides, Goodman can authenticate the Iron Age guy; he used to be an archaeologist, after all.</p><p>Once B&amp;B arrive in LA (in a swank ’66 Mustang), Brennan finds that identifying the victim won’t be cut and dry. Her skull has been operated on numerous times. Fortunately, there’s a breast implant with a serial number in the remains. Unfortunately, it was from a batch that were stolen from a plastic surgeon’s office. Man, everyone’s just making this case difficult. The doctor had found out that a few weeks ago, another one from the stolen shipment was traced to a botched boob job, though, and that doctor leads them to a call girl service. The madam had one girl missing, Rachel LaChance (not her real name, of course). She was in Las Vegas with a client, and hadn’t been heard from in over a week.</p><p>When the doctor she was with checks out, Booth turns to Rachel’s most frequent working partner, Leslie. Leslie explains that Candace (although that probably wasn’t her real name, either) had a boyfriend who had recently found out the was an escort and was pissed. Booth and Brennan go to question the boyfriend, who says that Sandra (maybe her real name? Maybe?) couldn’t ever believe she was beautiful, she just kept having more surgeries.</p><p>With no real evidence to go on, Zack notices that marks on the fatal wound match marks from one of the surgeries. They find the only plastic surgeon to do that specific procedure and he admits to operating on her in exchange for favors. He had been seeing another escort, who had gotten too attached. The surgeon finally had to cut it off with Rachel/Candace/Sandra/Susan (as he knew her) because he thought she was addicted to surgery. Turns out, the other escort got jealous and guess who it was? Yep. Leslie.</p><p>Using indicators that the mystery girl had been in a car accident around age 12 and was originally from the Northeast, Booth tracked her true identity down to Allison Holmes. Her mother was killed in the accident that injured her, but Booth found her father and brother and arranged to have the remains returned to them.</p><p>In the B plot, Dr. Goodman uses the squints to assist him in authenticating the Iron Age body, but his archaeologist/story teller side clashes with Hodgins science/fact-driven work. Hodgins goes so far that if he didn’t, you know, <em>own</em> the Jeffersonian, he’d have totally been fired. Goodman decides that there are too many conflicting facts about the body to definitively authenticate it and Hodgins snarks about this. Later, Goodman calls Hodgins in and tells him that he did like hearing someone call him out and that he did bail on the authentication. To fully authenticate it, he would have had to destroy the remains and he couldn’t bear doing that to what he thought was a real artifact. Hodgins suggests says that he’s waiting for imaging technology to get to the point where he would haven’t to dissamble and Goodman likes this suggesting. Yay, resolution!</p><p>The “case” in this episode is really a vehicle for two things: fancy shots of beautiful people in bikinis next to roof top pools and Brennan monologuing about how plastic surgery is barbaric and erases the real person behind that surgery. I really don’t think I can go into everything that’s messed up about that, so I’ll just leave that there and let you ladies discuss amongst yourselves.<br

Mitchell and Annie take their relationship to the next level, but Mitchell worries that he can't escape his fate. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a flashback to 15 years ago, McNair is loading up a camper van and the child inside it, a young Tom, complains that, “It hurts.” McNair encourages Tom to be brave, to remember how he and mum would tell Tom to be brave when they would go into the woods by themselves. Tom yells for his dad not to leave as McNair locks him in and runs off.<span
id="more-37665"></span></p><p>Back in the present, George and Nina take a walk through the woods trying to find the man they saw in the woods last month. That man was, of course, Tom, who is watching them from afar at the moment. He runs back to McNair (who still has the same blue camper van) and tells him that they’re back. Tom wants to talk to them, but McNair locks him back up in the van. George and Nina eventually find McNair and the bus and McNair denies seeing any young man in the woods, but Tom gives himself away by making noise in the van. George explains that he and Nina are werewolves, too and Nina says that they’re looking for someone who might be able to tell them if they’ve know any werewolves who’ve had pregnancies. McNair intimidates them away, but Nina leaves their information in case he hears something.</p><p>In the night, Tom pays Nina a visit and leaves a carving next to her bed. Mitchell, smelling a strange werewolf, attacks him and McNair arrives to defend his son as Annie yells for George and Nina. After breaking up the fight, Nina wants to patch Tom up, but McNair refuses to stay in the same room as a vampire. McNair and Mitchell throw insults at each other and McNair warns George against his roommate, telling him that vampires are rounding up werewolves for dog fights. Mitchell scoffs that those ended years ago. He demands to know who the other wolves are and what they’re doing there and as George fumbles over his words, Nina reveals that they’re pregnant. Annie freaks out with excitement and Mitchell gives George a brotherly hug. Nina takes Tom upstairs. As the four werewolves sit together, McNair explains that Tom was born a werewolf. And that the pregnancy was fine, even during the full moon. McNair explains that when the bones break, they mend stronger… the “curse” makes you stronger. Noticing scars on Tom’s back, Nina asks what happened to Tom’s mom and McNair says she was killed by vampires.</p><p>The next morning, George makes breakfast as he talks about becoming a father. Mitchell wants to know what the wolves are doing here, he thinks it’s suspicious and noticed the way Tom was looking at Nina. George says that they really need them around, and their friends. When Nina brings Tom down, Mitchell lies and says he’s going in to work. Instead, he heads into the woods, heading for that blue van. He breaks the lock and looks around inside it.There’s garlic and a cross at the threshold, but somehow Mitchell can walk in. Mitchell finds an armory of stakes and vampire teeth and a serial killer-esque wall display, including clippings about the Box Tunnel. McNair is at home with Annie and wonders why a nice girl like her is with a vampire. Annie tells him off just before Mitchell comes home. As they go to make tea, McNair says “Lovely girl,” and Mitchell turns around and tells McNair not to talk to her. Mitchell wants to know what he’s doing there. If someone sent him. What his deal is. McNair says that Mitchell spilled his boy’s blood, so he’s going to spill some in return. Mitchell shows him the stake he found; mobile homes don’t count as homes, Mitchell reveals. Something to do with the gypsies, he suspects. Mitchell wants McNair gone. McNair explains that he’s stubborn, and he’s coming for Mitchell.</p><p>Nina and George take Tom to the hospital to run some basic tests on him. Nina asks Tom directly what happened to his mom. He explains that they used to live in a house, like normal people. Someone must have seen the parents change. The vampires went after them, like wolves after the three little pigs. His mom was slow because she was carrying him. They got her. Nina doesn’t think it’s healthy, just him and his dad and Tom says that’s why they’re looking for the pack. It’s like a family, he explains. Nina sends him off to get some X-rays. George thinks it makes sense, but Nina thinks it’s bullshit. She thinks McNair lied to him and tells George about the scratches on his back. She’s running some tests, which should tell whether he actually was born a werewolf or not.</p><p>Mitchell, fed up with and terrified of McNair, heads to Richard Hargreaves’ mansion for help. Hargreaves thinks that Mitchell’s there to apologize for the Adam debacle, but Mitchell is there about the dogfights; he says he has a dog for them. Hargreaves gets excited, thinking he means George and Nina, but Mitchell makes it clear that they are untouchable. He explains where to find McNair and adds “the kid” to the off limits list, too. Really, Mitchell? Could you be more naive? I could see where this was going as soon as you stepped in the door. Meanwhile, McNair is making plans of his own. He and Tom are trying to fix the van to move on after tomorrow night. Tom is upset, though, he wants to know how they’re supposed to find a pack if they don’t give anyone a chance. McNair says their pack wouldn’t live with a vampire. They’ll get the results tomorrow and then move on. Besides, “George and Nina aren’t going to like us after we kill their friend.”</p><p>George and McNair talk as they wait for Tom’s results. George asks who McNair was before all this and the older man says he was wild, a danger before Tom. He asks if George would prefer a boy or girl. George says a boy and McNair says it’s not easier once girls get in the picture. Especially this time of month. Slightly nervous, George goes to see about Nina. Nina is in with Tom and Tom wants Nina to know how he feels about her— he loves her. In an awkward segue, Nina informs Tom that he matches someone in a missing persons file. He wasn’t born a wolf. The police found his mother and father in the woods, attacked by an animal. Their baby was never found. Police assumed he was dead. Tom runs out of the room and grabs McNair by the throat, demanding to know the truth. McNair reveals that he caused the scratches on his back. He didn’t remember killing the parents. He came back the next day and found Tom, still alive. What was he supposed to do? Tom asks about the pack. “It’s just me and you,” McNair confesses. He tries to explain himself, but Tom doesn’t want to hear it. McNair walks away. Later on, as Tom cleans his stuff out of the van, Nina apologizes for telling him the way she did. He gives her a carved figure, for the baby. Nina thanks him: “If I still have a baby after tonight.” They make plans for changing that night as they are surrounded by vampires with chains.</p><p>In the B-plot, Annie and Mitchell, having finally confessed their love for each other, are trying to find ways to have a normal relationship. Namely, Annie wants to have something resembling intimate times. She starts with kissing, which just tickles, and moves on to dirty talk, which Mitchell just isn’t into. Annie gets another idea, though, and takes Mitchell to a bar. She wants him to pick up a girl and get off with her as Annie feels it through him (similar to how she can taste through touch). They bring the girl home (and clean her up after she vomits. Nice). After a brief encounter with George where they finally admit they’re a couple, to George’s delight, they head upstairs with the bar girl, Sadie. As Sadie and Mitchell get intimate, Annie tries to position herself in the mix, but Mitchell finds himself getting a little too excited and the teeth come out. Sadie freaks out and Mitchell yells at her to leave. The next day, Mitchell explains to Annie that sex isn’t about intimacy and love for him. It’s a weapon, just the blood. He tells her that they can having something better than that. That she gives him a reason to take control over his life again, break free from the hundred years of being held in control by his hunger. Fresh off the feeling of taking charge of his fate, Mitchell calls Richard to tell him that the deal is off, but it’s too late. McNair bursts through the door, wanting revenge for Tom being gone. Mitchell asks where they went and they find the wrecked campsite. Mitchell asks where the dogfights are, and McNair says he already knows. McNair heads off and Mitchell hands him a stake.</p><p>At the ring, Tom, George, and Nina are thrown into the cage. George protests that she’s pregnant, but the vampires just mock him, and even before they begin to transform, Nina doubles over in pain because of the baby. Tom comes over and says that, if they want, he’ll kill George and Nina can kill him before they change, he won’t fight back. As they stand up, Tom says, “He’s here.” McNair stakes one vamp and then announces that, in three minutes, he’s going to kill every vampire in that room. Annie gets the keys as McNair and Mitchell rampage the vampires. Annie opens the cage and helps Nina out of there. As McNair transforms, Hargreaves grabs the stake and goes to kill McNair. Mitchell stops him and starts fighting with him as Richard is trying to leave.  The McNairWolf comes into the room, sniffs Mitchell, but leaves him alone to go for Richard. Mitchell and Annie lock themselves in the cage as Tom, McNair, George, and Nina transform outside.The wolves go for the cage as Annie and Mitchell wait it out.</p><p>The next morning, George and Nina cuddle on the couch and Annie makes tea for Tom and McNair. Nina wonders why they didn’t all tear each other apart and Annie explains that after the initial craze, George padded around Nina, protectively, and Tom and McNair wrestled with each other. McNair thanks them for their hospitality and he and Tom go to leave. Mitchell asks if they’re square. McNair says they are, but he’ll still get his someday.</p><p>In a hospital, a mental patient is brought in, raving. It’s Herrick.</p><p>McNair’s morality is an interesting thing. He definitely has his own code of ethics. He won’t curse in front of ladies and admonishes Tom that “we don’t judge women by their looks,” but confides to George what kind of person he was before Tom. His guilt has led him to create this world for Tom, a world of packs and special connections and a happy mother and father. He’s even made a bogeyman in the form of vampires. I’m sure vampires had done something terrible to McNair along the way, but McNair instilled such a fear in Tom by telling him that vampires had killed his mother. Why? Interestingly, it is McNair, the liar, who rails against Mitchell, not Tom, the impressionable son.</p><p>Mitchell rails against something he fears, as well: fate. After seeing letters spelling out “wolf-shaped bullet,” he rails against Annie as she opines that it was fate that brought them together. He tells her that you have to make things happen, or not happen. He doesn’t make his confrontation with McNair happen, though, and even though they end square, McNair just happens to reference a gunshot when warning Mitchell that the vampire will get what’s coming to him eventually. Fate? Or something else?<br

id="more-37267"></span></p><h3>Castle</h3><p><em>(3 Seasons in; Season 4 starting September 19, 2011 on ABC)</em><br
/> <strong>The Basic Idea:</strong> Crime novelist Richard Castle uses his friendship with the Mayor to get him a sweet gig shadowing the NYPD. He’s assigned to Detective Kate Beckett and she’s not too thrilled about it. Beckett and her fellow officers eventually come to realize that Castle’s novelist brain can actually be a help to them. Doesn’t help that he <em>is</em> ruggedly handsome, either.<br
/> <strong>Women to Watch:</strong> Kate Beckett, of course, but Meghan Williams goes on about her more in <a
href="http://persephonemagazine.com/2010/11/5-butt-kicking-brunettes-on-television/">5 Butt-Kicking Brunettes on Television</a>. Castle’s surrounded by strong women in his personal life, too, in the form of his mother, Martha, and daughter, Alexis. Far from token women to get put into danger, Martha and Alexis are Castle’s confidants, counselors, and conscience. And they’re both pretty darn fierce.</p><h3>Fringe</h3><p><em>(3 Seasons in; Season 4 starting September 23, 2011 on FOX)</em><br
/> <strong>The Basic Idea:</strong> While this show is usually classified as sci-fi, it’s straight-up procedural most of the time. Olivia Dunham investigates cases for the Fringe Division with the help of Peter Bishop and his father, Walter. The Fringe Division takes on the strangest, most unexplainable cases, which almost always come back to Walter’s earlier research or his old friend William Bell’s company, Massive Dymanic.<br
/> <strong>Women to Watch:</strong> Olivia Dunham, who kicks ass and takes names no matter what universe she’s in (what now? I didn’t say anything… just watch the show). Nina Sharp, CEO of Massive Dynamic, who switches quickly between friend and foe, but always seems to be three steps ahead of either side.<br
/> <strong>More:</strong> Our own Nichole Wilson started <a
href="http://persephonemagazine.com/tag/fringe/">recapping Fringe mid-season 3</a>.</p><h3>Dexter</h3><p><em>(5 Seasons in; Season 6 starting October 2, 2011 on Showtime)</em><br
/> <strong>The Basic Idea:</strong> Mild-mannered Dexter Morgan is a forensic blood-spatter analyst by day and vigilante killer of serial killers by night. Luci highlighted <em>Dexter</em> in her list of <a
href="http://persephonemagazine.com/2010/11/top-10-tv-series-on-netflix-instant/">Top Ten TV Series on Netflix Instant</a>.<br
/> <strong>Women to Watch:</strong> Debra Morgan, the best foul-mouthed detective in the world and adoptive sister to Dexter. While she’s occasionally put in the damsel-in-distress place, it’s how she rebounds from horrific events that makes her a strong, well-written character. Lt. Maria LaGuerta, who manages to be an assertive leader without forsaking any femininity.</p><h3>Covert Affairs</h3><p><em>(1 Season in; Season 2 currently airing on USA)</em><br
/> <strong>The Basic Idea:</strong> Annie Walker, a CIA trainee, is picked to jump up to a full on CIA job, whether she’s ready for it or not.<br
/> <strong>Women to Watch:</strong> Annie Walker, who gets herself into trouble doing the right thing just as much as she gets herself out of it. Joan Campbell, senior officer in the CIA, who some times appears as a stereotypical ball-buster, has hidden depths.</p><p>And those are just my current favorites. What would you recommend? I’ve heard <em>Suits</em> is amazing, but haven’t started watching yet.</p><p>(Images Courtesy respective networks)<br

id="more-36366"></span></p><p>The on-screen text tells us it’s 6pm on December 23<sup>rd</sup> and if you didn’t already know something bad was going to happen from the plot description on your tivo or Netflix, you should know by the countdown. Angela is trying to harangue Brennan into going to the company Christmas party with her. Brennan is not down for it. She’s more interested in a skull, but eventually agrees to leave in 20 minutes. In a case of great timing, Booth comes in with a case… there was a body found in a fallout shelter; it looks like a suicide, but Brennan says it’s not on one glance at some pictures and tells him to bring the skeleton in and she’ll prove it. He has it already and some guys wheel it in behind him. Brennan asks Booth to escort Angela to the party since she’ll be a little while.</p><p>Up in another part of the lab, Zack has made a voice-activated robot and Hodgins has makes vodka to spike the eggnog with. Later, Brennan works on the body as Brennan finds tickets in the pocket and a bullet in the skull. Booth comes up to get away from the party and wants to know if Brennan has looked in the suitcase yet. She doesn’t want to because she doesn’t think it will contain relevant information. Brennan puts everyone to work as Angela comes in and demands that everyone come to the party so she can kiss them all, including Brennan, “in a festive, non lesbian manner.” I guess she doesn’t get her Christmas wish, because in the next cut, Zack is sawing through the bone for some core samples. Hodgins is drinking eggnog, good supervisor that he is. Particles from the bone fly up into the vents and the lab goes into a biological contamination shut down. Hodgins pushes Zack and himself into the shower.</p><p>A CDC official teleconferences in to let the team know that the contaminant was Valley Fever, a potentially fatal airborne toxin. And since Hodgins might have inhaled spores and exhaled them all over everyone, they’re under quarantine until they know if any of them are carrying it or not. Everyone is pissed and the blame game starts. CDC people in Hazmat suits come in to give everyone doses of shots and pills and let them know that sleeping bags will be delivered; they’ll be there at least until Christmas.</p><p>Zack and Hodgins are bunking together and Hodgins laments that he was supposed to go to Quebec with his gorgeous girlfriend. You know, like a real Christmas. Zack tells him that a real Christmas is going to Michigan and chopping down a tree and celebrating with 40 people who all love you and are happy to see you. Oh, Zack, how do you fall so far later on? Dr. Goodman and Booth are sharing quarters, too, and Booth is a bit loopy from the injections. Dr. Goodman remarks that he <em>is</em> Christmas at his house for his wife and twin five-year-old daughters. Booth reveals that he has a kid, too: Parker, who’s also five. He and Parker’s mom weren’t married, so his parental rights are “vague.” Angela and Brennan are sleeping together in Brennan’s office and Angela asks for help making Christmas for everyone. Angela wonders what the guy’s story was; two tickets to Paris, a wedding ring they found sewn into his pocket. She wonders who the girl was, what happened to her, whether she ever knew. Brennan knows exactly what to do for Christmas and jumps out of the sleeping bag to go work solving the murder.</p><p>They discover that the man in the fallout shelter was Lionel Little and that he had accidentally gotten a girl pregnant in 1959. Not just anyone, an African-American woman, against the law at that time. He was planning to take her to Paris where they could be married and raise their child. To finance the trip, he sold many of his valuable coins to Gil Atkins (owner of the fallout shelter he was found in). Looks like Gil got greedy and killed Lionel to take all his coins.</p><p>Throughout the episode, the juxtaposition of the faithful Booth and the atheist Brennan is brought up. While the rest of the group decides to make and exchange gifts, Brennan abstains, and it’s revealed that her parents disappeared shortly before Christmas when she was 15. Her brother, Russ, 19 at the time, was taking care of her and had found their Christmas presents hidden. Thinking it would add some normality, on Christmas Eve he put the tree up and put all the presents out. When young Temperance came down, she thought that her parents had come back. She refused to open any of the presents, causing Russ to think she was rejecting him.</p><p>This episode also features one of the first times <em>Bones</em> made me flat-out bawl (and still does every time). As Tori Amos’ version of “Have Yourself A Merry Christmas” plays, the team’s families (and Hodgins’ girlfriend) come to visit. Brennan watches as there’s a crowd for Zack. Hogdins kisses the girl through the glass. Booth touches hands with Parker. Angela touches hands with her dad (a member of ZZ Top. She warned them they might recognize him and that she didn’t want to talk about it). Hogdins touches hands with the girl. Goodman touches hands with his kids. Zach touches hands with everyone. I hate how this scene makes me cry.</p><p>They figure out that the girl who Lionel was going to meet was named Ivy Gillespie, and as Brennan tracks her down to an assisted living facility in Maryland, Brennan also finds something curious: one penny. The penny turns out to be extremely rare and worth over $100,000. Lionel never revealed the best part of his collection. As the CDC people give the all-clear and everyone rushes out, Brennan stays as an older African-American woman and her granddaughter arrive. Brennan sits with Ivy and Lisa and Ivy explains that she gave birth to her and Lionel’a daughter in 1960, raised her, got her to college, nursing school. She died 8 years ago and Ivy took over raising her granddaughter, who wants to be a doctor. Lisa laughs this off, saying she can’t afford it. Brennan shows Ivy the tickets and Ivy is touched. That’s what Lionel had promised her; she thought the worst of him. She tears up and Lisa thanks Brennan. Brennan says she has something even better and hands her the penny. Ivy asks what could be better: “You gave me back my life.” Brennan replies, “There’s something you ought to know about that penny.”</p><p>After stopping at Wong Fu’s for a bit to meet Booth’s adorable son, Brennan heads back to her office. As Tori Amos plays again, she pulls out a box, which has some wrapped presents. She opens a card from her parents and holds back tears. She opens a present and smiles as she sees what it is, but we never see.</p><p>Wow. The past three episodes have all been ones that were etched into my memory. It’s amazing that they were all in such close succession to each other. Within the first half a season, <em>Bones</em> had already cemented itself as something unique. A procedural with humor, with bite; most importantly, with heart.<br

Making them at home is a great way to save calories and money, but also requires preparation (usually overnight). And I don’t know about you, but I’m too impatient for that, so every time I’ve been in a Williams-Sonoma this summer, I’ve been drawn to the <a
href="http://www.zokuhome.com/pages/products-quickpop-maker">Zoku Quick Pop Maker</a>, which promises popsicles in 10 minutes. When my husband surprised me with one for my birthday, I couldn’t wait to start using it. The Zoku does not disappoint. <span
id="more-35627"></span></p><p><a
href="http://www.zokuhome.com/pages/products-quickpop-maker"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-35960" src="http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/our_products_quick_pop_maker-300x232.jpg?1103ba" alt="" width="300" height="232" /></a>The kit includes the Quick Pop Maker, six sticks (and pop-on drip guards) and the Super Tool, which twists on the sticks to remove the pops with consistent, even pressure. He also got me the storage case (which keeps 6 pops airtight and fresh). Other accessories include a recipe book and an accessories kit which includes fill cups, a siphon, fruit placer, fruit cutters and angle tray (we’ll talk about what those would be for later). The Quick Pop Maker is a heavy set of molds (you can get either 2 or 3 pop makers) that you keep in your freezer. The liquid around the molds stays frozen and becomes what allows the molds to freeze your pops so quickly. Your basic ice pop is simply chilled fruit juice, poured carefully into the molds. In 7-9 minutes, according to the book, your pop is frozen and ready to eat. Because the mold doesn’t need to be placed back in the fridge, you actually can watch the pop freeze right in front of you.</p><p>My first criticism of the Zoku is that I don’t seem to be able to get my freezer and/or the mold down to the right temperature. Zoku recommends 0 degrees Farenheit, but my freezer will only get to about 5 degrees on its coldest setting. To counteract this, I just put the mold back in the freezer and add a couple minutes to the timer. Slightly less convenient, but not a huge deal.</p><p>How does the product turn out, though, you’re wondering? GREAT! I initially tried it with Minute Maid Orange Juice, Welch’s Strawberry Breeze juice and Dole’s Pina Colada juice. All flavors were delicious. And when done with just juice, nothing special added, it makes for a really novel (and refreshingly cold) way to drink your OJ or other juice. When you start experimenting with add-ins and filled core pops, though, that’s where the Zoku Quick Pop Maker gets <em>really</em> fun.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Strawberry and Vanilla Filled Core Pop</p></div><p>My first try was with core pops. Core pops are treats like Creamsicles, where orange goodness covers a core of vanilla ice cream. I tried at first with strawberry juice and raspberry sherbet and while it was delicious, it didn’t make for the best visual, so in the interest of journalism, I just had to buy some vanilla ice cream and try again. To make a core pop is a three step process. First, you pour your juice into the molds as normal and let the outside freeze just enough to make a good shell. Any more and you’ll have a completely juicy tip to your core pop. Next, use the official siphon (or a straw if you’re cheap like me and don’t have a cold to spread around) and siphon out or suck out the unfrozen juice from the mold. Make sure to get down in the bottom to get those last bits. Third, take your core mix and slowly and carefully fill the rest of the mold. To make my quick mold, I just used about four scoops of vanilla ice cream and let it sit on the counter for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it was somewhat soupy. When filling, I occasionally poked at ice cream backups with the straw to get the filling all the way in there. The inner core will take a little longer to freeze than the juice alone, but after about 12 minutes (back in the freezer), it was ready to eat and delicious. The <a
href="http://cakeonthebrain.blogspot.com/2011/06/zoku-ice-pops-maker.html">Cake on the Brain</a> blog has a couple more recipes for filled core pops adapted from the Zoku recipe book.</p><p>Next, I tried some add-ins. On hand, I had peaches and raspberries and took to cutting them up for delicious ice pops.</p><p><a

class="wp-caption-text">Fruity pops freezing</p></div><p>The slices of peaches were for the outside of the pops and the bits were for</p><p>mixing in the juice. The manual advises that add-ins can be placed on the sides of the molds, as long as they don’t interfere with the placement of the stick. When placing fruit on the molds, it sticks FAST. Think of that tongue on pole scene from <em>A Christmas Story</em>. You have to work quickly.Fruit works much better mixed in with the juice, but will still tend to clump up, so a skewer or toothpick is helpful. Again, pops will take a little longer than a normal batch to freeze, so after some extra time:</p><p><a

The <a
href="http://blog.zokuhome.com/">Zoku blog</a> posts new recipes about weekly (including one for <a
href="http://blog.zokuhome.com/post/5161354900/mothers-little-helper-mimosa-pops">Mimosa Pops</a> that will be getting made the next time I pick up champagne).</p><p>The disadvantages: while you can make your own juice or smoothie mixes to use in the molds, the Zoku manual advises against using artificial sweeteners. One of the keys to easy removal is a fine balance of sugar content in the liquid. This makes it somewhat difficult to decrease the amount of sugar and/or calories that you’re making, if that’s a concern. I have yet to try out different sweeteners to see what their effect is, but a quick googling shows that people do have good results with natural sweeteners such as agave nectar and honey.</p><p>A minor quibble is the length of the sticks. While I’m sure they’re designed specifically to give the most leverage for easy removal, the sticks leave no room for any pure ice pop at the bottom. Even with an adult sized mouth (it’s really hard not to go for the cheap jokes here, trust me), it’s hard to get to the ice at the bottom of the pop without getting half your face juicy. I imagine it’s a lot more difficult for kids.</p><p>Overall, it’s a fun gadget that’s probably a little pricey thanks to its pleasing aesthetics and nifty accessories. There are competing similar devices that start at about twenty dollars less. If you have the money to splurge on it, though, and are a fan of ice pops, you’ll have fun with it.</p><p> </p><p>Photocredit: Featured Image courtesy zokuhome.com.

Also, Nina's got some unsettling news and Mitchell's got a stalker. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago: A girl named Sasha is brought into the ER in very bad condition. She dies on the table and is brought down to the mortuary. As the tech is about to begin the autopsy, Sasha sits up and yells at him, “What the bloody hell d’ya think you’re doing?”<span
id="more-35625"></span></p><p>At the house, George heads to the bathroom in the middle of the night and Mitchell interrupts to ask where Annie is. Oh, Mitchell, you and your timing. Mitchell is worried that Annie fancies him and George is glad that he finally realized.</p><p>Annie is actually strolling down the nightclub streets where she finds a girl who was just kicked out of a club. The girl turns around and her face is all bloody. It’s Sasha, and she can see Annie.</p><p>George suspects that Annie could be good for Mitchell and gives him a pep talk about asking her out. Mitchell wonders how that would even work. Annie pops in and expliains that there’s a dead woman chasing her. As Sasha starts pounding on the door, George laments that he just got up for a pee. Sasha isn’t a ghost, though, George can smell her and she’s rank. When they think she’s gone, Mitchell opens the door slightly and she screams through the crack. George opens the window shade and Sasha vomits blood on the window. Mitchell says they have to let her in; the “shouting, pissed corpse” might draw a little bit of attention. Sasha sits down on the stoop to cry (still loudly) and Annie invites her in for some tea. Upstairs, the smell wakes Nina. Sasha requests some straighteners and George updates Nina on the situation as they get hers. As she gets introduced to the roommates, Sasha hits on Mitchell heavily (to Annie’s consternation). Sasha explains that she was in a car accident: texting while driving. And she doesn’t really realize that she’s dead.</p><p>Mitchell points out that the mortuary’s been off limits for a couple weeks because of a gas leak. George realizes they’ve been hiding a zombie. At least she’s not eating their brains, they gather. Mitchell says she’s the hospital’s problem. They need to take her back. Nina thinks Annie won’t necessarily agree, though. Nina is bonding with Sasha as the zombie girl starts asking what Mitchell’s story is. Annie says’s he’s her boyfriend. Nina calls her into the kitchen and Annie says that Sasha has to GO. George leaves it to Mitchell and Annie to get Sasha back to the hospital. After looking at the toe tag (that Annie retrieved from Sasha’s shoe), Mitchell finds something off about the date and suggests that he and Annie pay a visit to the mortuary first.</p><p>Upstairs, George finally gets that long-awaited pee. As he washes his hands, he notices a pregnancy test in the trash. He confronts Nina about it and asks when she was going to tell him. She confirms that she’s pregnant and he protests that she’s on the pill. She points out that the pill isn’t exactly made for werewolves. She took three tests, it’s true. She’s planning on an abortion, though, because they have no idea what it could be. George gets indignant at the thought that she wasn’t going to consult him and she throws him out of the bedroom. “I only got up for a pee,” George laments.</p><p>At the hospital, Mitchell breaks into the mortuary and Annie sees a trail of blood from one of the lockers. As they find more gruesomeness around, Annie reminds herself that she’s already dead. Mitchell finds a video camera and notebook and thinks it wasn’t just Sasha; there were three others who all came back to life at the same time. Mitchell thinks they were testing on them and the footage is gross. Anesthetic ineffective, but they autospied anyway. They burnt them afterwards, they think. Annie is hurt on behalf of the fellow dead that were in pain and pops back to the house to cover a sleeping Sasha with a blanket.</p><p>As Mitchell has a smoke outside, someone approaches him, thinking he’d be taller. Graham, a fellow vampire. Mitchell asks if he can help with anything and Graham says he’s a bit of a fanboy, visiting all the vampire legends across the world. He especially likes what Mitchell did in Bristol. Mitchell perks up, but Graham just means getting the family to renounce blood. Graham says it’s been a privilege, as Mitchell finds an excuse to leave.</p><p>In the house, Sasha wakes up screaming. “Hungover?” Annie guesses. Annie says they know about the others and the experiments. She tells Sasha that they’re all a bit different and explains what everyone is. Sasha laughs. George wakes up at the smell, pissed that Sasha is still there. He goes to wake Mitchell, who explains that there have been developments. Nina comes in to ask the same thing. Annie and Mitchell explain what they found and that Sasha has nowhere else to go. Downstairs, Sasha tearfully overhears their heated discussion. Mitchell reveals that they all came back when Mitchell was on the other side, spirits couldn’t pass over because of that. They owe her. Annie heads downstairs to find that Sasha is gone.</p><p>At the hospital, Mitchell is on a phone call and sees Graham pass by. Graham has a Mitchell-esque haircut and got a job as a porter just like Mitchell. Graham tells Mitchell that Cara says hello. Mitchell stops him, asks where she is. Graham says she’s “digging up trouble somewhere.”</p><p>Annie finds Sasha standing in front of her home, a large estate. They enter the house where a man is playing Wii. Sasha yells at him for his “mourning,” but as he backs away, he explains that they had a wake, big party, she would have liked it. She goes for a hug, but the man shoves a trophy through her. After he runs off, Annie pulls it out, leaving a large hole. Sasha sits down and finally admits that she’s dead. Annie points out that people can see and hear her, though, and Sasha finally believes that Annie’s a ghost. Sasha points out that Annie is still beautiful, like people always remember the dead as they were at their nicest, never like Sasha is, rotting. She says she can feel the rotting inside her. Annie says they’ll find a way to help her.</p><p>At home, George comes to speak to Nina. He apologizes for them not being normal. He wishes they could just be having a regular discussion about the pros and cons of unwanted pregnancy and Nina explains that it’s not just the wolf complication; she’s got other stuff going around in her head. She explains that her mum was abusive, both physically and emotionally, telling her she was a mistake. George asks why she never told him about it before, and she says there wasn’t a good time. “This thing inside me, whatever it is, it’s a baby. And I will become a mother and that terrifies me more than any werewolf bullshit.” George tells her that she is strong and beautiful and not in this alone, but that’s not enough for Nina.</p><p>In a mood whiplash, INXS plays as Sasha gets ready for a night out, Annie’s idea to take her mind off being, you know, dead. Annie explains this to Mitchell as she makes tea for “Mitchell’s old friend,” Graham, who has been telling Annie about the time they went skiing. Dude, Graham is all Single White Vampire on Mitchell and Mitchell is about to expose him, but Graham drops a hint that he knows about the Box Tunnel. Mitchell laughs and offers Graham the tour, taking him down to the cellar and warning him off. Graham wants to move in and threatens to tell Annie about the train if Mitchell doesn’t let him continue his creepiness. He’s totally taken on Mitchell’s whole loo;k leather jacket, fingerless gloves.</p><p>Upstairs, Annie uses some glue and plaster to make Sasha up and I’m totally reminded of <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. Nina’s gotten dolled up for the girl’s night, too. She assures George that she’s being DD, tonight. Sasha looks more presentable. A little less dead. As the girls leave, George suggests that he and Mitchell get pissed, which Mitchell thinks is a genius idea.</p><p>At the club, Sasha shows Annie and Nina how to pull and dances over to a guy. Nina does not think this is healthy and Annie pulls Nina onto the dance floor.</p><p>At home, Mitchell worries that they’re not back yet, but George reminds him that they’re all adults, and two of them are dead. Mitchell is finally coming to terms with his feelings: he’s terrified to lose her again. George says that their friendsip could become something even better.</p><p>Sasha makes out with a guy in a corner and the guy stops as a friend comes up and slips him some money. She realizes she was a bet and walks over to a mirror. As she walk, her foot breaks. She hobbles out of the room and Annie and Nina follow her as she collapses. She rush her home. They realize that she’s still decaying. None of the others lived long enough to get to that point. As Sasha is bedridden, Annie wants to take her out for lunch; she doesn’t think her “condition” should be an issue. Mitchell hugs her, consoling her. Later, in the kitchen, Graham is talking to Annie and giving her a neckrub as Mitchell comes home. Mitchell grabs him and pulls him out of the room, out of the house, telling him that they are DONE. Graham threatens to tell again and Mitchell says he’s going to tell them himself. Mitchell tells Graham off, telling him he is nothing, and heads back inside. Annie and Nina sit vigil as Sasha lays in bed. She asks Annie not to let them take her, to promise they’ll bury her. Annie does.</p><p>At the hospital, Mitchell is working as George says that he saw Mitchell’s friend Graham, who was acting weird, saying he was going to make Mitchell proud and stuff. Mitchell laughs it off as a joke, but looks through Graham’s locker after George leaves. He finds a book all about the Box Tunnel killing and in it, a Barry Island train schedule marked for today. Mitchell runs to catch Graham, who’s dressed totally goth on the train. Graham stands, but Mitchell is there to stop him. Mitchell tells him not to do this; the hard part is not doing it and Mitchell’s regretted it ever since. Graham says maybe he’ll start with the children. He explains that he killed his own. Nothing’s been real since then. Graham says he wants to be the new legend. As Graham stands again, Mitchell choke holds him and pulls him into the space between cars. Graham threatens to find another train if Mitchell doesn’t kill him. He didn’t kill Cara, so he knows Mitchell doesn’t kill other vampires. Mitchell says the story has to end and stakes the stalker. As he dies, Graham begs Mitchell to tell him that he likes him. Mitchell nods as the creeper turns to dust.</p><p>At home, Nina and Annie sit with Sasha still. Sasha wishes that she’d done more, stayed out more, lived more, loved more. They talked about having a baby, kept putting it off, buying other things. “What does any of that matter now?” Sasha thanks Annie for being her friend and passes on. Next to the bed, a beautiful ghost Sasha appears and heads through her door. “Live, Annie, seize the day,” she says before she passes through. Nina goes to see George and lets him know that Sasha’s gone. She asks George if he’d like to have a little hairy baby with her. Tearfully, George says that he would.</p><p>Downstairs, Mitchell comes home and Annie asks if he’s okay. He says that he’s not and that he needs to tell her something. He explains that he’s done terrible things and he needs to tell her. Annie says he doesn’t; she knows what he is. Everything is in the past, it’s who he is now that counts. She trusts the man that’s done great things for her and George and Nina, that’s who she wants. He asks if she forgives him and she responds with a kiss.</p><p>So, yay! Annie and Mitchell! Finally! And with one of the sweetest kisses I’ve ever seen on a television show. It’s amazing that actors like Aiden Turner and Lenora Crichlow can imbue so much emotion and subtext without words.</p><p>As much as I liked the introduction of new characters last week, I’m kind of glad that it appears to be over (in the previews, we’re going back to the werewolf father and son next week), as it was becoming a bit too formulaic: new character introduced, grates on roommates, grows on them and it’s sad when they leave and they’ve all learned a very important lesson about acceptance afterwards.</p><p>On a personal note, I knew that the George/Nina pregnancy subplot was coming, but hadn’t been spoiled as to Nina’s misgivings about it. The scene where she explains her past to George was really difficult for me to watch because of my own past experience with maternal emotional abuse and my own worries about what kind of mother I’ll make. While I can understand that a 6-9 episode TV series can’t really go into the years of therapy that it actually takes to resolve issues like that (and from the way Nina speaks, it doesn’t seem she’s tried to tackle them before), I can’t help but envy the supernatural lifestyle that would make that decades long process become distilled into one emotional deathbed scene.<br

Unfortunately, her boyfriend's working on it, too... for the other side. Did I mention he used to be her professor? It's messy. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the episode opens, Angela is talking to Brennan about a guy that she’s seeing who’s singing to her and it’s annoying but he’s got this friend and she wants to set the friend up with Brennan. True to form, Brennan is more interested in Zach’s news that one of their papers has been accepted for publication.<span
id="more-35504"></span></p><p>Even more interesting to her? A package that Hodgins has brought in from a mystery visitor. After opening, she takes it and heads out of the lab as the crew follows her. It’s a very attractive man, who says that Brennan left that at his three years ago… he’s just returning it. Brennan asks what he’s doing in town and he says that he’s interviewing at George Washington University . Angela, observing this, thinks this must be Brennan’s ex-lover Michael Stiers, who was also her professor at Northwestern. Ooh, scandal! Booth interrupts their moment by bringing in a fridge. Turns out there’s a body in it and since Booth was told off for contaminating evidence once, he thought he’d just bring the whole thing in. They open it up and Brennan and Michael tag team the estimate as a girl, teens to early 20s, dead about a year. Angela had a sketch ready, but Brennan doesn’t need it as dental records ID the victim as Maggie Schilling, who was kidnapped about a year ago. The kidnappers were asking for a ransom, but suddenly stopped communicating. Angela comments that Michael’s hotter than Brennan said and Brennan claims that they’re completely platonic now. In the next scene, Brennan and Michael have missed their dinner reservation due to naked sexy fun times. They start talking case stuff (cause that’s sexy), and Michael drops a Chekhov’s Hint that they do better together when they’re not competing. Brennan opens up to him that she found stress fractures on Maggie’s wrist, showing her that she fought… despite being in pain, she fought against her captors. It’s really nice to see Brennan opening up to someone who truly understands what she sees in the bones on the table and you can tell it’s nice for Brennan to have someone to open up to.</p><p>At the lab the next day, Brennan arrives (uncharacteristically late) with Michael in tow. The guys of the lab grill him as Brennan asks for his input on the body. Michael says that the marks on the wrists could just be from a medical condition that Zach discovered she had, which made her bones brittle. The girl has had fatal levels of hydromorphone in her system. Booth heads to talk to Maggie’s parents. At first, they’d hoped that Maggie had just run away from home… she’d been having drug problems, had been to rehab to no avail. They don’t recall her using hydromorphone, though, and say her endocrinologist would know more about what she was taking. At the doctor’s office, he explains that her condition didn’t cause her pain, so he didn’t prescribe that, but Maggie was always trying to get him to give her samples of pain pills. She’d even harass the office manager for them, and he suspected that she was giving them to the girl. Incidentally, that office manager was fired shortly before Maggie went missing. When Booth and Brennan visit the fired office manager, Mary Costello, they find that she and her husband Scott did take Maggie in. Maggie was neglected by her parents and they offered a “safe” place for her. Booth checks out the kitchen and finds a pretty new refrigerator with old rusty marks underneath that might match the one they found Maggie in. One house search later, they find a pleasure dungeon in the basement… Maggie was more than a friend, she was their sex partner.</p><p>In interrogation, Booth thinks that the Costellos kidnapped their friend Maggie thinking they could make a quick buck off her parents. They kept her on pain pills to keep her quiet and accidentally gave her too many. Their lawyer states that they maintain that they had a completely consensual relationship with Maggie and had nothing to do with her death. In the lab, Brennan is really excited to show Michael all her evidence, but he’s got a meeting to get to. They make a dinner wager and Michael gives Brennan ten minutes. He’s not convinced at the first glance of the evidence he saw before and says it can all be chalked up to the medical condition. Time to pull out the big guns, so they turn on Angela’s magic machine, showing that how Maggie was bound would have caused excess pain and infection. This impresses Michael  so much that he asks to see the findings. He looks at them and he thinks that the case is indisputable and yields. After Michael leaves, Angela approaches Brennan, worried about whether Michael can handle Brennan’s level of professional success. Angela saw hurt in him when he was proven wrong by Brennan’s findings. Brennan still claims they’re not involved. As Brennan gets back to work, Booth comes in to let her know that her initial findings have the Costellos being held in jail without bail. However, there’s some bad news: the meeting that Michael was going to? It was with the Costello’s lawyer. He’s going to be their expert witness.</p><p>At dinner, Brennan lets Michael know that she is upset about earlier and feels like he was spying on her. He reminds her that all the evidence would be entered anyway and she says that her methods for arriving at her conclusions wouldn’t. The university wanted him to take this one since it’ll be part of his job there. The next day, Michael is at the lab, examining the evidence himself, carefully watched by everyone. Oh, and he has some “opposing opinions” or corrections, as Brennan interprets. Booth arranges a meeting with the DA and Joy Deavers, a jury consultant, for Brennan and Deavers states it blatantly “Juries don’t like you.” She’s concerned that the jury will love Michael Stiers and think Brennan is condescending. Brennan doesn’t like being told this, but Booth reminds her that it’s all about the case, it’s not personal.</p><p>In court, the prosecution and defense make their cases. Booth takes the stand and explains to the jury that they had hydromorphone and speaks about the marks on the floor from the old fridge. He gives too much opinion and gets an objection levied on him, but the damage is done. Hodgins explains the bug stuff and Angela explains how she made a sketch. They are both charismatic. Brennan takes the stand and loses the jury with numbers, despite her cheerful blue shirt. She would totally lose me, too, jury lady. When the DA rephrases in lay terms Brennan just replies “I just said that.” Deavers knows that they’re going to lose because Brennan “can’t connect.” Brennan asks Booth if he agrees and he admits to partly agreeing, claiming she was hard to follow. He tells her to perform more, let the jury see how the case gets to her. As she storms back into the courtroom, she runs into Michael and vents to him about how the jury consultant just doesn’t get scientists. He reminds her that they can’t talk about the case and heads to the stand himself. He claims that the drug levels are more indicative of recreational use. He feigns not being used to used to being on the stand and even goes on to condemn his “former student” for having faulty conclusions to further her own opinion. The DA objects to all the personal stuff, but again, the damage is done. Brennan is pissed off about that.</p><p>Deavers rails on Brennan again for not understanding that perception is everything in a courtroom. Brennan wants another chance on the stand and goes back to her office to review everything again. Jeffersonian Boss Dr. Goodman (who’s been MIA for like two episodes) gives her a pep talk, confirming that she’s smart; he even hired her over Michael Stiers two years ago. Because she is more rational, empirical and because she cares.</p><p>At the court the next day, Michael defends himself saying he was just listening to his reasonable doubt. Brennan’s not accepting it. In the courtroom, Booth has asked the DA to ask Brennan a specific question, but the DA balks. Booth says to do it. Brennan is back on the stand and not doing well again. The DA interrupts to ask her why she became a forensic anthropologist. The prosecutor objects, but the DA defends that Dr. Stiers wondered the same when he was on the stand. Overruled. Ha! The DA Brings up Brennan’s missing parents. She doesn’t answer at first, but confirms that is why she looks for answers. It gets her riled up. “Are you as cold and unfeeling as you seem?” the DA asks. After a pause, Brennan goes into one of the first times we get one of her heartfelt speeches:</p><blockquote><p>I see a face on every skull. I can look at bones and tell you how they walked. Maggie Schilling is real to me. The pain she suffered is real. Her hip was being eaten away by infection from lying on her side. Sure, like Dr. Stiers said, the disease could contribute to that if you take it out of context. But you can’t break Maggie Schilling down into little pieces. She was a whole person who fought to free herself. Her wrists were broken from struggling against the handcuffs. The bones in her ankle were ground together because they were tied. And her side her hip and her shoulder were being eaten by infection. And the more she struggled, the more pain she was in so they gave her those drugs to keep her quiet. They gave her so much it killed her. These facts can’t be ignored or dismissed because you think I’m boring or obnoxious because I don’t matter. What I feel doesn’t matter. Only she matters. Only Maggie.</p></blockquote><p>Even Michael looks contrite after that and outside, begs to know what he can do. Booth lets Brennan know that the Costellos want a plea. Brennan said he had no right, but Booth reminds him that was his case, too.</p><p>In the lab, Angela is glad that they were found guilty on all counts. Brennan says she won’t be seeing Michael anymore. Angela offers to take her out, but she wants to work. Booth comes in and Brennan doesn’t feel forgiving, but he has a case for her. At the scene, Booth apologizes for revealing her past and Brennan admits that she probably would have done the same thing. The camera pulls back and in one of the most ludicrous things ever, the body they found is on the side of the Washington Monument. And we’ll never even get to see that investigation. Poo!</p><p>This was another one of the early episodes that had a big impact for me and it has me wishing we saw more of the trial process occasionally. It’s one of those <em>things</em> that I think when watching shows like CSI: <em>don’t they ever get really open and shut cases?</em> Well, yeah, sometimes they do, but it’s still not easy. I like the acknowledgement that part of Brennan’s job <em>would</em> be to be an expert witness and that her lack of social skills might make that difficult. Another thought that I always have is <em>Why aren’t these ever just accidents?</em> and <em>Bones</em> is really great at throwing one of those in every so often, too, but that’s another week.</p><p>What I can’t decide whether I like or not is that while Brennan and Michael’s earlier relationship was discussed, other than Zach trying to wrap his head about whether he and Brennan would have a relationship like that, the fact that Brennan and Michael had a relationship while she was his student isn’t really addressed. He defends it briefly to Booth, stating that “Tempe” was a 23-year-old consenting adult. But… she was still his student. It’s still against pretty much every university code. I just… I don’t know that I can be okay with that. Maybe that just makes her smack down of him in the courtroom that much sweeter. I don’t know.<br

Annie decides to be Mitchell's guardian angel with mixed results and Mitchell is given a Get Out Of Town Free card... but will he take it?]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A son tells his father that he doesn’t know why they have to move. Dad tells the son, Adam, that it’s all for him, they don’t want to move either. They don’t blame him, but people are asking questions. Adam starts to head for his mom, saying he’s hungry, but Dad says he’ll do it this time and unbuttons the top button on his shirt. Adam’s a vampire, guys!<span
id="more-34866"></span></p><p>At the house, Nina checks in with Annie, asks how she’s feeling, but Annie’s not wanting to talk about her time in purgatory at all. Mitchell’s got an interview for a cleaning job at the hospital that afternoon and Annie wants to make him some pancakes to build his stregnth. Mitchell tells her that he didn’t bring her back so she can cook. He missed her; they all missed her, he quickly adds. Annie wants to go with him on the interview; she’s his guardian angel now, she says. At the hospital, Nina goes into a patient room and finds Adam, the boy from before, munching on said patient. George and Nina run after him and Nina corners him as he finds a dead end. He throws a dog-related insult her way and says he’s not just a naughty kid and Nina agrees he’s a bit past that.</p><p>At Mitchell’s interview, he’s a little nervous and Annie is both helping and hindering. More of the hindering, though. Mitchell looks like he’s talking to himself. She’s not being a great guardian angel yet. George and Nina pull Adam into another room. He was feeding from his dad, who’s a lot older than we last saw him because Adam’s 46 now. Nina thinks they need to take him back to the house, have Mitchell watch him until his dad recovers, but George doesn’t think it’s a great idea. It’s the only thing, though, so George takes him home. As Mitchell heads home, a man approaches him, telling him he’s a hard man to find. Richard Hargreaves, carpet exporter by day, there on behalf of the Old Ones. Hargreaves tells Mitchell to come with him, they need to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.</p><p>At home, Adam says the place looks like a shithole and then crudely hits on Annie. George sends him upstairs and tells Annie not to ask. George shows Adam to a room for him.</p><p>Hargreaves walks with Mitchell near a train yard and lectures him about the ramifications of his actions. It’s the biggest manhunt in a century, he put them all at risk. The Old Ones want Mitchell to join them in South America and Hargreaves has arranged for him to travel with his next carpet shipment. Mitchell doesn’t want to go because he knows he won’t come back.</p><p>Mitchell comes home and doesn’t think he can help the kid. Staying clean for him is a minute by minute thing, Adam could make him worse. Adam comes down and offers a fist bump to Mitchell, offering to be his new wingman as the young looking 46-year-old is a “registered poon hound.” George asks Adam if he’s even actually ever touched a boob, let alone had sex with a woman before flouncing off. Mitchell still doesn’t want Adam anywhere near him. Adam explains that no one’s ever taught him how to do this. Annie interrupts to tell Mitchell about phase two of her Get Mitchell a Job plan. He’s not interested. George comes down to look for Adam. Nina’s called from the hospital. Adam’s dad has taken a turn for the worse, but he’s been asking for Adam.</p><p>Adam comes to see his dad, who is concerned that he’d fed and that someone is looking after him. Adam tells his dad that they (meaning his parents) gave him too much. “What else could we do?” his dad replies and tells him that he was always their little boy. Adam begs his dad not to leave him, that he’s scared, but a door opens. Adam’s dad stands at it and says he doesn’t know before passing through. As George and Nina let Adam mourn privately, George is concerned: “Adam hasn’t just lost his dad, he’s lost his food supply.” And sure enough, Adam’s bolted out the window and set to stalking some girls heading to a casino. George and Nina somehow manage to follow him there and then manage to catch him as he’s taking one of the girls away to feed on her. I guess we’ll chalk it up to their extra-awesome sense of smell.</p><p>At home, Mitchell excuses Adam by explaining that he just needed to feed, but he still can’t have the kid in the house. After a pause, Mitchell says that maybe Hargreaves can help them. George and Nina take the really weak seeming Adam to a large creepy house to meet with Hargreaves. A woman answers the door and says, “This must be Adam,” welcoming him in before tells the two werewolves to wipe their feet. Hargreaves and his wife feed Adam up with some blood, but George and Nina have to put some paper down before they can sit on the couches. Hargreaves shows George and Nina their set up: they’ve got a guy in a gimp mask happily chained in the basement that they feed on. Hargreaves even takes him out for play and tickle time. He’s number seven. Numbers 1-6 are buried in their garden. Seven speaks up for himself. He had everything on paper, but still felt ordinary. He volunteered for this; with the Hargreaves, he feels special.</p><p>Mitchell drowns his sorrows as he watches TV and suddenly there’s a report just for him, all about the wolf-shaped bullet that’s headed his way. He walks away, but it does get to him. George and Nina arrive home and discuss the extreme cleanliness and huge TV of the Hargreaves. Also the fact that they’re filthy, racist assholes. They don’t want Adam to be with those terrible people and head back there. Annie pops upstairs to let Mitchell know he missed a call. He doesn’t think it’ll be good, but because of Annie’s recommendation, he’s still being offered the job. Annie is ecstatic but Mitchell is conflicted. He grabs the passport pack that Hargreaves gave him and leaves.</p><p>At the Hargreaves, wife Emma has dressed up Adam nicely in one of Number Two’s suits. She shows him into a room where there are lots of vampires feeding and people being fed on. Adam’s overwhelmed, though, and Emma takes him upstairs for a more private party. George and Nina arrive and head up to look for Adam. In the upstairs room, the pool table is covered in plastic and Hargreaves announces that Number Seven’s time has arrived. Adam will drink him dry. George and Nina look around and George looks into the first room, asking Nina to gouge out his eyes later at what he saw. They hear cries of “Drink! Drink!” upstairs and Nina grabs a golf club for a weapon as George grabs a plant. They burst in and Hargreaves lectures them on their “blunt morality,” suggesting they leave the decision up to Adam. Adam chooses George and Nina. Hargreaves goes to attack George, but is stopped by his Star of David. He tells Adam that they are not his people and Adam says, “Tell it to someone who gives a shit.” George and Nina take Adam away.</p><p>Annie and Mitchell take a walk along the water front. Mitchell tells her to chill with the helping him. “You can’t base your life on other people, they may not always be there.” Annie doesn’t understand how something changed in a day. “What do you think I came back for? To a world where I can’t be seen or heard or touched? All I have is you, and Nina and George. You are my life,” she explains.</p><p>At home, George says they’ll pass Adam off as his brother for now. Eventually, he’ll become their son. Mitchell is upset that Adam’s back, but Nina explains what the place was like. Adam says he can’t let them do this like his parents did, though, wants a chance to try and take care of himself. Mitchell opens up the envelope and gives the cash to Adam, telling him not to ask where it came from. Adam asks how he’ll fight off the cravings. “You surround yourself with good people,” Mitchell explains. People better than he is. People like the ones Mitchell has. The next day, Nina and George wait with Adam at the station and Nina asks him to keep in touch. As Nina and George leave, the same girl from the day before is at the station, too. She wants to finish where they left off yesterday, but Adam turns her down. Nina and George watch this from afar and George remarks “I think he’s going to be okay.” “I think we all are,” Nina replies.</p><p>In the mortuary, though, a bloody hand hits the window.</p><p>I think it’s interesting that no one points out that Mitchell essentially condemns Bernie and his mother (from season 1) to a similar fate as the one that Adam has played out with his parents. It might be a secondary motivation for Mitchell’s reticence at having Adam in the house, but I wish someone had made some mention of it. After having such touching moments together last episode, Mitchell and Annie seem to be mutually pulling away from each other, though, which I’m not sure that I like.</p><p>The dynamic between George, Nina and Adam is interesting, as well. From reluctant surrogates to crusading protectors, they quickly bond with the man-child, despite his perviness. I wonder where this might be going.<br

He’s 24 hours away from execution, but doubts are raised as to his guilt. Booth enlists Brennan and team to put those doubts to rest one way or another. <span
id="more-34388"></span></p><p>Brennan has put in an application for a concealed weapons license, and Booth is charged with reviewing it. Unfortunately, he doesn’t like the answers. He reminds Brennan that she’s been arrested for a felony before, and Brennan reminds him that he was the one who arrested her AND she only shot the guy because he was going to set her on fire. Booth isn’t having it, though, and denies her request. Is that even his place or part of his job? I don’t get him sometimes. Anyway, as they’re arguing about it, a pretty lawyer, Amy Morton, walks up to Booth. He snarks that he thought she was barred from the building. She’s the new lawyer for Howard Epps, who is scheduled to be executed tomorrow. Since Booth was the main agent involved in his case, she wants him to review some of the questionable things she’s found, specifically the pubic hair that was not the victim’s that was completely ignored in his first trial. He wants nothing to do with it, but Amy appeals to his older, smarter, less angry side, and he agrees to go see Epps. At the jail, Epps speaks tearfully to Booth about what he heard execution feels like and implores him to look at the case again. He swears he didn’t kill April Wright.</p><p>Back at the lab, it’s a slow night. Hodgins and Zach are racing bugs, and Brennan is working on some skull restructuring. Angela tells all those losers that she’s going to go have a life… and sex. Booth comes into Brennan’s office and asks if Brennan can review the case. Brennan asks what the deal is with him and lawyers and asks him if this is a favor for him or for the pretty lawyer. It’s a personal favor for him. Brennan agrees. Since she can’t work with the actual remains, she needs all the original evidence. Booth promises it in an hour.</p><p>Twenty-nine hours to go until execution. Brennan spots some foreign matter on an x-ray that wasn’t seen before. She sends Zach out to the crime scene to take pictures. April Wright’s father calls Booth after hearing that there might be a stay of execution, so Booth heads to talk to him but tells the squints to keep working. At the crime scene, Zach notices numbers all around on the ground on a picnic area. He realizes that what investigators thought was a phone number was actually a code. April was meeting someone in the spot where she died. When he shares this insight back at the lab, Brennan reveals that the foreign matter on the bones is most likely quartz, possibly from gravel. There was no gravel where the body was found. This is enough to make Brennan think it’s worth exhuming the body.</p><p>At the Wrights’, Booth is trying to console the distraught parents without revealing that he’s the one that’s opening this up again. David Ross, a family friend, and their lawyer, is there. The parents comment how April looked up to David and worked in his firm. When David brushes aside the forgotten pubic hair, Booth realizes that David was probably sleeping with April (he had admitted to being with her at work earlier that night). He starts to question David on it, but David asks for a lawyer.</p><p>As Brennan and Amy head out to a judge’s home to ask for permission to exhume, Amy presses Brennan on the sexual tension between her and Booth, but Brennan denies being into him. At Judge Caan’s, he’s really pissed about being woken up in the middle of the night, but after looking at what they’ve brought, he agrees to the exhumation order. He just hopes, for their sake, those shadows aren’t just bone. Booth’s got problems of his own, as his boss has called him in, threatening to suspend him for this stunt. Booth says he’s doing this on his own time, as are all the squints; he just wants to make sure all the loose ends are tied off. Boss relents, reminding him not to give Brennan a gun (but suggesting that if she shoots anyone, it’d better be Booth).</p><p>After the remains have been exhumed, Brennan finds that is it gravel on the bone fragments, and there’s some particulates on the skull as well. Booth gets a court order and gets some of David Ross’s DNA for testing, and it’s a match. Booth, Brennan, and Amy heads to the judge again, hoping it’s enough for a stay, who complains about a lack of sleep. The prosecutor is there, too, and points out that Amy is just reiterating old evidence that’s already been judged. David Ross hasn’t even confessed to having sex with her yet. Amy urges the judge to hear Booth’s opinion, and Booth says that there are doubts; he thinks there shouldn’t be an execution. The judge agrees, but he needs certainties.</p><p>As they head back to the lab, Brennan wants to check the skull again. Amy rails against the barbaric death penalty, but Brennan reveals that she believes in it. She’s seen genocide; the people who perpetrate that deserve to be sentenced to death, but the “facts have to add up,” she explains. The squints have been working on the skull, and the particulates are pollen, transferred from the murder weapon, most likely a tire iron. The only place they’re found is along the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>Booth pulls David in for questioning and tells him that he’s been clouding the investigation by lying about his relationship with April. He claims that he only met her to talk. He didn’t know it was her first time, but she got upset and ran off. He found her eventually, but she didn’t want him to take her home. She called a friend and he left around 2 a.m. What a nice dude.</p><p>Brennan wants a dozen agents and GPRS devices to search some areas for the weapon, so Booth goes to ask his boss. He eventually consents, again reminding Booth: no gun for Brennan. With just over an hour to go, they arrive at the marsh and find a tire iron. Unfortunately, they’ve found something else, too. Brennan begins to dig, but Booth doesn’t want to get his expensive suit dirty. Brennan reminds him that she’s been up for 48 hours for him. “Dig.” He does, and he finds a skull. So does Brennan. Both bodies are female, 17-25, blunt trauma to the skull, and both have been dead over five years. Booth doesn’t think it fits with David Ross being the killer and realizes that they’ve been played. Epps saw Ross with April and knew fingers could point there. He knew that pointing them toward Ross would cast doubts on Epps’ guilt if they didn’t find his killing grounds, and if they did, there’d be a stay of execution while the other murders were investigated. Booth picks up his phone and says that if he doesn’t make the call, Epps dies in half an hour. Brennan says these women deserve to be heard: “It’s what we do.”</p><p>At the jail, Epps still claims not to have killed the women and thanks Dr. Brennan, but they’re not buying it. He tells Amy he’ll need a good lawyer for all the new cases and explains that he should be dead by now… “It’s all gravy.” By the time they get around to the next trials, there might not even be a death penalty. He reminds Amy that’s her dream, right? Amy leaves, and Epps turns to Brennan. He read her book and knew she’d be just what he needed. He goes to shake her hand, and she twists it and slams it down on the table. “Gonna arrest me for assault?” she asks Booth. Nope — it was self defense; he saw it.</p><p>So, Howard Epps. I don’t even know whether the producers were planning it or not, but this isn’t the last time we’ll see Howard Epps, and he starts a grand tradition of killers who sit in the background, popping back up over the course of multiple seasons to haunt our characters (the most epic being the Gravedigger).</p><p>Another thing I really like about this episode is that it reminds us that all these characters had lives and careers before this show. Booth might just be a hot FBI agent to us, but he’s had partners before Brennan and put people away without the squints. And this Booth that we are getting to know is maybe a different person than he was before… as Amy says, “smarter, less angry.” The Booth that put Epps away had probably still not recovered from the terrible things he’d seen as a ranger. Even seasons later, it’s still being addressed.</p><p>I remember seeing this episode for the first time, and like Amy, I was idealistic. Brennan will get to the end of this… he’s going to be innocent… I’d love to see someone be innocent for once. On rewatch, I couldn’t help but feel bad for Amy, knowing the gut punch that she will get at the end.<br

Mitchell goes to purgatory to find Annie and has to face up to his past. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Previously on <em>Being Human</em>, everything went to shit. Mitchell killed a lot of people after being betrayed by his girlfriend, George and Nina almost died and Annie was sent to purgatory. The remaining roommates were forced to leave Bristol and go on the run.<span
id="more-33833"></span></p><p>As season three opens, the roommates look through a house. One wall is entirely wallpapered to look like a beach scene. It was a bed and breakfast. The realtor asks how many will be moving in and it’s not just the three of them; a fourth will be joining them soon, Mitchell insists. There’s a basement gym which Nina and George are very interested in. As Mitchell watches a TV report about the Boxcar Massacre, he sees Annie calling for help. Down in the basement gym, George thinks it’s the perfect place to transform, for one of them at least. Nina confides that she’s uncomfortable around Mitchell now, she thinks he’s changed. Annie tells Mitchell they’re building a special room just for her: hell, they’re taking her to hell.</p><p>Two men talk about werewolves in a pub, just the Benicio Del Toro movie, though. The older of the two says it makes it seem trivial. Anyway, they can’t afford two tickets. The older man eventually agrees, but they have to eat a good meal tonight, big day tomorrow. The older man heads to a local fun fair that shut down, looking for copper wire, something to sell. He doesn’t know, but he’s being watched by an unsavory batch of characters in a van. One of them howls as they get out. The man is suddenly surrounded by the gang, but holds his own as he fends them off. Until he doesn’t. An older man, with fangs, demands to know where “the other one” is: “We heard there were two of you.” The young man comes running out as the gang of vampires puts the older man, his dad, into the van.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Don't you love it when pretty people have sexytimes awkwardness?</p></div><p>At their new home, Nina shows off some sexy new lingerie to George. She had a little left over after paying some bills so… George says she made absolutely the right decision. It’s so nice to see George and Nina uncomplicated again, especially once their sexiness turns into calamity as Nina gets her hair stuck in George’s glasses. It turns into even more awkward comedy as Mitchell interrupts to ask for a radio. The moment is lost and Nina turns over to sleep. Downstairs, Mitchell is gathering together electrical things to try to tune Annie in better. It doesn’t work.</p><p>George and Nina have found a new hospital to work at and Nina is briefing Mitchell on a patient that’s about to die, but George thinks it’s too close to the full moon to chance anything funny. They need to take this chance for a door to open, though, and Nina agrees. Mitchell and George wait at the bedside, George singing a Jewish prayer. Mitchell reminds George that he’s not big on religious rituals, but George replies “tough.” As they do a crossword, the man, Sean, dies. He appears at his bedside and Mitchell talks him through the door process, tells him he’s coming with him. The door appears and Mitchell psychs himself up to go through. Sean opens the door and takes Mitchell’s hand as they step through. He asks “Is this it? Is it all over now?” Mitchell tells him that he did good and can rest now. Mitchell turns back and tells George that this isn’t his fault; everything that did happen would have happened sooner and worse if they hadn’t met. George tells him to find Annie and come back as Mitchell steps through.</p><p>On the other side, a woman greets Mitchell. Her name is Lia and she is not shy about hitting on Mitchell. Lia explains that Sean’s already gone on to his own stuff. Mitchell asks if they’ve met before; she cryptically says “Age 12,” but it’s a riddle he has to figure out. They’re in Mitchell’s purgatory. A corridor, filled with all the good things and the bad and he has to choose a door. It’s like a quiz show and tonight’s prize is a soul, Lia jokes. Mitchell steps through to France. July 17, 1917. There’s a corporal who’s dead— poisoned. Mitchell goes to leave, but he can’t. He wants to go get Annie, but Lia tells him maybe there’s something they need to learn and asks who the dead man was. He was Mitchell’s first, Arthur. He’d been with the vampires a month, but didn’t want to believe that’s what he was and ran back to his regiment. And then he ran away again after killing his friend. As Lia comes on to Mitchell (for the umpteenth time. I’m not slut shaming, I just find it really awkward and creepy, but I can’t pinpoint exactly why), Annie’s voice comes over a radio. They’re about to move her; there’s going to be a parade. Lia finds the door is opened as Annie stops talking again.</p><p>George heads out to the woods to prepare for the full moon, but soon finds he isn’t alone. The young man from before is out there. And he has a chicken on a string, just like George. The boy goes running off and George runs after him. He runs past Rhys from <em>Torchwood</em>, who asks if he’s going to “Watch or Play?” They’re a friendly bunch, Not-Rhys explains, gesturing to all the cars parked around them. Oh, no, what is going on here? He can’t explain much more, though, because the police turn up and pull all the people who were hanging around there in. They take George’s phone away from him as he unsuccessfully tries to call Nina.</p><p>Mitchell is getting frustrated now and demands that Lia take him to Annie. She tells him that’s not the way it works and directs him to pick another door. Behind this one is Sheffield. December 24, 1960. There’s a woman, bloody and dead next to the bed. Sally. They met in a pub, came back there, got drunk. Lia’s confused. He’s less in control the older he gets as a vampire. With Arthur, it was kind for him and torture for Mitchell. For Sally, there were drinks and seduction, Mitchell enjoyed it. Mitchell sees Annie crying out from the TV and the door opens. “What happens next is your choice,” Lia warns.</p><p>In a dingy basement somewhere, the older vampire from the gang before is now the ringleader of a small, disturbing circus of vampires and he’s getting the crowd riled up for a dog fight. They bring the father out and place him in a cage in the center of the room. The ringleader announces the other contestant: Paul James, an ordinary human. He gets put into the cage, too, and a knife is slid to him from the outside.</p><p>At the police station, George is put in a cell with Not-Rhys. He starts changing and apologizes to the other man. Back in the cage, the ringleader tells Paul that he bets he’ll last two minutes as Father starts to change. George tells Not-Rhys to kill him, it’s the only way Not-Rhys can live. Nina turns up, demanding to see George. She’s his doctor, she explains, he has a serious medical condition. She’s fighting back her own transformation as the officer says that maybe they should let her have him. They pull George out and Nina gathers his stuff as they leave quickly. They find a gated stone wall and duck in it, hoping it’s a good place to transform. George worries that they’ll kill each other if they transform together, but they have no choice. He apologizes for all this and as they transform, she looks at him and tells her she loves him. They transform and the effects for it have gotten even more agonizing since the last time we saw them. In the cage, the father transforms, too, and the stunned Paul drops his knife.</p><p>Mitchell stands at another door and Lia says that he can just go back, say he tried, but it was impossible, they’ll understand. “No,” Mitchell says, “I need to do this.” This door is the Boxcar and all his victims, bloody and gross as they are, stand up and begin to surround him. He goes to seat 12 and finds Lia. She was a bit sad that he didn’t remember her, given how much he remembered about the other two. She introduces Mitchell to his other victims: a teacher, all her students have been having nightmares; the driver, who had five kids; Mary, just recovered from breast cancer. Mitchell asks Lia to stop. She tells him he’s lying to himself and he protests that he’s trying to change. “You want forgiveness every day,” she spits at him. “You get a smile from me and it proves you’re not completely evil. You do a thousand small nice things and you put them against the bad. You actually do the sums in your head, don’t you? Why did you come here? For Annie or for you?” Mitchell insists he came for Annie, and goaded by Lia, lashes out, admits that he’s an animal, a murderer, without conscious. “I hacked my way through the world, I left a trail of blood a thousand miles long and I loved it.” He apologizes and after a moment, Lia lets him know that he can have Annie back, but there’s a price. Mitchell asks what it is and offers to be taken to all his victims, he wants to suffer. Lia says that it’s not that simple. His time and place of death are already set as parts of someone else’s story: a werewolf, a wolf shaped bullet. Lia lets him go, with that punishment, knowing that he has an inevitable fate.</p><p>George wakes up and hears the sweetest sound, Nina admiring his ass. He’s so glad they’re both okay. He goes to put his clothes back on and wonders if they… Nina realizes they definitely did. “Nice.”</p><p>Lia goes to visit Annie. Annie thinks she’ll be going to the other room now, but Lia tells her she’s free to go. She’s still dead, of course, and someday she’ll come back through the right door, but for right now, Mitchell’s waiting. Lia asks if there’s anything between them, but Annie says they’re just friends. Lia tells Annie that she thinks that they’d be cute together; it might be fate. As Annie leaves, she asks Lia what happened to her. “A very bad thing. It’s okay. We play the long game here.” Annie runs out and down a corridor, she sees Mitchell. She runs for him. “You saved me.” “You saved me, too,” Michell replies. She asks if there was a trade-off and he says nothing. As they’re suddenly outside, Annie wonders where they are and Mitchell explains that they moved. To Wales. Barrie Island. Annie jokes that she wants to go back to purgatory.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Break my heart, why don't you, Russell Tovey?</p></div><p>George and Nina sit quietly as Mitchell comes in. George cries, thinking Mitchell came back alone, but tea is poured for him and he looks up and sees a tearful Annie. He jumps up to hug her and Nina runs over to hug her and it’s just a beautiful moment. She can touch things again and they dance around and play in front of the terrible beach wall as she voices over:</p><blockquote><p>My name is Annie Clare Sawyer. And two years ago I died. But in so many ways that’s when my life began. In the company of horrors, I learned about friendship and loyalty, sacrifice and courage. Humanity isn’t a species. It’s a state of mind. It can’t be defeated. It moves mountains, it saves souls. We were blessed as much as we were cursed. In this little enclave of the lost, I witnessed the very best of being human. We were safe here. While outside, the monsters prowled.</p></blockquote><p>Back at the cage, the ringleader tells Father that he just lost him fifty quid, but he’s got talent. They’ll look after him, he promises, get him toys. He speaks, for the first time since they’ve had him. His name is McNair, he informs the ringleader. Behind the vampire, someone comes up and stakes him in the back. It’s the son. Before his body turns to dust, he takes a gold filling out of the vampire’s mouth. The son lets McNair out and tells him that it wasn’t his fault. McNair calls for his son, Tom, and Tom informs him that he saw another one of them. Another wolf.</p><p>This is such an amazing first episode of the season. From the moments of ordinary comedy (Nina not getting the call because she was on the toilet; Annie wishing to still be in purgatory) to the moments that break your heart (George’s everlasting remorse and Nina’s new-found acceptance; Annie’s closing monologue that brings tears to my eyes just reading it), this is <em>Being Human</em> at its top form. The new characters bring some freshness without feeling like a retread of stories gone by and it’s interesting to see a subplot similar to one in the U.S. version (the U.S. writers reportedly hadn’t seen anything beyond season 1 of the U.K. series), but done with a slightly grittier edge. Lia, though, I don’t quite know what to make of yet. “Age 12” doesn’t seem to mesh with her being in seat 12 on the train. I feel like there’s something more to her and I don’t like it.</p><div

They walk down hallways into a small chapel  where they join Kemp in prayer. In a room at the institute, Lucy wake  up. She sees a bloody woman sitting at the desk next to her. The woman  says “It’s coming,” and laughs as she licks her lips. <span
id="more-32165"></span>Lucy looks away  and the woman is gone. Back at the institute, one of the young priests  in training picks up a sign as he tries not to look at the four coffins  in the room. Kemp and the young men stand on a corner to proselytize. At  the end of the day, them come back and the same young man finds himself  unable to not stare at George, who is getting a medical workup. The  young man visits George and the invisible Annie, who is being translated  by the psychic. George reminds him that he can hear Annie. Annie thinks  it’s weird that the “weird bible guy” can’t see her; only George, the  psychic, Nina and Kemp know she’s there. George and Annie have realized  that Lucy is Mitchell’s girlfriend. George isn’t being allowed protein,  because it will strengthen the demon. George is doing it because it’s  the only think Nina’s asked of him. Annie is worried about Mitchell.  George tries to pretend that he was drunk, but Annie knows he’s done  something.</p><p>Kemp  dictates some notes about George and Annie as the nervous young man  brings him tea. Kemp takes a moment to linger on a Garfield mug in his  drawer: Lucy’s. Creepster. Lucy enters and tells Kemp about seeing the  woman, Amy McBride. Lucy thinks that retribution is what’s coming. Kemp  thinks the alternative is letting the infection spread; they’re doing  “good work.”</p><p>In  her room, Annie talks with the psychic. She’s glad to have him around,  someone to talk to, since George has Nina. Annie confides that George  doesn’t know why she’s really there. Downstairs, Nervous Tea Boy brings  the tech his cuppa. Nervous Boy sees body bags and asks what they are.  Tech says they’re for the type threes. Tech wants to get him away (he  sees Nina undressing on a monitor), so tells him to head down to Londis  for some milk. A shadow passes by the coffins. The tech gets to  masturbating and doesn’t notice a door open behind him. The nervous boy  doesn’t notice the dead person next to him either.</p><p>Lucy  finds George hanging out near the chamber and discusses faith with him.  She outed herself as a believer scientist by writing a book on  intelligent design. It didn’t go well. George tells her that he knows  about her and Mitchell. She claims that she was using him; she messed  up, lost sight of why she was there. George asks if she loved him and  she nods. He tells her that Mitchell’s gone now. George can’t help  feeling she’s dangerous. Lucy thinks that’s the wolf telling him that.  He feels like it’s him.</p><p>George  goes to talk to Nina. Annie’s been crying, she’s so worried about  Mitchell. George wants to leave and find him, which Nina isn’t too happy  about. Nina thinks he’s chickening out. George is frightened it will  work. He’s been hiding behind it for two years and doesn’t know how to  live without it now. Nina thinks this is an opportunity for them to have  a real chance with each other, nothing to hide behind. He lets her know  that he’ll stay. He goes to the front desk to make a phone call and as  it rings, a ring echoes throughout the institute. The shadow claims  another victim. George gets the voicemail and tells Mitchell off for  just running off on them. He tries the landline to check messages and  finds two messages. First is Annie’s.</p><blockquote><p>For  so long now I’ve been tired, frightened. The prospect of this scream of  time in front of me is terrifying. Do you remember, George, I was  going to pass over and you couldn’t understand why because I didn’t know  what lay beyond. I love you boys. ‘Cause it was through you two  that I’ve really truly lived.</p></blockquote><p>As  George listens to the message, Annie sits with the psychic as he jokes  around with her. George chokes back tears and doesn’t even listen to the  second message.</p><p>The  tech goes to the bathroom and finds a bloody body dripping down on him.  He goes to Kemp and Lucy and shows them the security footage he’s just  noticed. Lucy knows that it was Mitchell. The tech spots that the body  bags are missing. Kemp thinks he’s looking for all of them, especially  Lucy, though. Kemp wants Lucy to go to the observation room and lock  herself in for safety. Kemp calls one of the young men over. He informs  the young man that once they deal with Mitchell, it’s time to neutralize  George and Nina. The young man goes to get them, but George wants to  stop and speak to Annie. He confronts her about the message. Annie  defends that he would have tried to stop her. Annie reminds him that if  he’s cured, he won’t be able to see her; then nobody will be able to  see her. George says he’ll stay, but Annie reminds him that he has Nina.  Outside, Nina notices that the young man is really nervous. Inside,  George encourages her to wait, just one more day. They exchange friendly  “I love you”s and Annie just feels frightened. The young man comes in to  hustle George out.</p><p>Kemp  hears the lift going and stands to wait with the tech. Lucy runs into  the observation room and locks herself in. The lift arrives but there’s  only a body bag. Mitchell is already in the room with Lucy.</p><p>George  and Nina are locked in a chamber and George feels that something isn’t  right. Nina distracts him with a game of I Spy. She spots some writing.  George goes to read it, showing off his nice arse to Nina. He reads it.  “George, All the werewolves die. Tully.” George tells Nina they need to  get out. He bangs on the door, shouting that something’s wrong with Nina  to get a young man to open the door.</p><p>In  the observation room, Mitchell wants to know where George and Annie  are. She assures him that they’re still alive. Mitchell wants to know if  anything wasn’t a lie. She claims the explosion was a sidetrack. He  claims it was ethnic cleansing and accuses her of betraying him. She  throws back the people he just killed at him. Reiterates that they were  just trying to help the werewolves. Mitchell wants to know if they were  just a science project, and Lucy explains that they didn’t know what the  three of them were planning.</p><blockquote><p>Mitchell: We weren’t planning anything. We just wanted to be left alone.<br
/> Lucy:  You don’t get to be left alone! You don’t get a life and lovers and  hope! You are poisonous! You are wearing other people’s clothes. You are  not human.<br
/> Mitchell:  You have such a redundant view of the world. God made man in His own  image. What if that included His rage? And His spite. And His  indifference. And His cruelty. What if God made us too? We’re all his  children, you see. God’s a bit of a bastard. Look at us both. Covered in  other people’s blood and talking about morality. But there’s one  difference between me and you. You had a choice.</p></blockquote><p>Kemp,  who has been watching this encounter, stands and goes to Annie’s room.  It’s time for her to finish her journey, he says. She tries to protest,  but he’s determined to do it then.</p><p>George  and Nina comes across the monitors and see the bodies around and Kemp  in with Annie. The psychic reminds Kemp that there has to be a death, a  door for Annie to pass through. No problem, Kemp guts him as George and  Nina watch on the monitors. The psychic can finally see Annie and  realizes he’s dead. Kemp recites scripture as the psychic is pulled  through the door. He repeats, “The power of Christ compels you,” over and  over as Annie is pulled through the door, too, as George and Nina watch  helplessly and Mitchell doubles over in pain. Nina tells George that  they have to leave.</p><p>Mitchell  runns away from Lucy as she asks what’s wrong. The tech presses some  buttons near the chamber as Nina pulls George toward the open door. He  wants to go back for Mitchell, though and runs past the open chamber  where the tech is hiding. As he cowers, he sees the ghost of Amy  McBride, too.</p><p>Mitchell  finds Kemp in the corridor and Kemp informs Mitchell that he sent his  girlfriend to the other side. He gloats about it. Wants Mitchell to know  grief and rage as he did. Mitchell threatens to rip his head off and  almost does but George stops him. George tells Mitchell that he has lost  too much today and won’t lost him, too. Mitchell protests that George  doesn’t know what he’s done. George yells at him not to kill in Annie’s  name. “They’re monsters, not us.” Mitchell lets Kemp go and screams  before taking George’s hand and leaving with him. The two men cry over  their lost friend as Kemp is left alone, the true monster.</p><p>Three  weeks later, a postal van drives down a country road. The postman  delivers a small box that Nina opens. It’s a book called <em>God’s  Blueprint</em>. Nina goes upstairs where there are articles and clippings  about Lucy spread all around. Nina wants to go into town for the  library, she thinks she knows the tech’s name: Lloyd Pinkey. She feels  responsible, she’s the one that brought Kemp into the house. George says  he’ll drop her off. Downstairs, Mitchell is listening to a news report  about the Boxcar Twenty, what they’re calling the massacre that he and  Daisy performed. George thinks he’s obsessing over other people’s grief.  Mitchell wonders why George hasn’t asked what Mitchell did after he  left the house, but George can’t be his confessor, he explains. As  Mitchell heads out for a walk, he sees someone in the drive. Lucy.  Mitchell marches up to her and asks if she’s here on her own. She is,  she doesn’t know what happened to Kemp. Nina’s been looking for her,  left a paper trail. Lucy says they can’t hurt them anymore. Mitchell  explains that they can’t go back to the house because it was Annie’s and  they lost her. Lucy confesses that the chamber was her idea and four  people died in there. She sees their faces all the time. Mitchell grabs  her and growls at her, wanting to know if she has any idea what she’s  done to him. “I have to live with what I’ve done; you should, too.”  Lucy wants to see George and Nina, she doesn’t have anywhere else to go.  Nina throws her up against a wall, too, angrier than either George or  Mitchell. Lucy just wants to say sorry, explain. Nina doesn’t want  reparation and makes a veiled threat to bite her. The roommies talk and  Mitchell thinks she really wants to make amends. Nina reminds Mitchell  that it’s not just about Annie; she was in there for two months, they  almost killed her, convinced her to bring the man she loves in there to  die, too. George isn’t happy about it, but Mitchell lets Lucy sleep on  the couch. Lucy doesn’t understand why he’s doing this. “If you want  forgiveness, you have to offer it first.”</p><p>Nina  can’t sleep and wanders downstairs where Lucy is no longer on the  couch. Nina follows some noises outside, where she finds Lucy. She  informs Lucy that she’s had enough of it, and if the boys won’t be man  enough to kick her out, she will. Lucy tells Nina to run as Lucy is  stabbed from behind by Kemp. Upstairs, George hears Nina scream and  comes down running with Mitchell. They find Nina being held by Kemp with  a knife to her throat. Mitchell leans down to Lucy, saying they’ll get  her some help but she’s already dying. George steps forward slowly,  telling Kemp to kill him instead. Kemp intends to… afterwards. He’ll  start with Nina. Kemp is distracted by a sound behind him and Nina gets  away. A door opens and a bedraggled looking Annie comes out, grabs Kemp,  and pulls him in with her. The roommies process this as they hear a TV  come on inside. Suddenly, Annie appears on it. They ask where she is.</p><blockquote><p>We  wait. We wait. We each have a number and we wait for someone to call  our number and then we move to another room and we wait there. But  then… then one of us disappears and we talk, and we’re not allowed to  talk about them. And there are bells and there are buzzers and  whistles… we had to fill in this form and the people… the people  behind the doors, they whisper. I don’t know what we’re waiting for to  happen, but sometimes I wish it would just, just happen. We’re  frightened of what it might be and… they’re really angry with me for  getting Kemp, ’cause they said there isn’t a form for that. Oh god, um, I  have to go. {she starts to fade} Please, don’t forget me, will you?</p></blockquote><p>George  and Mitchell’s eyes fill with tears and they reach out to the screen  and assure her they won’t forget her. George asks what they do now.  Mitchell says they’ll get her back.</p><p>Somewhere  covered in snow, two bodies huddle over a patch of red. It’s Daisy and  Cora, over some bones. Cora assures Daisy that blood heals. They can’t  stop now. A rumble happens and out of the snow comes Herrick.</p><p>After a rough start, the season really came around in the end. If the first season of <em>Being Human</em> was about the roommates coming to terms with the monsters inside them, the second season was about them realizing that the real monsters are the people who have no excuses, who act without remorse under the guise of “goodness.” As Mitchell says to Lucy, she had a choice. She chose to kill those werewolves. Mitchell forgets that he had a choice, too, and he chose to go clean. Sure, he goes off the wagon in a big way, but he was able to make that choice, something Kemp would never be able to understand.</p><p>The only lingering uneasiness I feel in this season is that it feels like the relationship between Mitchell and Annie was a little too much told and not shown. There have been moments of tenderness between them, sure, but no more than there have been with George. The sudden inference of a relationship between them is jarring and seems to only be there to set up season three.</p><p>Overall, though, I was really happy with it. Well, as happy as you can be with such a downer ending. What did you think?</p><p> </p><p>Transcript Quotes courtesy <a

class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Angela manages to get Brennan to come out to a night club and take a night off from dead bodies and emails. After Brennan references the music as “tribal,” a girl takes offense to that, but another girl comes to Brennan’s defense: “She’s using Descartes’ philosophy to say she’s down with the music.” But the first girl isn’t having it and starts to throw down. Unfortunately, she also throws the girl into a wall, which starts to crumble and release a cloud of white powder. Oh, there’s also a mummified dead body in there.<span
id="more-31722"></span></p><p>The white powder turns out to be meth and by the time Booth and Zack arrive to the club turned crime scene, Angela and Brennan are totally high from inhaling it. Booth headed over straight from a date, so his girlfriend Tessa is there, too. Angela informs him that’s not the best date idea. Booth questions the club owner as a wasted Brennan excitedly shows Zack the “modern mummy.” Tessa kisses Booth goodbye and grabs a cab back to his place as Angela and Brennan “Awww.” Brennan remarks that she’s not at all tired, so she’d up for staying up all night and working to ID the victim.</p><p>The next day, Brennan and Angela are nursing meth hangovers. The initial impression of the victim is that when he got stuck in the wall, the bag of meth he was holding popped, causing him to inhale too much and asphyxiate. To get some fingerprints, Brennan degloves the skin off the hand then wears it… seriously? Was that necessary? Fingerprint comes back as Roy Taylor, otherwise known as DJ Mount, one of the best DJs in the DC area.</p><p>The episode gets fairly convoluted (or maybe I was just having difficulty comprehending things when I watched it), so this will be detail light. Booth talks to the club owner and finds out that Mount had a lot of enemies, but his main rival was DJ Rulz. Mount’s father pays Booth a visit with a box of sports medals and trophies, informing Booth that his son graduated third in his class while working a full time job, never drank, never did drugs. Booth is swayed by his impassioned speech and wants to find out what really happened. A belly button ring (with flesh still attached, ew) saying “Luv Rulz” was found behind the wall where Mount was led them to think someone else was in there, and they soon discover that the bag of meth was used to smother him… definitely a murder.</p><p>After speaking with Rulz, they find out that the owner of the belly button ring was probably Eve Warren, who had bounced from Rulz to Mount. B&amp;B visit Eve’s brother, who last saw her six weeks ago when she dropped off her daughter and some money with him. She said she was turning her life around and cleaning up. She skipped town often, so he didn’t think anything of it. Mount had promised Eve that he was taking her out of DC and to a better life.</p><p>Booth still suspects the club owner, Terrence Baskin, and brings in his security guard who turns out to be an FBI agent in deep cover, investigating what they think is a drug front. Baskin poured cement on a new studio the day after Eve and Mount went missing. The team brings in cadaver dogs, who find Eve’s body, but Baskin has an untouchable alibi. They find an indentation on Eve’s body the same as one they found on Mount’s body, though and while Booth is harassing Baskin, Brennan realizes that it’s the tip of his cane, which finally gives them enough to arrest Baskin.</p><p>In the B-plot, Booth is planning a vacation and it’s going to be a coupley one with Tessa. Angela points out that that’s one of the key checkpoints on the way to moving in together. Shortly before they’re supposed to leave, though, Angela hears that Tessa isn’t going. Angela thinks that Booth got cold feet, but Brennan isn’t so sure. After the case is solved, Brennan finds Booth consoling himself with a frilly drink at the Chinese place. Tessa’s the one who called it off. Brennan says she’s sorry for him, but she likes going on vacation alone and hopes he has a good time anyway.</p><p>There’s not much going on in this episode as it’s a pretty straight-forward procedural episode. Zach does let slip the most personal information he’s given so far in a moment when he tells Angela about his large family in Michigan who think it’s weird that he works with bones all day. We’ll see his family in one of the Christmas episodes.<br

href="http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/">The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</a> at their Orlando, Fla., Islands of Adventure Park. Despite being a huge Harry Potter geek and living less than two hours away, it took me a year to make a visit to the park. It was well worth the wait.<span
id="more-30916"></span></p><p>Universal Islands of Adventure was opened in 1999 and was, surprisingly, the first Orlando theme park to have traditional roller coasters. It has six themed “lands” surrounding a central lagoon (in order clockwise from the Port of Entry):</p><ul><li><strong>Marvel Super Hero Island</strong>, home to the amazing 3D Spiderman ride and the shocking Hulk rollercoaster, which is my favorite roller coaster of all time.</li><li><strong>Toon Lagoon</strong>, which houses many water rides (great for cooling off) and is themed around various comic strip and TV cartoon characters, including Rocky and Bullwinkle, Gasoline Alley, Blondie, and more.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Park,</strong> which can really feel like you’re in the movie if you get caught in a sudden Florida downpour as I did the very first time I visited the park.</li><li><strong>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</strong>, featuring a scale replica of Hogwarts castle and the village of Hogsmeade.</li><li><strong>The Lost Continent</strong>, a slightly confusing island, split between Arabian- and Atlantis-themed stores and attractions; it had its third, Medieval portion rethemed for The Wizarding World.</li><li><strong>Seuss Landing</strong>, a delight for kids and adults like with Seussian goodies around every corner.</li></ul><p>I heard a lot about the Harry Potter portion of the park before we visited: the lines were long, the shops were crowded, the butterbeer was amazing, and most notably, you have to get there early. During busy times, I’ve heard from multiple patrons that entrance to the area is metered or closed entirely to try and combat the over-crowding problem. While I understand that Universal does this for good reason, I do feel they could make this known to patrons better. One of my colleagues was extremely upset to find that, at 2 p.m., the area had reached its capacity when they visited earlier this year. Keeping this in mind, my game plan was to get there shortly after the park opened at 9 a.m. and head straight for Harry Potter, visiting the rest of the islands afterwards. This worked well for my group, as we had all visited the park multiple times before Wizarding World opened, so didn’t feel we <em>needed</em> to go on any other rides. If you are visiting for the first time and can afford the money and time to do so, I would highly recommend spending at least two days at Universal. Especially if you are visiting in the summer and definitely if you are visiting with children, spending one day at Wizarding World and exploring the rest of the islands with your second day would be ideal.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Hogsmeade Entrance. Photo by Marie French-Zheng, used with permission.</p></div><p>There are two ways to enter TWWoHP; entering through Jurassic Park starts you at Hogwarts, while entering through The Lost Continent starts you at the main entrance to Hogsmeade and the Hogwarts Express. The view is absolutely magical. Seeing the Hogwarts Express, the snow-capped roofs of Hosgmeade, and Hogwarts Castle in the background all in one view can make even the most cynical adult turn into an excited child. Years went into the making of this island, and J.K. Rowling was involved in even the smallest details, of which there are many. It really feels like you are stepping into the actual places (except for the small hints of incongruity, like palm trees lurking in the background of the entrances). After getting a pictures with the Hogwarts Express conductor, we headed for Hogwarts.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Hogwarts, a Creative Commons Attribution (2.0) image from harshlight's photostream</p></div><p>Inside Hogwarts is a simulation ride called <em>Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.</em> After a line that wraps you through the castle, then outside and through the greenhouses, you enter the main part of Hogwarts where the ride starts. A projection of Dumbledore lays out the exposition: you Muggles are here to experience a Hogwarts class, The History of Magic with Professor Binns. Things like the entrance to Dumbledore’s office, the Unicorn Tapestry, and the Potions classroom door are all around you as you make your way into a corridor where portraits of the four founders talk to you. The moving portraits were absolutely amazing. Rather than appearing to be projection screens, you can actually see the paint and canvas grain on them as they move and speak to you. It’s such a simple thing, but it really does make the experience feel, forgive the overuse of the word, magical. Shortly, you enter the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom where Harry, Ron, and Hermione greet you, offering to help you sneak out of the castle (and boring class) to visit a Quidditch match. Once on the ride, you experience dragons, dementors, and even the whomping willow, led by the Trio the entire way. The ride is amazing and something every Harry Potter fan should experience. The only critique I have of the ride itself is that it was difficult to actually focus on the screened simulation moments at times, as too much was going on much too close. It didn’t distract from my enjoyment any, though. While it had an advertised wait time of 90 minutes when we got in line (I’ve heard tell of 140 minute wait times, by the way), we were in and out in less than an hour.</p><p>Next up on our adventure were Butterbeer, Pumpkin Juice, and shops. Other than Forbidden Journey, Butterbeer was</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Your author doesn't take good pictures. I was stunned by the deliciousness.</p></div><p>the thing that was most hyped about Wizarding World to me. There are two variations: cold and frozen, both of which get a creamy froth on the top. The prices are reasonable (for a theme park): $3 cold and $4 frozen, although you can get a keepsake mug for an additional price (I didn’t want to carry it around, so I didn’t get one). While I’d heard may people say they prefer the cold version, if you want something slightly less sweet, go for frozen. The drinks seem to be based on cream soda with some additional vanilla and butterscotch taste. It truly lives up to the hype and was absolutely delicious. I wanted to sneak a barrel out of there and take it home. The Pumpkin Juice is also a delightful treat. Using pumpkin and other fruit juices, it manages to taste like a liquid pumpkin pie in your mouth. I’m not even a huge pumpkin fan, but I really liked it. It’s very sweet, though, so only those with the biggest sweet teeth will be able to drink a whole bottle themselves. Both drinks are caffeine free. While enjoying our drinks, we ventured through the first set of shops: Honeydukes Candy Shop and Zonko’s Joke Shop. Connected inside, the shops bring many products from the Harry Potter universe to life, including new packaging for Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Cauldron Cakes, Sugar Skulls, Pygmy Puffs, Extendable Ears, and others. The shop also sells some t-shirts and other merchandise appropriate to the theme of the stores. While tempted to get a pygmy puff, I had my eye on a different souvenir.</p><p>Our next stop was Dragon Challenge, a dual track roller coaster. Rethemed from the old Lost Continent ride Dueling Dragons (if you ask an employee for that ride, though, they’ll deny it ever existed<em>), </em>Dragon Challenge is easily changed over to portray the first challenge of the TriWizard Tournament. Banners cheering on Harry, Fleur, Cedric, and Viktor flank the outside line, and inside, you get a glimpse at the Goblet of Fire and the Golden Eggs. Inside the ride, you choose which coaster to ride: Blue or Red. Frequent visitors to Islands of Adventure have long had their favorite dragons (previously named Fire and Ice), and the actual ride hasn’t changed any. The coaster features your legs hanging free, corkscrews, close calls with the other coaster and definitely some Gs pulled at more than one point. One of the great things about the Universal coasters (as compared to Disney, Busch Gardens, Kennywood, and Six Flags over Georgia in my experience) is that, even with quick turns, you never feel like your head is bouncing around against the headrests; the rides are very comfortable, even when they leave you with sea legs when you get off. There is also another rethemed attraction. The mine-cart style coaster The Flying Unicorn was renamed and redesigned as The Flying Hippogriff<em>.</em> Although we didn’t go on it, it’s a great coaster for kids.</p><p>As you exit Dragon Challenge, you see the two big shop lines for Ollivander’s Wand Shop. At the end closest to Hogwarts, you can have the Ollivander’s Wand Experience. Groups of people are let into the shop where a child is chosen at random from the group. Ollivander goes through a few choices of wand before one wand picks the child. The parents then have the option of purchasing the wand as the group is let into the bigger wand shop, which is also attached to Dervish and Banges. We skipped the wand experience and waited in the backdoor line (which was probably the worst line experience… it moved slowly and had no shade at all). The only critique I have of the wand experience is that they don’t pre-screen the parents to find out which parents are definitely going to buy a wand for their kid. Meltdowns do happen occasionally, according to the shop workers. So, for parents, do not do the wand experience if you’re not prepared to spend $30 on a wand. Inside the shop, there are two varieties of wands. Character wands (including the Trio, the alternate Trio, Voldemort, Cedric, Sirius, and Professors Snape, Lupin, and McGongall) and specialty wands designed for the attractions that correspond to birthdates. In Dervish and Banges, assorted merchandise includes replicas of house robes, sweaters, and ties, as well as trinkets like Sneakoscopes, Rememberalls, and brooms, all sold in park-exclusive packaging. My one souvenir (pro tip: give yourself a specific budget, otherwise you will buy EVERYTHING) was always going to be a wand. It was hard to choose between Hermione’s and Luna’s, but I went with Miss Granger’s in the end.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Wizarding World of Harry Potter — behind the bar at the Hog's Head pub, a Creative Commons Attribution (2.0) image from popculturegeek's photostream</p></div><p>Unlike the other islands, which have two to three restaurants each, Wizarding World only has one: The Three Broomsticks. In a feat of organized chaos, at busy times of the day, you wait in a line to get into the restaurant, where you wait in another line to order your food, then wait in another line to receive your food before waiting in another line to be seated. The system works, though, and moves pretty smoothly. It serves English fare, including roast chicken, Shepherd’s Pie (really Cottage Pie), Cornish Pasties, and Fish and Chips. The portion of Cornish Pasties was quite small (three mini-pasties), but the Fish and Chips had a generous portion. Attached to The Three Broomsticks is the Hog’s Head, serving Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice along with more muggle-centric drinks like Anheusser-Busch beverages. In a nod to criticisms of park food being terribly unhealthy, a cart near Hogwarts sells water, fruit juice, and fresh fruit, a perfect snack for waiting in the Forbidden Journey line.</p><p>We visited the park on a 96-degree, no-breeze day, and one constant criticism of both Universal parks is that they do not provide enough shaded, sit-down spaces (one hopes they’ll use some of the Wizarding World revenue to add shade to the park). They do seem to have built a specific, shaded area in Wizarding World, which is a start, but it gets crowded quickly. Most lines are indoors, and the outdoor portions have sprayer fans (a godsend in the summer), but for some reason, these weren’t on in the outdoor portion of the Forbidden Journey line for a while (and the greenhouse fans do not have sprayers). If you can, visit in the cooler times of the Florida year: February, April, October, and December provide amazing weather with highs generally in the high 70s  and 80s. If you do visit in the summer, stay well hydrated (alternating with something like Gatorade to avoid having an oversaturation of water) and reapply sunscreen often. Vending carts will fill up your water bottles with fresh, cold water for free. From the perspective of someone who has been near heat stroke before (not at Universal), if you do start to feel signs of heat exhaustion, please utilize the first aid stations throughout the park before it gets the better of you. While in the line for Forbidden Journey, we saw a child who had suddenly passed out from heat and hit her head as she fell; it took about 20-30 minutes for medics to get to her and get her out of there. We visited first aid for something as simple as sunscreen in my eyes this visit and were helped by a very friendly medic. Seriously: do not be afraid of first aid stations. Go to them before they need to come to you.</p><p>All in all, it was an amazing day. We spent about five hours just in that section of the park and could have happily done everything again or stayed longer to explore all the little details we missed. Small shows with the Beauxbaton girls and Drumstrang boys happen near the entrance to Hogwarts periodically throughout the day. If you go, be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting in lines. If you try to have a good attitude about it, it can even be a fun experience (my math teacher friend was excited to overhear a dad running through square roots with his math-loving son). Universal does allow you to bring in drinks and snacks from home, so, especially if you’re travelling with a child, that’s a great thing to take advantage of. The worst thing about the park is the steep admission price. Regular, one park adult admission is $82 (the Florida Resident Discount barely registers anymore either, at only $8 less — with blackouts through the month of July). For the Harry Potter fan, though, if you can afford the ticket price (and travel to Orlando), the experience is priceless. You even have the chance of meeting some of the actors — when some friends went the week before I did, the Phelps twins (who play Fred and George Weasley) were filming a commercial at the park. It really is a magical experience.</p><p><strong><span

Ivan asks if the young lady sheltering from the air raid across  from him has a name. Her name is Daisy. Daisy talks about Pearl, her  daughter — how she doesn’t understand her, doesn’t feel the motherly  bond with her. <span
id="more-31198"></span>Ivan asks her what’s worse: guilt, or the lack of it. Daisy  tries to change the topic, but Ivan’s not interested in politics; he’s  interested in Daisy, in bringing her away from her life that is  destined to mean nothing, enrich nothing. He wants her to come with him,  but she wants to wait for the all clear. He holds out a hand and  promises to make her indestructible.</p><p>George  wakes up in his new house to find Molly staring at him. Sam sent her to  tell him to wake up. When he heads down to the kitchen, Sam reminds him  that it’s parents’ night that night and again tells him that it’d mean a  lot for him to be there. He makes his excuses again, and Sam reveals her  frustration, telling him that it’s like he’s still on foot at the old  place, hedging his bets. She just wants to stop getting mixed  signals; he’s the one that set this accelerated speed, and now he’s  putting on the brakes.</p><p>Meanwhile,  over at the old place, Nina pays a visit. Annie greets her warmly. Nina  tries to make small talk but just cuts to the chase and asks how  George is. Annie tells her to sit down as she explains that George met  someone and moved out. Nina reacts almost too coolly and asks Annie if  she’s been OK. Annie says it’s been… weird. And she’s tired. She  wants to know if Nina is back for good, and Nina says it’s complicated.  Annie says that George’ll be back for the moon that night, so Nina can  just hang out until then. Remembering the third roommate, Nina asks after  Mitchell. Annie breathes out deeply.</p><p>We  see a very alive (well, as alive as he can be) Mitchell walking into  the destroyed funeral home. He finds Daisy, who runs at him with a hug,  asking how he got out. Ivan saved him but didn’t survive. The cover  story that the police are spouting is that an incinerator exploded,  which jibes with the 30 already-dead bodies that were in the building.  Mitchell thinks it’s payback for the constable. Daisy doesn’t think so; she thinks it was quick and brutal, but amateurish.</p><p>Nina  checks out the cage room as George comes home downstairs. She heads  down to the kitchen, and he appears to smell her before she even says  anything. He’s so happy to see her but also so conflicted. She just  starts blurting things out… how she thinks the cage was a great idea,  how Annie said he was seeing someone. She thinks it’s good, that he must  be happy. He wants to know what she’s doing there. She reveals that she  met some people who might have a cure. George is even more skeptical  when he hears it’s a priest and a mad scientist. She explains the  chamber and asks that he just meet them. He says there isn’t a cure.  “Then we walk away,” she offers. He agrees to meet them, but he thinks it’s  cruel, the false hope they’re giving her.</p><p>Mitchell  and Daisy have coffee, and she points out that all across the world  there have been lots of accidents like the “gas leak.” The humans are  fighting back, she reasons, and she doesn’t want to just sit around and  wait. She wants to retaliate. She wants to track down every single  person who knew about the attack on the funeral home to torture and kill  them. Mitchell knows who to start with. But first, he stops at home, where George informs him about Nina and the “cure” and Professor  Jaggat. Mitchell can’t hang around to meet them, but he thinks they  sound pretty harmless. George asks if he’s heard from Lucy lately, but  Mitchell hasn’t. He tells George that George was right to say he’d be an  idiot to tell her to truth.</p><p>At  Kemp’s institute, Lucy stares at the goldfish as Kemp comes in to tell  her that he’s off to see George. Lucy asks if Nina said anything about  how George is coping with Mitchell’s death, but Kemp reminds her again  that these are monsters without feelings and emotional connections. At  the house, Kemp arrives with Nina, and Annie cracks up at the sight of  him. Kemp bluntly explains that George and Nina are possessed by Satan.  George is pissed but doesn’t have a better explanation to offer. Kemp  continues that the cure is the application of faith to science as he  details the tidal shift effects and decompression chamber. The room  negates the tidal effect, the wolf doesn’t manifest, becoming weaker and  eventually dying. “Does it work?” George asks. “You would be the  first,” Kemp answers. George calls it out as vivisection. Kemp says they  think as time goes on, the wolf gets stronger and starts to manifest  between moons. Kemp name drops his exorcism past, his skill in helping  ghosts move on. Nina points out that George calls it a curse; why is  that easier to believe? George doesn’t buy it, though, and heads outside.  Nina tells Kemp to wait there as she goes to talk to him. George can’t  believe that Nina is buying into this, and she asks him to just try it…  try it for the new woman in his life: “You didn’t tell me, you had the  situation under control. How’d that work out for you?” George storms  away, and Nina goes inside to apologize to Kemp for wasting his time. It  wasn’t a waste at all though, as Annie dropped him a note: “Could you  help me?”</p><p>George  heads back to his new home and informs Sam that he’s arranged it for  tonight: he’ll be at the parents’ night, but has to meet Mitchell for  drinks at 8. He assures her that he is a constant and also thinks that  they should get married. Really, George? Does “George” mean “makes  stupid and impulsive decisions” in some other language, because that’s  all he’s been doing this season. Sam is, of course, ecstatic, because  she’s a complete enabler of George’s stupid and impulsive ideas.</p><p>Mitchell  and Daisy pay Steven the coroner a visit, and Mitchell plays good cop to  Daisy’s knife-to-the-throat bad cop. Mitchell wants to know  who was behind it, but the coroner says it wasn’t them; all he did was  react to the bodies and sign off on the report. He wishes it was them,  though… he would have invited the families of their victims to listen  to the screams. Daisy lets go of the coroner saying: “A) I told you so, and B) you,” to the coroner, “are very rude.” As they go to leave, the  coroner yells that Mitchell won’t find her. He stops, wanting to know  who. There was a woman who came to see him, thinking that he worked with  the vampires. She said she’d get them all together and there’d be a  fire. Mitchell wants to know her name. “Lucy.” Mitchell stabs the  coroner and throws file cabinets around the room. “You want some  retaliation?” he asks Daisy. “I’ll show you retaliation.” Uh-oh.</p><p>Annie  leaves a message on the machine as George plays dad at the parents’ night. George holds back a cough as he talks to someone and sees visions  of the wolf. The doorbell rings at the house, and Annie lets Kemp and a  psychic come in. He feels around and points at where Annie is. Kemp asks  if she still wants to do this; they can go if she doesn’t. The psychic  gets no response, so they go to leave, but she shouts out yes, jolting  the psychic, who says she’s really powerful.</p><p>George  and Sam are talking to the teacher as George checks his watch. Kemp  starts an exorcism around Annie, and things start flying around but no  door appears. She asks the psychic what time it is and remarks that  George should be home by now. At the school, Sam asks George if he’s OK, and he asks what time it is. She makes an excuse for him that he’s  just a bit out of sorts due to the clocks changing. He didn’t realize  that because she changed his watch for him. He freaks out on her,  yelling that she lied to him… it’s 8 in yesterday’s time… time for  the change. George runs out of the room, falling and screaming. His  vision starts to change. He’s running through the halls, passing kids.  Molly is playing with friends and walks down a hallway. She sees George  writhing around on the ground. He looks at her, and his eyes have  already hanged. “Run,” he says, showing off his teeth, which have already  changed, too. He runs out of the school as he’s transforming,  screaming. He runs, saying, “No, no, no, no,” over and over.</p><p>People  sit on a train as an announcement comes through about a signal failure.  Then sounds of a massacre. The lights go out and flicker back on. Daisy  is in the back of the car, Mitchell in the front, ready to kill.</p><p>Kemp  is still exorcising. Annie is bored in a chair. Annie tells them there  needs to be a door for her to pass over. “Did  we bring a door?” the  psychic asks as George comes running though the front door and Annie  tells them to stay back. George turns on Kemp as he is ready to turn.  Annie soothes him, “Don’t do this, sweetheart. We have to get you into  the cage.” She leads him up stairs and locks him in just as he changes.</p><p>A  maintainance worker comes onto the train to get the lights working but  can’t. His flashlight reveals part of the destruction… blood  everywhere. The lights come back on to show bodies everywhere. He  vomits.</p><p>Annie  comes downstairs and says he’s safe now. She doesn’t want to go on. Kemp  urges her to remember why she asked him for help and gives her his address  if she changes her mind. Kemp does well in appearing to be an actual  nice person, honestly.</p><p>George  can’t reach the keys the next morning and yells for Annie. She asks  what the hell happened. He got his timing wrong. “One minute longer!”  she warns. He asks if someone was here. She says some friends. “Ghosts?”  she lies. George dresses quickly; he has to go see Sam.</p><p>Sam  says it was awful, embarrassing, Molly’s friends won’t be allowed over  anymore. She asks if George is a risk. He says no, he manages it, last  night was a blip. “So this is the thing” that’s wrong with him, Sam  realizes. He apologizes again. She tells him to apologize to Molly and  calls Molly down. As soon as she sees George, she starts screaming and  tries to run away. Sam takes her away as George starts crying.</p><p>Mitchell  and Daisy wake, covered in blood, in blood soaked sheets. He knows he  shouldn’t have trusted Lucy, he sighs. “What do we do now?” Daisy asks,  “Bonnie and Clyde?” He says they’ll go speak to the hospital chaplain,  try to find her. “One by one” they’ll kill everyone, if they need to.</p><p>George  sits with a Rubik’s cube as Sam comes back down. He says they can’t carry  on. “Who was I trying to kid?” George goes to kiss her, but she pulls  back. “You’re wonderful,” he tells her. “She’s wonderful.” He kisses her  on the forehead and leaves.</p><p>At  the old house, Annie finds Mitchell in the kitchen, just sitting very  moodily at the kitchen table. “I kissed you once, you remember that?” he  asks. He gets really creepy, talking about her body and her skin. He asks  if she wants to kiss him again. George comes in, and she runs from  Mitchell to him. George is going to try the cure. Annie’s going with him.  Keep an eye on him. Mitchell coughs in the kitchen. Annie tells George  that Mitchell’s being weird. “Not him again, I thought he moved out,  he’s always fucking here,” Mitchell says. George thinks he’s drunk and  tells Mitchell that he’s going to the place with Professor Jaggat and  the priest. Mitchell says good, he’s glad to get rid of them. They  realize something isn’t right as Mitchell breaks through for a second and  tells them to leave, to get away from him. It’s like Jekyll and Hyde.  George seems to have realized, but Annie hasn’t, as George hustles Annie  out. “Whatever you are when you leave that place,” Mitchell warns,  “stay out of the cities. The cities won’t be safe much longer.”</p><p>As  they leave, Annie looks back. “We’re not coming back here, are we?”  George lies as a mass choir sings. Annie looks back at Mitchell staring  out the window. Mitchell arrives at the hospital chapel. The chaplain know  who he is. Mitchell says he’s looking for a doctor from the hospital, Lucy, that he just wants to talk to her. George and Annie pull into the  institute. Chaplain says this isn’t the man who sat with Josie when she  was dying, and he doesn’t hand out the contact details of his  parishioners. He asks Mitchell to find the man who George tried to  save… the man worth saving inside him gig. Mitchell goes to leave, and  the chaplain shouts at him, “You stay away from Lucy Jaggat.” Mitchell  stops. “What did you say? Did you say Jaggat?” George and Annie arrive  to be greeted by Nina. Kemp, the Tech, and Lucy come out. “Welcome to  freedom,” Lucy greets as multiple sets of doors close.<br

You’ve been warned.</strong></p><p><strong><span
id="more-29524"></span><br
/> </strong></p><p>After 60 years and over 200 episodes, <em>Doctor Who</em> showrunner Steven Moffat has dipped into the most frustrating plot  contrivance well for women: the mystical pregnancy. The mystical  pregnancy (MP) is a cheap ploy that almost always serves to completely remove  the character’s identity as anything but a vessel for the being inside  her. Even worse, very rarely does the character gain her identity back,  derailing any character development that had previously taken place.  Unfortunately, this pattern of identity loss plays out as a dangerous  metaphor for the state of women’s reproductive rights in the U.S. and the view of women in general.</p><p>Before we touch on <em>Doctor Who</em> and then finally what this plot contrivance means for real women, let’s  look at some other instances of mystical pregnancy (including one done well).</p><h2>The Bad:</h2><p><strong>Cordelia Chase (<em>Angel</em>)</strong>.  By season four of<em> Angel,</em> Cordelia Chase was no stranger to the mystical  pregnancy. She’d already had a one-episode arc where she was  impregnated by a demon, but these type of episodes (see also: <em>Torchwood</em>’s  Gwen Cooper) serve more to fit the damsel-in-distress trope than the  true MP plot conveyance. Cordelia’s real MP storyline came in season four.  Through three seasons on parent show <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and another three on <em>Angel</em>,  Cordelia had, perhaps, the greatest growth arc of any female in the  Whedonverse. She went from shallow cheerleader to suddenly poor to  helper of the helpless. Things started going wrong when she was lifted  to become a higher being. When she was returned, she wasn’t quite right,  and her memory wasn’t all there. In the creepiest instance of MP we’re  going to have on this list, she found momentary comfort in sleeping with  Angel’s age-accelerated son, Connor (whose diapers she changed only a  year or two ago in her timeline — CREEPY!). Connor was a product of a MP  himself (we’ll get to that in a bit), and it soon came out that even  his own conception was all part of a Xanatos Gambit to get Cordelia, who  was suddenly evil, preggers. After an accelerated gestation,  Cordelia gave birth to a fully-grown goddess, Jasmine, who claimed to  want to solve all the unhappiness in the world. Except that she was  really a maggot-faced demon. After giving birth, Cordelia fell into a  coma and other than being used for its special blood (or as a hostage),  she was pretty much forgotten about until she was used as a plot device  for the 100th episode before dying off-screen at the end of that same  episode.</p><p>A similar MP/SuddenlyEvil combo happened to <strong>Phoebe in <em>Charmed</em></strong>.  After marrying the reformed demon Cole, it’s discovered that Cole isn’t  really reformed at all. In fact, he’s now the Source of all Evil and  wants to seal the deal with Phoebe to make her the Queen of all Evil:  that means he has to knock her up with his demon seed. Even their  wedding is disrupted by the potential of a baby, (THERE’S NOT EVEN AN  ACTUAL FETUS YET) because he’s told that if they get married under one  kind of moonlight, the baby will be good rather than evil. The  prospective baby and eventual physical fetus become the focal points of  the end stretch of episodes. When the fetus actually beams itself out of  Phoebe’s womb (seriously, I’m not making this up), it’s revealed that  Phoebe was literally a vessel: the baby isn’t hers at all. To me, that’s  downright offensive, I don’t know about you. Phoebe does recover her  character development post-demon-baby, although being granted with the  power of premonition, it seemed like visions of herself with children  were a frequent theme.</p><p>And then there’s the <em>Star Wars</em> issue: Padme and Shmi. Any woman whose story revolved around Anakin  Skywalker was just doomed to tragedy. While Padme’s isn’t a strictly  mystical pregnancy, it seems mystical to the viewer because we know that  she is destined to become the mother to Luke and Leia, the most  mythical twins in science fiction. From the moment she’s introduced,  her accomplishments seem to go out the window. Nevermind that she’s a  Queen, then a Senator (Oh, you strange Naboo political structure)…  she’s going to be Anakin’s honey and Luke and Leia’s poor dead mother. I  mean, Lucas couldn’t even bother coming up with a believable reason to  kill her off — SHE DIED OF A BROKEN HEART, as if he basically said, “Oh,  crap… how does she die? She’s sad, there you go, now on to the lava  pit lightsaber fight! We have effects money to spend! And Darth Vader to  introduce!” And all because of Darth Friggin’ Vader. The Chosen One to  Bring Balance to the Force. So we know because he doesn’t even have a  father. Shmi is a rip off of the greatest mystical pregnancy of them all  (we’ll get to that later). She exists solely to have had this child,  have him taken away, and then have a life-altering (for her child, of  course) tragedy befall her. We know nothing about her that doesn’t  relate to Anakin. She has no story, no life, outside of what will be  beneficial to advance Anakin’s plot. Sucks to be you, Lars family.</p><h2>The Good(?)</h2><p>Going back to <em>Angel</em>,  the seasons two and three arc with a newly human, then-vamp’d-again Darla  actually served as a rare MP story where the character gained development  with the pregnancy. Introduced on the parent show as Angel’s vampire  sire, Darla was quickly dispatched by stake but often referenced,  appearing in flashbacks. In the second season of <em>Angel</em>,  Darla was brought back from death by the Big Bads to try and lure Angel  back to the dark side. It worked, and a driven-to-the-brink Angel took a  leap toward the abyss and slept with Darla before chucking her back out  to the street, still, somehow, ensouled. The next time we saw Darla,  she had a craving for innocent blood and a big ol’ baby belly ready to  pop. The impossible vampire pregnancy is about as mystical as you can  get, and various prophecies and cults spring up around it. Interestingly,  the soulless Darla begins to share a soul with her unborn child,  causing her to feel love that she’s never felt as a vampire. Her (dead)  body begins to strain with the child, and she realizes that once he’s  born, she’ll have no soul again: she won’t love her child. She tells  Angel that their son was the one good thing they did together and stakes  herself, leaving her child in her ash. Looked at just as its own piece  of plot, this is actually a good example of MP done well. While Darla  ends up sacrificing herself for her child, she gains development that  she never had even when she had a soul of her own. Her child makes her a  more complex character. It becomes problematic when the writers later  decide that the Impossible Vampire Baby was all set up just to enable  the Cordelia/Connor clustermess a season and a half later, negating the  strides that Darla made herself.</p><p>Less problematic is <em>Charmed</em>’s  Piper Halliwell. From the first episode, it’s established that Piper  has taken on the maternal role over the sisters since their mother’s  death. Following Piper and Leo’s courtship and marriage, she discovers  that they might have trouble conceiving, what with her husband being a  mystical being and not technically alive and stuff. After Phoebe’s  debacle with Cole, the sisters are given the choice of giving up their  magic. Sacrificing their potentially normal lives, all three sisters  decide to stay witches, and one of the first things Phoebe has a  premonition about is Piper being pregnant. Her future  children become important plot points, the first one being prophesized  to have great power and becoming a regular target of various demon sects  before eventually turning evil (and then back to good), and the other  being sent back in time (to before he was even born) to be the  Whitelighter protector of his mother and aunts. Throughout all of this,  though, we never lose Piper’s identity and character development.  Throughout the course of Piper’s story, after she has her first child she  goes through losing her husband, becoming an out-of-control goddess,  becoming a valkyre, dating again, having a booty call with her husband  (resulting in another baby), finding out that her protector is her adult  second child just before he gets killed, reconciling with her husband,  and being the only survivor of a great final battle before going back in  time to save her sisters’ lives. While some of her plots certainly  center around her children, her own, distinct role to play as a powerful  witch is never diminished.</p><h2>The MOFFAT!!!</h2><p>And so we have mad, impossible Amelia Pond. Introduced in the revamped <em>Doctor Who</em>’s  fifth season, Amelia Pond is a little girl who meets The Doctor as he’s  just becoming who the Eleventh Doctor will be. He promises to take her  away and she waits… 12 years. After their second meeting, she waits  another two years, finally running away with him the night before her  wedding. They travel, and there’s her fiance and sexy vampire fish and a  Dream Lord and her fiance being erased from existence and all of time  and space falling into a crack and bringing back her friend, the Doctor,  just from her memory and a wedding and dancing and promise of more  adventures. That’s simplifying it a lot, and there are many things that  are problematic about Amy Pond (but Steven Moffat’s Problems With Women  are the subject of an entirely different article), but this season, the  most problematic thing about Amy Pond became her Shrodinger’s Pregnancy.  In the season opener, we meet a strange little girl who has pictures of  a baby with Amy, and this little girl is later shown regenerating, just  like a Time Lord. After Amy closes the opening episode cliffhanger with  the revelation that she’s pregnant, she later claims to have been  mistaken. The Doctor does a scan on her (without her knowing) and the  scan keeps changing between Negative and Positive for a pregnancy. The  second, third, and fourth episodes all end with this noncommittal scan  (worst EPT test EVER). The only reason the fifth doesn’t is because it  rolls into the sixth, and in the sixth we learn why the scan can’t  decide: Amy is  pregnant, but Amy isn’t around. She’s been replaced by a  goo-doppleganger called flesh and has really been held in captivity in  some unknown place for her entire pregnancy. She’s being held by people  who want to turn her baby into the perfect weapon: a tiny time lord to  defeat The Doctor. After waking up to discover she’s in active labor,  Amy has the child taken away from her when it’s only a month old. As the  Doctor and Amy’s husband (and baby daddy) Rory storm in to rescue her  and the baby, they lose the child again. As they sit in shock from their  loss, River Song, their old friend who couldn’t come help with the  siege, comes upon the scene like a true deux ex machina. She reveals  that the little baby, Melody Pond, will be perfectly fine. How does she  know? Well, she’s Melody, of course… all grown up.</p><p>To  really examine how incredibly messed up this is for Amy as a character,  you have to look at how River is introduced. In the previous Doctor’s  tenure, once Moffat had been named the future show runner, he introduced a woman  called River Song, who was The Most Important Woman That Will Or Has  Ever Existed To The Doctor, but she couldn’t reveal why because she was  meeting him out of order (curse of the time traveller). The next season,  Amy is introduced.<br
/> The  main purpose of Amy Pond was always for her to be the mother of the  magical child who would be both the Doctor’s Girlfriend and Ultimate  Foe. This was Moffat’s long game. Her relationship with the Doctor was predestined not because of her  own, unique self but because of what would be in her uterus. And Steven  Moffat expects us to think this is the most amazing plot twist ever in  the near fifty-year history of <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p><h2>The Real Life Dangers</h2><p>More  than any of the physical horrors associated with mystical pregnancy  (finding yourself ready to pop without any prior knowledge, alien babies  inside you moving around, children being evil, children coming out not  right, etc.), the most frightening aspect is the loss of identity. The  mother is seen as just a vessel for the child, almost an afterthought,  as the questions surrounding the baby-to-be are the important thing.  Entire lives must be arranged, planned, and sacrificed around this baby, and  whether the mother is on board with being the incubator for this sacred  baby doesn’t even factor into the equation. The truly terrifying thing  is that this is apparently how many legislators in real life view  women’s role in pregnancy. The proposed bills in Utah and, more  recently, Georgia, to <a
href="http://www.tnr.com/article/84511/georgia-legislation-abortion-miscarriage">consider miscarriages criminal offences</a> unless proved otherwise are a testament to this mindset. The entire  anti-choice movement is predicated on this line of thinking; how else  could you explain the attempts to give the best wishes of a being who  doesn’t even have the power to think yet more credence than the living,  breathing woman with a life already in progress? It takes the voice, the  choice, away from the mother, leaving her just a vessel to fight and  politic over. Once you correlate that mindset with the religious beliefs  behind it, though, the reason pregnancy seems too sacred is clear.</p><h2>The OG</h2><p>Mary  is the Mystical Pregnancy model that all other models look to. She is  visited by the angel Gabriel and informed that she has been selected to  be the mother of Jesus, son of God. She marries her fiance and gives  birth to the prophesied child, and three men follow a star to find the  baby. Although non-biblical sources give Mary a life before Christ,  there is no mention of this in the Bible. Quite often, Mary isn’t even  mentioned by name, just referenced as the mother of Jesus (although,  admittedly, this might be partly to distinguish between the myriad of  Marys in the Bible). After Jesus’ crucifixion, Mary disappears. We know  nothing about her, where she is born and when, what her life is like,  what her life with Joseph (who is sidelined, as well) was like, if they  had other children, how and when she died… nothing is canonical. For a  figure that is so very important to many religions (just look at the  amount of art that has been inspired by the Madonna), it’s surprisingly  how little we actually know about her as a woman with her own unique  identity.</p><h2>Today</h2><p>Even  when a modern pregnant woman’s identify isn’t being removed by “well  meaning” legislators, this attitude that pregnant women just serve as  vessels can be found throughout society in small actions. The number of lists detailing  foods that will harm your baby in some way lends itself to public  judgement if a mother-to-be has a glass of champagne in her second  trimester or sneaks a piece of blue cheese or indulges in some sushi.  The tendency of strangers to want to touch a pregnant woman’s belly  makes many women uncomfortable and carries the unfortunate implication  that their belly is no longer their own private property. The pattern of  friends and family discussing nothing else about you for nine+ months  other than the impending baby serves to alienate you from your own  achievements and experiences. It should be no surprise that many women  turn into helicopter parents; when your identity is taken away from you  in lieu of your child, of course you’re going to hold them close.  They’re all the identity you have left.</p><h3>Thanks and Further Research:</h3><p>Assistance with biblical references provided by QueenieManhattan.

As a young priest gives a  church service, elsewhere a girl walks into a room and hides behind the  curtains. Her mom comes in behind her; they’re playing hide and seek.  The doorbell rings, distracting the mother, and the girl moves behind the  couch. <span
id="more-29514"></span>At the church, a member of the congregation compliments Reverend  Kemp on the service as the young man gets in his car. At home, the  mother is screaming as three people drag her into the room where the  girl watches from her hiding place. The three people begin to drink the  woman. Kemp comes home because sadly, this is his home, his wife, his  child that he finds being killed by the three vampires. As Young Kemp  holds up his Bible, backing them away, Old Kemp prays. “And whosoever  eats my flesh and drinks my blood will live forever.”  This is the first  and last time you’ll feel sympathetic for Kemp.</p><p>Lucy  and Mitchell deal with the morning-after regrets of their actions the  night before. Mitchell apologizes, but Lucy says they’ll talk later, as  she has to go to work. She stops to pray on her way as Mitchell heads  home to find a minor domestic happening between George and Annie. George  is going to look at houses with Sam, and Annie is pissed. He brings her  in for a hug, and she says that she was OK with the idea of him moving  out when it was just an idea, but she didn’t think he’d go through with  it. George asks where Mitchell was the night before and admits he was  with Lucy, but he leaves out the whole ripping out the Chief Constable’s  throat part. George promises to visit when he moves out, but Annie says it  won’t be the same and pops out. Mitchell remarks that it’s the end of an  era, and for himself… he hopes his own plans include Lucy. Oh,  Mitchell…</p><p>Annie  takes a walk and finds a psychic medium type show: Alan Cortez,  Master Medium. She heads in, but once the show starts, Annie is not  impressed. An usher asks her to keep her heckling down, and Annie  realizes that the usher is a ghost, too. Ghost Usher Robyn shows Annie  to the right seats, and there are a load of ghosts in the back, watching  the show. Robyn explains that Alan wasn’t always a fraud. He used to be  amazing, but then he just started ignoring them. After the show, Annie takes it  upon herself to try to give him a wake up call. He can hear her, but  can’t see her, and she realizes that he can’t hear the other ghosts. He  explains that there was a fire at one of his Newcastle shows… he  accidentally walked off the stage, and after that, they were just gone.  He used to pray for the voices to leave; now he prays for them to come  back.</p><p>George  and Sam find a place that Sam loves with a proper garden, reasonable  rent, and it’s available immediately. George doesn’t react quite so  excitedly, and it looks like he was more enthused when this was just  hypothetical, too. He lies and says he’s ready for change, even  suggesting getting a dog. Molly seems to be warming up to him. As they  drop Molly off, Sam invites George to a parents’ evening at the school  on the 27th. That coincides with the full moon, though, so George  explains that he has a… thing… a sport thing… tobogganing… in  Liverpool. Sam asks him to cancel, but he won’t.</p><p>Lucy  apologizes to Kemp, but she says she couldn’t bring herself to kill another  person. Kemp corrects her that Mitchell isn’t a person, but Kemp  understands. The devil is made to be charming, he explains, and Mitchell  is made in the devil’s image. Later, Mitchell and Lucy share an awkward  coffee, and she just can’t get past him being a murderer. “It’s your  world, Mitchell… it’s in every cell.” Mitchell promises that he can’t  change for her… he’ll leave the vampire family. She wants to know when  he’ll tell them. He says tomorrow night he’ll call a meeting at the  funeral home. Lucy leaves and calls Kemp to tell him, “It’s done.”</p><p>Annie  decides to try and mobilize the ghosts in the theatre. Alan doesn’t  think it’ll work, but she has a plan. She picks out a ghost and speaks  to Alan for them. The first one up is Jimmy. His wife is there, and she  wants to know if it’s okay for her to get remarried. Jimmy says nope and  starts going off on her. It’s not a great start. Apparently, Jimmy’s  wife was having an affair long before he died. Annie calms him down and  asks Alan to have the woman admit it, admit to the affair. After a  moment of shock, she does, and she apologizes for it. Jimmy’s door opens,  and Annie watches bittersweetly as he crosses over.</p><p>Mitchell  goes to talk to Ivan and asks the older vampire to spread the world and  get everyone there. Ivan says OK, “I have most of them on my twitter  feed.” After Mitchell leaves, Kemp’s Tech comes to the funeral home to  check out reports of a gas leak. Uh oh.</p><p>At  the new house, George is trying to put a table together and cursing up a  storm as Molly comes in the room. She looked up some stuff about  tobogganing and asks him some questions, which he fails utterly. She  knew he was lying. George doesn’t know what to say, and Molly says that  he should just leave now, don’t hurt her mum more. Her dad told lies,  too, she explains. George tells Molly that he has a problem and he’s  worried that Sam will think he’s a freak. Molly tells him that her mum  loves him, so everything will be OK. Later that night, however, as  George and Sam watch TV, Molly calls out. She had a nightmare. About  George, but he wasn’t George. He just stared at her, but his eyes were  dark. “They looked right through me,” she explains. “They looked inside  me.”</p><p>After  her experience with Jimmy, Annie decides to go on tour with Alan. She  sees a woman she recognizes in the audience. She tells Alan the woman’s  name is Carmen… her mother. Alan asks what Carmen would like to ask, and  she doesn’t even know. Losing a child is a unique pain, she explains,  but it’s all she has left. “I want to feel that pain. And I deserve to  feel that pain, because… I should have known. She was my little girl,  and I should have known that she was in danger. I should have known that  she was scared. Because I’m her mum, and I really should have known.”  She sits down. Annie has said nothing. After the show, Alan asks for  Carmen to come see him, and he reveals that Annie’s there… she couldn’t  find words before, but she’s there. Carmen doesn’t believe it at first,  but Annie picks up a tissue and starts making a rose from it. Carmen  sees the floating rose and recognizes it as something Annie made all the  time… she loved those roses. There’s so much Carmen wants to say, but  Annie says that she needs to let go… live her life, stop torturing  herself. Annie asks her mum to visit her grave. She never had before.  She was afraid to, afraid that would become her last memory of Annie.  But she was wrong; she still has her face and her eyes and her laugh.  “You’ll always have me, mum,” Annie says as Carmen promises to try and  live her life. She places the paper rose on the grave as she walks away.</p><p>At  home, Mitchell practices his talk in his bedroom, trying to find the  right words. Lucy sits in a room as Kemp tells her that they should  prepare themselves. Mitchell leaves the house and walks to the funeral  home. Lucy and Kemp pray at a very creepy looking alter.</p><p>Annie  lets Alan know that she can’t go on the road. Helping other ghosts move  on made her realize she has to as well. She asks what Alan will do, and  he asks if she thinks Robyn would be any good. He’s starting to hear the  other ghosts again. Alan asks what Annie will do, and she says that she  thinks it’s time to go.</p><p>The  Tech loiters outside the funeral home as vampires file in. Ivan plays  host, handing out drinks (alcohol only, no hard stuff). Kemp and Lucy  pray. Mitchell walks in. Tech makes a call. Mitchell calls out to Ivan.  Kemp’s phone rings. Tech tells him Mitchell just went inside. Lucy says  to wait, others may still arrive. Mitchell takes Ivan downstairs. Ivan  asks why he wants to throw it away as Mitchell explains that he wants  Ivan to take the reins. Ivan isn’t ready for that responsibility and  thinks they need to set up a new relationship with the police since  Mitchell severed the last one. Ivan can’t lead, he claims… he’s  coping, but he’s one step away from massacre. “This is the problem with  vampires,” Mitchell scolds, “too much fucking introspection.” Ivan says  he’ll have to find someone else. Mitchell reveals he met someone. Well,  that changes things for Ivan… he gets it now. “We all lead long and  appalling lives, but I have my Daisy. Everyone deserves a Daisy.” Ivan  opens the door, and they head back out to everyone.</p><p>Lucy  urges Kemp to wait a few more minutes. Kemp thinks he’s waited long  enough and makes Lucy say, “Do it.” Mitchell starts his announcement. Kemp  calls The Tech: “It’s time.” Tech calls a number. Ivan hears a beep,  sees the bomb, and yells to Mitchell to get down. The Funeral Home  explodes. Kemp turns to Lucy: “The deed is done. Shall we pray?”</p><p>And  with that, the pieces are set into place for the last two episodes.  Kemp has had his vengeance, but how many times has he exacted this  scenario? George has settled himself into a normal life, but is there a  monster still lurking there? Annie has accepted it’s time to move on,  but will it be so easy for her to find her door again?</p><p><em>Transcript Quotes courtesy <a

They find a strikingly small body behind a mall, and after examining the remains, Brennan feels comfortable in identifying them as the missing child in question, Charles Gregory Sanders. <span
id="more-29050"></span>The growth plates suggest he was 6-10 years old, but the statute suggests smaller. There are signs of blunt trauma to the chest, and his clothes were found away from his body in better condition, suggesting a sexual assault.</p><p>Booth informs Charles’ mother, Margaret, that they found his body. Charles’ father works overseas, and they were divorced before he was born. She’s a foster mother to a couple other boys, brothers David and Sean, who arrive with neighborhood friend Skyler, a slightly older body who always seems to have something to hide. Booth bonds with the brothers through video games, and David reveals that he went to the mall instead of staying in the park when Charlie went missing, something he previously lied about. Sean only let go of Charlie’s hand for a second, and then he was gone.</p><p>Angela uses the security camera footage to find Charlie in the mall, and Booth notices that someone was calling him over, but they can’t get a visual on who it is.</p><p>Angela and Zack are the most visibly shaken by the child’s small body. Brennan shares a moment with Zack where she tells him about being on the scene in Waco, Texas, to identify bodies there, seventeen of them children. He thinks she means he’ll get used to it, but she corrects that he won’t; it’s coded in our DNA to protect the young. What helps her, she explains, is to pull back, put her heart in a box, and focus on the details. He does so, finding a chemical smell in the child’s mouth, a potential clue. “Kids make it harder, Zack,” she adds as she leaves.</p><p>With Angela, Brennan is concerned that this case will shake her so much she’ll leave. Angela explains that she’s not like Brennan, driven for justice. She’s a good time girl, a sentiment Booth echoes later (and hints to earlier when he tells her that she looks normal, but she’s really a squint). Brennan says she knows it’s harder for Angela, who has to look at their faces, can’t distance herself from the victims. Angela just asks for some time to work on it, to get back to her artist self.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zack has noticed that the bones indicate that Charlie was disabled, something Margaret never mentioned. All signs point to a hereditary illness, meaning Margaret isn’t his biological mother. They bring her in for questioning, and she admits that she fostered him as well. His name was Nathan Downey, and his mother was arrested on drug charges. Three weeks into fostering him, the charges were dropped. She gave him back but stayed in touch. That Christmas Day, she went to visit them and found the mother dead, needle in her arm. Charlie was upstairs crying, and Margaret promised she would never leave him again. Child services never came looking for him. Brennan implies that she did the right thing by telling Margaret that he would have ended up back in the system anyway. Unfortunately, Booth has to arrest her for kidnapping, though, which infuriates Brennan, who asks Booth if he has any idea what’s going to happen to Sean and David now.</p><p>When Angela manages to make out a face from reflections in the security camera footage, she finds that Sean was the one leading Charlie out of the mall. Booth interrogates the child as Brennan watches with a juvenile prosecutor who has seen too much of kids killing other kids. Booth relates to Sean, showing him a scar from an accident playing with his brother. He asks gently if Charlie had an accident. The prosecutor is frustrated that Booth isn’t being forceful enough, and Brennan freaks out on her, telling her that foster kids are powerless; being forceful doesn’t do anything.</p><p>Booth comes to see Brennan as she is examining the remains again and lets her know that Sean and David have been put in emergency care together. She thanks him for it, but Booth begins to get frustrated and starts to lecture her about the rules. “If you want to do this… I need to know that you will respect the law,” he asks. She concedes (tearfully) that if she can’t respect the law, she’ll at least respect him. As he leaves, she notices that he broke a pencil in three by leaning on it, and it’s a breakthrough in the case… perhaps his fractures were from compression, not blunt force. Angela runs the scenarios through her machine and determines that they’re looking for someone at 190 pounds to cause those breaks, not a kid. Brennan asks if she can try talking to Sean and pleads to Booth that she knows what to say.</p><p>She opens by just talking to him. She tells him that they give you a garbage bag to carry your stuff, implying that your stuff is all garbage. They take you away from your brother, they bounce you place to place, and it’s never home. Sean breaks down; they liked being with Margaret, she had bunk beds for them. He knew that David was always there. Brennan asks who the man was that he took Charlie to and empathizes that the man said they’d be taken away from Margaret if he told anyone. Brennan promises that they’ll get to live with her again. She tells Sean about her friend in the FBI who will make sure that happens. Sean worries that Margaret won’t want them anymore; after all, Charlie was her real son. Brennan tells Sean that he wasn’t. The child hugs Brennan tightly and whispers in her ear.</p><p>Back in the neighborhood, Booth and Brennan arrive with backup. They approach Skyler’s father, Edward Nelson, outside his Pest Control truck. Skyler comforts his mom, not looking entirely surprised, as his father is arrested for Charlie’s murder. At the lab, Angela looks at her drawing of Charlie as Zack returns the jaw bone to a casket holding the rest of the bones, his hand shaking as he does so. Margaret is released, and the boys reunite with her. Brennan watches and smiles as Booth informs her that they have a solid case on Nelson. The insecticide he used matches the chemicals that were in Charlie’s mouth. Booth assures her that Sean wasn’t abused, but Nelson’s son probably was and mentions that someone will get him help. Booth apologizes for thinking she couldn’t talk to Sean and says that he realized when she was talking to him, that she had personal experience with the system. She promises to tell him all about it someday.</p><p>As the Jeffersonian crew prepare for being paraded around at a banquet for donors, Dr. Goodman advises them to talk about their work. Angela breaks it down and states that Hodgins works with bugs, Zack looks at bones all day, and she draws death masks. Not cocktail talk. Goodman is taken aback and tells her, “You are the best of us, Miss Montenegro. You discern humanity in the wreck of a ruined human body. You give victims back their faces, their identities. You remind us all of why we’re here in the first place — because we treasure human life.” Angela hugs him tightly, and Brennan asks what happened as she enters. Zack replies, “Apparently all Angela needed was to hear her job description in a deep African-American tone,” which is one of the best-delivered lines in the history of the show. Don’t we all just need that sometimes? Later, Booth asks Brennan how she knew he’d keep her promise. She admits that she was lying a little, “but the end justifies the means, right?” She knew he wouldn’t make her a liar, though, because he wants to go to heaven. “You don’t believe in heaven,” Booth challenges. “But you do,” she replies with a smile.</p><p>While Brennan’s secondary career as an author is mentioned in the pilot, much emphasis is put on it in this episode. During a speech at American University, all the students (and Booth) want to ask about is her book — how much money she’s made, when she got her agent, who the sexy FBI agent is based on (Oh, Booth!). Brennan’s publishers gave her a fancy new car, leading to her feeling pressured to write another book (and on company time!). This enviable life of Brennan’s is juxtaposed with what we learn about her past. She mentions her brother for the first time and explains that they were in the foster system until her grandfather took them out of it. Booth, too, mentions a brother, Jared, and hints at their antagonistic relationship. It’s just the tip of the iceberg for both of these characters, though, and watching it now, I’m thrilled to discover it all again. The only thing I wish is that there’d been some mention of Parker. Booth is shown momentarily shaken when he sees the child’s bones all laid out, but we’re never given a reason why. I guess they had to leave something for the future.</p><p>Brennan isn’t the only one we discover a secret about, though. When Dr. Goodman insists that the squints attend a banquet for big donors, none are enthused, but Hodgins is the standout, refusing to take part. The idea actually makes him angry, and Angela tries to get to the bottom of it by talking to Zack, who she understands is his roommate. But he only lives above the garage, he reveals; he’s never even seen the main house, as there’s a pond and tennis courts in the way. Booth’s arrived on the conversation and laughs that Hodgins must be “one of <em>those</em> Hodgins,” the ones that own the Cantalever group, the ones that are the single biggest donors to the Jeffersonian. Booth laughs as he realizes “Hodgins is your boss!” Once Hodgins finds out that Angela and Booth know who he actually is, he pleads with them not to share it with Brennan. He doesn’t want to be anybody’s boss and never did. He just wants to be “Jack Hodgins, who works in a lab.” If he goes to the banquet, the donors will all know him, and he won’t have his little comfort zone anymore. Booth respects his wishes by commandeering him for a special FBI reason right before the banquet, something Goodman can’t argue with.</p><p>The focus on Angela is especially touching in this viewing. I coincidentally caught some of the season two episode “The Man in the Cell,” in which part of the plot is based around Angela being called “the heart” of the team in a newspaper article. And she really is. Goodman’s “job description” is such a perfect complement to her. When Booth tells her that she really is a squint, she gets defensive. Truly, Angela straddles both worlds, and necessarily so. The rest of the team has to stay distanced, strong, cold to get the case solved. Through Angela and her work comes the emotional resolution of the team, and she’s brilliant at it.</p><p>I think, looking back on this episode now, this is probably the first <em>Bones</em> episode that made me cry. You learn so much about the characters, every single one of them — what makes them tick, why they’re there. Combine that with a heartbreaking case, and it’s a brilliant hour of television.<br

isPermaLink="false">http://persephonemagazine.com/?p=28608</guid> <description><![CDATA[Annie and George get domestic as Mitchell gets a little wild and proves that a tiger never changes his stripes.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flashback  time. Mitchell wakes up in a blood-drugged haze with a dead girl next  to him. From his unconditioned hair (and the text on the screen), we  learn that it’s London, 1969. He gets up and walks into the hall and  almost stumbles over another dead girl.<span
id="more-28608"></span> A toilet flushes, but it’s just  Herrick. Mitchell doesn’t even know where they are, so Herrick reminds  him about the drugs and the four hour car ride. They need to clean this  up, but Herrick doesn’t want to call in the local crew. They don’t get  along… Herrick killed the leader’s mom, oops. Herrick has to find the  car, so leaves Mitchell to clean up the mess. Mitchell seems to have a  moment of regret as he stares at one of the girls. He cleans up,  scrubbing down the surfaces (badly), straightening paintings, carrying  bodies out, vacuuming. As he leaves (stealing some milk on the way), the  police are already in the building (how they knew about the crime scene  so quickly is a wonder). A woman comes out of her apartment and he  grabs her, pushing her back into her apartment to hide. She thinks it’s  because he took the milk. He wants to know if there’s a way out and no,  there’s not. As the police knock on her door, Mitchell asks, “Are you  going to cause me a problem?” “Depends,” she replies, “Are you going to  hurt me?” Mitchell thinks for a second before saying, “Right now it’s  about 50/50.” The police question her and she keeps it cool. But she  knows he’s a killer now. He asks her to take her cross necklace off.  “What happens now?” “We wait.”</p><p>Back  in the present, it’s all very deja vu-y as the police are knocking at  the house door. They rush in, past George and past Annie and grab  Mitchell from his bed as George and Annie protest. “What’s he done?”  Annie wonders. “How far back do you want to go?” George supplies. At the  station, the police rough Mitchell up as they bring him in and toss him  in with the constable. Constable tells him about a child molester who  they haven’t been able to convict. He’s been in and out of there  multiple times and re-offends every single time. “I want this man sent  kicking and screaming to hell and you’re the one to do it,” he explains  when Mitchell questions why he’s here. He figured Mitchell might enjoy  it, but Mitchell corrects that he’s clean, he doesn’t kill anymore.</p><p>At  home, George is showing kid’s magazines to Annie, asking her opinion,  which she thinks Sam’s daughter would like. She thinks that’s a bit too  much responsibility for him. Mitchell comes home and they ask if he’s  okay, but he’s typically evasive and conversation moves back to George  and Sam. Mitchell doesn’t approve of Sam and confides to Annie that he  thinks George is still in love with Nina. George heads to Sam’s flat.  Molly answers and tells George that he has dogbreath before putting down  both his choices of magazine. She is pulling the brat card pretty hard,  to be fair. Sam reveals that they live with her mom. As she goes out  for a moment, George sits on a chair in the kitchen. Molly says that’s  where her dad used to sit. He leans on the counter. That’s where the cat  sits. “You can sit on the bin,” she offers.</p><p>Back  at home, Annie is surprised to have a ghost visitor, who (more  surprises) has a ghost baby with her! Sykes told GhostMum all about  Annie, she’s like a celebrity. She explains that a leaky boiler did them  both in (presumably a gas leak) and that the GhostBaby will stay a baby  until they cross over. The point of her visit, though, is that GhostMum  has a date with a dead fireman and she wants Annie to watch the baby so  she can go. Annie’s not keen on the idea, but GhostMum hands the baby  over and tells her to keep him clean, happy, and cold before zooming out  of there.</p><p>At  the funeral home, Mitchell is taking care of some admin work as  Campbell, one of the office staff vampires, hangs around. Campbell reveals  that he’s been dreaming about his ex. He tried to recruit her, but she  died instead. He hasn’t thought about her in 15 years, but now it’s all  flooding back. Mitchell assures him it’s normal and that it happened to  him, too: “in glorious technicolor.” We’re back in 1969 London and the  girl has come out of the bathroom, but written HELP on the bathroom  window, so she gets tied up now. She wants to know why he did it; he  must have a motive. They discuss being only children, their parents, how  many people he’s killed: “More than 100, less than 1000,” Mitchell  estimates.</p><p>Back  in the present, Mitchell comes upon Lucy, who’s on her way home to  sleep for a few days after a week of nights. She’s still up for their  date tomorrow though, she’s already downloaded Nigella to guide her. As  she turns the corner, Kemp is waiting for her. He doesn’t like the  relationship between her and Mitchell. They’re supposed to be getting  rid of evil, he reminds her, but she insists that a reformed vampire  isn’t part of their project.</p><p>Back  in 1969, Mitchell is still talking to the funny little girl. She’s not  scared of him and asking lots of questions. She brings up that he  probably didn’t even know the names of the girls he killed and this  touches a nerve. She threatens to tell him her name and he yells at her  to shut up. She still doesn’t understand why he does it and doesn’t  think anyone’s ever asked him before. He shouts that he has to kill and  she believes it, but thinks he doesn’t want to. Mitchell gags her.</p><p>George  and Sam drop Molly off at school and he thinks he’s done horribly. Sam  says he did great; she bit the last boyfriend. She explains that they  live with her mum cause she can’t afford anything else, expects George  to leave and he jokingly does when she turns her back, but comes back  out from the tree quickly. “However crap a prospect you think you might  be,” he explains, “I am far, far crapper.” George arrives home and is  shocked at the crying baby in the building. Annie can’t find the off  button. She hands the baby to George, who greets “Mr. Potato Face.” He  smiles at the baby who stops crying. She doesn’t even know what it’s  called. She’s makes up the name Tim, since that seems like a reasonable  baby name to her. He asks if she stole it and of course not! Babies are  the last thing she wanted. George wanted them, though. They were on his  old to-do list. His pre-wolf list.</p><p>As  Lucy makes supper, Kemp hangs out in her doorway because that’s not  creepy at all. He likes that she doesn’t call it “tea” like the younguns.  He reminds her that they have a team of men waiting and he gives her a  stake for self defense. He’s worried that there’s an attraction that  makes Mitchell volatile. She says it makes him vulnerable. In the ’60s,  the girl gets herself loose and makes a run for it. Mitchell comes out  and finds her gone. She brings the police back up, but unfortunately for  that poor girl, it’s just Herrick who had to steal a uniform just to  get in the building. She tries to run again as she realizes that they’re  in cahoots, but Herrick grabs her and throws her to the ground.</p><p>At  home, Mitchell gushes over the baby, too. He thought about it, too,  once, but, “You gotta be with the right person.” And, you know, not a  vampire. That probably would help, too. Annie does a George impression  and the baby likes it. George doesn’t find it so funny. Annie takes the  baby for a walk as Mitchell tells George about his date. George brings  up Sam and so Mitchell brings up the going too fast again. He cares a  great deal for her, George explains, which Mitchell thinks isn’t a  ringing endorsement. George calls Mitchell out on his own hypocricy  since Lucy doesn’t know his secret. Mitchell says he had someone like  that, but George points out that was 40 years ago. Are the pieces  starting to click as to who the London Girl might be yet?</p><p>Back  in London Girl’s flat, she asks if Mitchell can do it— kill her. She  knows this is how it ends. She prefers him to do it. She knows he’s not  like Herrick, but Mitchell explains that you have to feed the monster,  otherwise panic creeps in. He’s tried to stop before but he starts  seeing their faces again. “It’s not an addiction, it’s cowardice.” She  asks if he’d like to try to stop again. Mitchell enters the living room  and Herrick wonders if they can jump before asking if he took care of  her. Mitchell says the girl’s cool, she won’t talk. Herrick says no.</p><p>George  runs up to Sam and Molly and he’s brought a lunch. She’s a brat again.  At home, baby is still crying and Annie can’t get him to stop, even with  bribes. She tries stories, but runs out so starts telling scary stories  and of course that works. George and Mitchell are home later. George  has to blurt something out. He’s going to ask Sam and Molly to move in  with him. Annie asks where they’ll sleep and as George flounders for an  answer, Annie says Molly can have her room. Tim and her can make do down  here. George reminds her it’s not her baby, but she points out that the  mom has gone AWOL. Mitchell says not in a million years. He points out  that George and Sam feel sorry for each other, not love. Mitchell is  surprised that Annie’s indulging him. George burst out that he’s going  to change, grow old, and Mitchell isn’t and that’s why Mitchell’s afraid  of changes. Mitchell scoffs at that and says that he doesn’t want baby  Casper around either before huffing out the door. George huffs upstairs  and packs a bag to move out. Annie doesn’t want him to go, but he’s  adamant about it. After he leaves, Annie sits and sings to the baby when  suddenly, Ghost Mom pops back in. Annie pops away, trying not to give  baby back. She asks the mom how she can trust that he really wants the  baby back, since she just abandoned him for two days. Ghost Mom can pop  the baby back in her arms, though. “I know I’m a crap mom, but I’m the  best he’s got,” she explains. Annie says goodbye to the baby (who’s name  is actually Rufus) and goes back inside to the empty and quiet house.</p><p>George  turns up at Sam’s and blurts out that he just moved out of his house  and why shouldn’t they move in together. “We hardly know each other?”  Sam offers, much more practical than I think George was expecting.  George blurts out a whole bunch of information about himself and ends  with the fact that he’s sick of moving slowly through life. Sam just  needs some time to think and talk to Molly. George understand and says  he should go but Sam invites him in. Her mom is at her aunt’s for the  night.</p><p>At  the funeral home, the constable has let himself in to Mitchell’s office.  He’s giving him a second chance. The molester was released on bail two  hours ago and the constable wants Mitchell to pay him a visit. Mitchell  again tells him that he’s not going to be the police force’s own  personal attack dog and the constable threatens to step back, let the world  discover what they are. Back in 1969, Herrick asks if Mitchell has read  Lewis Carroll as he equates being a vampire to being through the looking  glass. “Point is,” he sums up, “mercy is an indulgence now.” Herrick  says that becoming a vampire doesn’t change the personality, it  liberates it. Vampire is the only truly free man. Herrick asks Mitchell  if he remembers their deal in France and Mitchell does: If Herrick took  him, he’d spare Mitchell’s men. Herrick explains why he offered that:</p><blockquote><p>Because  I could see in you a great man, a terrible man. An orphan-maker. A  breaker of hearts. Now, these people, these children of Darwin, they’ll  tell you that you’re wrong. That you’re a monster. Because they’re  jealous. Because they’re in chains. That little… scratch of  conscience. That’s a lie. That’s not who you are. Now go and kill that  girl.</p></blockquote><p>Back  in the present, Mitchell has come into the child molester’s house. “Are  you someone’s dad, then?” the man asks, expecting this: “Afterwards,  call me an ambulance.” He says he will get help, this time; it’s been  like a sign. It’s the addict’s refrain that Mitchell knows so well  himself. Mitchell tells him to shut up. “Time was, I would have killed  someone like you in a heartbeat,” but whether Mitchell says this in  regret or pride is unknown. Mitchell explains what’s going to happen to  the criminal: he’s going to go to the police tomorrow and will confess  everything. That he needs to be in prison, safer in there than out here  with him. Mitchell goes back to the funeral home where the constable is  getting a blowjob from… a vampire? A groupie? Who knows. Mitchell  tells him that the deal is off. Constable says there’s a natural order  and he’s upsetting it. The constable doesn’t think they can stay  clean. Eventually, they’ll be back to their “beautiful bloody chaos.”  He demands that Mitchell go back and put the animal to sleep. Mitchell  instead locks them in and turns on him, vamped out. In 1969, Mitchell  vamps out at the girl. In the present, he’s ripped the constable’s  throat out in the grossest kill we’ve seen on the show. He leaves and  runs. In 1969, he straightens Herrick’s tie and pretends to be his  prisoner as Herrick takes him away from the crime scene. In the present,  he arrives at Lucy’s covered in blood.</p><p>Lucy  asks what happened. He says he was attacked. She tells him not to lie  to her. It’s very important that his next answer not be a lie: “What  are you?” “I’m a vampire,” he admits. Lucy breathes out and thanks him.  He’s surprised that she already knew. She’s not scared as much as she  should be, she remarks. She thought he was safe and he protests that he  is. He explains that there are people who want to make them savage, he  has to protect all of them and all of humanity. “I think it’s under  control, but it’s just sleeping.” He says he can go clean if the  conditions are right, if there’s someone to change for. Someone like  Lucy. He approaches her and she keeps one hand on the stake. “I’m  begging you. Save me.” She lets go and touches his face.</p><p>In  1969, Mitchell leaves flowers at the house and the girl walks up the  drive. “Help me,” he says. “Why should I?” she asks. “Because I can’t  help myself,” Mitchell answers simply. She nods and introduces herself  as <a
href="../2011/04/being-human-recap-uk-series-1-primer/">Josie</a> as she takes his hand. He and Lucy kiss. He and Josie kiss and fall  into her bed. He and Lucy fall into her bed. Mitchell lays sleeping in  Lucy’s bed as Lucy stands, watching him, holding the stake. She climbs  on top of him, ready to plunge it, but she looks at his calm face and  she can’t. She lays down next to him.</p><p>There  are three big things to talk about in this episodes: Annie’s baby  issues, Herrick’s misogynistic undertones, and the Mitchell/Josie/Lucy  relationship.</p><p>It  slightly upsets me the way they handle Annie’s biological clock issues.  They really seem to go back and forth with her. In season 1, she’s  enraged at the thought of Owen’s girlfriend turning what was supposed to  be their nursery into something else. Yet, suddenly, Annie is denying  any urge to have had a baby when one is thrust upon her in this episode.  By the end of the very special 30 minutes (like this is some kind of  sitcom), she’s named him and trying to keep him. Yet for such a big  life-direction change (or not, if you look back at season one), it’s never  mentioned again. I feel like they do this a lot with Annie. George and  Mitchell get over-arching, season-long plot lines but Annie’s stories  are limited to one or two episodes max. It’s like they’re taken the  ethereal nature of being a ghost too literally, making her stories  vanish in mid-air.</p><p>Herrick’s  speech about the vampire’s place in the world made me realize something  about the language he used. It’s all “his world” and “he” this and  “him” that. We see very few women in the vampire family and the ones  that we’ve seen are either used as portable sex objects (Daisy) or crazy  women hidden away (Cora and Lauren). Women never have a voice in the  vampire hierarchy, except to goad and scorn and they definitely never  hold positions of power. It’s not a far leap to the correlation that  this is, perhaps, what would happen if the world didn’t need women to  reproduce. And it’s not exactly a world I’d want to live in.</p><p>At  the end of the day, though, this is Mitchell’s episode. Mitchell is  sent after the child molester, who knows what fate awaits him. The  molester repents, begs forgiveness, claims that he can’t help himself,  promises not to do it again, promises to change, promises that this time  is different. It’s like looking in a mirror for Mitchell. How many  times have we seen Mitchell alude to his past mistakes? How many times  have we heard Mitchell repeat that vampires can go clean if given the  “right conditions?” But has it ever really worked for Mitchell? You  never have to go more than four or five episodes in any directions to  find yet another time that Mitchell has fallen off the wagon. And yet,  still, he grasps onto anyone that can hold him still, be an anchor for  him until the next time he messes up. In 1969, it was Josie. In 1999,  it’s Lucy. The story never changes.</p><p>Transcript quotes courtesy <a

class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up  in the great Northwest (aka Washington State), a vet and a park ranger  are investigating a dead bear. The ranger, Sherman Rivers, a Native American, is sure that it was just a poacher, nothing nefarious, but the  vet, Dr. Denise Randall, has to perform a thorough examination. Amongst  the beef jerky and other random food in the bear’s stomach, she finds…  a human hand.<span
id="more-28456"></span></p><p>In  the other Washington (D.C., that is), Booth gives Brennan a picture of  the hand. The case was bumped all the way up to Booth, and Brennan  suspects it’s because she works with him and they think that she can ID  the victim. She wants to work through just getting pictures, but Booth  informs her that they’re heading across the country. Brennan takes it to  Dr. Goodman, but he’s all for her getting out and living a little…  connecting with other people. “Are you suggesting I have sex with Agent  Booth on a field trip?” she asks, totally missing the point. He says  that’s exactly why she needs to get out more and advises her to pack  some bug spray.</p><p>As  Booth and Brennan drive along a picturesque mountain lane, Booth  comments that sitting in a hotel with a $50 per diem isn’t his idea of a  good time, either and Brennan is shocked that he can live on that. She  doesn’t get a limit, which Booth thinks is just unfair to the taxpayers.  It’s a good minute of what is probably their first real adorable  exchange together where you can start to see their chemistry come out.  It ends with Booth suggesting that Brennan needs to take him out to  dinner on her tab. She says they’ll start with breakfast. When they  arrive at the town, Booth goes to find the sheriff while Brennan meets  with the local doctor, Dr. Andrew Rigby, and the vet and ranger who  found the body. Brennan needs to have the Jeffersonian team investigate  the remains more and she asks what the fastest way to get the remains  there is. The unanimous answer is “Charlie.”</p><p>Charlie,  it turns out, owns the express shipping place in town. And he’s hot. He  also knows a lot about the exhibits at the Jeffersonian and he’s even  reading Brennan’s book. He’s also totally hitting on her. I don’t know  why, but I find him extremely suspicious. Back in D.C., Zack knows that  the marks suggest a handsaw, but beats himself up for not being able to  tell any more. Angela reminds him he’s just a grad student and offers to  make a 3D image.</p><p>Meanwhile,  Booth is talking to the slightly unhelpful Sheriff Scutter, getting the  layout of the population of the town. A 29-year-old woman went missing  recently, but nothing else out of the ordinary. No real resident  crazies, a few poachers, that’s all. Once Brennan arrives, Scutter is  much more helpful. He reveals that they tracked the bear’s route via GPS  before it died and Brennan suggests checking the bear’s scat (such a  delicate term) for more human remains. The sheriff is totally hitting on  her, too, by the way.</p><p>In  D.C., Zack and Hodgins speculate on why there’s only the hand in the  bear’s belly, but are interrupted by a hot delivery girl, who they think  is certainly an upgrade from their previous delivery person, Jimmy with  three nostrils. Hodgins swoops in and signs for the package, chatting  her up pretty smoothly. He doesn’t ask her out to coffee, though, as  that’s a third delivery step. She looks forward to the next couple of  deliveries, she remarks as she leaves. Zack is pissed that Hodgins  bogarted his delivery.</p><p>Park  Ranger Sherman leads B&amp;B out to the bear poop and tells Brennan  that his people would call her a bone gatherer, helping put souls back  together to help them find their rest. She thinks that’s the best  description of what she does that she’s heard. The poop needs to be sent  to D.C., of course, so Brennan pays Charlie another visit. He’s on chapter 7 and wants to know if she does everything the Brennan in the  book does. Not the sex, he quickly corrects… the shooting and chasing  and stuff. Okay, he’s totally the killer. Don’t have sex with the hot  killer, Brennan… DON’T DO IT!!! Zack calls in while Charlie is busy  not helping Brennan with her package and informs her that the victim  died a week ago and the bear ate the hand one to three days later. He  needs her assistance on some of the marks on the bone, though and she  sets up a satellite connection so that she can get a picture beamed in  from him. As she’s setting it up, Charlie asks Zack is his boss has a  boyfriend. “Not currently,” Zack replies before asking if Charlie is  extremely hot. Charlie asks if Zack is extremely smart as Brennan  notices that the marks on the bone are from teeth… human teeth.  They’re looking for a cannibal. Hot Charlie is a cannibal? NO WAY!!!  [Insert comment about what he can eat here - sorry kids, he’s totally my  type, I don’t know where these comments are coming from.]</p><p>Sheriff  Scutter is a little icked out about the cannibalism, but Brennan has  seen it before in various societies, no big deal. She hypothesizes that  they could be looking for someone in need of help – maybe the missing  girl came along an already dead guy, hungry and lost. I dunno. I don’t  think I could do it. Hodgins and Angela talk about the same thing in D.C.  as he waits for his bear poop. Zack intercepts the package, though and  blurts out to the delivery girl that she’s hot. He doesn’t intend it as a  compliment, just a statement. She smiles, though and remarks that he’s  so cute, she could eat him up. OH NO! SHE’S A CROSS-COUNTRY CANNIBAL!!!</p><p>Brennan  asks Dr. Rigby if anyone in the town has been treated recently for prion disease. Dr. Rigby jumps straight to asking about the cannibal…  the news is all over town already.  In the other Washington, Hodgins is  pissed at Zack as he plays with his bear poop. There’s some bone, along  with tin cans and other random things in the poop. Including some flaps  of skin with a tattoo on them. Fortunately for them, Angela is a tattoo  expert and she’s able to recreate the design, which is a Haida Indian  sun design. As Angela phones Brennan to give her this news, she asks  about the hot guy and if Brennan is getting in there. She reminds her  that what happens in Aurora stays in Aurora. I think you have that  wrong, Angela. With the new tattoo information, the sheriff runs another  missing persons check and the only match is Adam Langer, 22, missing ten days from a local city. Scutter knows the kid, though; he used to  come up and visit Ranger Sherman, wanting to be a ranger himself. Booth,  Brennan and Scutter head out to pay Sherman a visit. The sheriff asks  him to go make some tea so that B&amp;B can get a look around, but  Sherman makes a run for it. Booth heads after him as Brennan and Scutter  search through Sherman’s house. They find a saw and an eaten apple  (that Brennan hopes to get a dental impression from). When they break  open the freezer, it’s stuffed with meat… but what kind? Brennan’ll  need to send it to the lab to find out what kind it is and Booth lost  the guy, so they’ve got the rest of the night free. Angela suggests that  Brennan call that Charlie guy and take him out for a drink.</p><p>At  the local dance hall dive, Charlie and Brennan share a dance and he’s  surprised that she hasn’t wrapped the case up yet. “In real life, you  have to wait for lab results,” she replies. Hahahaha, suuuuure,  your cases so often align to real-life processing times. Charlie reveals  that he and Adam were climbing buddies and Brennan notes that the  definition in his biceps and triceps make him in ideal condition for it.  Charlie’s asking even more questions about the case as Doctor Rigby  cuts in, but he just wants to talk about the investigation, too. He is  sure that Sherman didn’t do it; his tribe never believed in cannibalism.  The sheriff rescues her but he starts talking about the bite marks, so  Booth finally takes the lead and saves Brennan from being pumped by  everyone. He points out that everyone was hitting on her and I think  they might be a hint of jealousy in his voice.</p><p>Hodgins  has been slaving over the poop and has squat. Angela invites him out to  dinner, but he’d rather wait there for the delivery girl. Alas, the  next morning, Zack has torpedoed Hodgins again and swooped up the  package. Booth has waited, too. He waited for Brennan to have  breakfast so long his eggs went cold. They find Ranger Sherman quickly  and he explains that he’s not a cannibal. Zack calls Brennan with the  analysis on the meat and it wasn’t human, just black bear. All becomes  clear: Sherman ran because he was a poacher, not a cannibal. Zack also  informs Brennan that Hodgins found evidence of some beetle infested  trees, which Sherman can helpfully lead them to. When they find the  patch of trees, Sherman confirms that the bear was there seven days ago.  There right now? A big honking satanic rock circle. Brennan snaps a  picture to send to Dr. Goodman (a Native American expert) and they find a  shallow grave nearby containing Adam and the female hiker, Ann Noyce,  whose heart has been cut out. Ew. Goodman looks over the pictures and  explains that it’s a perversion of a standard medicine wheel. He  interprets it as taking energy by eating flesh. Goodman says that the  ritual isn’t complete, though; that they’ll find two more bodies. In  the morgue, Brennan determines that both victims were killed with gun  shots to the head, at close range. Doctor Rigby still doesn’t think that  Ranger Sherman could have done it.</p><p>As  they hold him in custody, Sherman suggests to Booth and Sheriff Scutter  that maybe Adam was supposed to be heading to see Charlie, but stopped  to see vet lady Denise instead. And that Charlie had a thing going with  her, too. In full disclosure, Scutter admits that he sees her  occasionally, too. Brennan arrives with the news that the bite on the  apple doesn’t match the bite on the bone, so Sherman is cleared as the  cannibal. Booth and Brennan find Denise at the bar and try to get a  teeth impression from the very drunk vet. She explains that she didn’t  report him missing because she would have had to admit they were lovers  and that would have made like four people mad. “There’s not a lot to do  in a place like Aurora,” she explains. She also points out that she  wouldn’t have made a deal about the hand if she were the cannibal. Which  is a valid point.</p><p>Back  in D.C., Zack has found something like teeth marks, but too exact, like  from a machine. He sends the image to Brennan and she can’t believe she  missed it: the marks are from a sternum spreader. B&amp;B go to find  the doctor and Booth allows Brennan to have one of his guns for self-defense. The bodies are gone from the morgue and so they head down to  the furnace room, where Rigby is trying to destroy all the evidence.  It’s a spiritual rite, he explains, but before he can go on his crazy  guy rant, Brennan hits him over the head with a bedpan.</p><p>Back  in D.C., Hodgins and Zack await the delivery girl, looking their best, as  Angela observes bemusedly. She comes with a package and they imply that  the one she asks to sign is the one she’s interested in. She looks from  Zack to Hodgins before settling on… Angela. “Oh! That is really  sweet. Thank you,” is Angela’s adorable response. Hodgins thinks that  was the hottest option, but Zack thinks it would have been hotter if she  choose him.</p><p>Wrapping  up in D.C., Brennan is glad she ventured out of her comfort zone. “You  don’t often find ritual cannibalism so close to home,” she explains.  Rigby has had prion disease, but still no idea from where. Could even be  from licking his fingers after surgery and ew. As Booth tries to  stomach his food, Brennan talks about coming back up there to ski in the  winter. Charlie says the skiing is great. As Brennan talks about how  perfectly developed his hips and thighs are, Booth is totally done  trying to eat his breakfast.</p><p>There  are a few interesting things going on in this episode. We see Booth and  Brennan getting a little more comfortable with each other and we also  see Booth starting to attempt to broaden Brennan’s horizons. In some  throwaway dialogue when they arrive in Aurora, Brennan talks about  something she’d studied in Guatemala, and is shocked to find that Booth  had been to the country as well. She asks with scorn if he was an  eco-tourist, but he reveals that he was there on sniper duty, stopping  her in her tracks. It’s an important shake to Brennan’s assumptions that  she’ll continue to get as their relationship develops.</p><p>Another  interesting thing is how much emphasis is on Brennan’s hotness in this  episode. They never attempted to make the character of Brennan Hollywood  homely, fitting the conventional TV stereotype of smart, but not that  pretty. Even from the first episode, Brennan is always presented as  having her choice of suitors. And even more importantly, she is shown as  being comfortable with the idea of casual sex. It’s in an episode  that’s yet to come, but we’ll soon discover that her attitudes  surrounding sex are based in her anthropological background, from  cultures where monogomy is not the cultural norm. It’s a controversial  take for a mainstream show to not only take, but to not make a huge deal  out of.<br

Booth and Brennan get to go undercover as Angela and Hodgins get ready to have their baby. So their game is changing, too. And those are the ONLY two references to the title. Maybe.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a bowling alley, a really snotty kid named Justin is having a birthday party. And no one is letting him bowl, apparently, so he yells at him mom that he wants to bowl. Hey! His mom is Libby from <em>Sabrina</em>!<span
id="more-27527"></span> The pins aren’t resetting fast enough for little Justin, though and Libby gets all mom on him, telling him that he doesn’t want to know what happens to bad boys. Justin finds out (or so he thinks) as the pins reset and a bunch of flesh and bones come down with them. Justin totally promises to behave now.</p><p>At the Jeffersonian, Angela is still pregnant. Very pregnant (although not quite two weeks overdue yet). She’s resorting to hot sauce as she reminds Hodgins that the first thing the doctor has to check is the baby’s eyes. Hodgins reminds her that they’re in very good hands with their doctor as he almost dies from the amount of hotness on Angela’s food. She is unfazed.</p><p>Booth and Brennan arrive at the bowling alley, which had been closed for 10 days for lane resurfacing and had just reopened the day before. Brennan makes the victim as a white male, mid 30s. The pin machine ground him up pretty well and the cop on the scene suggests that he snuck back there to have it off with someone. Brennan says that he was already dead a week when he was ripped apart, though, and that there are defensive wounds. It’s a murder!</p><p>Wendell is the squintern of the week and as he tries to work, Hodgins complains about he and Angela being there when they should be at home in comfort. Wendell tells Hodgins to prepare to be Brennanized and uses a lot of big words to describe a repetitive stress injury. They theorize that it’s from sun god worshipping. Angela comes up and suggests that it’s probably from bowling, since… you know, he was found at a bowling alley. In a bowling shirt. That said Jeff on the pocket and the league name The Thunderballs on the back. Oh, and on the pregnancy front, neither hot sauce nor sex have worked. Angela suggests a long ride on a bumpy road and Wendell suggests a roller coaster (like the one his mom was on when she went into labor… I’m pretty sure no park would allow that).</p><p>The victim was Jeff Fowler – big shot in local bowling, lots of trophies. Booth recognizes the bowling team as the one that Brennan’s dad plays on and really hopes that Max didn’t kill anyone this time. As Brennan is on her way to meet Booth and her dad, Angela calls. Brennan assumes she’s in labor, but no, Angela just wants to talk. Brennan says that she can’t concentrate on anything else and Angela thinks it’s because she’s a good friend.  At the Royal Diner, Max is in a wheelchair. He’s initially reticent to explain why, but then admits that he fell off a bed. As did his thirty-six year old lady friend, Rosamund. Brennan asks about Fowler. Max explains that Jeff called himself The Closer; everyone else called him The Gloater. Booth wants to go question the leaguemates, find out who had grudges, but Max says no one will talk – it’s tournament time. He suggests that Booth takes his place on the team, go undercover, hear the gossip. Brennan likes going undercover and Booth suggests that Brennan can be his girlfriend. She says sure, but if Angela goes into labor, they have to have a fight so she can leave. Booth agrees and Max notices something odd between them. He asks if they’re fighting… they’re too polite to each other. Brennan says she just wants to be there… for Angela’s baby. Suuuuure, Brennan.</p><p>Undercover mode B&amp;B arrive at the bowling alley wearing the most terrible wigs in creation. Dear, god, Booth has a mullet. I just… I can’t even… Wanda and Buck and their terrible wigs and blue eyeshadow have killed me. Done. Anyway. Max tells them that they need to act like a couple if they’re going to pretend to be one. We meet the rest of the team: Amber is about 12 and carrying on the theme of terribly behaved children from the teaser. Hercules, aka The TornAHdo, doubts Booth’s skills. Booth schools him by rolling a strike on the first shot. “Now that’s my muffin at work!” Brennan shouts. I am totally calling my husband “muffin” from now on. Seeing that The Thunderballs have a ringer, the other team, Strike Force, start to divide and concur: Tina, a younger lesbian, hits on Brennan and Alison, an older woman, hits on Booth. Their third team member, Blake, a young guy with longish blonde hair, hits on no one. Amber yells at the team to back off, eliciting the attention of Tod, the tournament director. He’s called The Raven. I don’t know why… maybe he’s from Baltimore.</p><p>At the lab, Hodgins has found red flakes embedded in the front of the victim’s skull. Wendell observes that with the ground up-ness of the body, it’s going to be tough to determine cause of death. The only fracture he can see is a broken nose and who dies from a broken nose? As he refers to the skull, they hear it rattling and find pieces of the broken nose. The fragments flew into his brain, killing him. Angela comes in to the room and Hodgins freaks out, thinking it’s time. Seriously, Hodgins, when it’s time, I think you’ll know. Angela channels my thoughts and tells him to chill.</p><p>Back at the bowling alley, The Tornado… sucks. Amber’s really good, though and she keeps score on her laptop. On the other team, Tina’s bowling strikes, as well and Blake makes a 7-10 split. As Booth takes his turn, Brennan hangs out with Amber a little. Amber logs every single game on her computer and has predicted that she’ll be World Champion of the World in 2026. Brennan points out that phrase’s redundancy and Amber explains that she’s “so good, they have to say it twice.” Unfortunately for The Thunderballs, Strike Force wins that round. Booth finds out from Max that The Raven assigned Hercules to the team after Jeff got killed, thinking he’s trying to sabotage the team. Max again encourages B&amp;B to act more couply. Aww, I love Brennan’s dad. Brennan kisses Booth and leaves to go grill Hercules as Max smirks. Hercules blames Amber for giving him bad juju, basically. He also thinks that Jeff was a hack… he always used the same rental shoes, his lucky shoes and had a lucky everything; lucky ball, lucky lane 12. Hercules doesn’t need luck as he has God on his side. Stupidly, he lets slip that Jeff told everyone that he was a terrible bowler (um, that’s kind of truth, dude) and ominously says that God works in mysterious ways. Booth, meanwhile, goes to get info from Blake, who is enjoying his position as the “hair apparent” with the ladies now that Jeff is dead.</p><p>In the lab, Angela fires up her magic screen as she eats some more hot sauced food. They rule out a 2×4, hammer, bat, and bottle from being the murder weapon. Guys? What about a bowling ball? Since, you know, it was in a bowling alley? I’m going to chalk their obtuseness up to the impending baby, which, by the way, is on its way. Angela says “Oh my god,” which isn’t noticed by Hodgins. Angela can’t believe that he’s been on edge all day and doesn’t notice when her water breaks. It’s showtime and Hodgins is calm, very calm as she yells at him to get the car. He runs, shouting “Where they hell are my keys?” Really, Hodgins? You aren’t keeping them on you? That’s what pockets are for, kid.</p><p>At the hospital, Angela is screaming through a contraction or, as she calls it, a fireball of pain. She calls the doctor a rotten old bat and then yells at Hodgins for having an annoying voice. Oh, joy… the old wife shouts terrible things during childbirth cliché. Since the contractions are still pretty far apart, Hodgins videos in to the lab where Wendell doesn’t know how to read the results on the red flecks from the mass spectrometer and also doesn’t know how to make the Angelamatic work. God, Wendell! Just a couple of weeks ago, you were telling us that you were the best! What good are you? Angela tells him to run it through the Spatula program as the doctor snarks about them working when they should be concentrating on bringing a baby into the world. I like this doctor. Cam shows up on the other end as Hodgins reads the results and says that the red flecks are polyurethane and hey, bowling balls are coated in polyurethane, maybe they should try that out. Gee, you think?</p><p>At the bowling alley, B&amp;B are definitely having more fun than the rest of the team. As Brennan bends over for something, Blake comments on her nice buns, causing Booth to throw badly. He blames it on his shoes and gets a strike next. “Buck’s on the truck, driving the truck, Buck Truck,” he celebrates incoherently. Brennan takes a phone call and Allison sweeps in to make small talk with Booth, revealing that Blake is a car thief. Allison finds it kind of exciting, but Booth observes that would kind of make him and Jeff (who created custom cars) natural enemies. Brennan comes back with the information that the weapon is most likely a bowling ball and Brennan checks in Blake’s bag with her mini black light. She gets caught and quickly covers that she was checking for illegal substances on his ball that would enhance the performance. The bowlers call over The Raven to rule on what’s happening and later, he reveals that he thinks that Jeff got what he deserved. Turns out that Jeff super-glued The Raven’s hand to his ball as a prank. Booth calls to Sweets and says to have The Raven picked up for questioning.</p><p>Wendell videos in to the hospital because he needs more instructions on the magic screen. The Doctor says that everything’s going great and Angela yells that it’s not. She says no the an epidural again, though, because “natural childbirth is a beautiful thing,” she yells in explanation. Wendell can’t really understand her instructions since a contraction hits, so he videos out.</p><p>Sweets interrogates The Raven in the room and starts off by showing him the video of his crash. Ouch. It’s brutal. The Raven says that he’s a director now, people respect him. Yeah, it messed up his career as a bowler, but it didn’t ruin his life. He supervises 12 leagues, has a kind of family… he’s cool. Sweets grills him more, getting downright mean and leading to this priceless exchange:</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Raven</strong>: Are you being so cruel to me in the hopes of getting some kind of “crazy murderer” response?<br
/> <strong>Sweets</strong>: Yeah… yeah, I am.<br
/> <strong>The Raven</strong>: That’s extremely cold-hearted.<br
/> <strong>Sweets</strong>: That’s my job.</p></blockquote><p>Sweets still needs to get The Raven’s alibi, though, and The Raven says that he was bowling at a different alley at the time of death.</p><p>Wendell and Cam think they have Angela’s screen figured out, but… they really don’t. First, there’s a flame, then Harry Truman, then an animated kitten with a skull and finally, a Hodgins/Angela sexy time encounter. They turn it off and video in, but Angela’s of no use since she’s, you know, having a baby.</p><p>The next bowling match isn’t going any better than the previous one as Booth gets the deadly 7-10 split. Brennan informs him that it’s highly improbable that he’ll make that shot and Tina observes “Sometimes, when you speak, it’s like you watch PBS on purpose.” Booth gets the split and Brennan says that something must be wrong with the lane; he shouldn’t have been able to do that.</p><p>Giving up on the magic screen, Wendell has gathered all sort of bowling balls to figure out which one is the weapon the old-fashioned way. He determines that it must have been less than five pounds. Like a child’s ball. Brennan investigates Amber’s records and observes that “If Buck and I ever have a child, she will never turn out like Amber.” Brennan notices that a lot of difficult splits have been achieved on Lane 12… she thinks that someone recalibrated lane 12 to set the pins closer. Brennan thinks that it was Jeff, but Booth things that it might have been ultra competitive Amber once they get news about the light bowling ball. Brennan references their imaginary child AGAIN.</p><p>Wendell calls B&amp;B with Hodgins on the line. Angela’s labor has stalled and everyone’s getting a little cranky now. Hodgins says that bowling balls chip, rather than flake. A ball doesn’t make sense for the weapon. As it’s just about time to push, Hodgins suggests a motorcycle helmet with red sparkles as he signs off.</p><p>Booth asks the crowd who owns a motorcycle. No one in the league does, but the shoe guy does. Booth announces that he has to quit the team and Brennan explains, “We have to catch a killer and then we have to go visit our friend in the hospital, you understand.” Brennan whips out the black light and finds blood on his red helmet. Booth whips the mullet off (thank goodness!) and places the guy under arrest. The shoe guys breaks down… Jeff never washed his feet, the shoes stunk, it caused him to lose all his fingernails and then his girlfriend and he didn’t mean to kill him. The other teams says to go easy on him and Amber freaks out because the game can’t continue. Brennan informs her that she is a horrible child.</p><p>It’s the big moment and Angela is pushing. She wants to talk about what happens if the baby is blind and Hodgins assures her that they’re totally ready. As Adele’s “To Make You Feel My Love,” starts playing and I get something in my eye as Angela wants to reassure Hodgins that she thinks he has a wonderful voice. They tell each other how much they love each other and the doctor marvels, “You’re going to be wonderful parents, no matter what happens.” The team waits outside the room, and Brennan looks uncharacteristically teary already. Back in the delivery room, it’s a boy. The doctor takes him away to check his eyes as Hodgins breathes “We’re a family.” Hodgins and Angela wait with worried looks. The doctor brings him back, announcing that his vision is fine. “Everything about him is just fine.” Aww… Hodgins nods slowly, taking in the great news.</p><p>As the team waits, Brennan holding her stuffed rabbit, Hodgins brings out the baby: Michael Staccato Vincent Hodgins. Oh, goodness… there’s that thing in my eyes again. “These are your friends,” he says to the baby as they all huddle around to meet him. Brennan sneaks off to go see Angela and asks her what it was like. Angela replies that “it was wonderful and beautiful… it was a dream.”</p><p>Brennan and Booth walk down a street together and Brennan remarks about how happy they looked. She thinks that they’d be apprehensive and scared of all the changes. Booth says that’s it a great change, though. Brennan, with another question behind her eyes, asks him if that’s really what he thinks. He says yes and after a momentary worried pause, Brennan informs him that she’s pregnant. And he’s the father. Shock, followed by joy comes over Booth’s face as he smiles. Brennan smiles back and we’re left with that wordless answer to our questions from last week.</p><p>My husband’s jaw literally dropped at Brennan’s revelation, but after all her comments about babies and wanting to be there for Angela, I was thinking that there had to be something going on. When Brennan was tearing up before the baby was born, I knew it. It’s definitely a very convenient way to write in Emily Deschanel’s pregnancy. It’ll be interesting to see what the implications for Booth and Brennan are. In season 4, they discussed Booth being a donor for Brennan, but it was dropped because Booth couldn’t *not* be involved with his child. Are they going to be a couple now? How’s that going to go? How on earth is Parker going to react (especially since we never saw how he reacted to She Who Shall Not Be Named leaving)? It’ll definitely be interesting to see where we go in season 7.</p><p>What did you think about the game changers in this finale?<br

isPermaLink="false">http://persephonemagazine.com/?p=26895</guid> <description><![CDATA[George makes a list to improve his life, Mitchell starts a Bloodaholics Anonymous group and Annie gets lessons on how to avoid the doors. ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flashback  time: Tonight, we see Lucy, looking at some DNA results, admonishing  the cheating parents. The creepy old man comes up behind her and  introduces himself as Kemp. Thank you! Finally, I can give you a name! <span
id="more-26895"></span>She thinks he’s reinforcements, a new employee, but he says that he’s  there about the papers she wrote last year. About her theory that a gene  could be the cause of all evil. He calls it a revelation. She says it  was just speculative. He asks her about a sample they got last week that  made no sense, that she probably blamed on a malfunctioning machine.  Kemp says it was evil. He wants her to think about it, give him a ring  if she’s interested.</p><p>In  the present, Annie is following the postman around critiquing people’s  mail. Well, what else are you gonna do when you’re dead? She sees a cop  pull up to an alley and follows him because that’s a lot more  interesting than mail. The cop on the scene says the victim hasn’t been  dead long, probably an OD. Annie suddenly sees the dead man standing  over his body. She asks if he knows what happened to him and he says,  “They told me to wait for you.” A door appears and he tries to pull her  through.</p><p>At  the house, George is making sausage and is far too chipper. He’s tells  Mitchell that he had a breakthrough after reading Nina’s letter. He’s  made a list. Order is achieved. “You sure you okay?” Mitchell asks.</p><p>Annie  wakes up in the alley and another young ghost has helped her. He  introduces himself as Sykes, takes some thanks for saving her afterlife  and heads on his way. Annie wants him to help her stop it happening, but  Sykes wants to move on, be a free spirit, so to speak.</p><p>George  asks Mitchell to help him face up to what happens to him during his  time of a month. He’s an animal, he points out, he should be put in a  cage. So he puts, “Buy a cage” on his list. Mitchell questions his plan,  but George continues: It’s one night a month, it shouldn’t stop him from  living the rest of the time. That’s on his list, too, kind of… in the  form of getting a better job.</p><p>Annie  is still following Sykes, threatening to haunt him. He tells her she’s a  kid and fighting off the gatekeepers is adult stuff. He can tell by her  aura that she’s not ready, but this just makes her want to learn how to  read auras, too.</p><p>Mitchell  is hanging out at the funeral home (does he have admin work to do? Is  he a paper pusher?). One of the vampires brings in a girl who looks like a  low-rent goth. The vampire explains that the boss gets first drink.  They found her on an emo message board, she wants to be drunk from.  “It’s a kind of groupie thing. Isn’t that better?” Mitchell tells the  hapless lackey that no, it’s not and the girl requests bus fare home  since she’s not getting bitten. Ivan comes is after overhearing and says  that was an interestingly creative interpretation of the rules. Ivan  tells Mitchell a story about a guy in AA he knew once and Mitchell looks  at him. You can almost see the light bulb above his head. Almost.</p><p>George  goes to see a man about a cage. For a very big dog, he explains. “About  the size of a man?” the guy guesses. The man thinks he’s in the S&amp;M  community and he’s totally cool with that. He dabbles. He’ll even  through in some handcuffs free of charge. At home, George rants about  the impropriety of Bristol. Sykes is at home, too, but he’s still being  slightly resistant to Annie’s requests for tutelage. Mitchell doesn’t  know about Sykes. He thinks his timing is suspicious. Mitchell and Annie  discuss George briefly, and agree that he needs to talk about Nina.  Sykes reveals that he doesn’t want to teach Annie because there’s only  one passing grade, he doesn’t want it on his conscience if he fails.  Finally he agrees, “If it’s okay with your two dads.” After he leaves,  George asks Annie if they can switch rooms because of the cage. She just  looks at him, in disbelief. “Bad time?”</p><p>Mitchell  has decided to make a Bloodaholics Anonymous group. Ivan thinks it’s  ridiculous and  relates the idea to dancing bears in Russia: “This great  big mountain of power and fury, done up in a fez and waist coat,”  waiting to rip someone’s throat out. Mitchell wants Ivan to join up;  he’s an old one, it’ll make the program legit. Mitchell worries about  when the withdrawal hits and the memories come flooding back to all the  dry vampires.</p><p>George  is at a school, interviewing for a position. The principal’s assistant,  a woman named Sam, gets him some water. George spots a photo on her  desk and she confirms that it’s her daughter, Molly, 7. In the interview,  the principal wonders what’s wrong with him, he’s massively  overqualified for the position. George points out that it’s still a step  up from a porter. The principal wants to know why he would settle for a  remedial teaching job. George explains that two years ago he had an  accident, but that he feels better now and ready to reenter the world.</p><p>Sykes  starts on aura reading lessons with Annie. She doesn’t catch on to it  immediately, and equates it to a magic eye thing. Suddenly, she sees  grey around the man’s head. “It’s a tumor,” Sykes explains. Annie wants  to let the man know, but Sykes thinks he already does. Annie jokes about  reading Sykes’ aura, but he gets tetchy. His only rule is that she  needs to stay out of there.</p><p>Mitchell  finds Lucy at the hospital. He suggests 20 questions to solve the  closed book issue. She’s not receptive at first, but eventually asks  where he was the previous day. Without hesitation, he answers that he  was at an AA meeting. Lucy is almost surprised. “So that’s your big bad  secret, is it?” She points out his drinking at the pub the other night,  but he says that’s not his drug of choice. She asks about the 12 steps,  thinking that she should be on the amends list. She tells him that  she’ll think about how he can make it up to her. George walks past and  smirks as Lucy walks away. George kids Mitchell that she’s out of his  league and guesses that there must me some other reason she’s chatting  him up, access to drugs maybe. Mitchell points out that she’s a doctor  and has her own access. George accidently bumps a patient into a wall  but says it’s okay; he has enough tranqulizers to keep a horse out.  He gets a brilliant idea and Mitchell steals some tranqs for him. George  sets up a video camera on the cage and gets ready for the full moon.</p><p>At  the Creepy Lab, Nina is in the chamber. She complains that she’s  starting to get headaches. Lucy arrives and asks if they’re sure about  this, if they’ve changed anything since the last time. Nina says that  she has a nosebleed. Lucy tells her to relax. It’s part of the process.  Kemp says that this is how we help them. We can recalculate for the next  one, which they want to be George. Lucy points out that the best way to  reach him is through Nina as Nina screams in pain in the chamber. Lucy  yells to the tech and Kemp that if they don’t stop, she’ll explode and  to lower the pressure. The tech looks at Kemp. Once the pressure is  lowered, Nina still changes, even though she’s unconscious. Lucy thinks  that’s a breakthrough. Before she leaves, she tells them to tell her it  was a malfuntion. Nina needs to believe to get George in, she explains.</p><p>The  next morning, George comes down and asks the roomies if the want to  see the most beautiful sight: eight hours of a sleeping werewolf. Annie  is so happy for George. He’s done it, he’s put the wolf to sleep. He  hugs Mitchell, who demands he takes a shower as he is RIPE.</p><p>George  starts his teaching job. He’s teaching English as a Foreign Language  and today’s subject is the two meaning of “used to.” He’s interrupted by  a student asking what the F word is. He thinks they’re making fun, but  they’re not. They need to know these things. “People laugh at us, we  don’t know F word,” one student explains. George consents and says that  for 10 minutes every lesson, he’ll teach them about swearing. While  George teaches the class about shutting the fuck up, the principal  happens by. He asks to see George and tells him off for the language.  George apologizes, but the principal insists that he repeats that he  understands that. He’s just trying to humiliate George and talks down to  him a lot. As he leaves, George makes the V sign at him. Translating UK  dirty gestures, that’s basically the finger.</p><p>Sykes  is giving Annie ghost lessons again. He teaches her about the  frequencies in the TV. They recruit people through it. Annie turns it  off and Sykes says well done. Annie jokes about introducing Sykes to  more modern TV, but the frequency starts changing and it’s time for the  lesson to be over.</p><p>At the BA meeting, Ivan steps in to attend. As he speaks, other vampires watch from outside the circle.</p><p>George  and Sam meet for lunch and he is hungry. She asks how he’s finding it.  He loves the students. She thinks he’ll be gone in six months of  boredom. He thinks boredom is exciting after his dangerous life. He  jokes that he was a superhero with the power of extreme hairiness. He  picks up a glass and his hand shakes, so he excuses himself to the  bathroom. There’s a large biker-looking guy at the urinal next to him  and as they’re doing their business, George shouts out “cocks”  involuntarily. The biker gives him a look as he walks out.</p><p>Sykes  brings Annie home where George has made a bunch of dishes for their  next lesson. Sykes says they’re testing her ability to taste. She places  her hands on his head. George says it’s tingly. Annie closes her eyes,  imagines it’s her eating. George takes some of the first dish. It’s  cold… bright… lemon? It is lemon sorbet! Next up: meat. Lots of  it, she says, but then sees a flash of the werewolf. Annie jumps back,  explaining that she’s not feeling very well and wants to stop. George  rages and screams, “I’ll just throw all this in the bin, shall I?” Annie  and Sykes don’t how how to react to the outburst.</p><p>After  the BA meeting, Ivan encourages them all to keep strong. He tells  Mitchell that they need more tea and biscuits the group has grown so  much. “All that matters is what happens on the stage, right?” He  non-sequiturs to Mitchell. Mitchell asks what’s up and Ivan confesses  that he can’t do it… he thought he could, but he can’t after 195  years. He won’t quit the group, but he wants to eat on the side. He  can’t do it dry. “Do you have any idea what you’re asking me to do?”  Mitchell asks.  “I could say the same to you,” Ivan retorts.</p><p>Late  at night, Sam is getting George’s details. Turns out there was a crash  and his whole file got erased. George lists his emergency contact as  Mitchell, explaining that they’re just housemates. She goes for a folder  and he goes for a kiss, then apologizes. She tells him that there  wasn’t really a crash; she kind of deleted his file. On purpose. He  says that was very devious as he goes in for a kiss again. Back at home  that night, George watches the video of the wolf sleeping again, touches  the screen, smiles sadly. Next day, he meets up with Sam again and goes  for a kiss but she shies away. He shouts out, “Bollocks,” then, “Shit,” and  then runs away around a corner. At home, he confesses his sudden  Tourette’s to the roomies and then bursts out at them when they laugh at  him. He realizes that he was foolish to think he could put the wolf to  sleep. Mitchell doesn’t want to jump to that, but George knows what he’s  feeling. The wolf wants to rage. He had a murderous vision about a kid  with an annoying phone, but Annie points out that he didn’t do it,  that’s the important thing. George thinks it’s just because the kid got  off the bus.</p><p>Mitchell  meets up with Ivan, but he’s not happy about it. Ivan did think he  could go clean, he explains, but he was wrong. Mitchell brings him to a  room with the girl from before. Disgusted, Mitchell tells him to enjoy  his meal and walks away.</p><p>Sykes  thinks that Annie is ready for the final exam. Turns on all the  electrical appliances around the house (since it’s where she died). They  wait and eventually all the devices begin to tune. They show her a  vision of her dead body and open a door. The dead Annie taunts her and  then turns on Sykes. “Have you told her what you did? Of all the men  that died because of your mistake, your cowardice.” He starts freaking  out and Annie tells him to focus, but he’s inside his head. Annie tells  Dead Annie that she’s just tricks, she can’t do anything. “I thought you  were an army of devils, but you’re not. You’re a magician who’s come to  the end of his act,” Annie tells the Dead Annie. She pushes the door  closed and the Dead Annie disappears. Sykes comes out of his stupor and  thinks she did a good job.</p><p>At  the lab, Lucy is telling Kemp about Mitchell leading a nest of vampires  being clean. Kemp tells her that the funeral parlor reopened, which she  didn’t know about. She thinks it’s just a building. Kemp worries that  she’s lost sight and she thinks that he’s patronizing. With werewolves,  he explains, they’re trying to free an innocent soul. Vampires can’t  change. Lucy thinks Mitchell can and will prove it.</p><p>George  goes to see Sam at work, but the principal is badly hitting on her, so  he dashes before he gets too angry. He’s trying to calm down in his  classroom and she comes in. She’s heard about the swearing. Doesn’t  matter to her. She really does think it’s Tourette’s. He bursts out with a,  “Fuck you,” and she laughs:  “One step at a time, tiger.” In the  bathroom, he sees, “Mr. Sands Suck Cocks” written on the mirror. He goes  to correct it (hey, proper grammar is important) as the principal comes  in. George tries to just go, but the principal corners him, wanting an  apology. He wants an apology for George daring to date a woman so out of  his league. George can’t bring himself to do that and starts beating on  the principal. “If you tell anybody about this, I will finish off  the fucking job,” he threatens.</p><p>On  a country lane, Annie sits with Sykes. She doesn’t get why people can’t  see her again, but Sykes says she was never meant to be seen. She was  something different. “A crease in the cloth.” Annie asks what happened  to him. He was in battle, made the wrong choice… his men died. He  didn’t want to have more blood on his hands, that’s why he didn’t help  her. That’s why he doesn’t want to go through the door. He doesn’t know  if they’ll welcome him. Sykes says that from now on the door will be her  choice. She can’t imagine choosing it, but Sykes says that the world  will change around her: “Eventually it becomes unbearable.”  He  leaves, on to the next adventure.</p><p>At the BA meeting, Ivan is all handshakes and hugs and Mitchell is broody.</p><p>At the house, George cowers in his cage in the fetal position, crying. He’s now become the monster, not the wolf.</p><p>At  this midpoint in the season, it’s so hard to discuss what has happened  without foreshadowing what will happen. Annie is strong and empowered  after her lessons with Sykes. Mitchell has a system in place and it  works, unhappy though he may be with it. George thought he found a way  to cage the monster, but only introduced the monster into the rest of  his life. At whatever midpoint our characters are at, however, it’s  only going to get worse for them. But that’s for another week.<br

class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26597" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vnm-300x168.jpg?1103ba" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>Jacob Broadsky is back, after <a
href="../2011/03/bones-recap-6-15-the-killer-in-the-crosshairs/">Booth didn’t take the shot at him last time</a>, and he’s looking for help from an old friend. The friend says he’s done killing people, and just offhandedly mentions that the FBI told him Broadsky was crazy. Friend just thought that Broadsky was working for the CIA on something the Bureau didn’t approve of. Broadsky asks for a favor: to use the friend’s rifle. Friend will think about it, as they toast to “the good guys.”</p><p>Booth, Brennan and Sweets hang out in the Royal Diner because they haven’t had a case in over a week. Why? Because Booth requested that his case load be cleared so that he could put all his energy into finding Broadsky. Mr. Vincent Nigel-Murray bounces into the Diner with “massive” news: the T-rex skeleton that he and Brennan ordered has arrived at the Jeffersonian. Brennan explains that they’re going to deliver a paper on a very long title that has no meaning to me, Sweets or Booth, but <a
href="http://bones-daily.com/photos/displayimage.php?album=675&amp;pid=153757#top_display_media">cracks Brennan and VN-M up</a>. Before they can explain the funny, Booth gets a text: Broadsky’s been spotted, at his girlfriend Paula’s grave. When Booth arrives at the cemetery, Tina Majorino is back as Agent Shaw. She’s been keeping a detail on the site, but Broadsky spotted her. As Booth looks for evidence, a cell phone starts ringing from the flowers. Booth reads out the number so that they can track it before answering. Of course, it’s Broadsky, who thinks it’s cold that they’re staking out Paula’s grave. Broadsky lays it out for Booth: since Booth is trying to stop him, that means that Booth is playing for the wrong team. He’s not one of the good guys anymore. Broadsky warns, “Don’t you forget, you never see the bullet that takes you down.”</p><p>Back at the lab, VN-M is wearing some of the T-rex bones. Yeah, you read that right. There’s a backpack thing… it’s really hard to describe. Hodgins wonders what he’s doing and VN-M explains says the title of the paper he and Brennan will be presenting. Hodgins understands it, thinks it’s awesome and translates for us regular people: It’s a theoretical arm wresting match between a human and a T-rex. Okay, that’s pretty awesome. Hodgins is disappointed that it’s going to be all equations and powerpoint, though, and asks if he can borrow the T-rex backpack. Hodgins should really be a mythbuster, don’t you think? Cam thinks they really need a murder case again. Badly.</p><p>Sweets works his profiling magic on Broadsky (side note: I want Sweets to be dead wrong about something someday) and Sweets thinks that Broadsky wants to keep the lines of communication open between himself and Booth, hoping that Booth will stand down and just let Broadsky do his “good work.” Sweets also thinks that someone is helping Broadsky. Of course, he’s right. They find that Matthew Leishenger, an old military buddy, just made a big withdrawl and determine that he was the one helping Broadsky. Angela arms Booth with an app that’ll locate which cell phone towers Broadsky’s calls are using and Booth, Shaw and Sweets head out to where Leishenger lives to question him. Shaw is kind of twitchy at having a civilian with them, especially when they might be shot by a master sniper. On Leishenger’s property, they find a rotting body and an empty rifle case. Booth thinks that Broadsky would have taken the case if he’d gone far and Shaw spots a camera in a tree. She calls for backup as Booth shoots the camera. Broadsky, who has been watching them, chuckles as he polishes a special bullet.</p><p>Cam estimates that the body, assumed to be Leishenger, has been dead for about five days and he was definitely stabbed under the chin. His wallet had been looked through, but all the cash was there and nothing of note had been taken. Hodgins interrupts to steal V-NM for a minute for a “life or death” issue. The issue: showing off the pimped out T-rex backpack, which can now exert the right amount of force in a practical setting. VN-M tries it on and Hodgins plays for the Humans as Cam discovers them. Ever the good boss, she just reminds VN-M that if he breaks Hodgins, he’ll have to raise the baby. The T-rex takes an immediate lead, but VN-M discovers that he can’t rotate the elbow beyond 40 degrees. He tries pushing it and the shoulder socket breaks before he can defeat the tiny human arm. That’s pretty awesome.</p><p>Booth thinks that killing Leishenger is against type for Broadsky, but Sweets posits that Leighenger wronged Broadsky somehow, maybe refusing to lend him the rifle, which would put him on the “wrong” side according to Broadsky’s flawed logic. Booth is upset with himself for not taking care of Broadsky when he had the chance. Sweets agrees, emotionally, but thinks that professionally, he did the right thing. Sweets worries though, that if Broadsky kills Booth, the whole team is marked for death. Way to put the pressure on, Sweets.</p><p>Vincent Nigel-Murray waxes poetic about how amazing it is that tiny, fragile humans can defeat the huge, powerful T-rex in a match of strength as he and Brennan find the other injuries on Leishenger’s body. There’s a cracked rib, crushed foot and neck fracture. Brennan reenacts the combat that must have taken place for Booth, but he’s frustrated, wanting to know how that brings him closer to finding Broadsky. The answer is, it doesn’t.</p><p>It’s time for an old-school montage now, but far from welcome, this is the most nerve-wracking montage <em>Bones</em> has ever done. “Keep the Streets Empty For Me” by Fever Ray plays as everything moves in slow motion. We see everyone going about their business… Hodgins, walking across a street (OH GOD, NO! NOT HODGINS!!!); VN-M, Booth and Brennan in the lab; Agent Shaw looking out a window; Angela crossing a street. WHY ARE YOU ALL OUTSIDE OR NEAR WINDOWS?!?!?! Find shelter!! Get inside!!! Don’t you know that <a
href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">Tonight, Someone Dies</a>? Sweets is in the Diner (by a window!)’ Angela and Hodgins meet on a corner (DON’T YOU DARE LET HODGINS DIE IN ANGELA’S ARMS!!!); Broadsky is ominously in a crane, high up above the city, the vengeful false god waiting to act. Cam sips tea in the Jeffersonian (SHE’S SAFE, RIGHT? SHE’S INSIDE! SHE MUST BE SAFE! IF SHE’S NOT SAFE INSIDE, NO ONE IS SAFE!!!!). Broadsky makes a phone call as the song ends.</p><p>The phone ringing is Booth’s, of course. Booth hands the phone to Vincent Nigel-Murray so that he can trace the location. He instructs VN-M to wait until the fifth ring. Broadsky is looking into the building with heat targeting and as soon as the phone is answered, he fires off a shot at the person who is holding the phone. Booth doesn’t react soon enough and fact-lover squintern Mr. Vincent Nigel-Murray is shot. The titular hole in the heart is through his. Booth puts pressure on his wound, but VN-M insists it doesn’t hurt. He looks at Brennan, begging not to make him go. He loves being there, it’s been lovely being there… he doesn’t want to go. Brennan, holding back tears, tells him that he doesn’t have to go, he can stay as long as he likes, “You’re my favorite, everyone knows that, right, Booth?” But Vincent Nigel-Murray has stopped talking. Brennan tells him he needs to keep the pressure on, but Booth softly says that no, he doesn’t. After a pause, she reassures Booth that he did everything he could. “You were very brave. I witnessed everything… You did everything you could.”</p><p>My husband would like to point out that VN-M was wearing a <a
href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">red shirt</a>. Farewell, Mr. Nigel-Murray.</p><p>The team sits around a table. Brennan says it’s amazing he lasted as long as he did. Sweets tries to evaluate their emotions, but Angela just wants to be sad for a minute. Hodgins remembers his facts fondly, Cam, his confessions. Booth comes in and informs the team that they recovered the casing. Booth feels partly responsible because he gave VN-M the phone. He doesn’t blame himself, though, he blames Broadsky and rightly so. Now, Brennan says, they work to find the murderer. Cam refuses to do the autopsy, she can’t steel her emotions that much. Booth suggests they reconvene tomorrow to get the son of a bitch. Before Brennan leaves, he tells her she’s staying at his apartment and she doesn’t argue.</p><p>At his place, he closes the blinds, tells her to stay away from windows. Booth gallantly offers to sleep on the couch, but Brennan says she’s smaller and he needs to get a proper sleep since he’s got to kill Broadsky. He says goodnight and goes into his room as she makes up the couch.</p><p>Hodgins is still at the lab and Angela is dozing next to him until his exclamation at a discovery wakes her up. Hodgins muses that when they found out about their kid having a 25% chance of being blind, Vincent gave him a list of other things that had a 1 in 4 chance. Hodgins found the slot that something was missing from in Leishenger’s wallet… something with traces of fold, but he doesn’t know quite what yet. Angela says he’ll find what it was. “Bet on it, baby,” Hodgins responds and then speaks to Angela’s belly, “you bet on it too, baby.”</p><p><a
href="http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bbbed.jpg?1103ba"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26598" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bbbed-300x168.jpg?1103ba" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>At 4:47am, Brennan opens the door to Booth’s bedroom, as he reflexively pulls a gun at the noise. Brennan apologizes and Booth tells her to come in as he puts the gun away. Brennan, the logical, clear-minded person we love, is having problems processing Mr. Nigel-Murray’s death. She thinks that he was talking to her as he was dying. “He kept saying ‘Don’t make me go.’ Why would he think that I’m the one making him leave? What kind of person am I?” Booth says she’s got that wrong that he wasn’t talking to her. She says he wasn’t talking to Booth. Booth explains that he was talking to God, but Brennan protests that he was an atheist, just like herself. Booth corrects himself that Vincent was talking to the universe. “If there was a god,” Brennan states, “he would have let Vincent stay here with us.” “That’s not how it works,” Booth says sadly and holds her as she cries.</p><p>At the Jeffersonian, Cam tells Angela that she just finished taking care of the terrible task of calling Vincent’s mom. When Mrs. Nigel-Murray saw the caller id, she thought it was her son calling. Cam told her how much he meant to them and then just listened to his grieving mother sob. She promised to arrange to have him sent home. “He was such a sweet little weirdo, wasn’t he?” Cam asks sadly as she fights back tears. Hodgins enters with a discovery. He’s found the impression of an access card in Leishenger’s wallet… Broadsky wanted an access card, as well as the rifle. But to what?</p><p>Booth sits in his office as Shaw tells him Leishenger’s boss is in the interrogation room. Shaw asks if the person that died was his friend and Booth says that he was. Leishenger’s boss says the access card was for the International port in Wilmington where Leishenger was a shipment inspector. We see Broadsy at the port with a large bag. He swipes the access card and is wished a good day by the attendant as he enters the shipyard.</p><p>Angela finds Brennan still staring at Leishenger’s skull, staring at some strange injuries. Angela presses Brennan, wanting to know if everything’s okay and Brennan confesses that she got into bed with Booth last night. Angela doesn’t want to celebrate in a time of tragedy, but she needs more details. She asks if they… you know and Brennan just kind of smirks oddly as Hodgins interrupts. Angela shoos him away, telling him “ Go… I love you but go tell Cam… Leave!” It’s a pretty adorable moment. He finds Cam and informs her that he found something out about the bullet. It had remnants of sea salt and produce cleaning products meaning it was made near the ocean where they decontaminate produce.</p><p>Booth gets this information and heads to the port with Agent Shaw. The guard tells him that Broadsky came onto the yard an hour ago. Booth tells the guard that he’s going to shut this place down and when the guard questions whether he can do that, Booth tells Shaw to do whatever it takes to shut the place down. DON’T TELL BOOTH WHAT HE CAN’T DO! Booth asks which ship was used for produce and the guard says The Persephone! I will totally count that as a shout out to all the awesome P’neers. Booth gets his rifle out and tells Shaw to send the team in when they’re there.</p><p>Booth stalks around the shipyard scaring the port employees. Broadsky spots him from his vantage point and grabs his rifle. Booth gets a sight on Broadsky’s rifle, but the two are playing hide and seek and neither can get a true view on the other. Brennan comes in on his earpiece, but freaks out slightly when he doesn’t say anything back. Hodgins realizes he can’t really talk at the moment and instructs him to single click his gun for yes, double click for no. They communicate to him that injuries to Leishenger’s head were from Broadsky’s right hand, which must be broken now. Booth speaks up to softly say “I think you might have just saved my life.”</p><p>Broadsky gets off a shot and Booth yells to his foe that that he missed. “Happens to the best of us,” Broadsky shouts back. “Not to you,” Booth corrects, “not to me.” Neither will give up. Broadsky climbs up some trucks and I ask myself why Booth isn’t looking up more. He does, finally, but as Broadsky jumps down. Booth gets a sight on him and tells him to drop the weapon, or he’ll blow his head off. Broadsky calls the intern collateral damage and Booth shoots him in the knee cap. “You really so damn positive you’re the good guy in this?” Broadsky questions as Booth stands over him. “Yeah,” he replies, “as positive as you are, only difference is… I’m right.” Brennan gets a call and with relief lets everyone know that Booth got Broadsky. Brennan and Angela share a look.</p><p>That night, outside the Jeffersonian, the team are waiting on Brennan. Some techs wheel out a coffin (I really wish they’d called in all the other interns for this) and Hodgins says to let them take it. Hodgins asks if Booth will say something, but he says he didn’t know VN-M that well. Brennan arrives and agrees, revealing that Booth only ever called him “the English Squintern.) She’s brought a potted plant. Cam laughs about this, to which Brennan asks if she did something wrong, but Angela assures her she did something exactly right. The team share their favorite facts that Vincent Nigel-Murray told them. For Hodgins, he gave the advice that the busiest shopping hour of the year is 3-4pm on Christmas Eve. For Sweets, it was that Quebec City has the same amount of street crime as Disney World. For Cam, it was that the crack of a whip was actually the tip breaking the sound barrier. For Angela, it was that the top of the Eifel Tower is six inches shorter in the winter. Brennan reveals something different; a fact <em>about</em> Mr. Vincent Nigel-Murray. His favorite song was “Da Lime in da Coconut.” Sweets starts a round of the song. Angela and Hodgins join in, followed by Cam, Brennan and finally Booth as they all help put his coffin in the hearse. It’s a sweet cathartic moment (with harmonies and everything). Brennan takes Booth’s arm and leads him away as Angela gives a knowing smile again.</p><p>So… all the feelings. Let’s start with poor Mr. Vincent Nigel-Murray. Knowing that someone would be dying this episode, of course, my analytical brain went right to it. Obviously, Booth and Brennan are safe. Without them, there’s no show. Angela is safe because while <em>Bones</em> might go dark sometimes, they would never go that dark, killing a pregnant woman. Hodgins and Cam I wasn’t too worried about until the montage started. Sweets was who I was really worried about. I feel like all this season, there’s been something hanging over Sweets, especially since “The Bullet in the Brain,” when he was a hair away from Heather Taffit’s shooting. I also felt like it was more likely to be Sweets because I felt it would be cheap to kill off a Squintern. We don’t see them every week, we don’t grow as attached to them, my brain said. Well, I was wrong. Although, because I was typing notes furiously while blinking back tears, I think his last moments actually got to me more as I was writing this recap. I appreciate that Booth (and I guess the writers), respected Brennan and Vincent’s atheist beliefs and didn’t try to force the opinion that VN-M was speaking to God in his last moments. Booth’s explanation of him speaking to the universe was one of the most touching moments in a great episode. I also loved (as much as you can), Brennan’s pain at thinking that he was asking her not to go. The moments that Brennan <em>can’t </em>logic out are the most heartwrenching moments that this show gives us and Emily Deschanel is exceptional at her performance.</p><p>Speaking of that scene… OH MY GOD, DID THEY OR DIDN’T THEY?!?!?!?! You really have to think that in the writer’s room they laughed gleefully when they decided to leave everyone hanging on that. I agree with Angela, maybe not right to celebrate in that episode, but COME ON!!! I keep going back and forth on what I think happened. Knowing Brennan, she would give that smirk if they’d just cuddled all morning (saying something like “His radial to ulnar ratio was the exact length to encompass me in a satisfactorily comforting way,” with an ear to ear smile). Whatever happened, between that and worrying for Booth’s safety, their relationship is definitely changed. While Brennan and Booth have never shied away from friendly physical affection, there was something different in the way she took his arm in that last scene. I just hope this time, they either go for it or just be done with it. I don’t think the fans can last much longer.</p><p>So… what did you think? Discussion commence!</p><p><em>Screencaps courtesy <a

They are being chased by clergy, who inform the peasants that they have been found guilty of, among other things, witchcraft, immoral acts, and spreading the plague. <span
id="more-25766"></span>They have been judged and are to be destroyed. They’ll begin by smashing their teeth from their skulls, then removing their heads from their bodies. In case you haven’t guessed yet, these peasants were vampires.</p><p>Back in present day, a girl is jogging when she runs across a bloody shoe and a trail leading into the woods. Stupidly, she follows it instead of calling 911 (or, 999, if we’re being geographically correct), and finds two bodies, a man and a woman, still holding heads. We assume the blood-covered bodies are dead until the man opens his eyes. He’s brought into the hospital. The police make a statement about the attack, which left the woman dead and the man in a coma. They intend to investigate it fully. Mitchell visits the man, Marcus, and knowing that the police will get a statement from him once he’s awake, briefly entertains the thought of pulling the plug. When Lucy happens upon him, he says he was praying. She’s surprised that he’s a man of faith. She thinks the guy will survive, though, and is sure this will be a murder inquiry. She asks what happened to their drink, if they can have it tonight, but Mitchell hems and haws and she gets the hint.</p><p>Annie pops into George’s room, letting the sunshine in against his will. She’s brought him warm water. There’s no tea because since George has hidden in bed and Mitchell hasn’t been around, no one’s gone shopping. George can’t handle this right now and he doesn’t really want to talk about Nina. Annie tells him to just pull out of his depression (not very sympathetic, Annie) as Hugh turns up downstairs. Annie forces George to go answer the door. They’ve told Hugh that Annie just left. Left a note, never coming back kind of left. Hugh says this is exactly what happened with his ex, Kirsty. “Why does every woman I love run a mile when I get just a little bit serious?” George avoids answering.</p><p>Mitchell goes looking in a subway tunnel and finds a still pretty crazy Cara. He wants to know who attacked the two students. Cara doesn’t really care if the humans try to kill them. Mitchell tells her to round everyone up for a meeting.</p><p>Annie interrupts George in the bathroom to tell him that she’s going to get Hugh back together with Kirsty. And that George has to help her, since he can relate to Hugh’s jilting. Annie just wants to feel useful again. She feels cursed, like she taints things. George knows how that feels.</p><p>Mitchell meets with the Chief Constable who assumes he’s the new Herrick. Mitchell says no, he’s just a representative. The press are all over this case. “Why can’t you guys stick with homeless alkies?” the Chief ponders. He sees no backbone in Mitchell, but says he’ll make it go away anyway… for the right price. However, he warns, “Without Coroner Quinn on board, this is all academic.”</p><p>Mitchell heads to an abandoned church where the split up family has gathered at his request. Daisy’s there for entertainment value. Mitchell starts talking, but no one’s listening. He demands that the killing has to stop and explains that the old system doesn’t exist anymore: “The world we knew is gone, you have to accept that.” He suggests that they all go clean. At their scoffs of disbelief, he asks them if they know who he is. “My name is John Mitchell and I’ve killed more people than you’ve met!” It’s a powerful moment for us more than for the vampires, I think. We forget that this Mitchell that we know and love and empathise with is really a mass murderer. They mock his rehab idea, led by Cara, but he lays it down. They get discovered, that means persecutions and mass execution. Daisy says they can’t change their nature. Reminds him that there were a few false starts when he tried, too. But there was always someone there to clean up after his. His betrayal of his kind was aided by his family. “You’ve gotta give a little something back.” He says he’ll talk to some people, but they can’t kill anymore. And if anyone does, he’ll kill them himself.</p><p>When Mitchell comes home, Annie and an unwilling George are waiting for him to have a house meeting. George tells him that he’s not pulling his weight. Annie says they need to team build, bond, talk. Mitchell suggests he and George go out and get hammered one night. George agrees and everything is copacetic between them, to Annie’s disbelief. “We don’t need to turn this into an episode of Oprah,” Mitchell tells her. But when the boys want to turn the TV on and watch Real Households, they freak out that the channel has changed the time. George even starts crying about it. Perhaps they’re not dealing with their problems in the most effective way.</p><p>Cara, ever the rebellious child, stalks a group of teens in a shopping center. She gets them into the back alley and attacks two of them as the third watches.</p><p>Annie and George head down to the New Found Out and Annie reminisces on her days as a barmaid. Hugh comes over with drinks and George gets him to start dishing about Kirsty. She was blonde, a florist (although she considered herself an artist with flowers). About a year ago, she chucked Hugh aside, saying that he was “too conventional.” But she had some quirks, too… she never cleaned up properly, just left dishes to get limescale and left glasses condensing on the tables. George and Hugh bond over their love of coasters, it’s a very sweet moment. Hugh says they should go out sometime, have a drink of two and George says he would like that. Annie is again boggled by the way guys work through things.</p><p>The Chief Constable meets with Mitchell, but it’s too late. The guy woke up. The Chief can still fix it, but they need Quinn, so the Chief provides Mitchell with some leverage: an envelope with pictures.</p><p>George and Annie stalk Kirsty, and Annie body snarks Kirsty’s hair color and appearance. Not cool, Annie, not cool. George asks for some flowers, something artistic. Kirsty half-heartedly wraps a normal bunch. When George asks for something a little more exciting and flamboyant, Kirsty explains that she used to do flamboyant. Now, she can’t be arsed anymore. Annie sums up the situation with Kirsty: “She’s deader than I am.” Annie suspects it’s because Kirsty misses Hugh, as well. Her suspicions are confirmed as she hangs out with Kirsty for a bit. While Kirsty is doing the washing up, she doesn’t just leave the plate, something Hugh was always encouraging her not to do. She calls to check her messages on a personals line and there are none. Poor lonely Kirsty.</p><p>At the hospital, Marcus has woken up from his coma and Lucy is talking to him and gives him a cross necklace that his girlfriend was wearing.</p><p>Mitchell goes to see Quinn, who implores Mitchell to listen to his conscience and walk away. Quinn isn’t rescinding his conviction to stop covering for the vampires. Mitchell sighs deeply and shows him the envelope of pictures. They’re of his grandchildren. “As long as you comply, nothing will happen,” to them, Mitchell assure him. Quinn changes his mind about Mitchell; he is scum, Quinn decides. Mitchell apologizes that it had to come to this. Quinn spits at him that the girls at the shopping center were only 15. Mitchell didn’t know about them. Quinn realizes that Mitchell has no control. Mitchell goes back to the family, demands to know who it was. Cara says they were delicious. Mitchell realizes that the system has to be in place and asks if any of the family has a suit. A suited vampire becomes Kyle, the assistant manager of the funeral parlor. The family business open for business again.</p><p>The Chief waits as someone in gloves pays a visit to the coma victim and injects something into his IV, then makes it look like he took some pills himself. Quinn gets the reports on the two girls for his signature. The coma victim codes and a cop brings the boy’s statement to Chief who burns it. Lucy tries to save the coma victim, but cannot. It’s judged a suicide and the Chief holds a press conference saying that they’ve determined that it was a suicide pact between the two victims. Mitchell meets the Chief and is pissed that they had him killed. The Chief says it’s the way things are done. He also wants to know how they knew about the girls in the shopping center. They were young offenders, he’s glad that they’re gone. He wants the vampires to stick with repeat offenders: “It’s a win-win.” The system is truly back in place now. “This is how it works,” The Chief informs a shocked Mitchell. “What, you expected it’d be pretty?”</p><p>At home, George says that Hugh won’t go on a blind date. Annie says instead, she needs a bad experience that makes her appreciate Hugh. George is going to date her and be terrible. The discuss terrible date ideas (George’s was a kebab shop) and George finds the jackpot: a 3 ½ hour German art film. “You bastard,” Annie says, impressed.</p><p>In the morgue, Lucy is looking at Marcus’ body as Mitchell comes in. She doesn’t think he was suicidal. How did he get the drugs? Unhook himself, break into the store, get back and plug himself in without anyone noticing? Mitchell says there were fingerprints. Lucy doesn’t buy it. She thinks the police are idiots. Mitchell asks her out for that date again.</p><p>Kirsty arrives for her blind date and recognizes George from the shop. She’s so excited for this date. She loves German cinema and has been dying to see this movie. Oops. Lucy and Mitchell head out to the pub for their drink. Lucy asks him to tell her about himself. Asks about his family, why he’s a cleaner. He’s typically Mitchell with his non-committal answers. He likes the anonymity. She just wants to find out who he is. “Maybe I’m just very dull,” Mitchell replies. Back at the blind date, Kirsty has loved the movie and requests a kebab after. George thinks she’s insane. Annie urges him to go for the last resort: reciting a poem to her. He recites a bad poem he wrote about missing Nina and Kirsty attacks him with kisses. The plan has totally failed. “Sod it,” Annie surmises, “maybe you guys are actually meant to be together.”</p><p>Mitchell walks Lucy home and she won’t let him see her in. She’s pissed with how distant he was at the pub. She chalks it up to a long day and says just to forget it. At home, George and Mitchell talk about how the funeral parlor is open again and they’re overheard via the bug on the mantelpiece by Creepy Old Man and the tech. Unfortunately for the eavesdroppers, when George picks up his glasses, he pulls the bug up, too. He washes kebab grease off his glasses and washes the bug down the drain. George is upset that the system is back into place. Mitchell says he’ll eventually get them off blood, but George doesn’t think he can do it. George says he’ll support him, but says he could have used some support himself with the Nina thing. Mitchell says he needs to stop with the self-pity, pick himself up and learn from it. Ouch.</p><p>Mitchell visits Cara, who’s been locked up in a room. “It’s time,” he informs her before he takes her to the work room where the family is waiting. They want to see if he’ll really go through with it.</p><p>Annie takes George to Kirsty again. She tells him to come on too strong, propose to her, name their first children, anything to put her off him. Instead, he bursts out to Kirsty that he’s lying to her. He’s in love with someone else who’s gone. He thought this would take his mind off it, but it didn’t. Kirsty sympathises. George says the most precious thing in the world is a second chance. He leaves and Kirsty pulls out her mobile to call Hugh.</p><p>Mitchell takes Cara down to the caves we saw in the opening flashback. He explains the history of bashing the teeth out of vampires. A now terrified Cara promises not to be bad again, but Mitchell has to go through with this, make an example of her. He hits her mouth with a rock and removes her teeth, leaving her there, crying. He brings her teeth back up and shows the others announcing that Cara has been executed. “The king is dead,” a vampire says, “Long live the king.” The rest began chanting along with it, all except Daisy.</p><p>Kirsty and Hugh meet up with each other again. They missed each other. Annie watches as they reconnect. At home, George answers the ringing phone. It’s Nina. She wants to say goodbye properly. She won’t say where she is, but she tells him to stop using the curse as an excuse not to live his life. He asks if she’s coming back. She asks him to promise her he’ll start living his life. He does. Says he loves her. She replies that she always will, too. She says she’s going to do something wonderful and hangs up. George breaks down.</p><p>On the other end of the phone Nina thanks the Old Man for letting her make the call. She’s ready now. The Old Man says that God loves her very much and asks for confirmation from Professor Jaggat on that. The camera pans around and we see Professor Jaggat for the first time: It’s Lucy.</p><p>As I rewatched this episode, I started trying to remember how far in it was that we learned that Lucy was Professor Jaggat and I was shocked that it came this (relatively) early. Watching Lucy’s interactions with Mitchell in these first three episodes has had a completely different light cast on it with the knowledge that she will eventually be the bad guy. I’ve felt so much for Mitchell while I see him trying to build this connection to her, and Lucy comes off much more heartless and calculating than she does when you don’t know who she really is. This episode really brings it to a head, though. Why, in the pub, does she ask Mitchell so many questions? She says she just wants to know who he is, but she already knows. Is she expecting him to confess his secret to her? Is she wanting him to deny it? Is she really interested in him or is this all part of her research into the various Types? The questions that go unanswered make her motives extra sinister at this point.</p><p>Annie, I have to say, is pretty darn unlikable in this episode. Between snarking about Kirsty’s clothing and appearance and telling George to just get over his depression, it’s a turn I don’t like in her character. While those tendencies have always been there in small ways, it seems like she’s completely encompassed by them in this episode. Whether to chalk this up to her experience with Saul or bad writing I just don’t know.<br

Since the general vibe of the show is pretty lighthearted, when a special topic episode comes along, it makes it all that more powerful.<span
id="more-25535"></span> I think “The Signs in the Silence” is going to become one of their touchstone episodes.</p><p><strong>Trigger Warning: This episode is centered on abuse of a special needs child.</strong></p><p>A cop on routine patrol sees a body next to a dumpster and finds a person covered in blood. As he checks on her, she wakes up with a start and begins trying to attack him with the knife she was still clutching.</p><p>At the Royal Diner, Booth and Brennan are trying to decide what to get the Hodgins baby. They seem to be assuming that they’re getting a joint gift (seriously? Stingy much, guys?) Brennan observes that soon she’ll be the only one without kids, and Booth seems to think that having Baby Hodgins around will make her starting thinking about having kids again (something that hasn’t been brought up since mid-season four, I think). Caroline Julian, our favorite southern DA, interrupts their breakfast with an interesting case related to the girl we saw in the cold open. The girl is assumed to be deaf and uncommunicative (as Brennan corrects when Caroline calls her deaf and dumb) and assumed to be a minor, so Grace Meachum has been assigned to her from Child Protective Services. Brennan argues that they don’t even know that she is a minor until she runs tests to determine the girl’s age. In addition to the blood all over her and the knife in her hand, she was found with a bundle of money. Jane Doe (as they’re calling her) isn’t responding to signing and Meachum won’t allow any medical tests without the girl’s consent, which they’re clearly not going to get. Caroline has a court order, though, to override consent because of exigent circumstances; they want to find out who she is and who she attacked because they could still be alive and bleeding to death somewhere.</p><p>The pressure is on, and Jane struggles against the team, especially when the sign for “family” is made as Hodgins tries to get the particulates from her hair and clothing to possibly ID the victim. Brennan isn’t molly-coddling the girl, and Sweets asks her to talk for a moment. He explains to her that she’s disabled, restrained, and on display; they need to make her feel comfortable and secure for her to cooperate. He reminds her what being in foster care was like; every situation was scarier than it needed to be “because some supervisor was in a rush.” Brennan tries a different tactic and brings her to a machine that can get an x-ray of her wrists without having to restrain her as much. It works, and Brennan determines that the girl is between 13-17.</p><p>Booth gets a lead on the money found on her. They were sequential numbers, most likely from an ATM, so he gets on identifying who used ATMs near where she was found. Brennan starts to worry about what happened to this girl… kids don’t start out bad, from her foster experience. Preliminary DNA IDs the blood on her as from a white male, mid-40s. There’s only one, conveniently, on the ATM they’ve found: Duval Price. When they go to his apartment, the door’s been broken in, and they find Duval on the floor in a pool of his own blood.</p><p>At the diner, Sweets is upset, as the case just doesn’t make sense. Brennan curtly observes that they’ll never know Jane’s motive, as she’s keeping it to herself. Sweets starts to get upset with her, mad that she’s just giving up on Jane, but Brennan reveals that there are facts they’re missing that could give them a motive and she intends to find them. “I’m not as cold as everyone assumes,” Brennan observes as Sweets apologizes. Brennan goes back to the video of the original, signed interrogation. Using the words per minute that she’s signing and specific signs that she makes, they conclude that she’s from a rural area in southern Pennsylvania. Meanwhile Hodgins has identified the paper in the girl’s pocket as a receipt from a hardware store in Crossroads, Penn. Booth and Brennan head there and find the owner and his wife, who recognize the girl as Amy, their daughter.</p><p>Amy is 15 and has a habit of running away, Mike and Denise Shenfield explain. They do their best with her, but they just can’t handle her sometimes. She always comes back after she runs away, though. They want to see their daughter. Back in D.C., Hodgins proves that the door was definitely too thick for Amy to have broken and he’s found fibers of another fabric. Brennan looks over the x-ray footage of Amy’s hand again and notices signs of a healed bucket handle injury… a sign of child abuse. The picture starts to become clear. Brennan meets with Amy again, and through Meachum explains to the girl that she knows that she’s been abused and wants to get x-rays of the rest of Amy. Amy signs that no one believes her. Brennan sympathizes with how it feels not to trust anyone. “People lie,” she confides, “but bones always tell the truth. Your x-rays will tell us exactly what happened to you. No one can say that you’re lying.” Amy consents to the x-rays. When the x-rays come back, intern Arastoo correctly summarizes, “it’s worse that you can imagine.” Amy has had fractures everywhere… legs, arms, skull. According to the injuries, it started when she was three. The Shenfields get impatient waiting to see their daughter, but they’re being stalled so Caroline can arrive with a court order to keep them away from her. Mike is enraged, but so is Brennan, who emotionally shouts that the girl has Waardenburg syndrome, that’s what made her deaf… it’s genetic, they must have known. As she says this, she realizes something and goes to touch the bridges of their noses. She’s sure they’re not Amy’s parents.</p><p>They investigate the birth certificate, which they discover was fake. In the interrogation room, Booth asks who Duval Price is, if Mike and Denise pimped Amy out to him. Mike shuts down, but Denise protests that she was troubled and they loved her. Sweets plays the sympathy card, understanding that they tried their best and that it was difficult for them. Denise cries that they just wanted her to mind, just wanted her to be able to have a normal life. After repeated warnings from Mike for her to be quiet, he unleashes his rage and backhands her. Booth responds by pulling him out of his chair and punching him.</p><p>Back in the lab, Arastoo has found that judging by the way Amy was holding the knife, she couldn’t have stabbed the victim from behind. He must have been on top of her, making the stabbing self-defense. Hodgins uses the moisture in the door to determine that the door was kicked in at 2 a.m., a full two hours before Cam determined time of death. And the fibers on the door? They’re from a PriceCo flannel shirt, just like ones that Shenfield wears. Also, they’ve found a picture showing Shenfield and Duval Price were friends. They’ve got him and piece together what happened. Mike called his friend Duval when he saw Amy get on a bus to D.C. When Amy arrived, Duval grabbed her and took her to his apartment so her dad could come get her. Amy finally begins to tell her story. She signs that Duval was going to hit her and tie her up… she tried to get away and only took the knife to scare him, but when he grabbed her, they fell. Brennan reminds her that she was just protecting herself, but Amy still feels remorse for killing a man. Booth tries to get the Shenfields to reveal who they took Amy from, but they’re not speaking anymore. Booth leaves them, snarking, “The only satisfaction I get is knowing what happens in prison to people who abuse kids.”</p><p>In another room, Brennan gets to tell Amy that the Shenfields aren’t her parents and by all evidence, no one hurt her before she was with them. She promises to help Amy find out who she is, and we see the girl smile for the first time. Sweets, Meachum, and Brennan try to help Amy remember anything from her early childhood, and in a moment that brings tears to Brennan’s eyes (and mine), she tells Amy about her experiences. How she didn’t trust the happy memories for so long, but she’d occasionally remember images of her mother and the feeling of being with her. Amy closes her eye and remembers a stuffed bunny but can’t picture anything else. Brennan has an idea, though, and asks to pull one of her wisdom teeth. The isotopes from the environment she lived in might still be in her tooth. Amy consents emphatically, and after a montage of forensic analysis, they find out that she was from near Los Angeles and find a missing child that matches her description (and even had a bunny). Her real name is Samantha Winslow, and Booth and Brennan take her to meet her parents. Jane/Amy/Samantha worries whether they’ll like her, and when the Winslows arrive, her mom signs “We never gave up, sweetheart,” as she presents the stuffed bunny. Samantha runs to her, and I have something in my eye for a moment.</p><p>As B&amp;B walk away, Brennan lets Booth know that she thinks that they should get a stuffed animal for Baby Hodgins. She also suspects that it must have been very satisfying for him to hit Mike Shenfield. Actually, though, Booth is upset with his loss of control. His father was like that… he doesn’t ever want Parker seeing that side of him. Brennan reminds him that it’s not the same. He’s not the same.</p><p>While I love that <em>Bones </em>tackles foster care issues, I do wish that we would see more of the good side of foster care (which, if they’re in good foster care, they’re probably not going to end up being in an investigation, so it’s kind of a self-selecting sample group). I almost hope that Brennan chooses to be a foster parent herself. It’s completely unrealistic with the hours she works, but I think it’d be an important character choice that would be the next step in resolving her past.</p><p>Stepping down from that minor quibble, I thought this story was done so well. The writers and show runners at <em>Bones</em> have done an amazing job over the past almost six years creating characters who have complex pasts. The very real thing I find about it is that it’s not something that always defines the characters. Brennan doesn’t bring up her missing parents every episode, nor does Sweets bring up his foster care background or Booth his alcoholic, abusive father. But it’s there when it’s relevant. Good or bad, it affects their actions and reactions. Brennan is extra cold and distant at the beginning of the episode because she has to try harder to keep her objective distance since the subject hits so close to home for her. Booth flies off the handle because he projects the specter of his father onto Mike Shenfield. They’re flawed characters, and that’s why we feel for them and relate to them so much, especially when we’re sucker-punched with episodes like this one.</p><p>The B-plot seems so inconsequential in comparison to the rest of the episode, but for posterity it was about Angela having Braxton Hicks contractions. This being her first rodeo, she and Hodgins took a trip to the hospital (after he had a meltdown while trying to find his keys) only to get the false labor diagnosis. They had a laugh about it in Hodgins’ tiny Mini Cooper, which Angela could barely get out of, leading her to point out that he might have to get a new car (which I was thinking as soon as I saw it). I mean, seriously, dude… you’re a millionaire, go get yourself a minivan before the kid drops.</p><p>What did you think? Do you like the more serious episodes of <em>Bones</em>, or do you crave the lighthearted ones?<br
