<p><img src="http://www.n-retrospekt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/avant.jpg" alt="" title="Avant — Avant" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2600" /></p>
<p>R&#038;B crooner Avant is back with his fifth album released on his new label, <a href="http://www.capitolrecords.com/" target="_blank" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, which hit stores December 9th.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avant</em></strong> acknowledges the singer’s established track record. He says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve proved my point. The album reflects who I am. I think one of the reasons I&#8217;ve been able to enjoy the kind of longevity I&#8217;ve had, is that I write songs that are about real-life situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The album’s kick-off single, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEMjg3pVKCk&#038;feature=artist" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Avant — When It Hurts">&#8220;When It Hurts&#8221;</a> is an impassioned and irresistible plea about the true meaning of unconditional love, produced by the Anonymous Entertainment team of Eric Dawkins and Tony Dixon.</p>
<p>Other aspects of love inspired Avant to create <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694140gy61g&#038;feature=artist" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Avant — Break Ya Back">&#8220;Break Ya Back&#8221;</a>, a sexy ode to gettin’ it on. &#8220;I know what my fans expect and they look to me for the way I try and come across with a love song,&#8221; Avant explains, &#8220;but at the same time, as a songwriter I also know there’s nothing new under the sun. My job is to find new ways of saying things that you might have heard before.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7muaE3OZlQ&#038;feature=artist" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Avant — Out of Character">&#8220;Out of Character&#8221;</a> is Avant&#8217;s attempt to persuade his lady to invite another woman for a night of pleasure. He explains to her, &#8220;The way I feel about you won’t change, and I’m not trying to make you go both ways. But tonight you need to go both ways for me, baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>The album also features a couple of charming and faithful tracks. On &#8220;Y.O.U.&#8221;, Avant states that he has found his reason to love unconditionally. Although he is an accomplished songwriter, he is not afraid to cover another artist’s material, especially if it allows him to add his own style (remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLEtkPyUlnU&#038;feature=artist" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Avant — My First Love">&#8220;My First Love&#8221;</a>?). He offers his take on the Christopher Cross classic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j9zBgcSl1Y" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Christopher Cross — Sailing">&#8220;Sailing&#8221;</a>. &#8220;Sometimes when you&#8217;re going through life you just want to sit back, relax and think of everything that’s going on, and for me, &#8220;Sailing&#8221; is a song that gives you the freedom to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Avant</em></strong> is filled with his best material to-date, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6oymKhJnDU&#038;feature=artist" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Avant — Material Things">&#8220;Material Things&#8221;</a> really messes up the flow on the album midway. I understand the message behind it, but up-tempo tracks aren&#8217;t really Avant’s forte.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><small><a href="http://concreteloop.com/2008/04/j-dakar-on-the-good-life" target="_blank">Published April 1, 2008 for Concrete Loop</a></small></p>
<p><img src="http://www.n-retrospekt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/goodlife.gif" alt="" title="J. Dakar On: The Good Life" width="500" height="145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2591" /></p>
<p>For some time, I was concerned about the car I drove and other nonsense I now find to be of little importance. At one point, I wore two carat diamond studs in my ears but have downgraded to a less ostentatious quarter carat. In the end, it’s not going to matter how big my diamonds were or whether I drove a Ford or a Ferrari. That’s not what will determine my worth.</p>
<p>The status of a person is not how much money they have or what they do for a living — the real importance of a person is how they treat everybody, particularly the people who are deemed lower than them in society. I’ve figured out what it’s all about. For me, the only thing that’s going to matter is that I lived my life to the fullest and did everything I possibly could to help those around me in need.</p>
<p>I’m not saying I’m giving away my worldly possessions to feed the hungry and care for the sick; I like to spend money like everyone else. However, I know my limitations and choose not to exceed them. Judging by our generation’s conspicuous consumption, not everyone shares that sentiment.</p>
<p>We try to stunt, living beyond our means causing more debt &#038; superficiality. According to the Federal Reserve, <a href="http://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/pdf/ec/ec1614.pdf" target="_blank" title="Living Sustainably: It’s Your Choice">over 40 percent of U.S. families spend more than they earn</a> and a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report claimed 93 percent of Americans will retire financially dependent on the government, family or charity.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with enjoying the fruits of your labor; however, we should be aware that rich people are not happier and adding wealth to your life does not increase a sense of well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of amassing Benjamins in our pockets &#038; bonds in our portfolios, we should be spending our money on what will actually make us happier.&#8221;</p>
<p>For each of us, that will mean something different. Personally, I love the idea of <a href="http://www.n-retrospekt.com/2010/12/19/j-dakar-on-good-business/" target="_blank" title="N-Retrospekt — J. Dakar On: Good Business">socio-capitalism</a>. I’m not saying those who can support others should do so. It’s their money, and they should be able to do with it what they want. I do, however, think it’s messed up when people base their life’s worth on the amount of money and possessions they’ve accumulated instead of realizing the number of people they could have helped. If all I am concerned with is gaining material goods just for the sake of saying I have this or that means a problem exists, and there’s a disconnect with reality.</p>
<p>As the disparity between rich and poor grows, the wealthy become less inclined to pay taxes that benefit the average person, and the rich get richer, the middle is not raised and these differences compound themselves. Materialism then becomes a threat to the unity on which any well-ordered, democratic society is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many people spend money they haven’t earned, to buy things they don’t want, to impress people they don’t like.&#8221;<br />
— Will Smith</p>

<p>In these modern times of R&#038;B, Kem is a rarity &#8212; singer, songwriter, musician and producer; he employs no samples and yet manages to deliver a consistent, mature fusion of soulful R&#038;B and jazz on his sophomore album, simply titled <a title="Wikipedia: Album II (Kem Album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_II_(Kem_album)" target="_blank">Album II</a>.</p>
<p>Kem&#8217;s self-released debut, <a title="Wikipedia: Kemistry (album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemistry_(album)" target="_blank">Kemistry</a>, sold 10,000 copies in 2002 and was eventually picked up by Motown for nationwide release the following year. It was on this album that we were first introduced to the smooth, sultry sound of the top-20 hit <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zb6Dbp7VjU" title="YouTube: Kem — Love Calls" target="_blank">&#8220;Love Calls&#8221;</a>, and it looks as if things can only get better for Kem. His latest effort debuted at No. 5 on the Pop Albums chart and No. 1 on the R&#038;B Albums chart. Currently burning up the airwaves is <a title="YouTube: Kem — I Can't Stop Loving You" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVBmBR7kL-w" target="_blank">&#8220;I Can&#8217;t Stop Loving You&#8221;</a>, which has already reached No. 1 on the Billboard Adult R&#038;B.</p>
<p>The Detroit-based artist tells of poignant love songs, but his personal story is one of victory and triumph. Once homeless, Kem supported himself and his family by waiting tables and performing top 40 covers for weddings. He later managed to scrape together money to finance and release his first album. Just as his story inspires listeners, his soulful music does the same.</p>
<p>Album II opens with &#8220;Find Your Way (Back in My Life)&#8221;, questioning the nature of love and the rest of the album follows suit. Kem&#8217;s take on love is multifaceted, deeply tying his connection with God, addressed on the sweet sounding &#8220;Heaven&#8221;. The song, &#8220;Each Other&#8221;, a track featuring only a calm three-note guitar riff and gentle vibes, sets the tone as being more of a personal conversation expressing Kem&#8217;s love not only for a significant other, but also for others as well, in addition to stressing the importance of having God in our lives. &#8220;Without You&#8221;, a calm, mellow mood song is ideal for a romantic evening with that special someone, which happens to follow the first single released from Album II, &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Stop Loving You&#8221;. Featuring gentle bass and soft drumbeats, the single serves as a theme song for those of us who have loved, been loved or are in love.</p>
<p>There are a select few of people who &#8220;find their way,&#8221; and Kem manages to do just that with this album, a throwback to a time when rhythm and blues was actually comprised of rhythm and blues. Instead of conforming to the times with overproduced samples, Kem utilizes organic, laid-back arrangements to sustain the album&#8217;s duration and takes lovers and true R&#038;B fans alike, to a place we all want to go: &#8220;Heaven&#8221;.</p>

<p>So many times you hear a song on the radio and immediately fall in love with it so you go out and buy the album and discover that there&#8217;s only one song on the entire album you actually like. Such is not the case with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happenstance_%28Rachael_Yamagata_album%29" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Happenstance (Rachael Yamagata album)">Rachael Yamagata&#8217;s 2004 full-length debut</a>.</p>
<p>My ears stumbled upon hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF24erC0Fuk" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Rachael Yamagata — Under My Skin (Live)">&#8220;Under My Skin&#8221;</a> and within a matter of seconds, I was hooked. Rachael&#8217;s smooth, sultry voice, reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Jones" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a>, mixed with meaningful lyrics caught my attention immediately and I had to have <em>Happenstance</em>.</p>
<p>One of the few albums I find to be worthy of listening to in its near-entirety, <em>Happenstance</em> opens with the infectious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-F_OK3JmDI" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Rachael Yamagata — Be Be Your Love (Live)">&#8220;Be Be Your Love&#8221;</a>, followed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhyfk0_rGz0" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Rachael Yamagata — Letter Read (Live)">&#8220;Letter Read&#8221;</a> in which Rachael states that she&#8217;s &#8220;put so much into a life [she] made too much about you now to lie.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll Find a Way&#8221;, the next notable track, is a great relaxing song to play Sunday morning thinking about that special someone. It should be followed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i106j8a7GY" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Rachael Yamagata — Even So (Live)">&#8220;Even So&#8221;</a>, a soothing, melodic ode to a wronged love. The string solo, &#8220;Moments with Oliver&#8221;, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Kraus" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Oliver Kraus">Oliver Kraus</a>, is a perfect introduction to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86lBWmH3Bzk" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Rachael Yamagata — Quiet (Live)">&#8220;Quiet&#8221;</a>, a deeply personal song that presents Rachael&#8217;s voice demandingly and gently, simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>Happenstance</em> is one of the chance occurrences where you hear one song and yearn for more. Rachael&#8217;s smooth, sultry voice gets under the listener&#8217;s skin&#8230;but in a good way, of course. </p>

<p><img src="http://www.n-retrospekt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gb.gif" alt="" title="J. Dakar On: Good Business" width="500" height="145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2382" /></p>
<p>Some time ago, economist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> wrote an article which offered his ideas on the purpose of business. The title itself blatantly stated his view: <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/economics/milton_friedman/business_social_responsibility" target="_blank" title="The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits by Milton Friedman">“the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits“</a>.</p>
<p>Friedman stated businessmen believe they defend free enterprise when they state business isn’t just out to make a profit, but to also “[promote] desirable ‘social’ ends.” He opposed the idea that business possesses social responsibilities: “Only people can have responsibilities,” he declared.</p>
<p>According to Friedman, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engage in open and free competition without deception or fraud.”</p>
<p>To some degree, I agree with Friedman; every business hopes to make a profit, but I do not believe that is the only intent. Businesses can do good and do well (DGADW) at the same time.</p>
<p>I first became familiar with DGADW while reading an article which mentioned it was the credo of the late, famed attorney <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Cochran" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Johnnie Cochran">Johnnie Cochran</a>. Back then, I wanted to become a lawyer and Cochran, “the people’s lawyer,” was the epitome of what I wanted to become.</p>
<p>He said, “People think lawyers only do things for money…It’s not about being paid. It’s about doing the right thing. It’s not about money, it’s about using the law as a device for change.”</p>
<p>A few years later, I was introduced to <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20040401/25ogiale.html" target="_blank" title="Inc. Article: Stella Ogiale">Stella Ogiale</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.chesterfieldhealth.com/" target="_blank" title="Chesterfield Health Services">Chesterfield Health Services</a>, who was named one of America’s most fascinating entrepreneurs by <em>Inc.</em> magazine in 2004. In the article, she called what she does Socio-capitalism. “We can be humane and still make money,” she said. That phrase reiterated Cochran’s notion of DGADW.</p>
<p>I’m inspired by companies like hers and others like <a href="http://www.rawganique.com/" target="_blank" title="Rawganique">Rawganique</a> which offers sweatshop-free products made from sustainable sources with many of them organic; <a href="http://www.tunesfortrees.com/" target="_blank" title="Tunes for Trees">Tunes for Trees</a> which plants a tree for every 10 tracks bought on iTunes; <a href="http://www.dothemath247.com/" target="_blank" title="Do The Math 247">Do The Math 247</a> which spreads the meaningful message of acceptance, brotherhood and compassion using the universal language of math; <a href="http://www.tiedtogreatness.org/" target="_blank" title="Tied to Greatness">Tied to Greatness</a>, a national outreach program targeting inner city high school young men, and its founder, Alex Ellis, owner of <a href="http://www.simplyellis.com/" target="_blank" title="Simply Ellis">Simply Ellis</a>, a custom clothing company that specializes in custom suits, shirts and men’s accessories and <a href="http://www.huntsman.com/" target="_blank" title="Huntsman">Huntsman</a>, a global manufacturer and marketer of differentiated chemicals, whose founder, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Huntsman,_Sr." target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Jon Huntsman Sr.">Jon Huntsman Sr.</a>, oversees charitable foundations whose goal it is to make life better for families around the world by combating cancer, as well as other philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>YOU can even help DGADW at no cost to you.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><small><a href="http://clutchmagonline.com/lifeculture/feature/what-happened-to-rolonda-watts/" target="_blank">Published March 23, 2009 for Clutch</a></small></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rolonda.com/" target="_blank">Rolonda Watts</a> was the host of her eponymous internationally syndicated talk show, <em>Rolonda</em>, for four seasons. She began her television career as a news reporter in Greensboro, North Carolina, before joining WNBC-TV in New York, where she received an Emmy nomination for her “Live Spot News Coverage” of a deadly train crash. She later moved on to WABC-TV in New York to anchor, report and moderate “Eyewitness News Conference,” the station’s weekly political forum.</p>
<p>Rolonda gained national exposure and attention when she became host of Lifetime Television’s talk show, <em>Attitudes</em>, in 1987. There, she received a Cable Ace nomination for “Best Talk Show”. The award-winning journalist went on to tackle news around the world, joining the <em>Inside Edition</em> news magazine team as senior correspondent, weekend anchor and producer. King Word Productions, the syndicator of <em>Inside Edition</em> then asked her to start her own talk show.</p>
<p>Rolonda has also emerged as one of the leading voice-over talents in America and has demonstrated her comedic and dramatic talents in various television shows and feature films.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What have you been up to?</strong><br />
<strong>Rolonda</strong>: I just finished a novel, currently called <em>Destiny Lingers</em>. I also continue to enjoy my voiceover career as the announcer and promo voice for <a href="http://www.judgejoebrown.com/" target="_blank" title="Judge Joe Brown"><em>The Judge Joe Brown Show</em></a>. I am the voice of Boeing and play “Professor Wiseman” on <em>Curious George</em>. And, I have an animated feature out, called <em>The Great Music Caper</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What is your proudest achievement thus far?</strong><br />
<strong>Rolonda</strong>: Today, I feel particularly proud of having finished a 330-page novel. I have always dreamed of being an author, and I am finally well on my way into another passion and career. I must say that <em>The Rolonda Show</em> was also a proud achievement. We helped a lot of people, and we all learned a great deal. We are also able to survive four seasons in a very tumultuous talk show climate. And, we maintained our dignity and integrity in what seemed to be a compromising time.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What do you attribute to your success?</strong><br />
<strong>Rolonda</strong>: My parents, my community, my education, my faith, and my God.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What’s next for you?</strong><br />
<strong>Rolonda</strong>: I look forward to selling my novel, which I also intend to sell as a movie. I would love to write the screenplay. I have learned to be open in life and want to consider all kinds of options in the future  — in TV, radio, internet, and film — acting, writing, producing, and hosting.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: Any final words for your fans at <em>Clutch</em>?</strong><br />
<strong>Rolonda</strong>: Please know how very much I appreciate you. Stay tuned!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><small><a href="http://concreteloop.com/2008/01/j-dakar-on-celebrity-endorsements" target="_blank">Published January 31, 2008 for Concrete Loop</a></small></p>
<p><img src="http://www.n-retrospekt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ce.gif" alt="" title="J. Dakar On: Celebrity Endorsements" width="500" height="145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2367" /></p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize nominee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Maya Angelou">Maya Angelou</a> and Nobel Prize winner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Morrison" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Toni Morrison">Toni Morrison</a> are causing quite a stir, as are many other well-known figures throughout America, by making celebrity endorsements of presidential candidates.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s easy to capitalize on pretty much anything, and that’s exactly what a lot of celebrities are doing.</p>
<p>About 47 percent of Americans between the ages of 18-24 voted in the 2004 presidential election, up from 36 percent in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. But I can’t help but think that “Vote or Die!” had something to do with that. Was using high-profile names such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Hilton" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludacris" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Ludacris">Ludacris</a> as a way to stress the importance of voting the best way to do it, though?</p>
<p>The proof is in the pudding, as Bill Cosby would say (or would he?). Citizen Change, the political service group founded by mogul <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Sean Combs">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>, sought “to educate, motivate and empower millions of young Americans to access their power and vote”.</p>
<p>Apparently the junior-high method was the way to go: “the popular people are doing it; so should you.” Unfortunately, society at-large has a strong desire to do what celebrities do, and it starts at a very young age.</p>
<p>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Britney Spears">Britney</a> (well..maybe a couple of years ago), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Beyoncé">Beyoncé</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk" target="_blank" title="Björk">Björk</a> (well, maybe not Björk at any time) start dressing a certain way, it’s a pretty safe bet that more than half of the girls in your area will attempt to emulate them. Our growing fascination with celebrities mimics the notion that if they’re doing it, we should be doing it. But, let’s face facts: very few of us are celebrities, and we are not meant to do the things they do, but they see that so many us try to and they do whatever they can to gain a little something from that.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sajak" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Pat Sajak">Pat Sajak</a>, the host of <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> wrote in November that “if any group of citizens is uniquely unqualified to tell someone else how to vote, it’s those of us who live in the sheltered, privileged arena of celebrityhood.” I couldn’t agree more, and although I am by no means a celebrity, I add myself to the “uniquely unqualified” group.</p>
<p>I commend Diddy for what Citizen Change helped accomplish and other celebrities who stress the importance of voting in the upcoming election. However, I am a free-thinking individual (just like everyone else) and refuse to vote just because my favorite actor, author, athlete or the like announces who they’ll be voting for when that time comes.</p>
<p>I urge you all to inform yourselves of what’s going on around you with multiple sources and always remember to, in the words of Pulitzer Prize-winning author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Gaines" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Ernest Gaines">Ernest Gaines</a>, “Question everything. Every stripe, every star, every word spoken. Everything.”</p>

<p>He’s worked on major projects with some of the major players behind some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, and he’s only 30 years old. </p>
<p>Publicity artist <a href="http://www.troymonaco.com/" target="_blank">Troy Monaco</a> got his start writing bios and updating the resumes of his artist and actor friends. Hearing and writing about the experiences of others in the entertainment industry sparked his interest in all things entertainment related and eventually put him on the path to a career in public relations. </p>
<p>After earning a degree in marketing and internet &#038; eCommerce, he went on to doing on-air promotions at Toronto’s urban radio station FLOW 93.5. Working the Toronto nightlife scene eventually paved the way to his move to New York City, and after several years of working in public relations in NYC, he’s currently working both independently and as PR Director for <a href="http://megamanagementinc.com/" target="_blank">MEGA Management</a>. <em>Clutch</em> caught up with the public relations expert to catch up on all he’s doing and where he sees the field heading.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What would say is the hardest part of your job?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: Always having to describe what a publicist does and then going through the questions and comments about how much fun my job must be and what celebrities have I met. People tend to see only the glamorous side, not the long hours or the constant need to be detailed oriented and focused.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What do you love/hate most about it?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>:<br />
Love: Hearing how happy my clients are with the results.<br />
Hate: Dealing with people/businesses that do not understand the importance of following up.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: Take us through a typical day in the life of Troy Monaco.</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: Coffee or green tea (coffee if I need a kick start, green tea if I need to de-stress), turn on CNN, check email/PDA, follow up emails/calls, press outreach, new prospect research, various daily client calls, check event calendar for special events to accompany clients for networking and light socializing (events are always business never personal).</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: What would you say to someone interested in pursuing a career in PR?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: The most important things you have in this business are your name and your contacts. Handle with care. Why? Your name is your business card in this field, and as for your contacts, it’s easier to lose a great contact than to find one.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: Aside from your work, what else do you enjoy doing?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: Travel (collecting stamps in my passport!) Next stop Dubai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: Any thoughts/ideas on what the future holds for your field?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: The possibilities are endless! With the advent and rise of new media technology, online social networking and content sharing, the ability access to information in the 21st century is now directly at your fingertips. Past models of news and media sharing have shifted dramatically from print publications (newspapers and magazines) to web portals, SMS messaging and networks (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, text messaging, and a variety of file sharing applications). We can now self publish, broadcast and disseminate information in real time and with a much higher refresh rate — no more waiting for your favorite magazine subscription to show up in the mail or for the 6 o’clock news.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch: Where do you see yourself in a few years?</strong><br />
<strong>Troy Monaco</strong>: I’m currently working on a new venture in Toronto called RSVP, a Brand Strategy and Communications Firm committed to connecting the urban entertainment and lifestyle industries in Toronto to the US and Internationally. Consider RSVP as the new arrival hub for Toronto – the next great metropolitan destination and playground for those who enjoy pursuits in lifestyle, culture and the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a product of the eighties, most likely you&#8217;ve never known a time without the ever prolific, soulful <a href="http://www.sade.com" target="_blank" title="Sade">Sade</a> and frankly, who would want to? <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AWMF?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=dindada-20" target="_blank" title="Amazon: Sade — The Best of Sade">The Best of Sade</a></em> is a sixteen track masterpiece featuring some of the band&#8217;s best work until 1992. Released in 1994, the album went double platinum in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, in addition to going platinum in nine other countries.</p>
<p>With her exotic beauty and captivating voice, the band&#8217;s frontwoman manages to cast a spell on any listener; however, I must admit, it&#8217;s &#8220;never as good as the first time&#8221;. Somewhere around 1995, I stumbled across an old cassette tape in my dad&#8217;s study. As a teenage male, anything that featured a beautiful woman on the cover piqued my interest. I rushed to put the cassette in my stereo, and the first thing I heard were the horns and bass of <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/sade/is-it-a-crime/GB0208500110" target="_blank" title="VEVO: Sade — Is It a Crime">&#8220;Is It a Crime&#8221;</a>. Then I heard one of the most beautiful voices say, &#8220;This may come&#8230;this may come as some surprise, but I miss you.&#8221; I missed her too, yet I didn&#8217;t even know who she was.</p>
<p>It was Sade&#8217;s sophomore album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000051XX9?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=dindada-20" target="_blank" title="Amazon: Sade — Promise"><em>Promise</em></a>, released ten years earlier in 1985, which quickly catapulted her to the top of my list of favorite singers. I thought to myself, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t I heard this before?&#8221; Or of Sade, for that matter. Perhaps, an even better question at the time would have been, &#8220;Who is Sade?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t even sure of how to pronounce her name until my dad came in the room and muttered something along the lines of, &#8220;Hooked on Sade, huh?&#8221; And that, I certainly was.</p>
<p>Helen Folasade Adu was born in Ibadan, Nigeria, to an African father and an English mother. Growing up, she&#8217;d listen to some of the best soul singers of her time like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> — artists who were able to capture an emotion, such as heartache or love, and force that feeling upon all who listened; a skill Sade, herself, also naturally possesses.</p>
<p>The effortless <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyh-d-LS1po" target="_blank" title="YouTube: Sade — Stronger than Pride">&#8220;Stronger than Pride&#8221;</a> fuses island beats, jazz and R&#038;B into a timeless classic. Her dynamic handling of &#8220;Is It a Crime,&#8221; is what caught my attention. The soft, gentle tone in the beginning is overrun with emotion as Sade pleads for a love lost. <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/sade/jezebel-live/GB0200102170" target="_blank" title="VEVO: Sade — Jezebel (Live)">&#8220;Jezebel&#8221;</a>, with its haunting appeal and vulnerability evident in her voice, forces you to listen and take notice. But, of course, you should be doing that anyway. On <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/sade/no-ordinary-love/GB0200002129" target="_blank" title="VEVO: Sade — No Ordinary Love">&#8220;No Ordinary Love&#8221;</a>, Sade&#8217;s voice oozes sex appeal, making it one of the best love-making songs ever. The lyrics to <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/sade/cherish-the-day/GB0200102136" target="_blank" title="VEVO: Sade — Cherish the Day">&#8220;Cherish the Day&#8221;</a>, fit perfectly into the deep, sensual musical accompaniment. <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/sade/pearls-live/GB0209200002" target="_blank" title="VEVO: Sade — Pearls (Live)">&#8220;Pearls&#8221;</a>, the jewel that closes this collection, is so full of emotion, I cried the first time I heard it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how one would classify Sade; so many influences are evident in their music. However, this is definitely a chill-out album to relax with your loved one and &#8220;cherish the day&#8221;.</p>
