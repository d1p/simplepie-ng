Deprecating Twitter
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.curry.com/images/2011/03/19/jmo1505l.jpg" width="200" height="170" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named jmo1505l.jpg"&gt;I’m done with “The Cloud”, and as of today, I am &lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/deprecating"&gt;deprecating&lt;/a&gt; twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with the drop.io fiasco, which &lt;a href="http://curryscloud.com/about/"&gt;led me to create&lt;/a&gt; my own URL shortener that &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="http://bigappshow.com/"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; on the iOS and Android platforms, I can only imagine the heartbreak developers are suffering from the &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/12/from-businesses-to-tools-the-twitter-api-tos-changes/"&gt;recent change&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter’s change in their Terms of Service (TOS) that is essentially telling the very developers that helped the company build it’s critical mass to go pound sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing is on the wall, corporate interests must prevail. This will undoubtedly result in censoring of tweets, deletion of accounts, lawsuits over who has the right to “own” a twitter name. Really? Been there, done that, got the T-Shirt and the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is news. That’s how I view it and have used it, but as of today, it will only be one of my news sources. Just another way to contact me, and it will be on equal footing with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/alerts/feeds/13493902749734921753/13953146842259674194"&gt;Google Alerts&lt;/a&gt;, and any other news source I choose to follow through an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I leaving twitter? Not entirely, I simply won’t play in their sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve set up a &lt;a href="http://adamfriends.com/"&gt;personal&lt;/a&gt; River of News that I use to follow feeds from people and sources I care about. Turns out it isn’t that many, and I have an excellent system to manage that. Following and unFollowing is as simple as pasting or deleting a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how twitter fits into my river;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow an rss feed of a &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search.rss?q=@adamcurry"&gt;search query&lt;/a&gt; for anything that shows up on twitter with the term @adamcurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple people I follow directly. For them I use a handy bookmarklet that surfaces the rss feed of that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send messages into the twitter silo, I publish &lt;a href="http://adam.curry.com/twitter.xml"&gt;an rss feed&lt;/a&gt; that is picked up by &lt;a href="http://twitterfeed.com/"&gt;twitterfeed.com&lt;/a&gt;, whi in turn publish it to twitter under my account. I also have an archive of my messages in &lt;a href="http://adam.curry.com/twitter.html"&gt;html&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://radio2.curry.com/archive?user=adam&amp;amp;feed=twitter.xml"&gt;machine readable&lt;/a&gt; version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow me on twitter, or just add the rss feed to any magnitude of rss follwing machines (formerly known as an aggregator or feedreader)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a setup like this for yourself, you can get it &lt;a href="http://ec2.scripting.com/"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt; (as in beer), but you have to do a bit little bit of work. The results will be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;a href="http://r2.reallysimple.org/howto/radio2/"&gt;radio2&lt;/a&gt; and the river of news are very exciting to me, a reboot of a technology that is far more prevalent on the net than twitter, and open for anyone to use and play with. None of the aforementioned restrictions apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and all the &lt;a href="http://noagendanewsnetwork.com/"&gt;cool kids&lt;/a&gt; are doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>AC</name></author><gr:likingUser>00224439595522357033</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://curry.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://curry.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">CURRY.COM</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://curry.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1300526865689"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/994b7a85ab02d3db</id><title type="html">How little you know, and some useful commands.</title><published>2011-03-19T09:27:45Z</published><updated>2011-03-19T09:27:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.mnxsolutions.com/quick-tip/how-little-you-know-and-some-useful-commands-for-the-week.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2342734"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><gr:likingUser>18078788385534166172</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>09426490706640796471</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>03712775109755796805</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>07309744596950140388</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>16732537503096527437</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>05630178322569092480</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>15858391860638187073</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>15899941809396596685</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss</id><title type="html">Hacker News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1300488508595"><id gr:original-id="tag:daringfireball.net,2011:/linked//6.22428">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/538ba2e70a866177</id><title type="html">Twitter Adds Always-Use-HTTPS Option</title><published>2011-03-15T20:57:03Z</published><updated>2011-03-15T20:57:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/making-twitter-more-secure-https.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone who uses Twitter should turn this on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget just how exciting and revolutionary &lt;span&gt;ICQ &lt;/span&gt;was. Almost overnight it took two of the most powerful features of the walled-garden online services—being able to see when your friends were online and message them in real time—and brought them to the Internet. People signed up in their millions, and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while everyone loved the service, it only took a couple of upgrades before the client software was universally loathed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was there was only one company making &lt;span&gt;ICQ &lt;/span&gt;clients. Thus there was no competitive pressure to improve the core experience of sending and receiving messages from your friends, but &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt; was there pressure to add just one more advertisement panel, or yet another button to pump sponsored newsfeeds and stock quotes to millions of entirely uninterested college students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally there's an outcry when a fresh exciting company sells out to an evil corporate behemoth, but by the time &lt;span&gt;ICQ &lt;/span&gt;sold out to &lt;span&gt;AOL &lt;/span&gt;the reception was just a collective “Meh, merge it with &lt;span&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt; Instant Messenger already.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a"&gt;today’s announcement from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; directed to its third-party developers, saying in essence:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are thinking of writing a new Twitter client, don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have already written a Twitter client and it strays too far from the way the official client works, your application will be blocked from using the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twitter has always grown on the back of outside innovation. Features like #hashtags, @username links and retweeting were all things that users came up with on their own to help manage the flow of information. Third-party clients and services built features on top of these conventions, and eventually they were folded into the core of the product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the client side across mobile and desktop platforms, Twitter mostly stayed out of the way and, as &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/04/twitter_clients_playground"&gt;John Gruber noted two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, third-party Twitter clients were a locus of innovation in mobile application UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fantastic things about Twitter clients is how easy it is for users to jump from one to another. Just type in a username and password and off you go. It's possible for anyone to write a Twitter client nowadays and have the opportunity to completely blow everyone else out of the water. It's very exciting. Very democratic. And it certainly seems like everyone and their mother is trying to do just that. I'm just happy to be part of it, I know the developers of other clients and I can say definitively that competition is making all of us write better apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That quote is from Loren Brichter, developer of Tweetie, in an &lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/140209/2009/04/tweetie_brichter_interview.html"&gt;interview with Macworld&lt;/a&gt;. Brichter now works for Twitter. Tweetie was rebranded as the official Twitter client for Mac OS and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that the time for competition and innovation in Twitter clients is now over, and that all the platform now needs is “A Consistent User Experience” strikes me as akin to the &lt;a href="http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/PatentHistory/posass.htm"&gt;apocryphal story&lt;/a&gt; of the man who quit the Patent Office in 1899 because everything had already been invented. And with two of the banner features of the latest Twitter client update being the addition of a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23dickbar"&gt;tremendously unpopular&lt;/a&gt; overlay for (often-sponsored) trending topics and a lock-in to Twitter’s &lt;span&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;-shortening service, the direction is worrying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Twitter client currently offers a choice between six image-hosting services. Which, if any, will still be there in twelve months?" title="If my service was on that list and not already in the process of being sold to Twitter, I&amp;#39;d be shitting myself about now." src="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/pictures/twitter-image-shortening-preference.png" width="503" height="411" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a silly battle that's been fought before. Instant Messaging services spent the good part of a decade attempting to lock out third-party clients and losing because you just can't fight the demand for something you can't deliver yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official clients have a massive advantage in exposure, user inertia and immediate access to new features. Twitter admits as much in the announcement, pointing out that 90% of Twitter users already regularly use the official client. If a third-party client becomes so popular that it is causing a noticeable impact on market-share, there is something &lt;em&gt;very, very wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the direction of in-house development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third-party clients have more freedom to experiment and innovate, and can serve niche markets saving the official client from having to be a one-size-fits-nobody pastiche of conflicting requirements. And even if those clients do not give the service any direct revenue, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe&amp;#39;s_law"&gt;Metcalfe’s Law&lt;/a&gt; ensures that the &lt;em&gt;people behind the screen&lt;/em&gt; make the service more valuable for everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Miller</name></author><gr:likingUser>02110867783949959046</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17511063164506929257</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13112254411161547853</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>16870550999530279402</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>11199828247701990930</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>03117770114440901468</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>05645994962277945339</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>16120281646641253761</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/atom.xml</id><title type="html">The Fishbowl</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1299882384791"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3492e80ccd2fc7ed</id><title type="html">Persistent Login Cookie Best Practice</title><published>2011-03-11T22:26:24Z</published><updated>2011-03-11T22:26:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/01/19/persistent_login_cookie_best_practice/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2313534"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><gr:likingUser>12283431963703903442</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>00406325592209217713</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss</id><title type="html">Hacker News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1299690852553"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96e77805d219951c</id><title type="html">Shortest SEO Guide</title><published>2011-03-09T17:14:12Z</published><updated>2011-03-09T17:14:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lifedev.net/2011/03/shortest-seo-guide/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2305272"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><gr:likingUser>15963914873140213203</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>18276857694401806729</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>06405729912562463760</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>18078788385534166172</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17947184333342858622</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>03712775109755796805</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>11690897386447157105</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>10604908998252585818</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>02138826466712097385</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>06792357375051008813</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>08267488414556871704</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://news.ycombinator.com/rss</id><title type="html">Hacker News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1299534473053"><id gr:original-id="http://damnyouautocorrect.com/?p=6101">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bbd79fe51e00a4cc</id><category term="Best Of DYAC"/><title type="html">15 Most Popular Autocorrects From February 2011</title><published>2011-03-04T18:01:10Z</published><updated>2011-03-04T18:01:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://damnyouautocorrect.com/6101/15-most-popular-autocorrects-from-february-2011/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://damnyouautocorrect.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;These were the 15 most viewed, most shared, and most popular images sent in to DYAC in February, 2011.

It’s beautiful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; functional, with public spaces so you can chat and hang out, and private spaces when you really need some peace and quiet – all beautifully designed. Looks like the perfect office. The perfect culture. But is it really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446563048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1297335660&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Delivering Happiness&lt;/a&gt; by Tony Hsieh and I now believe Zappos’ chaotic and messy offices are much more effective at promoting happiness and innovation. Please keep reading to find out why. At the end, I’d love to hear your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s compare the offices of Zappos and 37signals visually …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zappos Headquarters in Las Vegas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-p31h2urpea5w33q3ukh77pf46g.jpg" alt="Photo of Tony Hsieh&amp;#39;s desk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-nkgti7ekbtubxi6rea3bjfjddh.jpg" alt="An expanse of desks, with tons of ribbons hanging from the ceiling. Messy but fun."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-pibrnw1ww68n6wyajx5jrqp2ey.jpg" alt="A crazy wall of fabric put up around a cubicle at Zappos"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;37signals Headquarters in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-tks6622iyw4gwiehia6x8xhuja.jpg" alt="Photo of 37signals office with one person talking to another at a desk, with a lot of open space around them"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-gyycugkrxyh8td9mha3kmjt7na.jpg" alt="Photo of a conference room with glass walls in the 37signals office"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110210-xq6fbiyfejbxtrummm1jugwj8g.jpg" alt="Photo of a hallway at 37signals with a lot of open space"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two different approaches?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Fried (President of 37signals) and Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos) both have similar views on business. A quick read of 37signals’ book &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/rework/"&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values"&gt;Zappos Culture Doc&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? How can two tremendously successful and passionate businesses manifest themselves in such dramatically different ways? And which one is better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giving control away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary thing that I took away from Delivering Happiness was this: If you want to have an amazing company culture, you have to give your team control of three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their surroundings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy employees need to be able to positively affect these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m focusing on ‘surroundings’ in this post, so let’s dive into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zappos let their team do whatever the hell they want with their desks and environment. The goofier and weirder, the better. They actively encourage &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zappos+pranks&amp;amp;aq=f"&gt;mischief and fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something tells me that if someone at 37signals put up a huge green and blue tent around their desk, they wouldn’t get a high-five in the hallway. The unspoken message to 37signals employees is this: “Don’t touch. Don’t put your stamp on this office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with a perfectly designed office is that there’s little room for individuality or fun. Yes, they have blackboards at 37signals’ office, but that’s not enough. People need the freedom to customize their environment and express their personality on a permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m with Jason when it comes to aesthetic, I value clean lines, gorgeous textures and tidiness. But that’s just me and I shouldn’t force that on my team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your office ≠ your product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to break the myth that your company’s culture and office needs to match your end product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that zappos.com provides insanely awesome customer service. Their site is also very usable and functional. Their product is amazing and well designed, but their office is a wreck. They’re a billion dollar company and their CEO’s office is a small cubicle with fake vines hanging from the ceiling and a blowup monkey hanging on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is proof that you can promote weirdness and fun at your office, without compromising the integrity of your product or sacrificing profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every founder dreams of designing and creating an office like 37signals have done, but that doesn’t mean it’s the right thing for their Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love to hear your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve detailed elsewhere how hard I worked in law school. But there was another secret to my success that I haven’t mentioned yet: the nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In law school, I rented a carrel where I kept my books and studied in-between classes. I started learning about the benefits of napping and wanted to incorporate the nap into my routine. But alas, the law school didn’t really have any good couches to sprawl out on. So I improvised. I brought a pillow and blanket from home and put them under my carrel desk. When I was ready for a nap, I simply put my iPod headphones on, put on some nice relaxing music, and slipped under my carrel for a quick nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome. It was nice and dark underneath my desk and because it was in the library, it was quiet. I’m sure some people thought I was a crazy bum or something, but I didn’t care. Those short little naps allowed me to power through hours of classes, reading, and outlining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="naps2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/02/naps2.png" alt="" width="239" height="166"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, napping is often frowned upon in our workaholic American culture. When we think of napping men we think of Dagwood passed out on the couch after consuming a giant, delicious sandwich. Naps are  for the lazy and unambitious. Or for retirees with plenty of time on their hands. The man who falls asleep at his desk at work is laughed at. And when we doze off, we feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality, the nap stigma is incredibly misplaced. Naps can be one of the most powerful tools for self-improvement; they can increase not only our health and well-being but our intelligence and productivity as well. This is something great men have known all along. Famous thinkers and leaders like Edison, JFK, Churchill, and Napoleon were all ardent nappers. We’ll cover the specific napping habits of famous men in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Cat Knows Something You Don’t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are among the few animals that take their sleep in one shot. The rest of the animal kingdom consists of polyphasic sleepers; they alternate sleep and wake cycles throughout a 24 hour period. Cavemen likely slept in multiple phases too, so someone was always up to keep an eye out for saber tooth tigers. While experimenting with a return to polyphasic sleep has become trendy in recent times, the ideal pattern for human sleep is &lt;em&gt;biphasic&lt;/em&gt;–a long stretch at night along with a shorter respite during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Romans were biphasic sleepers; at &lt;em&gt;sexta &lt;/em&gt;(the sixth hour or their noon) everyone would turn in for some midday shut eye. This is where we get the term &lt;em&gt;siesta&lt;/em&gt;, a tradition once popular in countries like Spain but which has largely succumbed to the encroaching go-go-go Western business style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the pace of modern life may keep us from being the biphasic sleepers we were meant to be, the urge for a daytime snooze is still hardwired into our biology. Studies have shown that when people are put into an environment that lacks any indication of time, they will fall into the long sleep at night/shorter nap during the day pattern. Thus most of us are daily fighting tooth and nail against our body’s natural circadian rhythm, and this is wreaking havoc on our well-being, turning us into a horde of zombies that crave espresso instead of brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us find it nearly impossible to get enough z’s at night, and sleep deprivation causes a host of bodily and mental ills, keeping us from performing at our best and enjoying life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a good night’s sleep is essential, a daily nap can buoy us up when we’re not getting quite enough winks. And for those who already sleep well at night, a nap can take take the performance of your body and mind to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="naps3" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/02/naps3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="393"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Benefits of Napping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases alertness.&lt;/strong&gt; When your eyelids are almost too heavy to keep open, you’re not doing your best work. Make time for a nap and then go back at it. A NASA study found that a 40 minute nap increases alertness by &lt;strong&gt;100%.&lt;/strong&gt; Other studies have found that a 20 minute nap is more effective than either 200 mg of caffeine or a bout of exercise. Yet another study showed that pilots who were allowed to take a 25 minute nap (while the co-pilot manned the controls!) nodded off fives times less than their nap-deprived peers. They also made less errors during take-offs and landings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that if you break up your day with a nap, you will be as alert and energetic for the second part of your day as you were for the first. So if you’ve got an event planned for after work, take a nap before going out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improves learning and working memory. &lt;/strong&gt;Naps improve your working memory. This type of memory is involved in working on complex tasks where you have to pay attention to one thing while holding a bunch of other things in your memory. Napping also improves your memory retention; during sleep, recent memories are transferred to the neocortex, where long-term memories are solidified and stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevents burnout and reverses information overload.&lt;/strong&gt; While we often refuse to take a nap because we feel like we have too much to do, studies have shown that putting in extra hours without rest dramatically reduces your productivity. It would be better to take a 30 minute nap and return to your  work refreshed. This was demonstrated in a study in which subjects performed a visual task over the course of four days. With each successive session, the subjects’ performance on the task deteriorated. But when the subjects were allowed to take a 30 minute nap after the second session, the decline in performance was halted. And after a one hour nap, their performance actually &lt;em&gt;improved &lt;/em&gt;in the third and fourth sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heightens your senses and creativity. &lt;/strong&gt;According to foremost nap scientist (napologist?) Sara C. Mednick, napping can improve your sensory perception as effectively as a night of sleep. This means that steak tastes better, the sunset looks purtier, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C21G2OkHEYo"&gt;Annie’s Song&lt;/a&gt; sounds even better after a good nap. Napping also improves your creativity by both loosening up the web of ideas in your head and fusing disparate insights together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improves health. &lt;/strong&gt;Sleep deprivation leads to an excess of the hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol, known as the stress hormone, helps us deal with fight or flight responses. But excess cortisol increases glucose intolerance and abdominal fat, weakens the muscular and immune systems, stymies memory and learning, and decreases levels of growth hormone and testosterone in our bodies. These deleterious effects can lead to diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sleep, you release growth hormone, the antidote to cortisol which which boosts your immune system, primes your sexual function, reduces stress and anxiety, and aids in muscle repair and weight loss. Napping gives your brain a chance to rest and your body a chance to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof’s in the pudding. A study done with Greeks found that those that took a 30 minute nap at least three times a week had 37% less risk of dying from a heart-related condition. Among working men their risk of death was reduced &lt;strong&gt;64%! &lt;/strong&gt;So not only should you &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/07/12/dance-like-zorba-the-greek-getting-in-touch-with-your-wild-man/"&gt;dance like Zorba the Greek&lt;/a&gt;, you should nap like him, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improves mood. &lt;/strong&gt;The neurotransmitter serotonin regulates our mood, sleep, and appetites. It produces feeling of contentment and well-being. But when our bodies are stressed, higher levels of serotonin are used and the production of more is blocked. As a result, we can become anxious, irritable, depressed, overwhelmed, and easily distracted. According to Mednick, “napping bathes your brain in serotonin, reversing those effects and creating a more positive outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saves money. &lt;/strong&gt;Instead spending $30 a week on Five Hour Energy or Starbucks, take a nap and boost your energy the natural and more effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s awesome.&lt;/strong&gt; Seriously, napping. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the Stages of Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All napping is good, but you can also tailor your nap to your specific needs. But before we delve into that, we need to talk about what each stage of sleep does for your mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five different stages of sleep, 1,2,3,4, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement).  You cycle through them repeatedly as you sleep or nap: 1,2,3,4, 2, REM, 2,3,4,2, REM and so on. Each cycle lasts 90-100 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Lasting 2-5 minutes, this stage transitions you into sleep. Your thoughts and mental associations loosen up. This state of sort of wakeful dreaming has been used by artists and thinkers to cultivate rich ideas. We’ll cover this in-depth in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Motor skills and complex tasks you’ve been working on are solidified. Your energy and stamina are strengthened and senses sharpened. You spend about 50% of your sleep time in Stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stages 3 and 4: &lt;/strong&gt;In these stages you slide into &lt;strong&gt;Slow Wave Sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Your body stops releasing cortisol altogether and extra growth hormone goes to work restoring your body, repairing tissues, lowering stress, metabolizing fats and moving carbs out of your body. And your mind is cleared; memories that aren’t being used are pruned away, strengthening what remains and making room for new information.  Information that you’ve recently and consciously learned such as the dates for a history test are solidified. You spend about 30% of your sleep time in Stages 3 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REM:&lt;/strong&gt; During REM your brain shuttles your recently-made memories from their short term holding tank in the hippocampus to long term storage. The information is thus made permanent; if you don’t sleep soon after a learning session, you’ll lose much of what you studied. Creativity is given a boost as spatial orientation and perceptual skills are sharpened and the different insights and complex ideas you have swirling around in your nogggin are fused together. You spend about 20% of your sleep time in REM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="nap2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/02/nap21.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="306"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailoring Your Nap to Your Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Mednick, the perfect nap for everyone is &lt;strong&gt;90 minutes long and taken between 1 and 3 &lt;/strong&gt;in the afternoon. At this time, and at this length, your nap will consist of the optimal balance of all the different sleep stages. The ratio of the sleep stages in this nap exactly mirror that of nocturnal sleep. But of course, not everyone has an hour and a half to saw off during the day. And sometimes you want to tailor your nap to your particular needs on a particular day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: These recommendations are based on an average adult sleep schedule (11-12 am to 6-8 am). If you’re a night owl or have a different sort of schedule, check out Dr. Mednick’s book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761142908?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stucosuccess-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0761142908"&gt;Take a Nap!&lt;/a&gt; It has a “nap wheel” and formula for calculating your perfect nap based on when you wake up and your particular needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need a boost of creativity. &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t know how many happy little clouds to add to your painting, and Bob Ross won’t be on until 3? Does writing your essay for English class feel, as Ronald Reagan put it, like crapping a pineapple? Then you need a dose of REM sleep, which increases your creativity. You’ll need a longer nap to get to the REM stage and since potential REM peaks early in the day and declines from there, aim for something like a &lt;strong&gt;90 minute nap before 2 pm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need stamina. &lt;/strong&gt;Running a race that evening? Going from one job to the next? You need Stage 2 sleep which you can get in a &lt;strong&gt;20 minute power nap.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t go down for any longer than 20 minutes though. We’ve all experienced naps that leave us groggy when we wake up. This is called &lt;em&gt;sleep inertia&lt;/em&gt; and happens when you awaken during Slow Wave Sleep. So you need to wake up before you slip into Stage 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that a 20 minute nap 8 hours after you wake up will boost your stamina more than sleeping an extra 20 minutes in the morning. So instead of hitting the snooze button, save those minutes for an afternoon siesta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to relax. &lt;/strong&gt;While REM sleep declines during the day, SWS increases. So if you’re feeling stressed, shoot for a longer nap after 2 pm and ideally in the early evening, so your body can get a cortisol break and repair itself. &lt;strong&gt;Naps will not affect your nighttime sleep as long as you wake from your nap three hours before bedtime. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to pull an all-nighter.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of downing can after can of Red Bull, try what researchers call the “&lt;strong&gt;prophylactic nap&lt;/strong&gt;.” Taking a preventive nap in anticipation of sleep deprivation is more effective in maintaining cognitive performance and alertness than taking no nap at all, taking a nap when your sleep debt has already made you tired, and even taking multiple doses of caffeine. So when you know an all-nighter is in the cards for you, try to take a nap during the day; the longer the better, but even 25 minutes will keep keep your performance levels higher than they would be. Keep in mind that the effects of a prophylactic nap only last 8-10 hours; nothing can keep your brain from starting to unravel if you skip two nights of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to ace a test.&lt;/strong&gt; After you study and before test time, &lt;strong&gt;take a 90 minute nap.&lt;/strong&gt; Stage 2 will increase your alertness, stages 3 and 4 will clear your mind of unnecessary clutter, solidify the things you just studied,  and lower your stress, and REM sleep will move the information into permanent storage and sort through the complex information you just learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need immediate alertness. &lt;/strong&gt;Try a “&lt;strong&gt;caffeine nap.&lt;/strong&gt;” Researchers at the University of Britain at Loughborough tested several ways to improve the alertness of drivers and found the “caffeine nap” to be the most effective method. You down a cup of coffee or other caffeinated beverage and then immediately hunker down for a 15-20 minute nap. Again, don’t go any longer than that or you’ll awaken with sleep inertia. The caffeine clears your body of adenosine, a chemical which makes you sleepy. It takes awhile for the caffeine to circulate through your system, so it doesn’t effect the quality of the nap. Instead, it kicks in in tandem with the refreshment you would feel upon awakening from a normal power nap. I’ve personally found the caffeine nap to be effective, especially when you’re crunched for time; it’s easier to get up and keeps you from the temptation of turning a 20 minute nap into an hour and a half session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeezing in Nap Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be awesome if offices took a cue from kindergarten and broke out cookies, milk, and nap mats once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas in the real world it can be hard to catch some z’s at work. Getting caught asleep at your desk is not a good way to &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/01/03/how-to-get-the-respect-you-deserve-at-work/"&gt;earn respect at your job&lt;/a&gt;. But most people get an hour for lunch, and you can easily eat for half that time and then go take a snooze in your car for the other half. Tell your boss all about the benefits of napping and see if you can get a couch in some rarely-used room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a student, do like I did and toss embarrassment to the wind and just curl up somewhere. If you can’t nap during the day, take a short pre-or post-dinner nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, all you need to do it carve out 20 minutes somewhere in your day. One study showed that even a 6 minute nap improves memory function. So you can even sneak one in while the guy at the desk next to you runs to the snack machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, learn to embrace the nap and the napping of others. Napping is not a character defect! Many great men have taken advantage of the benefits of napping. It is a wonderful, wonderful way to improve your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:203px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heartonsleeveweakatknees.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Consumption___part_2_by_freakyhedgehog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Consumption" src="http://www.heartonsleeveweakatknees.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Consumption___part_2_by_freakyhedgehog-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;borrowed from deviantart/freakyhedgehog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look around at home, in your car, or at work – how much of what you’ve bought have you really thought about? Did you decide to buy them on the basis of cost? Brand name? Colour? A combination of all of the above?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years I have been spending more time thinking about where things come from &amp;amp; what that means. I personally chose to become vegetarian when I thought in detail about where my food comes from. I also try as hard as possible to buy food grown in the UK so my food miles are lower. At the same time, I don’t want to cripple the economies of non-UK countries which are reliant on food export – I still buy Fairtrade/ethically grown coffee, rice, nuts (where possible) &amp;amp; chocolate – when I’m feeling particularly decadent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting that everyone become vegetarian – or militantly only eat Fair trade/ethical chocolate like I do. However, if you experiment on just one day, I’m fairly confident that by the time you’ve gotten to work in the morning (if you don’t already practice conscious consumerism), you’ll interact with at least 10 items you haven’t considered the sourcing of. Your alarm clock, your breakfast meal, your coffee or tea, your clothes, your shampoo, your make up/shaving stuff, your shoes, your car &amp;amp; your petrol. &amp;amp; that’s all before you’ve even settled into the day fully &amp;amp; definitely not including luxury buys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How cool is it to realise how much power you have – your consumer choices matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read about farming processes &amp;amp; where food comes from &amp;amp; still want to be a meat eater; I respect that. If you know about the people who work to make your tea or coffee possible but disagree with apparently ethical sources of this – I respect that. I am not really interested in whether or not you agree with me at all; but I am interested in having a conversation about what you know. How you choose to spend time or money on one thing – but not another. So really I’m saying that I respect an informed opinion that is based on more than not caring enough about something to look into it deeper - indeed it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; based on caring about making an informed decision that you can own, before you own the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close my thoughts on this, I heard a quote from somewhere the other day along these lines: we are merely borrowing the world from our grandchildren. So let’s help them think we are cool, considered &amp;amp; involved grandparents who were knowledge-seeking, engaged young people that moulded the world we are borrowing from them – &amp;amp; not stubborn, ignorant, close-minded grandparents who were uninterested, unengaged young people. Let’s set a good example for them to follow for their own grand children. Be conscious (awake) in your consumerism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heartonsleeveweakatknees.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Books_ends_by_thebluemaiden.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="book ends" src="http://www.heartonsleeveweakatknees.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Books_ends_by_thebluemaiden-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;borrowed from deviantart/thebluemaiden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I work a 9 – 5 job – or in my case, an 8 – 4.30pm job, with a lunch hour away. Sometimes I work longer hours for a show, late meeting or travelling to and from wherever I have to be. I enjoy my job, but I’m also much more than it. I’m a yogi, a meditator, a personal development geek, a climber, a dancer, a friend, a relative, a partner and a crafter. So when I go home from work – I like to be those things without work getting in my head and in the way. Increasingly I find that as I gain more experience, the pressure and frustrations of work increase seemingly exponentially in relation that experience – and it becomes harder to switch off. Occasionally it’s at the point where I’m still worrying about things late at night before I go bed – even though I don’t want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, I’ve decided to actively book-end my work ‘day’ so that I develop a routine of getting to work, focusing, leaving the work at work &amp;amp; then going to enjoy the rest of my life. Here are some ideas I’m implementing which I thought would be nice to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do something as a transition activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work it can be very easy to just slump infront of the TV or start cooking dinner &amp;amp; moving on physically, without really allowing yourself to mentally move away from work. I think it’s a lot to ask ourselves to mentally transition instantaneously from work life to home life – so we tend to carry parts of work back home with us and be distracted in these parts of our lives. Creating a transition activity allows you the length of time of that activity to bring yourself into the present moment and away from what you have left at work. I have found simple things such as my 5-7 minute walk home from work as a successful transition activity where I start to become more focused on the present moment with some mindful walking, but don’t get disconcerted if my mind does wander off while I’m transitioning. I also find some gentle yoga when I get home to be a lovely transition choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end of the day isn’t really the absolute end of the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how you think about it, if the cogs of your brain are still turning over work issues 30 minutes after you’ve left work – you’re still working. I like to try to think about leaving work and what needs to be done tomorrow 30 minutes before I leave. So at 4pm, I start closing things off and making a list either electronically or on paper about what needs to be done tomorrow. Planning is still a part of the work day. If you can’t bring yourself to allow this time period as a part of the day then stay an extra 15 minutes &amp;amp; do this. It will clear your mind for your evening as you know exactly what needs to be done tomorrow or Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent, important work – or just putting out fires?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are spending a large part of the work day running from one activity to another, systematically working through emails and picking up the phone everytime it rings, it’s possible that you aren’t prioritising your work according to what’s important and needs to be done. It’s no wonder you can’t turn off from work when you get home if you spend the entire day in what is akin to a blind panic, rather than reasonably structured and focused on the priorities you have as a part of your role. This section really warrants an entire article to itself, but a good read on this is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People"&gt;7 habits of highly effective people.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderfully complicated element of this is that when you begin to work on the important, long term work more and try less to put out the seemingly urgent fires that tend to stem from a lack of focus on the longterm, you will need to be aware of this process and regularly re-prioritise. Selecting important, long term work to focus on for the best part of your work hours is a work-life-long activity. You will do it again, and again, and again. Hopefully you will find that you meet the priorities and goals you are supposed to more by being more resistant to activities that don’t foster the goals you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice meditation and mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get good at anything, you have to practice. Practicing mindfulnesss and meditation will equip you with techniques for bringing you into the present moment and not being distracted away by your worrying thoughts. It’s not a quickfix, and it won’t happen overnight but it’s a long term solution to the assault the mind has of information overload and high expectations of our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a very basic breathing exercise and just focus on your breath. Everytime you are distracted and your mind wanders, be aware of the distraction, and gently bring yourself back to focusing on the breath. This will not be easy to start with. You can also try to bring mindfulness into aspects of your life which are routine to help you practice more. For example, choosing to become mindful while brushing your teeth – and really focusing on the experience and being present in the moment is great, regular practice for bringing your mind into the present moment and not being distracted and disturbed by your thoughts and feelings. Choosing routine activities like brushing your teeth, showering, washing the dishes mean that you can practice this in bitesize, manageable chunks. This regular practice should hopefully cascade into your normal life – so as you start your commute or walk home from work you can remember to use mindfulness as a method to transfer you away from your worries, thoughts and concerns at work (hopefully lessened by the brainstorm on tomorrow’s activities that you had before you left) and bring you more into your present experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change **added to main article 6th Feb so re-published**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally changing your clothes can be a real physical reminder to switch off from work. I tend to take off my jewellery and change into something more comfortable. You could even take off your make up if this applies, or if you find applying make up quite meditative, try on a different ‘look’ for after work.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever get the feeling you’re living a life you never wanted? That you’re just doing what other people think you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re stuck in a job you hate because you thought it was something you&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; do. You’re not really sure who told you that you should pursue that career, but you were certain you had to do it because it was well-respected and well-paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re in college working on a business degree. You really wanted to become a barber and own your own shop, but you thought you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; go to college instead because everyone says college is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you’ve accepted a request to work as a volunteer leader at a church or a civic organization. You knew your schedule was already packed with work and family, but you felt like you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; accept. Now you’re burnt out and falling behind with the responsibilities of your job &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your volunteer position, not to mention neglecting your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever felt like this, then you know exactly what it means to &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; all over yourself. It’s not fun and it sure ain’t pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should-ing Ourselves Silly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should-ing on one’s self comes in two forms. First, it could mean doing what you think others expect you to do, doing the “right” thing despite what your hopes, your conscience, and your gut are telling you. This first type of should-ing is rooted in a sense of guilt or in a hope of gaining approval from others. The second form of should-ing on yourself involves re-living past mistakes over and over again, saying, “I should have done this” or “I should have done that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know lots of men who struggle with the first kind of should-ing (me  included! more on that in a bit) and today I’ll be focusing on this part of the equation, sharing my personal story in the hopes that others can learn from my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re conditioned since grade school  to follow a certain pattern in order to become a mature man. You know the  drill. You’re probably living it right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out massive loans and go to college —&amp;gt;  Get a 9-5 job with a decent salary and benefits —&amp;gt; Get married  —&amp;gt; Have kids —&amp;gt; Take on a mortgage —&amp;gt; Work 30 years in  something you’re not terribly passionate about —&amp;gt;Retire, buy jogging suit, play golf, and hold up lines at the post office —&amp;gt; Die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what most American men think they’re expected to do and for the most part they follow along. Consequently, we end up living, as Thoreau said, “lives of quiet desperation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boys Do as They Should, Men Do as They Choose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re a boy, your life is pretty much laid out for you.  You have a bit of autonomy, but for the most part you simply do what you’re told to do.  And you know what? There’s something secure and comforting about that. Doing what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do relieves you of the burden of making your own choices and being held accountable for those choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a man means taking control of your life and being responsible for yourself. &lt;strong&gt;A man does as he &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt;, while a boy does as he &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; However, some men never make this leap; they struggle with carving out their own path in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they flounder. Because they’ve never actually figured out what they really want in life, they end up picking life goals they think they should have simply because everyone around them–/society/television/family/religion–tells them they should have those goals. In short, they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do things simply to please others or gain their approval, when you act purely from a sense of guilt, you give up a bit of your personal power. And you head down a path that invariably leads to feelings of  resentment, anger, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Struggle with Should-ing on Myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of my life I’ve been a people pleaser. As a boy, I loved  getting the adulation of adults by following the rules and doing what I  was “supposed” to do. I was the buzz-kill friend in high school who’d  say, “Guys, maybe we shouldn’t be doing this,” when we were about to partake in some mostly harmless teenage hi-jinks. My friends, God bless them,  put up with me, but they gave me an endearing nickname: Mama Brett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea how entrenched my thirst for approval was,  here’s a journal entry from when I was 12 years old:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today some friends brought some information about going paintballing. I thought it might be fun so I got some too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom thought it was a bad idea to be going around shooting people. My dad thought so, too. He told me that when he trains for his job, he learns to shoot to protect people and himself. He also said shooting someone isn’t supposed to be fun, you only shoot someone if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad my parents aren’t letting me go. It shows me that they care about me and love me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.roflcorner.com/wp-content/gallery/facepalm/FacePalm.jpg"&gt;Face palm.&lt;/a&gt; My wife burst out laughing when she read this. What sort of 12 year old boy is happy and grateful that he  can’t go paintballing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my quest for approval throughout high school. Growing up people always told me I’d be a good lawyer. Law seemed like a good career. It was prestigious, it paid really well (or so I naively thought), and I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Law and Order&lt;/em&gt;, so I figured why not? I’ll become a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I was a wee lad, I’ve had a passion for teaching. I’ve always enjoyed helping people widen their personal and intellectual horizons. I love mentoring other people and helping them reach their potential.  And I love the opportunities that teaching provides for me to learn new things myself.  My senior year in high school I remember thinking that it would be really cool to be a high school history teacher and coach football. It felt right in my gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went and “shoulded” all over myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a teacher wasn’t as “prestigious” and didn’t pay as well as being a lawyer. I couldn’t shake the feeling that what I should want was to fulfill the American Dream of being better off financially than my parents had been. I felt like I&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; want the “good life,” and to achieve it, I needed to be a high powered attorney, not some podunk high school teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I compromised. I told myself that I’d be an attorney for a decade or two, stockpile some cash, buy a house, retire, and then  start a second career as a high school American history teacher who coached offensive linemen in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to college and got my undergrad degree in Classics and Letters because all the counselors said it was a good degree to prepare you for law school. I really enjoyed my classes. I got to discuss philosophy, literature, and history all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During college I took a break from school to serve a two year mission for my church in Mexico. While I was there I rediscovered my passion for teaching. It seemed life was trying to nudge me back to becoming a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back from Mexico, I went back to college and proposed to Kate. She knew about my goal of becoming an attorney, and she was mildly supportive of it.  One night we were having a talk about our future life together, and I told her of my dream of becoming a high school teacher and coaching football. I laid out my plan of practicing law for a few years, making lots of money, and then pursuing a teaching career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate just looked at me blankly and asked: “Why are you putting off what you really want to do for twenty or thirty years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hemmed and hawed. “Well, everyone has always said I’d be a good lawyer and I’d enjoy practicing law… It’s, um, prestigious… It would certainly make my parents proud…And I want to make enough money so we’re financially well off. I mean, I don’t want to buy fancy cars or have a giant house, I just don’t want to have to worry about money. I mean, &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; a man want that for his family?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate continued the blank stare. “Those are some really dumb reasons to pursue a career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my wife. Always telling it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she was right. I really had no interest in the law, nor did I know much about it as a career. I just made it a goal because I thought it was something I &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I started making a new career plan: to become a high school teacher. Kate and I were both excited and felt really good about it. Yeah, money would be tight, but with Kate teaching as well, we’d make it work. I started scheduling the classes I needed and researching the teaching certification requirements in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shoulded a should load all over myself. The Should Monster paid me another visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brett, look at all your friends! They’re becoming doctors and lawyers and investment bankers. You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; go for a prestigious, well paying job too!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on, Brett, you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;want to take your family on nice vacations and buy them a nice house in a nice neighborhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caved. I told my wife that I was going to follow-through with my original goal of becoming an attorney. Teaching could wait. She was disappointed, but she supported my decision. I promised myself and her that if I was going to do this law thing, I would give it my all. I also promised I would try to avoid as much debt as possible to earn my JD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next five years, &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/08/the-world-belongs-to-those-who-hustle/"&gt;I hustled my ass off&lt;/a&gt;. I graduated with my undergraduate degree a year early by taking summer school, doing classes over Christmas break, and overloading my schedule in the spring and fall semesters. In my spare time I prepped for the LSAT. I was spending close to 30 hours a week studying for that dumb test. It paid off, though. With the score I earned on the exam, combined with my GPA, I was able to get a near full ride scholarship to law school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of law school, I quickly learned the “shoulds” of young law students: graduate in the top 10% of your class, get on law review, and land a big firm summer clerkship that paid mega bucks. Being the consummate shoulder that I am, I made those shoulds my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I achieved them. First semester of law school, I was first in my class. My second year of law school I earned a spot on the law review. The summer between my second and third years, I landed high paying summer positions at two of the most prestigious firms in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite achieving these goals, I was miserable. But I kept on trucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internships during the summer were my first real experience with the practice of law. And I quickly discovered law wasn’t for me. 60-70 hour work weeks. Billable hours. Work that didn’t interest me.  However, I feigned excitement so I could convince the hiring partners to bring me on full-time because I thought I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want to work at a big firm. I explored government work and small law thinking maybe it was just the big law firm atmosphere I didn’t enjoy. But I got the same results. It was official: I had no interest in the law. Sure, I was good at law, but it just bored me to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third year of law school I decided that I was going to do everything I could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to practice law. I would try to find another career that would put my law degree to use, pay off my debt, and cut my losses. It was then that I had a moment of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagnorisis"&gt;agnorasis&lt;/a&gt;. I realized I had spent the past three years of my life working for something I didn’t really want simply because I thought “they” (whoever they are) said I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you–it’s a sucky feeling to realize your unhappiness stems from the fact that you tried to conform your life to someone else’s expectations rather than following your own inner compass. I was angry at myself for not having the spine to go after what I really wanted. I felt guilty for having made Kate a law school widow for three years without a definitive purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During law school, I started blogging as a creative and mental release. What was interesting was that my articles naturally gravitated towards content geared towards helping people. Blogging provided me a chance to learn new things and then share what I learned with others. Basically, blogging let me be a teacher in a less traditional mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first blog was called &lt;a href="http://frugallawstudent.com"&gt;The Frugal Law Student&lt;/a&gt;. I started it in 2006 and had some mild success with it. Then in 2008, my second year of law school, I started The Art of Manliness. (If you want to see why I started the site, read the &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/about-2/"&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;). In just a few short months it was receiving large amounts of traffic, getting great publicity, and growing a small, but passionate community. I was spending around 20 hours a week on The Art of Manliness back then, with even more hours spent on writing our first book. This was on top of law classes, law review, and a part-time job. But I didn’t care. I loved working on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I graduated in 2009, The Art of Manliness was enough of a success that doing it full-time was a viable option. I was now putting at least 40 hours a week into the blog and so was Kate, who I had brought on to help me share a work load that had become far too big for one person. We would be barely scraping by, but would have enough money for a roof over our heads and food in the fridge. And most importantly, I’d be working in my &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/05/24/finding-your-calling-part-i-what-is-a-vocation/"&gt;vocation&lt;/a&gt;. I’d be happy with my work. So I decided to throw myself into building up AoM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I dropped a big should on myself. Enter stage left–the Should Monster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brett, you really &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;put that law degree to use. It’d be a waste of three years if you didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;take the bar exam even though you don’t want to practice. You know. Just in case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;get a “real” job. You can’t be a blogger for a living. That’s just silly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health insurance! You’re going to start a family soon. You &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;get a job that has good health insurance!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, I caved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2009 I started applying for a position with a legal publishing company that I worked for as a law student. The position was actually a really sweet gig. It paid an awesome salary, it involved teaching, and my hours were flexible. Still, I knew it would be tricky. Complicating things was the fact that Kate was pregnant. Could we both work on the blog and take care of the baby while I worked a second job? But I convinced myself that I could do it all. I  justified the choice by telling myself that blogging wasn’t a “real job” and that I needed a back-up plan…but really I was once again just doing what I thought I &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got turned down every time I applied for the corporate gig for about a year, and in the meantime I kept plugging away at AoM. We even published a book during that time. Our income from the site was starting to provide us a comfortable living, but it still felt like a hobby despite the fact I was working on it full-time, seven days a week. So I kept applying for that legal publishing position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally landed a job here in Tulsa. I was pumped. I had achieved another goal I had set for myself. I had a “real” job. This the spring of 2010. By this time, AoM was growing faster than ever and keeping me increasingly busy. New opportunities were showing up. We got a second a book deal. I was getting some speaking gigs. Everything was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Gus arrived. Late-night feedings, diaper changes, and comforting a crying newborn was a lot more work than I thought it was going to be. I kept soldiering on, but I was hitting a wall–physically, mentally, and emotionally. I was working 40 hours a week at my day job and putting in another 40 with the Art of Manliness. There was no way I could keep this up for very much longer. After five years of putting in 70-80 hour work weeks my body and mind had had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things came to a head over the winter break. I realized that I couldn’t do both things &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. I had to decide: keep going with the respectable, well-paying corporate gig or take a risk with something that I was really passionate about, doing what I actually wanted to do. It was a choice between &lt;em&gt;should-ing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 28 years of doing what I thought I &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;do, I finally decided to follow my heart and my inner compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was still a tough choice. I don’t like to quit things because a man &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t &lt;/em&gt;quit things he starts. I also felt guilty for leaving my boss after only 7 months on the job. The man is an amazing manager, and I learned a lot while working for him, so leaving was hard. It took me three weeks to work up the nerve to tell him the news. I kept vacillating between should-ing and choosing. But I stuck with my choice. My boss was completely magnanimous. He congratulated me and wished me well and was genuinely excited for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day with my corporate job was this past week. I’m now devoting myself 100% to The Art of Manliness, and I’ve never been happier. It feels good to do what you want and not just what you think you should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop Should-ing on Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to stop doing things out of guilt or the need for approval was a long, hard process for me. And it’s still ongoing. But here are a few things I’ve learned along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out what you want &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;want. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’ve never sat down to figure out what you want out of life, do it today. If you’re a young man just embarking on life’s journey, do some soul searching to see if you’re in the right career or major. Ask yourself  “Am I doing this because I want to or am I doing this because I think I should?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a man who’s years into his career or life choices, and you feel like you’re not living the life you want, figure out what you’d like your life to be and start hatching plans to make it a reality. It might be hard to navigate family obligations and your dreams, but it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just say no. &lt;/strong&gt;Start saying “no” to requests of your time and energy. I think most men who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; on themselves automatically say yes to most requests because they want approval from everyone around them or they operate out of guilt. Don’t fall into that trap. &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/29/how-to-firmly-say-no-without-coming-off-like-a-jerk/"&gt;You don’t have to be a jerk when you say no&lt;/a&gt;. Just politely and firmly say, “No thanks!” and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace “I should” with “I choose.” &lt;/strong&gt;You’re a man. A man does what he chooses, a boy does what he should. Instead of saying “I should,” say “I choose.” “I choose to go to college.” “I choose not to volunteer this weekend at the company BBQ.” It’s amazing how much more powerful and in control of your life you’ll feel when you start choosing instead of should-ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing Responsibility with Your Personal Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me be clear. I’m not suggesting you become a selfish jagweed in your quest to quit should-ing on yourself. Sometimes doing what you should means doing the honorable thing. We all have duties and responsibilities we have to fulfill even when we don’t feel like it. It will take some judgment and wisdom on your part to balance doing what you should and doing what you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you really should be faithful to your wife. That’s a no brainer. But should you stay at a corporate job you hate out of guilt that they need you even though you have a better opportunity somewhere else? A corporation that wouldn’t bat an eye before downsizing you? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between mere “shoulds” and real responsibilities is sometimes easy to discern and sometimes very difficult.  It’s something we get better at as we mature, consult with trusted friends and family, and learn to become attuned and responsive to our own inner compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alright, what do you guys think? Have you had a problem with should-ing on yourself? Any suggestions for men who do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed. I’ve only used Blu-Ray on a PS3, which is probably better than most standalone players, but all of the consumer-hostile “features” of DVDs — unskippable logos, previews, warnings, and disclaimers, long animation delays before menu activation, custom-themed interfaces that make everything more difficult — has advanced to new levels of hassles, delays, restrictions, and annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movies &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; great. But at such a high practicality cost, many people won’t (and shouldn’t) bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><gr:likingUser>05693012551531553580</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>01867880815236897424</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>07403035505444076718</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>06635607665256367282</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>11045288819919027643</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>08634806355076514413</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>07164225132584371953</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>14705039330007682102</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>02763995851142648490</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>06823410938016534213</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>11718481687045589256</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>04227761368317290687</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>09898904139810358597</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>05185292075178328361</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>01476917668200178031</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13665573413783985977</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.marco.org/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.marco.org/rss</id><title type="html">Marco.org</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.marco.org/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295983136622"><id gr:original-id="http://www.marco.org/2807464865">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02e095a4b5fc0b15</id><title type="html">"The majority of support emails and reviews have been from nice people who genuinely want to help,..."</title><published>2011-01-18T05:40:50Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T05:40:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.marco.org/2807464865" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.marco.org/" type="html">“The majority of support emails and reviews have been from nice people who genuinely want to help, but they are overshadowed by 10-20% that aren’t.

&lt;p&gt;As much as this seems like commonsense, we've all seen clients attempt to cram in as much information as possible, oblivious to reason. I believe this is largely due to another school of thought, which goes along the lines of, "My subscribers have signed up because they obviously want to &lt;i&gt;read all about&lt;/i&gt; my brand values and 5 year plan." With a lack of hard evidence to the contrary on hand, this can be an frustrating argument to dismiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;See no email...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was skimming through &lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/"&gt;Jakob Nielsen's research&lt;/a&gt; recently and came across a little gem in the form of an eyetracking heatmap. Based on data collected from recipients of an email newsletter, it denotes the areas where they looked the most in red and the least in blue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i3.campaignmonitor.com/uploads/images/newsletter_heatmap.jpg" alt="Email newsletter heatmap" width="350" height="548"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small style="color:#ccc"&gt;From: '&lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/newsletters-study-3.html"&gt;Email Newsletters: Surviving Inbox Congestion&lt;/a&gt;' - Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox, June 12, 2006&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the emphasis on reading the first two words of the headlines, followed by diminishing interest in the body copy. As the email extends downward, interest in the content rapidly drops off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't prove how fickle the average subscriber is, then there's more. Based on this research, Jakob observed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"...the average time allocated to a newsletter after opening it was only &lt;strong&gt;51 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;. "Reading" is not even the right word, since participants &lt;strong&gt;fully read only 19% of newsletters&lt;/strong&gt;. The predominant user behavior was scanning. Often, users didn't even scan the entire newsletter: 35% of the time, participants only skimmed a small part of the newsletter or glanced at the content."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch. Just when you thought you could get away with adding at least a tiny introduction to your newsletter, Jacob throws in the following salvo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"People were highly inclined to &lt;strong&gt;skip the introductory blah-blah text&lt;/strong&gt; in newsletters. Although this text was only three lines long on average, our eyetracking recordings revealed that 67% of users had zero fixations within newsletter introductions."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like we'll be keeping our emails to the point this season, hey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What can we learn from this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're probably speed-reading this blog post, so we'll get to the good stuff. Here are a couple of tips for getting the important bits of your email read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it short&lt;/strong&gt; - Interest in the content of an email diminishes as the email extends below the fold (as backed up by &lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/scrolling-attention.html"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;), so cut the copy and keep the most important points of the message near the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize your headlines&lt;/strong&gt; - As the first two words of a headline are the most important, keep them informational. For example, a headline like "3 tips for improving email usability and response rates" could be rephrased as, "Email usability: 3 tips for improving your response rates".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get to the point&lt;/strong&gt; - Most readers will skip any long-winded greetings or introductory text, so decide if it's worth including. If an introduction is necessary, avoid adding any important information to this section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus the message&lt;/strong&gt; - Where possible, avoid covering too many topics and keep the message simple. You're only going to have the readers attention for a few seconds, so make it count by using a standout call-to-action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it scan-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; -  Limit body copy to easily-readable paragraphs, preferably under 60 characters in width. Selectively use images to reinforce your message, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words"&gt;images often take less time to understand&lt;/a&gt; than words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align to the left&lt;/strong&gt; -  Notice how little attention the right-hand column of the email above is getting? That's because readers of left-to-right languages (like English) are &lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html"&gt;accustomed to scanning from the top-left first&lt;/a&gt;. Keep this in mind when designing two- or more column layouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, your email design may only get an average of 51 seconds of fame per reader (if it gets 'read' at all). &lt;strong&gt;How will you make the most of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CampaignMonitorBlog/~4/YGfSPm3nHPI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>Ros Hodgekiss</name></author><gr:likingUser>18143263250778037860</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>09715586281200924778</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>07302470335080244804</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>11134290710995507787</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/CampaignMonitorBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/CampaignMonitorBlog</id><title type="html">Campaign Monitor Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295981020381"><id gr:original-id="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2750-think-tanks-no-rhetoric-warranty">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ccb71ba4cd8e5028</id><title type="html">Think Tank's No Rhetoric Warranty</title><published>2011-01-25T13:48:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T13:48:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~3/yAvsPOCYg7c/2750-think-tanks-no-rhetoric-warranty" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://37signals.com/svn/posts" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/"&gt;Think Tank&lt;/a&gt; makes great photography bags. Like all manufacturers they stand by the quality of their product. However, they believe the “Lifetime warranty” is nothing more than marketing BS.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great statement from their &lt;a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/warranty.aspx"&gt;No Rhetoric Warranty&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;If you’re 30 years old when you purchased a bag, are you really going to return it 30 years later for repair? The only way this is possible is if the bag has stayed in your closet the majority of the time. Remember the leather cases in the 1960’s? Is anyone returning these bags for repair under the “lifetime” warranty? This is why the lifetime warranty is more of a marketing gimmick than the truth. Is it the life of the bag, or your personal life? The normal life of a bag, if it is used weekly, is four to 10 years, which is not “lifetime.” If lifetime means your personal life, when you’re dead, you won’t need the bag, unless it’s a body bag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I found this statement refreshing. I’m not sure how big Think Tank is — how many employees or revenues. This straight-talk made them feel like a shop around the corner, and I like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
