    <title>Analyzing Kellen Moore's incompletions against Nevada</title>
    <content type="html">
  
  
    &lt;img alt="BOISE, ID - OCTOBER 01:  Kellen Moore #11 of the Boise State Broncos passes against the Nevada Wolf Pack at Bronco Stadium on October 1, 2011 in Boise, Idaho.

&lt;p&gt;Kellen Moore had his worst statistical day as a Bronco on Saturday, throwing for fewer than 150 yards and completing just over half his throws. It was a performance that half of college football teams would take in a heartbeat, but for Bronco fans, it raised the question, "Gaa! What is going on here?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most have settled on Moore just having a bad day at work. Others, like Chris Fowler, think Moore's right knee is at fault. So what's really eating Kellen Moore? I have some theories after the jump, as well as analysis of every incompletion he threw on Saturday. Share your theories in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;h3&gt;Kellen Moore is suffering from H1N1 of the knee, and other random theories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some theories on what was wrong with Kellen Moore on Saturday. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments and in the poll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kellen Moore had an off day. &lt;/b&gt;He's allowed to be human every once in a while. I guess. If he has to. And better that he was human against a Nevada team that never threatened than against an Air Force or TCU team that has the talent to take advantage of games like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kellen Moore has a serious problem with his right knee.&lt;/b&gt; Moore overthrew a lot of receivers, which can be caused by a failure to step into throws. The leg he uses for stepping was wrapped in a knee brace for the second straight week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nevada defense came to play.&lt;/b&gt; The Wolf Pack did several things well on defense, including pressuring Moore and mixing up coverages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boise State's wide receivers let Moore down.&lt;/b&gt; There were three obvious drops and a few occasions where it seemed the Bronco receivers were not where Moore expected them. The Boise State offense requires a quarterback to throw to a spot and for a receiver to be there. If the Bronco wideouts weren't where they were supposed to be, that would explain a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatever Marty Tadman says.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tadman, ever the Ron Jaworski of Boise State Twitterers, had&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/martytadman"&gt;some constructive criticisms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;during the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734386/tadman1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734386/tadman1_medium.jpg" alt="Tadman1_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317660042234" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734390/tadman2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734390/tadman2_medium.jpg" alt="Tadman2_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317660079289" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734394/tadman3.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734394/tadman3_medium.jpg" alt="Tadman3_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317660116471" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am obligated by my love bond to Marty Tadman to agree with his analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kellen Moore's day in incompletions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here now is every single incompletion that Kellen Moore threw on Saturday with the reasons why, to the best of my knowledge, each pass was incomplete. Help me fill in the blanks if I left anything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 1: Incompletion to Tyler Shoemaker - Dropped&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 2: Incompletion to Mitch Burroughs - Dropped&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 3: Incompletion to Gabe Linehan - Overthrow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incompletion would be the first of six in a row, almost all of which were on Moore. This one came on a 3rd and 1 from near midfield and really stopped BSU's momentum. Linehan also deserves some blame for not having elastic arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 4: Incompletion to Aaron Burks - Pass broken up by Nevada's Jeremiah Green&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 5: Incompletion to Matt Miller - overthrow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 3rd and 10, Nevada came with the blitz, and Moore's quick, deep throw to Miller sailed out of bounds. It could have been that Miller failed to adjust to the blitz with a comeback or slant route and Moore had to throw the ball away. Or it could have just been a bad throw.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 6: INTERCEPTION&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This play will not be on his Heisman tape, for sure. It may have been the worst decision he's made in his Bronco career (best decision: breaking out the air guns versus Idaho).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevada DE Kaelin Burnett, a 225-pound lineman in the mold of Kharyee Marshall, worked his way around the pocket to grab Moore as he stepped up. It seemed like Moore thought he had stepped up far enough, and he maybe miscalculated Burnett's speed and reach. Nevertheless, once he was in Burnett's grasp, Moore should never have thrown that ball, and you, me, Moore, Moore's in-laws, and the guy sitting behind you who hates it every time you stand up knew it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734310/int1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734310/int1_medium.jpg" alt="Int1_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317654342329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 7: Incompletion to Doug Martin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help me out with this one. I seem to remember a pass thrown just out of Martin's reach that bounced off his hands. Did I dream that? And if so, why doesn't Doug Martin catch passes in my dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 8: Incompletion to Doug Martin - pass broken up by Nevada's Brett Roy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked the end of Moore's six straight incompletions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 9: INTERCEPTION&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734322/int2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734322/int2_medium.jpg" alt="Int2_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't a bad decision by Moore. Miller was in single coverage on Nevada corner Khalid Wooten, and I have no problem with Moore giving Miller a chance in one-on-one. The problem was that Wooten had inside leverage on Miller (meaning that Wooten had his body between the ball and Miller), so the throw needed to be outside rather than inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess Miller could have done more to break up this pass, like maybe pull Wooten to the ground, but as you can see in the above picture, Miller did make an attempt. He doesn't play corner for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 10: Incompletion to Kyle Efaw - overthrow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of Moore's worst throws of the day in my opinion because it was also one of the easiest. Efaw was wide open in the back of the end zone, and it is a pass that Moore hits nine times out of ten. I imagine he was trying to float it over a defender and just floated it too much. Either that or he saw KBOI news kid Troy Oppie in the back of the end zone and wanted to pull a goof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 11: Incompletion to Gabe Linehan - overthrow / miscommunication&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm leaning toward miscommunication on this one. You'll remember this play as the one where Linehan was wide open and the pass was a good five yards over his head. Moore was visibly confused / frustrated with Linehan, so I get the impression that Linehan wasn't where he was supposed to be. On long, arcing throws like this, Moore is releasing the ball before Linehan is finished with his route, and his route didn't seem to be the same one Moore expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 12: Incompletion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play-by-play does not list the intended target on this one, and my memory fails me. Intern, fetch my ginkgo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 13: Incompletion to Mitch Burroughs - dropped pass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to relive this one any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 14: Incompletion to Matt Miller&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is Kellen Moore's day in a nutshell. When you add it up, over one-third of his incompletions were either drops or good plays by Nevada. Only one of his interceptions was a poor throw (the other was the result of being heaved to the ground in the process of the throw).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, Moore's numbers could have been a lot better if just a few breaks had gone his way and a certain INT was never thrown. Instead of this:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;19-for-33, 58 percent, 142 yards, 2 TDs, 2 INTs&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Moore could have had this:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;22-for-32, 69 percent, 223 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Moore's throws were off on Saturday more often than they have been at any other time in his career. But it is no reason to panic. See how things go on Friday against a Fresno State pass defense that ranks 46th in the country, and then we can talk again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miscellaneous notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Doug Martin's 43-yard touchdown run came on the same play as his 33-yard touchdown run the week before against Tulsa. It was Boise State's double-pull where center Cory Yriarte and guard Joe Kellogg got out in front to lead the way. The way Nevada was lined up, the Wolf Pack never had a chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734467/tdrun1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734467/tdrun1_medium.jpg" alt="Tdrun1_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317661723562" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;You may remember and/or may still be incensed about Martin's 92-yard run that got called back for holding. Was it really a holding penalty? Well, there were some shreds of evidence that made it somewhat undertsandable how Gabe Linehan could be called for a hold. Linehan engaged his defender and then bent down to take the defender's legs out from under him. No problem there. But Linehan did a sneaky blocking move in tugging the defender down as he was cutting him. From the naked eye, it looks like a clean cut block. From slow-mo replays, you could see just the slightest jersey pull downward as Linehan went for the low block. Holding? Maybe, technically, but you see players get away with a whole lot worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Putting Jamar Taylor in man coverage on Rishard Matthews is a departure for a Boise State defense that traditionally keeps its corners on the same side of the field for the whole game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;The Broncos went with five defensive linemen for several snaps, using Shea McClellin as a hybrid linebacker-nickel-end. Pretty cool gig if you can get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your turn&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Game balls for Boise State versus Nevada</title>
    <content type="html">
  
  
    &lt;img alt="BOISE, ID - OCTOBER 01:  Doug Martin #22 of the Boise State Broncos is congratulated by his teammates for a touchdown against the Nevada Wolf Pack at Bronco Stadium on October 1, 2011 in Boise, Idaho.  (Photo by Otto Kitsinger III/Getty Images)" height="300" src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2012254/127828698_extra_large.jpg" width="450" /&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;Bronco Nation got its vicarious revenge Saturday with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.obnug.com/2011/10/1/2462638/doug-martin-bronco-d-lead-boise-state-to-30-10-win-over-nevada"&gt;Boise State's 58-10 win disguised as a 30-10 win over the Nevada Wolf Pack&lt;/a&gt;. There were many players, plays, and performances that deserve recognition (though surprisingly few left-handed ones), and I'll do my best to honor each of them with a gameball after the jump. Let me know which ones I forgot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;p&gt;Let these Mtn.tv studio guys yell some highlights at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object class="mceItemFlash" height="350" width="425"&gt;   &lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-WDufNI8k7s" /&gt;&lt;/param&gt;   &lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;/param&gt;   &lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-WDufNI8k7s" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" mce_src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-WDufNI8k7s" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reader's choice award for player of the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doug Martin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin had his first 100-yard game of the year, his new longest run of the year, and his new longest run of the year that didn't count. He was the best offensive player on the field on Saturday, which is never an easy accomplishment when you share a field with Kellen Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronco fans were treated to some classic Martinizing, and it just goes to show how good he can be when he has a little bit of daylight and space. His natural instincts and athleticism just take over, and before you know it, he's 30 yards downfield in an end zone. More please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unit of the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boise State defense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, 12 different Boise State players recorded tackles for loss in the Nevada game, and the Wolf Pack offense couldn't get out of its own way fast enough to avoid the impending onslaught of the Boise State defense. It's a little like those scary movies when the kids are trying to run away from the chainsaw guy or hockey mask guy or sharktopus but they end up tripping over their own feet in their haste to avoid the inevitable. Boise State's defense was the sharktopus. Nevada was the token single guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734286/sharktopus2d.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734286/sharktopus2d_medium.jpg" alt="Sharktopus2d_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317652965942" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Players of the game, Nevada version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LBs Brandon Marshall and James-Michael Johnson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just thank goodness it wasn't Rishard Matthews again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall finished with 14 tackles and Johnson had 11, and while some of that was due to their being on the field all the time, the two Nevada linebackers really were making plays all over the field. I don't have my WAC defensive depth charts memorized anymore (thank goodness, more brain space for xx), but I'm pretty sure these are two of the best linebackers in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worst drop of the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(tie) Jamar Taylor and Mitch Burroughs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor dropped a would-be pick-six that hit him square in the hands. Burroughs dropped a sure-thing touchdown bomb that would have made Kellen Moore's day look significantly better. So let's just pretend it was a 44-10 win and no harm done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most uncomfortable halftime interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Versus sideline reporter Anthony Herron and Coach Pete&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versus sideline man Anthony Herron grabbed Coach Pete as he was leaving the field to ask far-too-happy questions about the Boise State offense. Coach Pete answered something along the lines of: "No, the offense isn't playing well at all." Subtext: You're an idiot. This was followed by awkward silence and then I left the room because I couldn't take it any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to future sideline reporters: Begin all future halftime interviews with the question, "You can't be happy with anything, am I right or am I right?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Season achievement game ball&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boise State special teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure the Bronco special teams have received enough credit so far this year. And I'm not sure a game ball will fix that. Nevertheless, special teams has played a huge role in Boise State's 4-0 start. On Saturday, Nevada had 14 drives - one started outside its own 30 and 11 began from the 20 or worse. That is not a recipe for Tyler Lantrip success (that recipe: Not wearing gloves on both hands). Credit goes to Brad Elkin for punting like a champion and the Boise State kickoff team for covering like they mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734306/qeb.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/734306/qeb_medium.jpg" alt="Qeb_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br id="1317653636660" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best performance in a supporting, relief role&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quaylon Ewing-Burton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q-Burt got the start opposite Jamar Taylor at corner after Jerrell Gavins was ruled out with a knee injury. And all QEB did was lead the team in tackles and not give up any huge plays in the passing game. To be fair, I'm not sure Nevada was capable of big plays in the passing game (at least not outside the final two minutes of the game), but for Ewing-Burton to step in and play so well makes the corner spot a little less depressing from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best catch by a person who has no business making catches like that&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D.J. Harper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His touchdown grab over a defender was Austin Pettis-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Runner-up: J.C. Percy.&lt;/b&gt; I'm not sure I had even seen his hands until Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gameball for best under-bus throwing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris Ault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that freshman sensation Cody Fajardo did not play quarterback for the Wolf Pack on Saturday?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.rgj.com/section/blogs16?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;U=cf54a7c3-6850-4148-9710-effa04ad5005&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3acf54a7c3-6850-4148-9710-effa04ad5005Post%3ad25ad2a7-05ad-4e59-be6a-1d0753e1f6fd&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest"&gt;Chris Ault may have noticed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really felt like Cody could have possibly played this week, and yet there wasn't much of an effort from his side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2011/10/02/1823530/nevada-boise-state-notebook.html"&gt;what was Ault's assessment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the universally panned performance by senior starter Tyler Lantrip?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyler is Tyler - he was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there's a man you want to play for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical awards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best broadcast, non-ESPN category: Versus&lt;/b&gt;. I enjoyed the fun camera angles and semi-professional production so much that I'm actually looking forward to BSU's remaining games on Versus (Air Force and TCU). Now if Sean King could just get off Kellen Moore's back ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seriously, what was up with Tyler Lantrip's gloves award: Tyler Lantrip&lt;/b&gt;. It looked like Kurt Warner was giving him fashion advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most WAC-like officials: The Mountain West crew. &lt;/b&gt;Seriously, were they working with a quota?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Kicker of the year: Dan Goodale. I may be exaggerating a little bit, but it sure was nice to see a field goal go through the uprights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cover corner of the game: Jamar Taylor.&lt;/b&gt; I'm not sure Tyler Lantrip had the wherewithal to get the ball to Rishard Matthews, but Taylor made sure that wasn't even an option, covering Matthews like a wet blanket all afternoon. Matthews' first catch didn't come until the second half.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What plays, players, and performances do you think deserve game balls? What was your favorite defensive play? What was your favorite score? Share your thoughts in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wilnerhotline/status/120861125683314689"&gt;According to the Jon Wilner hotline&lt;/a&gt;, the Broncos would need Missouri to go to the SEC and the Big East to not implode. Then BSU is just a gift basket away from being on the short list. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Wake up, Bronco Nation: Boise State football links and things, 10-03-11</title>
    <content type="html">
  
  
    &lt;img alt="Photo" height="299" src="http://cdn1.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2012080/54874_Utah_St_Boise_St_Football.jpg" width="450" /&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/01/sports/la-sp-1002-college-football-spotlight-20111002"&gt;Kyle Brotzman is doing just fine a year after the Nevada game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LA Times caught up with Brotzman to find out that he is coaching high school kickers in Meridian and is set to play with the AFL's Utah Blaze when the AFL's season resumes. Glad to hear from Brotz and glad to hear he still enjoys football and hasn't been scarred by the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2011/10/03/1824295/bobbling-for-bucks.html"&gt;Former Boise State players' now getting paid for bobbleheads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's bobblhead players -- &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/15351/titus-young" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Titus Young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/15435/austin-pettis" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Austin Pettis&lt;/a&gt; and Ryan Winterswyk -- all received $500 for being enshrined. Seems low but Boise State says they have only made between&amp;nbsp;$2,360 and $3,668 each year they've been produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/10/02/3413596/tcus-streak-of-46-weeks-in-rankings.html"&gt;TCU's streak of 45 straight weeks being ranked comes to end after losing to SMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, TCU lost to SMU in OT this past weekend. The Horned Frogs scored 23 points in the 4th quarter just to send the game to OT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20111003/SPORTS/110030301"&gt;Fresno State falls to Ole Miss after leading by 1 point at the beginning of the 4th quarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been nice to see Fresno pick up a win against an SEC team the week before they play Boise State, but they couldn't hold on and ended up falling to the Rebels by a score of 38-28.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2011/10/college_football_plus_the_susp.html"&gt;Some east coast writer thinks Boise State would go 9-3 in the SEC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course it's a throw away comment that he doesn't back up, because isn't that just a commonly held belief about how Boise State would do if they played in the SEC?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/sportspost.aspx?Texas_trickedup_offense_led_by_guy_who_has_tripped_up_OU_already/12-12749"&gt;Bryan Harsin and Texas to take on Oklahoma this week in the Red River Rivalry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of course leads to a history of trick plays in the Red River Rivalry. I really hope that Harsin dissects the Oklahoma defense and takes them down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three stars and one goat of Boise State's win over Nevada</title>
    <content type="html">
  
  
    &lt;img alt="BOISE, ID - OCTOBER 01:  A general view of Bronco Stadium during the game between the Nevada Wolf Pack and the Boise State Broncos on October 1, 2011 in Boise, Idaho.  (Photo by Otto Kitsinger III/Getty Images)" height="300" src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2007055/127831598_extra_large.jpg" width="450" /&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;This was the game many Boise fans had been awaiting for a very long time. Sweet, sweet revenge was the tone of our outing as the Broncos embarked on a journey of redemption on Saturday afternoon. Just one year prior, the Nevada Wolfpack had shattered our hopes of a BCS bowl through a series of unfortunate events. Though we still played in a bowl game, it was the meeting in Reno approximately 10 months ago that renewed a seemingly dwindling Western Athletic Conference Rivalry. Join me now after the jump as we celebrate our victory, and diagnose the three stars and one goat of Boise State's win over Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;p&gt;What started out as an overcast afternoon in Boise, Idaho, eventually became one of the hottest days in recent memory. Maybe that's just because I sat directly underneath the sun for about six hours, in the North Endzone, away from any hope of shade unless I wanted to go hang out with the Chicken and Cheese Pita crew underneath the bleachers. Although we walked away with a victory on Saturday afternoon, there was a very eerie presence throughout the stadium, or maybe that was just the inordinate amount of flags the prestigious WAC officiating crew threw against Boise State. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was it. But in all seriousness, it was different watching Kellen throw for only 142 yards with two touchdowns and two picks. Or maybe it was the lack of the pick-master, &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/101350/jerrell-gavins" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Jerrell Gavins&lt;/a&gt; from the Bronco secondary. Or maybe the eeriness was caused by the incessant pacing of Chris Ault on the sidelines. Regardless of all the seemingly odd happenings on Saturday afternoon, the Broncos came away with a win, and became one step closer to an undefeated season and BCS bowl appearance. Join me now as we take a look at our stars, and the obvious goat from Saturday's meeting with the Nevada Wolfpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733469/NOOPOQXLIKHFGWK.20110617164343.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733469/NOOPOQXLIKHFGWK.20110617164343_medium.jpg" alt="Noopoqxlikhfgwk" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733473/HEFEFDSKVEJTMOY.20110617164344.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733473/HEFEFDSKVEJTMOY.20110617164344_medium.jpg" alt="Hefefdskvejtmoy" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733477/RYQSFMFMVVZGOXY.20110617164344.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733477/RYQSFMFMVVZGOXY.20110617164344_medium.jpg" alt="Ryqsfmfmvvzgoxy" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;It seems to me like three stars is quickly becoming the Kellen, Doug, Gavins/Miller show. I don't want it to be so. I don't want three stars to be the same guys, week in and week out, even if it seems like they're the only logical choices. Three stars needs to be about players that had a positive impact on their team's achieving a victory. I feel these three players all had a positive impact on the Boise State victory on Saturday afternoon. Sure there are others, but these are the ones that stood out in my mind. Now let's celebrate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Star No. 3: &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/15345/mitch-burroughs" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Mitch Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, Junior WR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;The Mitch Burroughs Experience is back, ladies and gentlemen. Well, kind of. Or has it ever even left? A quick glance at Burroughs' stats would argue that the Experience is back. In 2010, Mitch had six receptions for 59 yards. So far through 2011, Burroughs the Elder has 21 receptions for 216 yards, playing a vital role in the Broncos receiving core. On Saturday, Mitch had five receptions for 34 yards. Yeah, yeah, I know he dropped a WIDE OPEN ball that would have been a score, but Mitch came through when we needed him and seemed to be a solid favorite for Kellen against Nevada. Mitch also had three punt returns for 69 yards. Congratulations, Mitch, on being Star No. 3 of Boise State's win over Nevada - and here's to hoping the experience never leaves; unless of course he starts dropping wide open balls more often - if that happens, the Experience can leave anytime he wants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Runner Up for Star No. 3: Chris Potter walking around on the sidelines in skinny jeans and a long sleeve shirt under his jersey. Wow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Star No. 2: J. C. Percy, Junior LB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/35564/j-c-percy" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;J.C. Percy&lt;/a&gt; has had at least three tackles in every game so far this season. On Saturday afternoon he had four, and one interception. Not the most incredible performance we've ever had, but time and time again I found myself impressed with his presence on the field. He seemed to always be in the core of a tackle or making a big stop on the edge. Percy was flying around the field, truly establishing himself as a leader on the defense that only allowed 59 yards rushing to a team that previously averaged 285 yards rushing per game. Percy played a vital role in shutting down an offense that had previously been extremely high performing. Great job, J.C., and congratulations on being Star No. 2 of Boise State's win over Nevada.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Runner Up for Star No. 2: The Hamster masked man in the stands that braved the intense heat and showed his muscle hamster pride. Must have been a literal pool of sweat inside that outfit. Gross.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Star No. 1: &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/15372/doug-martin" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Doug Martin&lt;/a&gt;, Senior RB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Doug Martin, or as CBS announcers like to call him, The Bulldozer (Mark Johnson frowns on your ridiculous nicknames, CBS) was a beast on Saturday afternoon. Too bad we don't give out stars for yards after contact, because that was the name of the game for Doug Martin vs Nevada. Time after time, Martin barrelled his way downfield, literally running through and over would-be defenders that got in his way. Doug finally got his first 100 yard rushing game of the season, ending the night at 126 yards on 21 carries. His best run of the game was actually called back because of a blue field penalty flag thrown by the WAC refs (just kidding, it was a hold, but it may as well have been something that ridiculous). Martin's legs are continually pumping and pushing for the extra yards, which is what makes him so hard to take down, and eventually earned him the nickname Bulldozer. Martin may not even hit 1,000 yards rushing on the season, but numbers truly can't sing the importance of Martin on the Boise State offense. He is a true leader, and an incredible football player. Congratulations, Doug, on being Star No. 1 of Boise State's win over Nevada.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Runner Up for Star No. 1: The Broncos walking out of the tunnell. Running out of the smoke is awesome enough, but walking out, arms linked, literally sends chills throughout my entire body. Freaking. Awesome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733557/goat.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733557/goat_medium.jpg" alt="Goat_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733565/penalty_flag-1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/733565/penalty_flag-1_medium.jpg" alt="Penalty_flag-1_medium" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Goat: Penalties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;My criteria for determining the Goat each week: what pissed me off and brought me to cursing more than anything else. Well, this was an easy one. Penalties. Boise got hit with the same amount of penalties, for approximately the same amount of yards that Nevada did, but ours sure seemed a lot worse. If the anger level of the North Endzone was any indiication of how poor some of the calls were, I imagine everyone - both home and at the stadium - were just as enraged. I can't even count how many facemasks and holds the refs missed on Saturday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;First off, let me say that I know the referees call what they see. Most of them do the best job they can every play, and none are perfect. I get that. But c'mon, man! That was awful! At one point, I saw &lt;a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/78304/kirby-moore" class="sbn-auto-link"&gt;Kirby Moore&lt;/a&gt; get tossed out of bounds, helmet coming off and all. The ref threw a flag, and I fully expected the call to be: "Excessive length of hair and fluidity on the offense, number 34." Okay, that might be an exaggeration. But in all seriousness, I haven't heard that many "boo's" in Bronco Stadium for several years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Runner Up for The Goat: Nevada Fan Attendance - what were there, like a few dozen of them? We bring 10,000 to Reno and they can't even crack triple digits? Thats like looking at the upper tier of the student section in the 4th quarter. Oh snap.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Turn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Anyone else see C. Pot on the sidelines in the skinny jeans? Is Mitch Burroughs the real deal? Who were your stars, and who was your goat? Sound off, Bronco Nation!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>2012 Recruit Roundup: October 2, 2011</title>
    <content type="html">
  


&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the hiccup in recruit coverage the last few weeks, I'd been utterly swamped from bell to bell the last 2 Sundays, but I think we're back on track. I'll try my best to fill you in on what you've missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me after the jump for stats galore.&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Fields, RB, Americas High (El Paso, TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recruit from the class of 2012 benefitted more from my hiatus than Jack Fields. On the 16th against Coronado, Jack went off&amp;mdash;rushing for &lt;b&gt;337 yards&lt;/b&gt; on 25 carries (13.48 YPC) and 3 TDs. One of Jack's runs in the contest was an amazing 94-yarder. Then after a bye week, Jack picked up roughly where he left off on Friday night, rushing for 253 yards and 3 TDs against Hanks. Fields also added a 63-yard receiving TD to his total on the night. The Trail Blazers are now 4-1 on the season and Fields has rushed for &lt;b&gt;954 yards&lt;/b&gt; and 8 TDs. Fields highlights from the Coronado game are below...don't get lulled to sleep by the copious 4- and 5-yard dives at the beginning...he goes off as the game wears on (literal LOLs at 1:40 and 3:00 marks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hbSmY9LIfc0" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br id="1317575998691" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shane Rhodes, WR, Klein Collins High School (TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodes has continued to play well over the last few weeks, but his Klein Collins team has dropped two straight. On the 23rd, Klein Collins saw their undefeated season end in a wild 3 OT loss to Klein Oak. Rhodes did all he could in the loss, finishing with 9 catches for 158 yards and 2 TDs. Then on Friday night, Collins dropped their second straight, this time to Dekaney (where fellow 2012 commit Armand Nance plays) 42-31. Rhodes had 9 catches for 112 yards and 2 TDs on the night. Highlights from Rhodes' first 4 games of the season can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devan Demas, RB, Cypress Creek (TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demas sat out Cypress Creek's loss against Cypress Falls with a minor ankle sprain, but the squad lost again in his return against Cy-Fair 17-3 on the 24th. Demas had 21 receptions in the game for 87 yards&amp;mdash;his rushing stats were not listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donte Deayon, CB, Summit High School (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deayon continued his stellar season for the 3-1 Summit SkyHawks although he's been doing his damage on the offensive side of the ball. Deayon had 3 rushes for 46 yards against Fontana on the 16th and then followed up that performance with an 8-carry 125 yard game against Colton on the 22nd. Deayon has 501 rushing yards and 5 TDs on the year and has hauled in 7 passes for 117 yards and 2 more scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chaz Anderson, CB, Loyola High School (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson's Loyola squad is now 4-1 on the year after losing to Upland on Friday evening. Anderson now has 13 receptions on the year for 150 yards and 2 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marcus Rios, CB, Cosumnes Oaks High School (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rios' Cosumnes Oaks squad improved to 4-2 on the year on Friday night with a 45-7 win over Galt. Unfortunately the stat-keeping has gotten a little lax and only partial game stats are available over the last few games. Rios appears to have at least 104 yards rushing and 66 yards receiving through the 23rd and has scored at least 1 TD. Defensive stats are tough to come by after September 9th...and which point he had 15 tackles and 4 passes defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christopher Santini, N, Leland High School (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santini has continued his stellar senior season for Leland, accounting for 5 TDs against Gilroy on the 16th (137 yards rushing and 44 receiving). He also logged 12 tackles in the 64-42 win. Then, on Friday evening, Santini led the team to a 41-14 win over Live Oak. Santini rushed the ball 10 times in the game for 119 yards and 2 TDs and added a 95-yard kick return for a score in the contest. Santini logged 10 tackles on the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chanceller James, S, Steele Canyon (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James' squad is 3-2 on the year with their most recent win coming Friday against Point Loma. Steele Canyon's record keeping has been spotty at best, but James had been a big contributor at wide receiver through the first few games and there's nothing to suggest that he hasn't continued to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Patti, QB, Dr. Phillips High School (FL)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we left off with Patti, he'd guided his Dr. Phillips squad to a 2-0 record and provided some youtube-worthy highlights. Now, Patti's squad sits a 5-0 after dismantling the last 3 opponents (Wekiva, McArthur, and DeLand, respectively) by a combined score of 103-27. As usual, Patti has been torching opponents with his arm and his feet. Against Wekiva, Patti had 256 total yards, completed 14-of-19 passes for 3 TDs and averaged 10 YPC on seven carries. Against McArthur, Patti rushed 7 times for 86 yards and threw for 105 on just 8 completions. In the McArthur game, Patti also passed the 4,000 yard mark for his career&amp;mdash;making him the first in school history to do so. Finally, on Friday night against DeLand, Patti was 14-of-21 for 178 yards and a score. DeLand and Dr. Phillips are the two top-rated schools in the area. Below, you can find highlights from Patti's first 3 games of the year. Patti should be graduating early to join the team in January, and I'd be lying if I said that his skillset doesn't intrigue me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nbuN-goyLnw" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br id="1317575768550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrew Pint, LB, Valor Christian (CO)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valor Christian is now 5-0 on the year and although Pint's tackle production has dropped off a bit, he still is averaging a respectable 6.8 tackles per contest. Pint has 34 total tackles on the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ben Weaver, LB, Klein High School (TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaver's Klein squad is now 4-1 on the year after dropping a tight contest to Klein Forest on the 22nd and then demolishing Westfield 86-0 on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Armand Nance, TE/FB, Dekaney High School (TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nance's Dekaney squad is now 5-0 after posting big wins over Spring and Klein Collins in consecutive weeks. Believe it or not, Nance registered his first catch of the season against Spring on the 23rd, although he is primarily a blocking TE in a run-first system. Nance has to get some of the credit for the stellar rushing numbers the Wildcats have put up this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Travis Averill, OL, Servite High School (CA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averill's squad is 4-1 on the season after being handed their first loss of the season on Friday night by Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas). Prior to the contest, the Friars were ranked 13th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steven Baggett, OL, Martin High School (TX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baggett's squad is also 4-1 on the year and ranked 7th in the state of Texas. The dropped their first game of the year on Friday night, falling hard to Arlington 47-16.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for this week...if you have any stats, info, or otherwise to report, I would greatly appreciate it. Just send&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://mailto:tips@obnug.com"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doug Martin, Bronco D lead Boise State to 30-10 win over Nevada</title>
    <content type="html">
  
  
    &lt;img alt="Nevada quarterback Tyler Lantrip is brought down by a host of Boise State defenders during an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 1, 2011, in Boise, Idaho. (AP Photo/Idaho Press-Tribune, Charlie Litchfield)" height="299" src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/2002963/63587_Nevada_Boise_St_Football.jpg" width="450" /&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;The Boise State Broncos made amends for last year's loss to Nevada with a thorough 30-10 win on Saturday. The Bronco D had 12 tackles for loss and held the Wolf Pack over 200 yards below their season average. Doug Martin picked up the slack for the Bronco O with 100 yards and two scores on a rare Kellen Moore off day. Chris Ault looked completely helpless. It was fun times all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave your thoughts on the game in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;h3&gt;Game recap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A twenty-point margin did not do justice to the gap between Boise State and Nevada on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wolf Pack offense was outmatched at every position and didn't cross midfield until the second half. Apart from two garbage-time drives, Nevada never threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boise State had opportunities aplenty on offense, and were it not for several misses in the passing game, the score could have been far more lopsided. The Broncos got the running game working better than it has all year, led by Doug Martin's 130 yards and two scores on 22 carries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the game's opening Nevada possession, you just had the feeling that Nevada QB Tyler Lantrip was not going to be good enough to challenge the Broncos. And with zero threat from the Wolf Pack, the game seemed over almost before it began. 30-10 may not have been the complete and total evisceration that Bronco fans wanted, but seeing Nevada struggle to move the ball sure was cathartic. Perhaps more importantly than the final score, Saturday's game reminded us that Boise State follows great seasons with more great seasons and Nevada doesn't enjoy the same luxury. That difference alone is enough to make me feel better about things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knee-jerk reactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a WAC officiating crew if I ever saw one (update: Those were actually MWC officials, so yikes) ... I don't really want next week to become a Kellen Moore Knee Crisis, so let me say that I don't think any of his problems were knee-related. He just made some poor decisions, threw some poor balls, and didn't get much help from his receivers ... When did Shea McClellin become Clay Matthews? Man, that guy is versatile and really good ... What a performance by the Bronco defense for 59 minutes and 14 seconds ... Call me crazy, but I enjoyed the Versus presentation, probably because I've seen too many games on the WAC Sports Network ... Quiet day for Tyler Shoemaker, which makes me think that may have been part of Nevada's gameplan ... The loss of Jerrell Gavins didn't seem to hurt the Broncos at all ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy, if Jamar Taylor could catch ... Coach Pete will have a lot of areas to be displeased with, but as a fan, I think I feel better after this game than I did after the Tulsa or Toledo ones ... It's nice having Chase Baker healthy ... Boise State continues to win the battle of field position, which I think says a lot about the improvement of their special teams coverage ... Dan Goodale, everybody! Kicking 1.000! ... One of Tyler Lantrip's many problems: Wearing gloves on both hands ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you think about Boise State's win over Nevada? Who was your player of the game? Glad to see the Boise State defense dominate the way they did? Share your thoughts in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
