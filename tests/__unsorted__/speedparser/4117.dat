			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/19/summit-recap-day-1/">Day One </a>of the <a href="http://mashable.com/sgs/">Social Good Summit</a> was pretty awesome. From an awesome talk by Ted Turner which left the crowd laughing and nodding their heads, to thoughtful talks by people from <a href="http://www.usaid.gov">USAID</a> and the <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a>.</p>
<p>But, I’d have to say my favorite was seeing Scott Harrison on stage. If you’ve been following my work for a while this probably comes as no surprise. I’ve been <a href="http://uncultured.com/2009/04/29/changing-the-conversation-charity-water/">a fan</a> of <a href="http://www.charitywater.org">Charity: Water</a> for a while now.</p>
<p>Charity: Water works on a very different model than most NGOs. They track where every dollar goes so you know <em>exactly</em> what you funded and, unless you specifically ask to do so, they will never use your donation to pay for their salaries or marketing overhead.</p>
<p>I had a chance to sit down with Scott 1-on-1 and ask him about his model, how they have quantitative data that shows their work has made an impact, and how raising overhead separately still means that good aid and development costs money to be done right.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anytime I get a <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a> Video Call, I kind of marvel at how the world has changed. Think about it: if you’re like me you grew up with Star Trek (for me, it was <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">TNG</a>), the idea of being able to have a video call with someone was really sci-fi. Now so many of us do it everyday.</p>
<div id="attachment_3557" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Viewer_2254.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3557" title="Spock Video Call" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Viewer_2254-300x209.jpg" alt="Spock Video Call" width="300" height="209" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The very first pilot of Star Trek (which didn</p></div>
<p>A few days back, I got a Skype Video Call from Sweden. It was from the head office of <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/" target="_blank">Ericsson</a> &#8211; a global telecommunications company with over $30 billion dollars in revenue last year. By the time that call ended, I was left wondering at how the world has changed &#8211; but for different reasons.</p>
<p>Ericsson has given me a scholarship to come the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Foundation’s</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/un-week/social-good-summit/" target="_blank">Social Good Summit</a> here in NYC. I’m here to attend the events as a VIP, listen to the speakers, and share my experiences as much as I can with you guys. Some of what I share will be posted on Ericsson’s <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/the-networked-society-blog/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Something like this would never have happened when my dad was my age. Back then, corporations (especially multi-billion dollar ones) would carefully craft, control, and curate their corporate message. Giving such control to a non-employee was corporate heresy back then. And, as you can see below, this kind of control didn&#8217;t always bring diversity into a corporation&#8217;s message:</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y9k2CUZJDp0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y9k2CUZJDp0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>But here I am. I wasn&#8217;t asked to tell you how great the company is &#8211; after all, they can&#8217;t fire me if they don&#8217;t like what I say. And they don&#8217;t care that I use an iPhone and that none of my friends own a Sony Ericsson phone &#8211; in fact, as I have learned, most of their business has nothing to do with making products for consumers like you and I to buy.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/06/17/beth-kanter-gets-it/" target="_blank">talked about</a> how this is happening &#8211; albeit much more cautiously &#8211; in the non-profit world. Experts like <a href="http://www.bethkanter.org" target="_blank">Beth Kanter</a> like to call this the <a href="http://philanthropy.com/article/How-to-Adjust-to-a/65855" target="_blank">“Networked Nonprofit”</a>. But it turns out, for-profit corporations have been already doing this for a while. After all, with technology and social media, an individual&#8217;s voice can sometimes be louder than an institution&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I believe when it comes to solving some of the world&#8217;s most difficult problems &#8211; we need to imagine these problems complexly. And to imagine something complexly we need to have a diversity in conversation. That diversity means individuals, institutions (including NGOs), and international corporations have to work together, network together, and &#8211; hopefully &#8211; solve things together.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very fortunate that most of the folks reading what I spew <a href="http://twitter.com/uncultured">on Twitter</a> know me well enough to put things in context. But recently, I got called out on a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/uncultured/status/93702470777307136">couple</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/uncultured/status/93703204788903936">tweets</a> by an <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/YTaddict">anonymous YouTube fan</a>. I know it&#8217;s just one person, but I figured it&#8217;s worth a quick blog post.</p>
<p>At home, I&#8217;ve been having a lot of debates and discussions with family about what constitutes being successful. As anyone from a South Asian or Asian family like mine already knows, success in my culture is defined by how big your paycheck is.</p>
<div id="attachment_3537" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 417px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/high-expectatinos-asian-father-you-doctor-yet-talk-to-me-when-you-doctor.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3537 " title="high-expectatinos-asian-father-you-doctor-yet-talk-to-me-when-you-doctor" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/high-expectatinos-asian-father-you-doctor-yet-talk-to-me-when-you-doctor.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="405" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">True for South Asian families as well.</p></div>
<p>So while I can list a whole bunch of good things I&#8217;ve done and the recognition I&#8217;ve received for it, there will always be relatives that will not see me as a success. I&#8217;ve kind of learned to live with that reality. And, others in my culture encounter the same thing (see <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/masarat/status/84854991415808000">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/masarat/status/84855059497750528">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/masarat/status/84855265605849088">here</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/masarat/status/84855671199240192">here</a> for a story from <a href="http://twitter.com/uncultured">Masarat</a> &#8211; creator of the largest TEDx event in the world).</p>
<p>Though there are times when I feel my relatives are right and this week is one of them.</p>
<p>Last year, I was <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/07/08/going-to-vidcon/">invited to speak at VidCon.</a> I had about ten days notice but was able to come up with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCkWJXcwZQA">presentation</a> that I am grateful was very well received. Since then I&#8217;ve been developing a story about how momentum from last year&#8217;s VidCon led to even <strong>bigger</strong> things in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I will not be there to tell that story at VidCon.</p>
<div id="attachment_3543" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 402px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tumblr_lo2ga7rWmA1qz864mo1_500.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3543  " title="tumblr_lo2ga7rWmA1qz864mo1_500" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tumblr_lo2ga7rWmA1qz864mo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="587" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sneak peak of the story I had hoped to tell in person at VidCon.</p></div>
<p>There is no YouTube drama, politics, or anything like that. Stuff happens and sponsorship to get me to VidCon didn&#8217;t come together. Sadly, in light of this, my conversations with my family have kind of looped back to the debate on how you define success.</p>
<p>Basically, even if some in my family concede you can be successful doing something on YouTube, they will point out charity work isn&#8217;t one of them. Making music, making jokes, microwaving things, and making explosions is success in this space according to them (a metric measured, among other things, through sponsorship to events like VidCon).</p>
<p>I am very proud of the many friends in the YouTube community that are musician, comedians, microwave specialists, and graphic effects pros. And I love how they&#8217;ve taken these talents and turned them into a success (both personally and financially). I also don&#8217;t think <em>their</em> success means <em>other</em>s working in other areas can&#8217;t also be equally successful by the same metrics.</p>
<p>But, especially given the conversations I&#8217;m having and have had with family and relatives, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit down. My tweets were just me sharing what&#8217;s going on in my life and weren&#8217;t intended to be a swipe against anyone. I&#8217;m glad all but one of you realized that <img src='http://uncultured.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>With less than a month before the Muslim holy month of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a>, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/07/06/bangladesh.protests/">violence</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hP9O7e05PockunaAGqxPB8ULfRiw?docId=CNG.6663621e5bbe4007b9a5c85520046abb.141">protests</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iOr6kf7MtOReBGlpwFcisdiQ6vmA?docId=CNG.205816eb111b08d6beab574037f334ec.6e1">strikes</a> have erupted in Bangladesh. Much of this is fueled by an Islamic political party called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami">Jamaat-e-Islami</a>. This is a political party that exists both in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Their goal? To advance the Islamization of Muslim countries (with the goal of ultimately ruling by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law">Sharia Law</a>).</p>
<p>When acts of violence and religious extremism occur in a far-away country, we usually don&#8217;t think of it as having anything to do with the charities we donate to, how NGOs operate in these countries, or how the attitudes and approaches of aid workers affect these issues. But the two are closely interlinked.</p>
<p>What surprises me the most is that aid workers are often the ones least willing to admit that such a connection exists at all. The impression I get from many of my friends and colleagues in the humanitarian sector, is that many see themselves as <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Starfleet">Starfleet</a> officers operating on their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct_for_the_International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement_and_NGOs_in_Disaster_Relief">own version</a> of Gene Roddenberry&#8217;s <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Prime_directive">Prime Directive</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while there is a great deal of nobility, selflessness, and self-sacrifice in the aid industry, the notion that one can provide humanitarian aid and development while being impartial and above the fray of local conflicts is science fiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-3416"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3450" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3450 " title="If Captain Picard was an aid worker, this would be a photo of him sending an email which would save millions of lives." src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdesk.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="341" /><p class="wp-caption-text">If Captain Picard was an aid worker, this would be a photo of him sending an email which would save millions of lives.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there is nothing sinister about how aid work can sometimes inflame, fuel, and amplify Islamic extremism. There is no malice. There is no conspiracy. There is no neo-colonial plot. And, for the most part, aid workers on the ground and in NGO offices are working under the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Rather, this is happening because the aid and development sector &#8211; even in open discussions such as aid blogs &#8211; is developing a consensus that more reflects <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a> than it does reflect the specific contexts and realities on the ground. This is especially true in Muslim countries. Here are three examples:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">1) &#8220;Orphanages Are Bad&#8221;</h3>
<p><object width="500" height="281"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=21790809&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=21790809&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/21790809">Orphanage Tourism</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/reginarivard">Regina Rivard</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>You will be hard pressed to find an aid blogger that thinks supporting orphanages are a good idea. <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/26/dont_try_this_abroad?showcomments=yes">Over</a> and <a href="http://goodintents.org/orphanages/hug-an-orphan-vacations-3">over</a> and <a href="http://lessonsilearned.org/2011/04/orphanages-we-need-to-%E2%80%9Cget-real%E2%80%9D/">over</a> again aid bloggers and Western-centric aid professionals have been pushing the notion that family-based care (through adoption by neighbors or surviving blood relatives) are a better alternative to housing children in an orphanage.</p>
<p>But, did you know, in Islam <a href="http://islam.about.com/cs/parenting/a/adoption.htm">adoption isn&#8217;t permissible</a>? Even in a progressive Muslim country like Bangladesh, adoptions are not permitted by law (although there are some <a href="http://foreverparents.com/2008/06/john-mccain-adopted-one-of-his-children-from-bangladesh.html">high profile exceptions</a> if you can pull some strings). The closest alternative to adoption is for an adult to assume a guardianship or stewardship role over a child.</p>
<p>However, even that has it&#8217;s downsides. Because, under Islamic sharia law and jurisprudence on inheritance, a child under guardianship has <a href="http://www.islam101.com/sociology/inheritance.htm">no right or entitlement to any inheritance</a> from parental surrogate (unless voluntarily given by the guardian). [<em>EDIT: I forgot to mention that attempts to move to more secular inheritance laws not based on Sharia Law have also been <a href="http://muslimvillage.com/2011/04/06/protests-after-bangladesh-government-propose-equal-inheritance-laws/">violently resisted</a>.</em>]</p>
<p>As many Bangladeshi families, including some in my own family can  attest, what this can often lead to is orphaned children in family-based care being treated like second class citizens. They are seen as another  mouth to feed &#8211; but one that neither adds to the family name (because of  lack of adoption) nor has any Sharia Law-based right to the family  wealth.</p>
<div id="attachment_3463" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 474px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/awbm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3463     " src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/awbm.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="603" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A cousin of mine (now grown up and living in America) who lost his father in the Bangladesh War of Liberation. He tried living amongst a conservative Muslim surrogate family in Bangladesh but was treated like a second class citizen. My father stepped in and he ended up living with me as a kid in Canada. For many not as fortunate, orphanages are a preferred alternative given Islamic prohibitions on adoption.</p></div>
<p>The Islamic solution to this problem is the creation of orphanages. But they aren&#8217;t orphanages in the Western sense &#8211; no one is on display waiting for adoption. Rather, these are institutions where the care of orphans become the responsibility (and investment) of an entire community.</p>
<p>One of the complaints aid professionals have against orphanages is that it tends to <a href="http://goodintents.org/orphanages/does-funding-orphanages-create-orphans-3">attract parents who send children</a> they are otherwise unable to afford to raise themselves. While this is true, in the absence of a risk of being &#8220;adopted&#8221;, Islamic &#8220;orphanages&#8221; often function as  boarding schools. In fact, depending on how far away the orphanage is, children with parents can go home on holidays.</p>
<div id="attachment_3466" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3824.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3466 " title="IMG_3824" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_3824.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Given that rules against adoption are part of national law in Bangladesh, even non-Muslim communities like the Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery have created institutions that double as permanent homes for orphans and as a boarding school for children with parents.</p></div>
<p>The problem is that the majority of the (Western-centric) aid professionals and NGOs (that control the bulk of the billions and billions of dollars in the aid system) have deemed orphanages to be a <a href="http://goodintents.org/disaster/the-dos-and-donts-of-disaster-donations-2">bad aid practice</a>. The result hasn&#8217;t stemmed the construction of orphanages. Rather it&#8217;s merely handed a monopoly on the construction, finance, and agenda of orphanages to Islamic groups.</p>
<p>I saw this first hand in Bangladesh. Virtually all of the orphans I encountered in Southern Bangladesh (perhaps a disproportionate amount due to the frequency of natural disasters in Bangladesh) were in Islamic orphanages. These doubled as madrasahs. Children spent all their time learning from the Qu&#8217;ran. None of them had any interaction with non-muslims nor were they taught any math or science.</p>
<div id="attachment_3470" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0373.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3470" title="IMG_0373" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0373.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Students, residents, and orphans of a local Islamic-run Orphanage and Madrasah in Southern Bangladesh. Students had never encountered a non-Muslim until the day they met me. Curriculum includes only learning the Qu&#39;ran everyday. No math. No sciences. No learning about other cultures. Primary donor sets the tone of education.</p></div>
<p>While there is nothing inherently evil or violent about a madrasah, as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-police-clash-with-islamists-enforcing-a-general-strike/2011/07/10/gIQALQSR6H_story.html">Washington Post points out</a>, Islamic parties like Jamaat-e-Islami mobilize through the support through their network of Islamic madrasahs. The funders of such schools/orphanages aren&#8217;t always benevolent. Some provide skewed interpretations of the Qu&#8217;ran while others go as far as to <a href="http://www.allvoices.com/news/2802238/s/30775035-large-arms-cache-seized-from-bhola-madrasa">provide guns</a>.</p>
<pre><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LBw85-Velzg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LBw85-Velzg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></pre>
<p>The bottom line is, by marginalizing orphanages as &#8220;bad aid&#8221;, aid professionals and NGOs have essentially helped to create a feeder network for extremist groups.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Aid is a Field for Professionals Only&#8221;</h3>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="   " src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Snapz-Pro-XScreenSnapz028.png" alt="" width="480" height="237" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A somewhat respected aid blogger (working at a large American NGO) setup a second anonymous Twitter account to call me a &quot;hack&quot; and an &quot;idiot&quot; (among other insults). When I collected evidence and found who he was and privately confronted him, he graciously deleted this secondary account. I still get snark from him on his main account from time to time.</p></div>
<p>While I myself do much of my work by teaming up with <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/04/01/why-save-the-children-sucks/">reputable NGOs</a>, aid professionals have been.. less than kind&#8230; to individuals doing aid and development outside of the NGO system. Their logic is compelling at first blush. Many NGOs have been around for 50 to 75 years. Although not perfect, they have done a lot of learning on how to do things right.</p>
<p>However, for every aid worker that sees &#8220;DIY-aid&#8221; as an amateur intrusion on their turf, there is a mullah or imam who feel the same about aid workers and NGOs. After all, if aid workers can emphasize their industry&#8217;s 75+ years of professional know-how, why can&#8217;t imams, mullahs, and everyday Muslims emphasize Islam&#8217;s 750+ years of jurisprudence, knowledge, and wisdom on helping the poor?</p>
<div id="attachment_3478" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0811.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3478 " title="Aid in Sidr by Muslim Imams" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0811.JPG.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Muslims and others will always be there to help the poor outside of the aid and NGO system. Refusing to accept this reality just creates polarization &amp; conflict.</p></div>
<p>As anyone familiar with Islam will tell you, Islam is technically not a religion. Believers refer to it as a <a href="http://islam1.org/khutub/Defn__of_Deen_&amp;_Islam.htm">deen</a> &#8211; that is a way of life. And, as part of this deen, Islam says much more than just &#8220;give alms to the poor&#8221;. Islam&#8217;s approach to aid and development include a vast array of centuries old protocols, procedures, and know-how that are incorporated and integrated into various Muslim cultures.</p>
<p>I saw this first hand in Bangladesh as Imams on &#8220;Islamic TV&#8221; stressed the procedures and protocols of providing food to the poor down to an almost micro-managed level of detail. One isn&#8217;t allowed to take a cut from the poor&#8217;s share of the food for <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/09/26/rambling-about-charity-overhead/">&#8220;overhead costs&#8221;</a>. In fact, there is even a set of Islamic protocols and procedures to determine who gets to use the <em>skin</em> of the cow for leather.</p>
<div id="attachment_3481" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0274-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3481  " title="IMG_0274 (1)" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0274-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="358" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A group of Muslims perform Qurban - a process of killing an animal to provide food to the poor. The procedures and protocols on how the poor must be helped are quite extensive and have existed for hundreds of years.</p></div>
<p>In fact, even the <em>structure</em> of the modern day aid organization is somewhat antithetical to Islam. Traditionally, in Islam, most businesses and organizations (including charitable organizations called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf">Waqf Trusts</a>) generally consist of three people. And, generally speaking, the organization or business automatically dissolves upon the death and/or exit of one of the members.</p>
<p>With the rise of non-Islamic standard institutions such as NGOs, many Muslims (especially Bangladeshi and Bangladeshi Diaspora) opt to fulfill their Islamic obligations to assist in the aid and development of the poor through (Islamically permissible) private giving. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/09/06/the-bideshi-deshi/">talked about this before</a> and I&#8217;ve also talked about how an individual approach can often be more preferred and trusted.</p>
<pre><object width="500" height="314"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bmXZeDdSCl8?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="314" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bmXZeDdSCl8?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></pre>
<p>The bottom line is, by pushing a narrative that aid and development is the exclusive domain of NGOs and aid professionals, aid professionals have failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of approaches that differ from their own. It&#8217;s resulted in the fueling of <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/09/06/the-bideshi-deshi/">polarization</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8559078.stm">violence</a>, and <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/02/27/negative-attitudes-to-ngos-in-bangladesh/">hatred</a> of NGOs in the Muslim world.</p>
<pre><embed width="500" height="281" src="http://cf.komonews.com/jwplayer56viral/player.swf" bgcolor="0x000000" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="&amp;backcolor=0x000000&amp;bandwidth=382497&amp;controlbar=over&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fkidkbim.s3.amazonaws.com%2FC5D646F0D10B93F58CC6198B9ED77809.mp4&amp;frontcolor=0x9b9b9b&amp;gapro.accountid=UA-9711042-1&amp;gapro.height=371&amp;gapro.pluginmode=FLASH&amp;gapro.visible=true&amp;gapro.width=660&amp;gapro.x=0&amp;gapro.y=0&amp;googima.ad.position=pre&amp;googima.ad.tag=http%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fpfadx%2FKOMO%2FLOCAL%3Btile%3D1%3Bsz%3D320x240%3Bord%3D41790187&amp;googima.height=371&amp;googima.pluginmode=FLASH&amp;googima.position=over&amp;googima.visible=true&amp;googima.width=660&amp;googima.x=0&amp;googima.y=0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.komonews.com%2Fimages%2F100310_world_vision_attack.jpg&amp;title=World+Vision%3A+%27Brutal%2C+senseless%27+killings+were+unprovoked&amp;lightcolor=0x000000&amp;plugins=googima-h%2Csharing-h%2Cgapro-h&amp;screencolor=0x000000&amp;skin=http%3A%2F%2Fcf.komonews.com%2Fjwplayer%2Fova.jwplayer.5x%2Fstormtrooper.zip&amp;sharing.link=http://www.komonews.com/news/87227912.html"></embed></pre>
<p>As a side note, from my own experiences and off-the-record inquiries, I&#8217;ve learned that the <em>anonymous</em> aid bloggers most <em>aggressively</em> pushing the narrative that &#8220;aid is a field for professionals only&#8221; are those working (but not publicly disclosed) in Christian Faith-based NGOs. These organizations tend to have Christian-only hiring practices and have little to no Muslim voices within their NGO (especially at the management level).</p>
<h3>3) &#8220;Giving Stuff is Bad&#8221;</h3>
<div id="attachment_3493" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1587.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3493      " title="IMG_1587.JPG" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1587.JPG.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taken in my mother&#39;s home village. Local community requested help acquiring pens, pencils, and notebooks for students. All were purchased in bazaar&#39;s in my mother&#39;s home village. A small &quot;union&quot; of school supply storekeepers (not just one storekeeper) later confessed to me they jack up the price when World Vision (a Christian NGO which won the legal right to hire only Christians in their US Offices) comes to buy supplies. By the way, to my knowledge, all the storekeepers were Muslim.</p></div>
<p>Especially when I can work in my ancestral home village, I love the  fact that I don&#8217;t have a set plan or program. Instead, I can let locals  set the agenda on what they think needs to be done in order to help  their community or families. Granted, I work on a small scale but I&#8217;ve  seen this approach work with success on a <a href="http://bit.ly/cBobKj">larger scale</a> too.</p>
<p>However, especially since my work is so public, I always get nervous  when a community or family asks for food assistance, help with clothing  and shoes, requests school supplies, complains about charity overhead,  or asks for something like a well (or a school) to be built. It&#8217;s not  that I don&#8217;t want to do it &#8211; but I know doing so will leave me  vulnerable to aid blogger snark.</p>
<p>This is because many aid bloggers <em>hate</em> projects which involve giving &#8220;stuff&#8221; (be it things requested like clothes, shoes, or food) to the poor. Furthermore, many think the model of raising funding for overhead separately is &#8220;bad aid&#8221;. And those that have tried such as <a href="http://www.toms.com">Toms Shoes</a> and <a href="http://www.charitywater.org">Charity: Water</a> have received a lot of snark and <a href="http://goo.gl/6KeZb ">criticism</a> for doing so.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 445px"><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/meowtree/status/23940237438"><img class="  " src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Snapz-Pro-XScreenSnapz007.png" alt="" width="435" height="241" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I tweeted some complements to Charity: Water and their CEO, and this was the reaction from an employee with PLAN International.</p></div>
<p>In many respects, I can empathize with this criticism. After all, many of the critics of Charity: Water or TOMS shoes are from big NGOs which deal in billions of dollars, have decades of experience, and have volumes of data to backup their claims.</p>
<div id="attachment_3497" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 489px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0765.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3497 " title="Feet Injuries" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0765.JPG.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="269" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Feet injuries are one of the most common injuries after a disaster. Shoes and sandals are also not a top purchase item for parents since children grow into new sizes so fast. Taken in 2007 during Cyclone Sidr. It must be noted that while I saw many NGOs operating there, I only saw a Muslim group give out replacement sandals.</p></div>
<p>The thing is much of this data is skewed towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"><em>quantitative</em> research</a>. What does that mean? Well it means it&#8217;s mostly focused on numbers and scientific methodology. It includes sample surveys, large samples, double blind tests, control groups, and other numerical analysis. Sounds good, right?</p>
<p>The problem is that there is a huge bulk of data that this approach excludes. It excludes the centuries of work that the Muslim world has done to help pull people out of poverty. It&#8217;s a data set that is not stored in a survey sample and cannot be learned through scientific testing. Rather we need to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verstehen">verstehen</a> of the local cultural traditions and histories. The only way to get at it is through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research">qualitative</a> &#8211; not quantitative approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_3500" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1474.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3500 " title="Maternal Ancestor School" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1474.JPG.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the many schools one of my great maternal ancestors helped build (I&#39;m told). Most have grown to large multi-story secular government schools. Why have these schools lasted generations when some schools by NGOs close down a few years after construction? Only historical, anthropological, and ethnographic data (not numbers) will reveal the answer.</p></div>
<p>If such an approach were taken than many would realize that some of the longest lasting impacts in the Muslim world has been through providing &#8220;stuff&#8221;. By building schools, drilling wells, providing school supplies. In fact, the history of the Waqf Trusts include building hospitals but also even simply just providing the mattresses for the hospital beds.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that, by putting a bias towards quantitative data and marginalizing giving &#8220;stuff&#8221; as &#8220;handouts&#8221; many NGOs and aid professionals ignore the bulk of Islam&#8217;s centuries old contribution to aid and development. It&#8217;s a contribution that shows a history of providing material goods and &#8220;stuff&#8221; which have <em>successfully</em> transformed communities, individuals, and families.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have a cliche to pimp. There is no one solution to this problem. Instead, I&#8217;d like to offer the following thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring context doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li>Taking a neutral stance doesn&#8217;t result in a neutral impact.</li>
<li>A consensus on aid among aid professionals doesn&#8217;t mean there is consensus on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I think there is an implicit assumption by many aid professionals and aid bloggers that, as the <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/01/13/why-i-want-to-go-to-davos/">digital divide closes</a> and the poor are able to <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/03/30/when-the-poor-speak-for-themselves/">speak for themselves</a>, that minority voices will join the discussion on aid and development. This is simply not true.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 462px"><a href="http://twitter.com/TalesFromthHood/status/23947511191"><img class="  " src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Snapz-Pro-XScreenSnapz017.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I am ever grateful that the reaction to my work by Bangladeshi villagers, Bangladeshi diaspora, and the greater Muslim community has been the polar opposite of some of the reactions I&#39;ve received from aid bloggers.</p></div>
<p>As I&#8217;ve talked about before, those who are the most conservative in their Islamic beliefs would not find the tone and pattern of aid blogger discussions to be conducive to <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/03/23/lying-in-aid-development/">Islamic codes of conduct</a>. Snark and sarcasm for example, to a devout and conservative Muslim, are sins. Sins equivalent in religious significance &#8211; in some cases &#8211; to cannibalism. Many will simply avoid entering conversations where such are present.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason, even though I blog about aid and development, I go to great lengths to point out that I don&#8217;t consider myself an aid blogger. Because I want to make it clear to my friends in Bangladesh and any Muslims that support my work that I do not condone the snark, sarcasm, and personal attacks in the discussion of aid &amp; development.</p>
<p>Rather, I hope this conversation changes. When it does, and when that impact percolates to the reality on the ground, the nexus between aid work and Islamic extremism will change with it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I recently stumbled on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/blogging-poverty-tourism-developing-countries">this article</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/emmylee04/status/86168255542206465">h/t</a>)&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_3392" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 485px"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/blogging-poverty-tourism-developing-countries"><img class="size-full wp-image-3392" title="Click to Read" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RowanBangladesh.png" alt="Click to Read" width="475" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Article from The Guardian</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">I agree with a lot that is said here. In fact, I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/08/22/world-vision-vloggers/">similar stuff</a> myself (and <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/09/06/the-bideshi-deshi/">got grief</a> for it).

But, it also got me thinking, what do Bangladeshis think of my work?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what I found in a five minute search:</p>

<p>For someone who normally has a lot to say about this topic &#8211; I find myself speechless.</p>

<p>Meet Nathan Kotylak. A few weeks ago Nathan was a rising star. He was the best water polo player in his school, he was training with the Canadian national water polo team, he earned a scholarship to one of Canada’s best universities, and he was on track to be one of Canada’s Olympic athletes in a few years time.</p>
<p>But that all changed in about the time it takes to make a tweet.</p>
<p><span id="more-3376"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3378" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3378 " title="NK2" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/NK2.jpeg" alt="" width="480" height="309" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nathan Kotylak - Lighting a Police Car on Fire</p></div>
<p>Nathan decided to do something stupid. In this case, he decided to take part in the violence that ensued during the recent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13788491">Vancouver riots</a>. If this was but a handful of years ago, Nathan could have slept soundly knowing his crimes were hidden amongst the crowd, confusion, and other culprits.</p>
<p>But we live in a connected society &#8211; one where there is little or no digital divide. In the case of the Vancouver riots, this meant that for every rioter there were at least 2 or 3 bystanders filming, photographer, tweeting, Facebook posting, and otherwise documenting and sharing images and details.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In no small part due to these socially connected lenses, Nathan Kotylak soon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPQOQsLUW60">turned himself in</a>. His attempts to salvage his reputation have somewhat been undermined by the ever growing deluge of images &amp; footage showing him seemingly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NTtpoRB4ss">starting other fires</a>, seemingly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io08deCT0-A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m17s">shooting fireworks in crowds</a>, and seemingly <a href="http://www.examiner.com/canada-headlines-in-canada/new-video-shows-possible-sexual-assault-on-female-rioter-by-nathan-kotylak">sexually assaulting women</a>.</p>
<p>While definitely not the only trouble-maker and not the only riot leader, Nathan Kotylak deserves all the hardships and broken dreams that are coming his way. But, in many respects, Nathan is merely the latest to feel the brunt of the on-coming storm that is the social lens.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3380" title="SONY DSC" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/filmnk.jpeg" alt="" width="482" height="311" /><a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/08/20/1410217/Apple-Patents-Remotely-Disabling-Jailbroken-Phones"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/08/20/1410217/Apple-Patents-Remotely-Disabling-Jailbroken-Phones">Barring advances</a> which limit our freedom to share information with each other, it is becoming increasingly easier to put a spotlight on thing we don’t like. It can be an employee <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDLrXp2KHy0&amp;feature=channel_video_title">acting as a whistleblower</a>, a customer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIF-R2lzek">complaining</a>, or a concerned citizen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Ev_XnNrl0">documenting a hooligan</a>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that the next great frontier of the social lens won’t be the next riot, or the next whistle-blowing employee, or the the next complaining customer. The next target of the connected camera phone will come from the poor in the developing world &#8211; and what they have to say about NGOs.</p>
<div id="attachment_3381" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzi2BNkyq7s"><img class="size-full wp-image-3381 " title="IMG_4308" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4308.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In my travels in my charity work in Bangladesh, I&#39;ve often been filmed by locals. None of these phones, however, are connected to the internet. What happens to NGOs when that changes?</p></div>
<p>I say this as an ethnic Bangladeshi. For decades, for as long as NGOs have existed, there have been complaints about the quality of aid delivered, complaints of the misconduct of aid workers, and complaints about the amount of corruption and inefficiency in the aid system.</p>
<p>As part of this project, I’ve demanded a lot from any NGO that I team up with. I’ve demanded the right to film NGO staff anytime they are in public, I’ve demanded the right to upload content without pre-approval, and I’ve demanded to be more involved than controlled and curated field visits.</p>
<p>I have teamed up with many NGOs but only one has been  consistently been brave enough to say yes to these terms. That  organization is <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/">Save the Children</a>.  In fact, in my last trip with them, I gave them additional headaches by  randomly selecting villages to conduct impromptu interviews.  The only lead time Save the Children had was the time it took to get the consent to film the families.</p>
<div id="attachment_3382" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 492px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3382 " title="IMG_6696" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_6696.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="321" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I interview a beneficiary of a Save the Children health worker program. Save the Children was only given 24 hours advanced notice after I selected one of 96 villages to go to. They were only told on the day of the trip which beneficiary I intended to interview and only given enough time to request permission to film from the family. Save the Children staff were also not informed what questions I would be asking. And, whenever possible, Save the Children staff stayed out of earshot of my interview. Despite these hoops, I couldn&#39;t find a single beneficiary who had a complaint.</p></div>
<p>Understandably, very few charities or NGOs have enough confidence in their work and/or enough trust in an outsider to agree to something like this. But this is a moot point. You can ban and bar all the <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/06/17/beth-kanter-gets-it/">free agents</a> you want, but eventually villagers themselves will start filming, tweeting, posting, and sharing.</p>
<p>If charities and NGOs start making steps to be comfortable with being under the social lens, it will be easier to avoid a Nathan Kotylak moment. After all, Nathan may have done something wrong but jumping on him was also a catharsis for a frustrated public.</p>
<p>As an ethnic Bangladeshi, I assure you, that frustration <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/02/27/negative-attitudes-to-ngos-in-bangladesh/">pales in comparison</a> to what many feel about NGOs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->Earlier this week, I got a letter from a young lady who had interned with an NGO in Bangladesh. With her permission, I am sharing excerpts of her email below:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a female Canadian who spent a summer in Dhaka and it took me over 2 years to regain my ability to think and function like the typical North American female. Even still, it&#8217;s a challenge.</p>
<p>Your youtube videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFLg57CnHfI" target="_blank">Eve Teasing</a> &amp; Purdah, especially the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19vfFRM-QA" target="_blank">conversation with Nirjhar</a>, were all too familiar.  No one prepared me for this aspect of my trip to &#8220;volunteer/intern&#8221; for [OMITTED] in Dhaka.  I knew I was going to a largely Islamic nation, with a great deal of modesty expectations for females.  I had no idea that because I was young (21), unmarried, and female, (and the coveted white-skinned!), that [OMITTED] would pretty much hide me away in a room for the duration of my 90 day visa because it was too much of a hassle to escort (felt like babysit) me around to go anywhere at all, and it seemed as though they also somehow considered me incapable of doing anything.  At the end of my stay in Dhaka (which felt like a lifetime spending 80% of it in a single room), I was told to come back someday after I was married and maybe they would have work for me.</p>
<p>I returned to [OMITTED] being unable to go out in public places without this overwhelming fear of men staring at me, with vivid memories of males pointing and talking about me in words I couldn&#8217;t understand but could sense were not exactly kind-hearted, and taking millions of photos of me with their mobiles. I was unable to bare my shoulders or ankles. To this day, I still wear scarves 75% of the time to add an extra layer of coverage to my front because I otherwise feel so incredibly indecent and ashamed. It is a constant battle to look males in the eye when I talk to them. It took over a year before I actually felt safe while going out after sundown by myself.</p>
<p>The Dhaka experience was incredibly&#8230; oppressive. It killed my heart to know that Bangladeshi women live through even worse every single day of their lives. I wish I knew of something I could do. I would go back if I had some sense that I could be of any use; but the result of my last trip gave me the impression that my presence is only a burden and therefore not wanted, only my money. Which as a student, I still have very little of.  So in the meantime I fund a Kiva loan every month, am slowly finishing my education, and ultimately aspire to get a decent enough job so I can give half my money away to the most respectable NGOs/foreign aid organizations I can find. But this plan leaves me feeling like I&#8217;m copping out, and just handing over money for other people to do the hands-on work.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I have more respect for Nirjhar the aid worker than words can describe.  And I hope and pray that maybe someday I, too, will have even a small portion of the courage that she has.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked for her permission to post this letter because, while I am sure there are tons of women who have had great experiences interning in Bangladesh, this is by no means an outlier.</p>
<p>There is a lot I like about Bangladeshi culture and tradition. For example, I believe local non-NGO <a href="http://uncultured.com/2010/09/06/the-bideshi-deshi/" target="_blank">ways and approaches</a> to helping the poor are just as valid (if not more so) than foreign institutional and professional methods.</p>
<p>But not every facet of Bangladeshi culture, habits, and tradition need to persist. And this is a prime example.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Check out my friend (and personal hero) <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/author/arabbani/" target="_blank">Anika Rabbani</a>. As a guy, I will never fully understand the kind of hurdles she faces in her job.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My dad probably forgets saying this &#8211; but I never did. Years back, he confessed to me that one of the reasons he left Bangladesh and settled elsewhere is because he never wanted my mother to be mistreated. Until I heard what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFLg57CnHfI" target="_blank">these women</a> had to say, I never knew how real my dad&#8217;s concern was:</p>
<pre><object width="500" height="311"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CFLg57CnHfI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CFLg57CnHfI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_teasing" target="_blank">Eve teasing</a> is a euphemism to describe forms of verbal and physical abuse by men against women. Verbally it can range from simple cat calls and overzealous wooing to really <em>nasty</em> and sexually explicit and derogatory comments. Physically it can range from grabbing a girl&#8217;s hand to groping and molesting them in public.</p>
<p>What got me is that &#8211; despite this being well known amongst aid and development professionals &#8211; no one has really done a decent job of covering this issue on YouTube or other &#8220;social media&#8221;. I don&#8217;t mean to say there aren&#8217;t videos with tons of views about this issue.</p>
<p>But most of what is online is usually G-rated re-enactments of eve teasing which make it seem like childish flirting. There are also heavy handed PSAs by police and local media which makes it seem like it&#8217;s being treated with prejudice and zero-tolerance&#8230; which would be nice but doesn&#8217;t reflect reality.</p>
<p>Despite all these videos online about eve teasing, I really didn&#8217;t find one where women could <em>just talk</em> about this problem and share their opinions. And it&#8217;s not like Bangladeshi women are a homogeneous group &#8211; as you can see in the video &#8211; there is a diversity of thought on this problem.</p>
<p>Right now, this video has about 3,500 views. That may not seem like much but that&#8217;s nearly <em>twice</em> the views that UNICEF was able to gather on this issue over the past <strong>eight months</strong>. Maybe this issue won&#8217;t go viral &#8211; but at least I could give this issue a slightly bigger platform than it had yesterday.</p>

Anyone who knows me knows I&#8217;d be the <em>last</em> person to say that <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org" target="_blank">Save the Children</a> sucks. In fact, I didn&#8217;t have the heart to even <em>fake</em> trash talk them for April Fools&#8217; Day.

<p><span id="more-3218"></span></p>
<p>Growing up, I never heard of Save the Children. Here in Canada it&#8217;s eclipsed by the much better known (but smaller) organization called <a href="http://www.freethechildren.com" target="_blank">Free the Children</a>. In America, I&#8217;ve seen people confuse it for <a href="http://www.feedthechildren.org" target="_blank">Feed the Children</a> &#8211; an organization whose <a href="http://www.valleynewslive.com/Global/story.asp?S=13914760&amp;clienttype=printable" target="_blank">founder</a> is accused of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-6037886-504083.html" target="_blank">taking bribes and hoarding pornography</a>.</p>

<p>I learned about Save the Children through Bangladeshis. What surprised me the most was how positively Save the Children was regarded. It&#8217;s surprising because Bangladesh is a country where there is a great deal of skepticism and even <a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/02/27/negative-attitudes-to-ngos-in-bangladesh/" target="_blank"><em>hatred</em></a> for NGOs.</p>
<div id="attachment_3085" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 367px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/2011/02/27/negative-attitudes-to-ngos-in-bangladesh/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3085" title="image.jpg.scaled1000" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image.jpg.scaled1000-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="357" height="238" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Aid is an industry... and it&#39;s not the poor people who profit.&quot; - a common sentiment among many Bangladeshis of all income levels. Many villagers also have a saying that &quot;NGOs taka kai fellay&quot; or &quot;Charities eat the cash&quot;</p></div>
<p>I was able to see what people liked about Save the Children first hand in 2007. Just before Thanksgiving, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Sidr" target="_blank">Cyclone Sidr</a> hit Bangladesh. The devastation was immense. I was able to volunteer with an international NGO and head to the disaster area to see what I could do to help and report.</p>
<p>What I saw when I got there will haunt me forever. I&#8217;m not just talking about the death and destruction. Rather, some of the most shocking things I saw were the questionable and sometimes unethical conduct of seemingly prestigious NGOs and charities.</p>
<div id="attachment_3234" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 359px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3234   " title="still" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/still.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="285" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of a rough cellphone video I took. This NGO (which I will not name) was purifying water fast enough so there was never a line. But they stopped giving out water for several hours for a line to form so that a VIP could have a photo-op. More over, instead of normal procedure, disaster victims were forced to wedge themselves and squeeze between a small gap between two buildings (seen near top center) in order collect their water bottles. Why? Because the VIP didn&#39;t want to leave base camp.</p></div>
<p>I can&#8217;t mention names (without being sued to oblivion) but one award-winning international NGO decided to stop giving out clean water for several hours so that a line would form. They wanted a line to form because some VIP wanted to have a photo op handing clean water to cyclone victims.</p>
<p>At one point, I was able to temporarily get my hands on the DSLR of a UK-based NGO. I downloaded the photos and &#8211; to my shock &#8211; found photos taken at point blank range of crying children as they were getting surgery without anesthesia. Their pained faces, taken perhaps, to be used in future guilt ads.</p>
<div id="attachment_3235" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 481px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DSLRUK.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3235     " title="DSLRUK" src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DSLRUK-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="311" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Downloaded from a DSLR of a charity based out of the UK. This photo was taken by sticking a camera in a child&#39;s face as he was getting surgery and first aid without anesthesia. Now I know where this organization gets its images of crying children to use in its ads.</p></div>
<p>I also found an incredible amount of NGOs which were unwilling to share anything with other NGOs. Not even <em>information</em>. Many NGOs pressured me to be silent (and not blog or speak) about where and when relief line riots broke out. They feared they would look bad and wanted me to shut up.</p>
<div id="attachment_3237" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 404px"><a href="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1008.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3237 " src="http://uncultured.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1008.JPG-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;If I want something off the record - I simply won&#39;t let it come out of my mouth&quot; - Nick Downie of the Save the Children Alliance</p></div>
<p>In the midst of this I discovered Save the Children. I got to spend but one day with them. In that one day, I learned this was an NGO I would want to support and endorse for the rest of my life. And it all started because I met one of their employees by the name of Nick Downie.</p>
<p>Nick had a simple policy: if it came out of his mouth &#8211; it was on the record. This was the first time I encountered such transparency in an NGO. Of course, Nick had rules on how long I could film children that were under the care of Save the Children (and how to do so <em>respectfully</em>) &#8211; but everything else was an open book.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve followed what I&#8217;ve been doing with Save the Children you know that, since then, I&#8217;ve been fortunate to do a lot of projects with them. I&#8217;ve teamed up with them to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kJEGvY6_QY" target="_blank">help in disaster relief</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJubQzKYMGg" target="_blank">provide lasting clean water</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dsjtJMqsE" target="_blank">rebuild a school</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_WtdxvMcpE" target="_blank">support health workers</a>.</p>

<p>Save the Children estimates that, by the end of 2011, thanks to you guys I will have helped over 14,000 children in Bangladesh in over 100 villages. That&#8217;s not even including work I&#8217;ve done with other organizations. And all I am is just some guy (not an employee) with a blog, a camera, a cellphone, and internet connection.</p>

<p>What I can tell you is that, in every village I have been to and every project I have done with Save the Children, my respect for the organization grows. And whether it&#8217;s April 1st or not, if you&#8217;re in the mood to donate to a charity, Save the Children should be on the top of of your list of charities to <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/uncultured/charliesheen" target="_blank">donate to</a>.</p>
