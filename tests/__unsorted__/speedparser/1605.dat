		<title type="text">Thursday 11th August 2011</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a lot of thinking about the UK riots over these last few days. Several public figures, including the Prime Minister, have stated that the participants are “mindless criminals”; but while some are undoubtedly using these events to serve their own purposes, I can’t accept that as a catch-all explanation. It’s far too easy to write all of this off as groundless criminality, because that means we don’t have to look any further. With very few exceptions, criminals aren’t born: they are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our politicians—&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our politicians, not just the government—seem completely disconnected from large swathes of the population, evidenced by their constant appeals to parents to check up on their children; seemingly unaware that many of those parents lost the respect of their kids a long time ago. Many young people feel they are being ignored, and this is their moment to shout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said: violence and arson can never be justified, under any circumstances. Feelings of powerlessness and the perception of injustice are powerful incentives to take action, but this selfish anarchy will only attract the wrong kind of attention. I can’t and don’t pretend to know the first thing about growing up in an inner city borough, but I do know this: destroying livelihoods and homes is not only unconscionable, but also reinforces poisonous stereotypes among the people who live outside these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am worried about what this will do to our country. My fear is that the only beneficiaries will be racist, hate-filled bigots like the BNP, who are currently watching news footage of black teenagers stealing electronics and burning cars; rubbing their hands together with glee at the thought of all the reactionary votes they will be able to lure from frightened constituents in the next election. The fact that there are plenty of white kids involved will, I expect, be conveniently forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; more to these events than just senseless opportunism—and for the sake of my own wavering faith in humanity, I have to hope that there is—then please, young Britons: don’t use technology to organise riots, but instead something much more powerful and memorable. If you really want to bring about change, to be listened to: this is not the way. Get the people on your side. Force the government to hear you, not with violence, but with numbers and reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worked before.  &lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is anyone except the government even &lt;em&gt;remotely&lt;/em&gt; surprised at the large number of universities which want to charge the maximum tuition fee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that I placed £9,000 on a table in front of you, said “help yourself”, and left. You can have all of the money, and you&amp;#8217;re completely within your rights to take it. I&amp;#8217;d rather you didn&amp;#8217;t take all of it. But you can, if you want, and there will be no repercussions for you if you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll just have more money.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="text">In Which I Get Annoyed at Couriers</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, in the interest of fairness I would like to point out that logistics is a very difficult problem. Throughout &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, we have struggled with the safe and reliable transport and delivery of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that: it is now 2011. We have fast motor vehicles and good roads to drive them on. Not to mention trains; aeroplanes; computers; GPS; satellite navigation, mobile phones and above all, hundreds of years of experience. &lt;em&gt;Surely&lt;/em&gt; by now receiving packages should be relatively painless?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Consignment Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It may take up to 48 hours for details of your consignment to appear on the courier&amp;#8217;s web site.&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;48 hours until I can track the parcel—by which time I am &lt;em&gt;already supposed to have had it in my possession for 24 hours&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not really “tracking” if the only possible statuses are “Tracking Information Not Available” and “Delivered”, is it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Delivery To Your Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Sorry we missed you, somehow, even though you literally haven’t moved all day due to the fear that we’d try and deliver—as usual—in the two minute window where you nipped out to get some milk. Here’s a card with a phone number that gets you through to somebody who has no ability to help you in the slightest, along with some directions to our closest depot, conveniently situated in Azerbaijan.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Delivery To Your Work Address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Sorry we missed you, somehow, even though you were at your office between 9am and 5pm as usual, waiting for your package to arrive. Because the address you specified contained a company name¹, we tried to deliver either at 5:30 am when nobody was awake yet, let alone at work, or at 7pm when the office had shut. However, under no circumstances would we deliver at those times to your home address—because that would actually be quite handy.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Arranging Redelivery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, I have a card here that says you tried to deliver a package today, but I missed it—I’d like to arrange redelivery to a different address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, no problem, do you have a consignment number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it’s DVCOJ909809823070111.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep:&lt;/strong&gt; (clicking, typing): Sorry, it’s gone back out on the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; So what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep:&lt;/strong&gt; It means he’ll try and deliver it to the same address again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to be there. As it hasn’t been delivered yet, why don’t you just tell him to deliver to the new address instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not how it works. I can’t contact the driver.² We have to try to deliver to the old address again and fail before I can issue him new instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; So let me get this straight: instead of the package coming straight to the new address I just gave you, the driver has to make a completely wasted trip—to deliver a package to someone &lt;em&gt;we now all know won’t be there to receive it&lt;/em&gt;—before returning the package to the depot and trying to deliver to the new address on Monday, where by then I won’t be either?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I feel like saying:&lt;/strong&gt; AAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHH THE RAAAAAAGE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I actually say:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. Ok, just keep it there when he gets back, and I’ll come and collect it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene: a cold, desolate industrial estate somewhere in Azerbaijan. A battered exterior door bears a piece of paper which reads: “Please Ring Bell And Wait.” I ring it. What seems like a full fifteen minutes later, I hear movement inside. An extremely pissed-off looking woman appears and opens the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, I’ve come to pick up a package? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hand her the card. She disappears without a word. What seems like another fifteen minutes later passes; she reappears, minus package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warehouse Lady:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry—it’s gone back out on the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; padding-top: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. As far as I am able to tell, this is how it works.&lt;br /&gt;
2. WHY THE HELL NOT?

		<title type="text">Plastic Santas</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Within my own relatively recent memory, children would go door-to-door singing carols and handing out small seasonal treats to the people they sang for. Sometimes they would ask for a small donation for a charity; most of the time they were just doing it for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a car with some plastic Santas on its roof drove down my street, blaring out offensively loud Christmas songs from a cheap P.A. system, while a small army of high-viz jacketed charity volunteers knocked on every door asking for bank details. No-one is singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who says the spirit of Christmas is dead?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="text">Things It Took Me Far Too Long To Realise #3: Laziness Usually Hurts</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all try to save ourselves time and exertion by not doing reasonably important things which require a &lt;em&gt;bare minimum&lt;/em&gt; of effort in the first place. You will recognise these examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I need a glass of water, but the light switch is &lt;em&gt;miles&lt;/em&gt; away. I&amp;#8217;m sure if I just start walking toward the kitchen, my eyes will adjust to the darkness and I won&amp;#8217;t hit my kneecaps on an&amp;#8230;” &lt;em&gt;[SOUND OF AMBULANCE SIRENS]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The outside of this bowl of soup is scalding hot. I could get out a plate or tray to carry it on, but that&amp;#8217;s all the way right in front of me in this cupboard. I&amp;#8217;ll just run down the hallway throwing it lightly from hand to hand—that way it&amp;#8217;ll never get hot enough to bur&amp;#8230;” &lt;em&gt;[SOUND OF AMBULANCE SIRENS]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of opening the toolbox and picking out the Stanley knife, to save time I&amp;#8217;ll just crack the lid a little and rummage around blindly inside in the dark until I feel the ha&amp;#8230;” &lt;em&gt;[SOUND OF AMBULANCE SIRENS]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rest my case.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="text">What's that? More tax, you say?</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It turns out that due to the incompetence of HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, millions of people now suddenly owe quite a large lump of extra tax. Which means paying it off, to the tune of £100 per month on average—in the middle of a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am telling you right now: after everything that&amp;#8217;s happened recently, if I get a letter from HMRC asking for extra tax payments, they will get one back from me that just says “&lt;strong&gt;FUCK RIGHT OFF&lt;/strong&gt;”, in 100 point bold type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a plan: as our hard-earned cash &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; saved most of the big banks and financial institutions—who incidentally are &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8516847.stm"&gt;still paying out &lt;em&gt;ludicrous&lt;/em&gt; bonuses&lt;/a&gt;—from their own idiocy, how about &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; pay this extra tax bill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But obviously, that&amp;#8217;s never going to happen, is it. So I guess the people of Britain will just have to suck it up. &lt;em&gt;Again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <entry>
		<title type="text">Public Transport</title>
                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a pretty “green” person. I grew up in Cornwall and now live in Devon, which I think has made me even more conscious of the environment and what we have to lose, because the South West is such a beautiful part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reuse or recycle the bulk of my household waste, to the point where I’m now only throwing out a single bag of non-recyclables every 3-4 weeks. I also try to conserve energy where possible; simple things like turning off the lights when I leave a room, turning electrical appliances off at the wall rather than leaving them on standby and only filling the kettle with as much water as I actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to blow my own trumpet, though. There’s still one way in which my carbon footprint could be &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; reduced: if I was able to get rid of my car, in which I drive more than three hundred miles a week. Sadly there’s just no feasible way I can do that, because public transport in the UK is—generally speaking—inconvenient, overpriced and unreliable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try and back up that slightly controversial statement, using my own circumstances to illustrate my point. I’m perhaps not the best example, as I have a rather unusual commute; I live in a large city and work nearly thirty miles away in a tiny rural village, but let&amp;#8217;s plough ahead anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to commute using public transport, I’d get a train from Plymouth to Newton Abbot, then a bus from there to Chudleigh—and obviously vice-versa to get home. The cheapest train ticket I could find is the Anytime Day Return, which is £10*. I’m not sure how much the bus is (because their web site has no fare listings for some reason) but we’ll be conservative and call it £3 each way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s £16 a day, five days a week—plus I’d have to get up over an hour earlier and arrive home more than an hour later. In contrast, I’ve worked out that driving to and from work every day costs me approximately £5.50, and takes about 35-40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up then: using a car, getting to work costs me around £110 per month. Using public transport, it would cost me a wallet-battering £240 per month. Even with a margin for error built in to take into account that those tickets might not be the very cheapest, it’s still more than &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the cost—plus horribly inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: I wanted to visit an exhibition in Bristol, which is about a 250-mile round trip. In my car that would cost around £25, plus a tenner for parking, totalling £35. The cheapest train fare I could get (for a Saturday that was sooner than two months away) was a single each way, totalling £38.50. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too different, you might say; perhaps worth the little extra money for a more comfortable journey. But that’s only if I want to leave Plymouth at 9am and leave Bristol again at around four. Either side of those times, the prices increase dramatically, sometimes by more than thirty percent. Why is that? How can it cost the train company twelve pounds more to get me to Bristol if I leave at 9:33 than if I leave at 8:52? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that it doesn’t—but these are deemed ‘peak’ times, which means that the train companies are trying to encourage us to take other, less busy trains. But charging much, much more at peak times makes no sense whatsoever. By doing this you drive customers away, word spreads that “trains are expensive” and before you know it, everyone is travelling by car again. I realise that there’s only a finite amount of train capacity, but I can’t imagine that the Saturday 9:33 to Bristol would be rammed to the gills while the 8:52 would be empty, were they the same price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an almost ridiculous example: my work colleagues and I visited a trade exhibition in London a couple of years ago. To cut a long story short; we ended up hiring a limousine to take us there and back, because it was significantly cheaper than five return train tickets. That’s right. A &lt;em&gt;limousine&lt;/em&gt; was cheaper than the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast, Good or Cheap. Pick two.&lt;/em&gt; An old business maxim, which basically underlines the fact that you simply can’t have everything. Fair enough, but in terms of public transport, what we have in this country is &lt;em&gt;Slow, Bad and Expensive&lt;/em&gt;. If I get a bus to my destination it is often late, takes way longer, is less comfortable and more expensive than driving. Where’s the incentive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even looking at the major cities like London, our public transport systems seem positively archaic compared to many other countries. When I visited Berlin, it seemed as though there was hardly any traffic on the roads. I’m not sure exactly why this was, but if I had to guess, I’d say that it’s because their public transport is so good that driving around the city just seems like way more hassle than it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems are &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. Trains every 5-10 minutes, to pretty much anywhere in the city; cheap, clean, fast and always on time. The German inter-city rail systems are excellent too, for the same reasons. I can’t comment on the bus service; I never needed to catch one because the trains were so good, but I suspect they would have run along the same lines. In fact, Berlin’s public transport is actually an exception to the maxim mentioned earlier—and because of its value and efficiency, Berliners use it heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, though, are we supposed to encourage more UK drivers to use public transport, when in most cases there are absolutely no advantages for them if they do so? If a bus or train journey was way cheaper than driving, people might be more prepared to put up with the longer travel times. If it’s more comfortable, or faster (or both), most of us don’t mind paying a little extra. But when it’s not faster, nicer &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; cheaper&amp;#8230; well, you can see where this is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem facing transport operators is quite apparent: how do they keep prices down, when there aren’t enough people using the service to support low prices by volume—because the prices are currently too high? Confused? Sorry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly don’t have the answer, but it’s something we really need to think about. Rural areas need good public transport just as much as, if not more so than big cities; however, I can see that the inherent problems with supply and demand are a big obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;* A small disclaimer: I’m sure that there are probably rail cards and/or discounts for bulk bookings that would bring these prices down, but the fact that I couldn’t find them anywhere on the rail operator’s web site just backs up my argument.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s bad enough that the England team crashed out of the 2010 World Cup, but to add to the misery we now have to listen to months of analysis and argument about “where it all went wrong” (a phrase that makes the incorrect assumption that “it” was “right” in recent history).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the comments are so inane it&amp;#8217;s ridiculous; this morning I heard the following on the radio (quoted from memory):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pundit:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we need to look at the team from the ground up and examine the way we play, because something is fundamentally not right with England. 
&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; So do you think that the 4-1 defeat to Germany is an example of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; it bloody is! Why would you even ask that question? What&amp;#8217;s he going to say? “No, I think our squad of world-class millionaire superstars getting made to look like a bunch of drunk schoolboys is exactly the way we should carry on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran out of intelligent things to say about this World Cup campaign about five minutes after the Germany game ended. Please—everyone—just shut up about it now. Maybe if we stop over-analysing our national team to such a ridiculous degree they will just slink away into obscurity and learn how to be football players again.&lt;/p&gt;

                <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was in a graffiti-covered multi storey car park in Brooklyn, which had been turned into some kind of headquarters, full of computers. There was a big group of people with me; we all had weird organic guns, which were orange for some reason. The only person in the group (gang, army?) I recognised was Jeremy Clarkson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all went outside and walked toward a convoy of camper vans, which were parked on the other side of some wasteland. As we crossed, a sniper started shooting from somewhere behind us, taking out most of the group—I can remember Jeremy crying over the body of a felled comrade. I got into one of the vans; suddenly I was in a club bathroom, having a threesome with two girls who were both &lt;em&gt;part bird&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What. The. Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
