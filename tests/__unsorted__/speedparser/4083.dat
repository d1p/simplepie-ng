<p>Hats off to Jonathan Eisen for hosting this activity on his blog. (I&#8217;ll keep mine on, thank you. It&#8217;s raining cats and dogs here right now).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2011/08/26/of-mice-and-men-or-revisiting-the-ortholog-conjecture/">posted a discussion</a> about two papers that challenged the ortholog conjecture. Briefly, both papers stated that orthologs may not be such great predictors for molecular function. One <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073">study</a> from  Indiana University by  has shown that paralogs may be better predictors than orthologs for molecular function. Or, at the very least, paralogs should not be excluded as predictors. This paper has generated quite a bit of <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2011/09/some-links-on-ortholog-conjecture-paper.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheTreeOfLife+%28The+Tree+of+Life%29" target="_blank">interest</a> and <a href="http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~hahnlab/MediaFiles/OrthologConjecture/F1000.html">controversy</a>. Consequently, Eisen has invited Matthew Hahn, the lead author to <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2011/09/special-guest-post-discussion.html" target="_blank">write about &#8220;the story behind the story&#8221;</a> in Eisen&#8217;s well-read blog. The <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2011/09/special-guest-post-discussion.html" target="_blank">post is a great read</a>, and has generated an animated discussion in the comments area. You do need to clear quite a bit of time to go through both Hahn&#8217;s guest post and the comment thread: the topic is a rather complex one, and as explained in the comments thread, one problem is that the &#8216;ortholog conjecture&#8217; itself seems to be not well-defined.</p>
<p>I kept checking in to Eisen&#8217;s blog to read the elongating comment thread. It seems that now a special session on the topic may be in the works for the <a href="http://www.smbe2012.org/">2012 annual meeting of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution</a> following this discussion. So great to see such an involved community getting together.</p>

<p>The thing is, the game also has a great soundtrack, which introduced me to a band called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koop_(band)" target="_blank">Koop</a>. Their music alternates between eerie ambient and big-band-ish. They may have a big-band sound, but Koop is just two guys, Magnus Zingmark and Oscar Simonsson. Their sound is completely sampled, from thousands of different sources. The result is, well, judge for yourself:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An original viral (or rather, fungal and bacterial) marketing campaign for the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/" target="_blank">Contagion</a>. Although the film tells the story of a fictional viral outbreak, the marketers of Warner Brothers Canada kept it in the realm of microbiology by teaming up with 25 microbiologists and creating what is probably the first agar-plated billboard, which they placed in a storefront in Toronto. The bacteria and mold were plated and grew in the letters, but it looks like contaminants formed their own random colonies, purposefully creating a rather eerie effect. Thanks to Zack Moss, a student in my lab, for pointing me to this. More details in the <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Bacterial+billboard+brings+culture+Hollywood+marketing/5390504/story.html" target="_blank">Vancouver Sun</a>. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://chevreux.org/projects_mira.html" target="_blank">MIRA</a> is a really cool sequence assembly software, developed and maintained by <a href="http://chevreux.org/" target="_blank">Bastien Chevreux</a>. MIRA has a large and active community, led by the funny and gracious Bastien, for whom no problem is too small, or too large.</p>
<p>Recently MIRA seemed to have developed a stochastic bug, one of those which are a serious headache to track down. Bastein called upon the MIRA community to help him. A couple of weeks ago, the &#8220;bug&#8221; was resolved to everyone relief. It was not a bug at all, but &#8230; well, I&#8217;ll let you read Bastien&#8217;s letter. Probably th funniest and geekiest error report I have seen since, well, ever. Reproduced here from the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/archive/mira_talk" target="_blank">mira_talk</a> email list with Bastien&#8217;s permission. <b>WARNING:</b> fairly geeky and fairly long. Not for everyone. But if you, like me, enjoy a good story travails of extreme bug hunting, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. (Because we have all been there, although personally I don&#8217;t recall encountering a problem <i>that</i> frustrating). Teaser: it was not a bug.</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><br />
Dear all,</p>
<p>my warmest thanks to the numerous people who all donated time and computing power to hunt down a &#8220;bug&#8221; (see http://www.freelists.org/post/mira_talk/Call-for-help-bughunting) which. in the end, turned out to be a RAM defect on my development machine.</p>
<p>This is the story on how the problem got nailed. It involves lots of hot electrons, a lot less electrons without spin which keel over, the end of a hunt for invisibugs of the imaginary sort, 454, mutants (but no zombies), Illumina, some spider monkeys, PacBio, a chat with Sherlock and, of course, an anthropomorphed star.</p>
<p>In short: don&#8217;t read if you&#8217;ve got more interesting things to do on a Friday morning or afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Life&#8217;s a rollercoaster and there are days &#8211; or weeks &#8211; where morale is on a pretty hefty ride: ups and downs in fast succession &#8230; and the occasional looping here and there.</p>
<p>Today was a day where I had &#8211; the first time ever &#8211; ups and downs occuring absolutely simultaneously. Something which is physically impossible, I know, but don&#8217;t tell any physicist or astronomist about that or else they&#8217;ll embark you in a lengthy discussion on how isochronicity is a myth by telling you stories on lightning, thunder and two poor sobs at the ends of a 300,000 km long train. But I digress &#8230;</p>
<p>So, my lowest low and highest high today were at 09:17 this morning when I prepared leaving for work (hey, it&#8217;s vacation time, almost everyone else is out and I can go a bit later than usual, right?). A few minutes earlier I had just told MIRA to run on the very same PacBio test set she had successfully worked on the night before to see how stable assemblies with this kind of data are (quite well so far, thank you for asking).</p>
<p>Reaching out to switch off the monitor and leave, MIRA suddenly came back with a warm and cosy little error message which she&#8217;s taken the habit lately to have a mischievous pleasure to present. This time, she claimed there had been an illegal base in the FASTQ file.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, MIRA, wait a minute!&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Yesterday and tonight you ran on the very same data file with the very same parameters for two times three hours and even gave me back some nice assembly results. And now you claim that the INPUT data has errors?! Come on, you&#8217;re not serious, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a side note: she then just gave me back &#8220;that look&#8221;, you know, the one with those big open eyes behind by long, dark lashes and slightly flushed cheeks accompanied by pointed lips &#8230; as if she wanted to say &#8220;I *am* innocent and *I* did no nothing wrong you disbeliever!&#8221; (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj3efmmDL01qasfhmo1_400.png). This usually announces a major pouting round of hers, something which I&#8217;m not looking forward to, I can tell you.</p>
<p>Two restarts later with the same negative result (MIRA can be quite stubborn at times) I had to give in and decided to sit down again and investigate the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;So &#8230; read number 317301 at base position 246, eh? Let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>*clickedyclick*</p>
<p>&#8220;Read 317299, 317300 &#8230; 317301 &#8230; there we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>*hackedyhack*</p>
<p>&#8220;Base position 239, 240 &#8230; now: C G G G T C F A A &#8230; wait! What? &#8216;F&#8217; &#8230; &#8216;F&#8217;?!? It&#8217;s not even an IUPAC code. What&#8217;s a frakking &#8216;F&#8217; doing in the FASTQ input file?! (CSFW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7KcpgQKo2I )</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not. Even more mysterious to me was the fact that just the night before it apparently had not been there. Or had it? I now was pretty unsure where this path would lead me, as if I had unlocked a door with the key of imagination. Beyond it: another dimension &#8211; a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. I was moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. I just crossed over into &#8230; the Twilight Zone (&#8220;G#-A-G#-E-G#-A-G#-E&#8221; at 128 bpm, for more info see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi6wNGwd84g).</p>
<p>Where was I? Ah, yes, the &#8216;F&#8217;.</p>
<p>So, how did that &#8216;F&#8217; appear in the FASTQ, and where had it been the night before? Out to town, ashamed of not being a nucleotide and getting a hangover without telling anyone up-front? Or did it subreptitiously sneak in from the outside, murdering an innnocent base and taking its place in hope no one would note? I didn&#8217;t have the slightest clue, but I was determined to find that out.</p>
<p>First thing to check: the log files of the successful runs the previous night. MIRA&#8217;s very chatty at times and tidying up after her has always been a chore, but now was one of those occasions where not gagging her paid out as poking around the files she left behind proved to be interesting. Read 317301 showed the following at the position in doubt: &#8220;C G G G T C ___G___ A A&#8221; Without question: a &#8216;G&#8217;, and no &#8216;F&#8217; in sight!</p>
<p>So MIRA had been right and the &#8216;G&#8217; in the sequence of the file mysteriously mutated into an &#8216;F&#8217; overnight. I must admit that I had grown suspicious of her in the past few weeks as she had seemed to become uncooperative at times. In particular she had been screaming at me a couple of times during rehearsal of combined 454 and Illumina assemblies for the premiere of her new 3.4.0 show. She claimed that some uninvited spider monkeys (http://dict.leo.org/ende?search=Klammeraffe) had frightened her so much she refused to continue to work and simply scribbled the &#8216;@&#8217; sign all over her error messages. I had not been able to find out how those critters entered MIRA&#8217;s data and had even enrolled a few volunteers to rehearse different assemblies with MIRA &#8230; to no avail as she&#8217;d performed without flaws there.</p>
<p>While reconsidering all these things, something suddenly made *click*.</p>
<p>The character &#8216;G&#8217; has the hexadecimal ASCII table code 0&#215;47 (or in 8-bit binary: 01000111). &#8216;F&#8217;, as preceding character of &#8216;G&#8217; and the table having some logic behind it, has the hex code 0&#215;46, which is 01000110 in 8-bit binary.</p>
<p>The ATINSEQ-bug (@-in-seq) I had been desperately hunting in the past few weeks (and which had held up the release of MIRA 3.4.0) was due to the &#8220;@&#8221; character sometimes mysteriously appearing in sequences during the assembly of MIRA. The &#8216;@&#8217; sign in the ASCII table has the hex code 0&#215;40 (binary: 01000000). In the ASCII table, there is one important character for DNA assembly which is very near to the &#8216;@&#8217; character &#8230;, so near that it is the successor of it: the &#8216;A&#8217; character. Hexadecimal 0&#215;41, binary 01000001.</p>
<p>I had always thought that a bug in MIRA somehow corrupted the sequence, but what if &#8230; what if MIRA was actually really innocent?! I had never taken this possibility into account as this other explanation attempts would have seemed to far stretched.</p>
<p>But now I had a similar effect *outside* of MIRA, in the Linux filesystem!</p>
<p>Filesystem MIRA<br />
G 01000111 A 01000001<br />
F 01000110 @ 01000000</p>
<p>The difference between the characters is in both cases exactly 1 bit which changes, and it&#8217;s even at the same position (last one in a byte) and changing into the same direction (from &#8217;1&#8242; to &#8217;0&#8242;.</p>
<p>I was now sure I was on to something: bit decay (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot)</p>
<p>But how could I prove it? Well, elementary my dear Watson: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.</p>
<p>Suspects:<br />
- the problem is caused either by MIRA or one of the components of the<br />
comeputer: CPU, disk, disk/dma controller, RAM.</p>
<p>Facts:<br />
- an artefact was very sporadically observed during MIRA runs where sequences<br />
(containing lot&#8217;s of &#8216;A&#8217;) suddenly contained at least one &#8216;@&#8217;. This occured<br />
after several passes, i.e., not on loading.<br />
- an artefact was observed in the Linux filesystem where a &#8216;G&#8217; mutated<br />
suddenly and overnight to a &#8216;F&#8217;.<br />
- both artefacts are based on one bit flipping, perhaps even to the same<br />
direction all the time.<br />
- when loading data, MIRA does not use mmap() to mirror data from disk, but<br />
physically creates a copy of that data.<br />
- MIRA loaded the data twice flawlessly before the artefact in the filesystem<br />
occured.</p>
<p>Deduction 1:<br />
- MIRA is innocent. The artefact in the filesystem happened outside of the<br />
address space of MIRA and therefore outside her control. MIRA cannot be<br />
responsible as the Linux kernel would have prevented her from writing to<br />
some memory she was not allowed to.</p>
<p>Further facts:<br />
- the system MIRA ran on had 24 GiB RAM<br />
- even with a KDE desktop, KMail, Firefox, Emacs and a bunch of terminals<br />
open, there is still a lot of free RAM (some 22 to 23).<br />
- Linux uses free RAM to cache files</p>
<p>Deduction 2:<br />
- when loading the small FASTQ input file in the morning, Linux put it into<br />
the file cache in RAM. As MIRA almost immediately stopped without taking<br />
much memory, the file stayed in cache.</p>
<p>Further facts:<br />
- the drive with the FASTQ file is run in udma6 mode. That is, when loading<br />
data the controller moves the data directly from disk to RAM without going<br />
via the processor<br />
- subsequent &#8220;loading&#8221; of the same FASTQ into MIRA or text viewer like &#8216;less&#8217;<br />
showed the &#8216;F&#8217; character always appearing at the same place.</p>
<p>Deduction 3:<br />
- the CPU is innocent! It did not touch the data while it was transferred from<br />
disk to RAM and it afterwards shows always the same data.<br />
- the disk and UDMA controllers are innocent! Some of the glitches observed in<br />
previous weeks occured during runs of MIRA, inside the MIRA address space,<br />
long after initial loading, when UDMA had already finished their job.</p>
<p>From deductions 1, 2 &#038; 3 follows:<br />
- it&#8217;s not MIRA, not the CPU, nor the disk &#038; UDMA controller</p>
<p>Suspects left:<br />
- RAM<br />
- Disk</p>
<p>Well, that can be easily tested: shut down the computer, restart it and subsequently look at the file again. No file cache in RAM can survive that procedure.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I  have posted quite a few times before about the <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2009/02/03/enzyme-promiscuity/">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2009/06/03/glowing-like-a-horse/">new</a> <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2009/10/01/it-aint-necessarily-so/" target="_blank">functions</a> by genes. In many cases a gene is duplicated, and one of the duplicates acquires a new function. This is one basic evolutionary mechanism of acquiring new functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, gene duplication occurs within a species: part of the chromosome may be duplicated, causing one, a few, or many genes to have more copies of themselves within the species. The descendants of the duplicates and the original are <em>homologous</em> are they are descended from a common ancestor. This type of homology is called <em>paralogy</em>: a homology due to a duplication event (para == in parallel).</p>
<p>In another case, the genes can be homologous due to speciation: a new species (A1) diverges from the original (A0), carrying highly similar genetic loads. The gene for, say, brown eyes in A1 and the gene for brown eyes in A0 are also homologous: derived from the gene of hemoglobin in A0. This time, the homology is called <em>orthology</em>: it is not due to in-species duplication, but due to speciation itself (ortho == exact).  The definitions of orthologs and paralogs were given by Walter Fitch in <a href="http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/99.short" target="_blank">a seminal paper published in 1970.</a></p>
<p>One of the first protein structures to be solved was that of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein complex in our blood. Scientists noticed that hemoglobin in jawed mammals has three different protein chains: alpha, beta and gamma. Their amino acid sequences were very similar, suggesting that the genes encoding for hemoglobin are highly similar, suggesting homology. Since all jawed mammals have hemoglobin, and they all had alpha, beta and gamma chains, the conclusion was that the duplication of the original genes happened in the common ancestor of  jawed mammals, before they split up into different species. Hence, the alpha, beta and gamma chains in hemoglobin are <em>paralogous</em>: homologous due to duplication preceding speciation. However, gamma-hemoglobin was shown to have a different function than beta or alpha (more on that in a bit).  The conclusion from this observation was the <em>Ortholog Conjecture </em>and it can be stated as follows: paralogs (reminder: homologs due to duplication) diverge in function more than orthologs (homologs due to speciation). A model was proposed for this observation: when genes duplicate within a species&#8217; genome, there is less selective pressure on one copy to perform the same function. Thus, it can accumulate mutations and eventually adopt a different function. The ortholog conjecture states that paralogs mostly differ in function, whereas orthologs mostly do not. The ortholog conjecture is a very powerful statement because, if we have two proteins known to be orthologs, we can infer that they have the same function, whereas paralogs may not (if they had enough time to diverge). The ortholog conjecture is therefore a fundamental tenet in molecular phylogenetics, and is also a tool used to predict the function of proteins. If two homologous proteins are found out to be orthologs, then it is assumed they have the same (or highly similar) functionality.</p>
<p>A crack in the ortholog conjecture was formed in study published late 2009 in a paper published by Romain A. Studer and Marc Robinson-Rechavi. I <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2009/10/01/it-aint-necessarily-so/" target="_blank">blogged </a> then about <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.004" target="_blank">their study</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Romain A. Studer and Marc Robinson-Rechavi challenge common wisdom by publishing a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.004" target="_blank">study that says</a>: “it ain’t necessarily so”. They look at three alternative models of molecular function evolution: (i) subfunctionalization after duplication; (ii) neofunctionalization after duplication; and (iii) the ‘alternative model’ of equal change after duplication or speciation. <em>Subfunctionalization</em> holds that after duplication, each of the two copies of the gene performs only a subset of the functions of the ancestral single copy. <em>Neofunctionalization</em> holds that one of the two genes possesses a new, selectively beneficial function that was absent in the population before the duplication. The ‘alternative model’ states that the gain of new function is not preferential to paralogs and that orthologs may gain new functions at the same rate that paralogs do.</p>
<p>Studer and Robinson-Rechavi claim that few studies have been made to study the scope of any of these proposed models. They then lay out study designs for doing so, challenging other evolutionary biologists (and themselves?) to conduct these studies and examine whether the common wisdom that orthologs maintain function while paralogs gain function. What I like about this paper is that it not only makes a strong case for challenging conventional wisdom, it also lays out a series of possible routes of study to be taken up by others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now two studies have widened this crack to a rather large crevasse. The first is a study by scientists in Indiana University. In a way, this <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073" target="_blank">new publication</a> is a response to Studer &amp; Robinson-Rechavi&#8217;s call to arms on points (i) and (ii). The IU scientists (the Radivojac lab and the Hahn lab at the School of Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) examined hundreds of pairs of orthologous and paralogous genes from the mouse and human genomes. They then examined whether paralogs had a higher functional similarity, or rather orthologs.  What they found certainly defied the ortholog conjecture:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_5062" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 727px"><a href="http://bytesizebio.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/journal.pcbi_.1002073.g001.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-5062 " title="journal.pcbi.1002073.g001" src="http://bytesizebio.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/journal.pcbi_.1002073.g001-1024x289.png" alt="" width="717" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The relationship between functional similarity and sequence identity for human-mouse orthologs (red) and all paralogs (blue). (A) Biological pathway (B) molecular function. From PLoS Comput Biol 7(6): e1002073 under CC licence.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But before we explain the results, a word about function. The <a href="http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2010/06/12/protein-function-promiscuity-moonlighting-and-philosophy/">function of a protein has several aspects which are context-dependent</a>; two important ones are the molecular function of the protein, and the biological process in which it participates. For example, the molecular function of all hemoglobins  is noted as  oxygen binding and oxygen transport. However, they are different in the processes, or pathways, in which they participate: gamma-hemoglobin participates in the transport of oxygen in the fetus. The complex which contains gamma-hemoglobin has a higher affinity to oxygen, and thus able to extract oxygen in the placenta from the maternal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_hemoglobin#Overview" target="_blank">oxygenated hemoglobin and transport it to the fetus</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can explain the figure above. Graph <strong>(A)</strong> above shows the functional similarity for the biological pathway aspect and how it is affected by the sequence identities of the hundreds of orthologs (red) and paralogs (blue) examined between human and mouse. Graph <strong>(B)</strong> shows the functional similarity of the molecular function aspect.</p>
<p>The X-axis is the sequence identity percentage between any pair of sequences: the higher the percent identity, the less divergent are the sequences, the more inclined we should be to think that the pair of proteins performs the same function since they diverged less. The Y-axis shows the fraction of functional similarity. Looking at graph <strong>(B)</strong> above, we see that paralogs which are 100% identical, have (almost always) the same function . But sequences of orthlogous proteins between human and mouse have only about 65% functional similarity, on average. What does that mean? In the database they looked at, each gene has a set of words associated with it, describing what it does. The IU scientists found that only about 65% of the keywords in orthologous sequence pairs overlapped, on average. Whereas for paralogs 100% overlapped. And those are for sequences which are identical! This means that even if we find identical protein sequences in human and in mouse, it does not mean that they have the same molecular function. On the other hand, paralogs, will generally have more similar functions. So the ortholog conjecture has been stood on its head here: paralogs are the ones that would generally have the same function, whereas orthologs diverge more in function. This holds true for up to about 50% sequence identity, when the picture seems to reverse itself. Graph <strong>(A)</strong> depicts the differences in the biological pathway aspect. Here, the differences are even more striking. The paralogs which are 90-100% identical between human and mouse participate in almost exactly the same pathways in both organisms. But orthologous proteins which are 90-100% identical the functional similarity is much lower:  only about 65%.<br />
<span style="float: left; padding: 5px;"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"><img style="border: 0;" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org" /></a></span></p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>First, it means that, at least between human and mouse, paralogs are better predictors of function than orthologs. And why would that be? To answer this question, let&#8217;s look closer at the graphs above. Note that while for paralogs the functional similarity decreases rapidly with sequence similarity, for orthologs the functional similarity remains roughly the same no matter how similar or different the orthologs are to each other, and even when they are 100% identical their functions vary to some extent! The reason: the experimental study of function in two human and in mouse  takes place in different contexts. The species-specific context is what causes the differences in annotation, and in the overall function. Also, all the orthologs in the study are of the same age, dating back to the human-mouse lineage split 75 million years ago. The paralogs predate that split, and may be of different ages: the split may predate the human / mouse split by 10 million years, 100 million years, or 1 billion years. Thus orthologs, regardless of their actual sequence similarity, have the same age, and paralogs do not. But why should proteins of the same age share the same level of (not so high) functional similarity? The authors of the study reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>While there is no direct role for “time” in evolution that is not tied to mutation, we suggest that what time represents here is the evolution of the cellular context: the sum of the evolutionary changes over all of the directly and indirectly interacting molecules. If this context evolves at a steady rate (i.e. the average amount of functional change among all of the interacting molecules remains relatively constant), then protein function will appear to evolve at a steady rate, a rate largely disconnected from the level of an individual protein&#8217;s sequence divergence. &#8212; <em>PLoS Comput Biol, Vol. 7, No. 6.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The strongest evidence they find for this hypothesis, is that even proteins with 100% are annotated differently. To wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, Liao and Zhang [50] found that &gt;20% of genes that are essential for viability in humans are not essential in mouse. It is unlikely that changes to the proteins themselves have made them essential or not, but rather that their context in cellular and organismal networks has evolved. &#8211;<em>ibid.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The proteins may not have changed substantially, but their environment changed, giving them a different role. Think about changing jobs after moving to a new place where there is no employer providing your exact old job you were used to. You may have been an embedded systems programmer, but now you are a website programmer. So context goes a long way to explain changes in ortholog function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, about a month after the IU paper was published, <a href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/16/bib.bbr031.full" target="_blank">another paper</a> from the Robinson-Rechavi lab was published, which also talks about homologs between human and mouse. In this study Gharib and Robinson-Rechavi reviewed previous literature listing several types of functional divergence of orthologs between human and mouse. They had some additional findings. For example, about 11% of the orthologous genes were alternatively spliced, meaning that the end products, proteins, were different between human and mouse.  They also listed specific phenotypic effects: genes which are linked to diseases in humans, but mutations in their mouse orthologs have no effects on mice. They cite studies that found that over 20% of genes which are essential in human are non-essential in mice (an <em>essential gene</em> is just that: if the organism does not have it, or it is mutated, the effects are fatal, and the organism does not develop past very early stages).  Their literature review concluded that 10-20% of ortholog pairs between human and mouse cannot be used for functional transfer. The IU study implies a higher percentage. Both studies conclude that a common practice in molecular evolution studies, the use of orthologs to infer function, should be seriously looked at.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you received your mate-paired reads in two different files, and you need to merge them for your assembler. Here is a quick Python script to do that. You will need <a href="http://biopython.org" target="_blank">Biopython</a> installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:python">#!/usr/bin/env python
from Bio import SeqIO
import itertools
import sys
import os
# Copyright(C) 2011 Iddo Friedberg

def merge_fastq(fastq_path1, fastq_path2, outpath):
    outfile = open(outpath,"w")
    fastq_iter1 = SeqIO.parse(open(fastq_path1),"fastq")
    fastq_iter2 = SeqIO.parse(open(fastq_path2),"fastq")
    for rec1, rec2 in itertools.izip(fastq_iter1, fastq_iter2):
        SeqIO.write([rec1,rec2], outfile, "fastq")
    outfile.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    outpath = "%s.merged.fastq" % os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])[0]
    merge_fastq(sys.argv[1],sys.argv[2],outpath)</pre>
<p>The neat trick is in line 13, using Python&#8217;s <font face="courier"><b>itertools</b></font> to zip two iterators and loop over them in parallel two fastq records at a time.</p>
<p>How to use this script: download to a file you will call <font face="courier"><b>merge_fastq</b></font> (or whatever). Then:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">
$ chmod +x merge_fastq
</pre>
<p>And you are ready to go.</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">
$ ./merge_fastq myseq_1_.fastq myseq_2_.fastq
</pre>
<p>The merged file will be called <font type="Courier">myseq_1_.merged.fastq</font></p>
