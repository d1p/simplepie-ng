			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I'll be hosting a workshop at the Creative Commons Global Summit in Warsaw, Poland, focussing on how to work with volunteers in the CC communities across the globe. The idea is to address ways to establish such communities, how to sustain/expand them and of course how they can be used as a strong resource on different levels in affiliate (local chapters') activities.

In practice we'll (1) look into existing CC communities and learn from those in an effort to map good and fruitful practices for both building and using them, (2) discuss the difficulties and pitfalls we meet in building and sustaining communities and, time permitting, (3) try to design a framework or overview of good practice, as derived from the session, to be made available to all affiliates.

Before the workshop, which starts at 11.00, I'll also be giving a short presentation of my label Urlyd/Uhrlaut at the Collecting Societies Update session (9.00-19.30).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just arrived yesterday in Warsaw, such a beautiful city, to attend the Creative Commons Global Summit 2011. As Public Lead for Creative Commons Denmark I am representing our CC affiliate jurisdiction along with my colleague Martin von Haller Grønbæk.
The idea is, first and foremost, to meet and network with all the other leads from CC juristictions from around the world - from South Africa to Canada, from Bolivia to Japan - but also to discuss the future for CC and the rapidly growing use of the licenses globally as well as the future of open culture in general.

I'll be in Warsaw until late Monday afternoon, so please get in touch if you happen to there too.<script type="text/javascript">

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was awesome. In Platform4 we hosted one of the most extreme voltage-meets-music experiments of all time on Danish (and European) soil: The so-called Tesla Coil Concert Experiment, also known as Tesla In Concert.

Daniel Uhrenholdt, Danish creator of numerous tesla coils over the last ten years, had teamed up with us (Platform4 and Hal9k) and musicians Randcore and Yngvesin to create a MIDI-interface that could send musical input to 4 large coils (including the largest coil on the European continent, over 4 meters tall) so that the musicians could play the coils as instruments. This setup was backed by a heavy PA-system to support basslines and lower frequencies, so the sound pressure was...phenomenal. Additionally, the hall was blazed with huge purple 450.000 volt lightnings from the gigantic coil and it's three smaller buddies while thundering noise shook the old warehouse to it's very foundation. Amazing.

The concert was part of Culture Night in the city (an annual event) and drew in over 600 people who wanted to see this highly unusual and historic event. They witnessed a show consisting of three parts; first a segment from Vivaldi's 'Summer', next an 8-bit potpourri of well-known songs interpreted by chiptune artist Randcore and finally kidney-shattering sub-bass dubstep sounds from Yngvesin, resulting in the what is probably the most vicious wobble bass ever heard (anyone else ever tried adding 450.000 volt thunder to a bassline?).

Fun and fascinating fact for the geeks: The coils were running half power so they wouldn't damage the building. When given full throttle the big bastard often squirts out lightnings of over 1.000.000 volts!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I'll be doing an <a title="Go to Urlyd site" href="http://www.urlyd.com">Urlyd</a> presentation at the first ever open culture event in the history of the Faroe Islands. As a part of the event, which is hosted by all the CC chapters in Scandinavia in collaboration with the <a title="Go to Cloudberry Project website" href="http://www.cloudberry.cc">Cloudberry Project</a>, I'll be summarizing our label business model using <a title="Go to CC international site" href="http://www.creativecommons.org">CC-licenses</a> and sharing as the driving factor (it'll be the same presentation I did at <a title="Go to FSCONS website" href="http://www.fscons.org">FSCONS</a> 2010).

Normally in this blog I encourage everyone to join me. Which is a bit hard unless you're Faroese - but if you happen to hang out in the middle of the Atlantic, please drop by! <img src='http://autofunk.dk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  The event takes place in the <a title="Go to Nordic House Torshavn website" href="http://www.nlh.fo/">Nordic House</a> in Torshavn.

Earlier in the day, btw, we'll also be having the last Cloudberry network meeting and discuss how to proceed from here. Exciting!<script type="text/javascript">

As a part of the event, which is hosted by all the CC chapters in Scandinavia in collaboration with the Cloudberry Project, I\'ll be summarizing our label business model using CC-licenses and sharing as the driving factor (it\'ll be the same presentation I did at FSCONS 2010).  Normally in this blog I encourage everyone to join me. Which is a bit hard unless you\'re Faroese - but if you happen to hang out in the middle of the Atlantic, please drop by! ;) The event takes place in the Nordic House in Torshavn.  Earlier in the day, btw, we\'ll also be having the last Cloudberry network meeting and discuss how to proceed from here. Exciting!';

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I head for the Faroes as public lead for Creative Commons Denmark - together with CC Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland - to help the local CC crew to establish the chapter there. 

Ahead lies three days of talks, dialog and discussions - as well as an extra day to hike the mountains there for a bit. It's my first trip there, and if it's anything like Iceland, I'll know I'll love it.
