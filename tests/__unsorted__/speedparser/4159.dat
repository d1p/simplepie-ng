	  <description>I heard someone tell &#60;a class="profile-link" href="http://live.xbox.com/member/De Veritate"&#62;De Veritate&#60;/a&#62; to go play outside and he was like 'screw that!' so we did some gaming. Our gamerscore is currently &#60;a href="http://www.360voice.com/blog-gs.asp?tag=De Veritate"&#62;14,450&#60;/a&#62; points. He rallied FIFA 12, and did it while drooling over my awesome graphics and sound. </description>

	  <description>This entry is a little different than the others. It is a recap of the last week of gaming. Check it: NOTHING HAPPENED. De Veritate and I did not play a single day last week. Sure people get busy, but not people with an Xbox 360... at least not seven days in a row. </description>

	  <description>Are you ready for a recap? I know I am! Giddyup: I wish I had something good to blog about, but I don't. In my fantasy world De Veritate and I played all these great games and got all this gamerscore... but that didn't happen. Not a single day of gaming took place last week. Maybe next week!</description>

	  <description>Hey &#60;a class="profile-link" href="http://live.xbox.com/member/De Veritate"&#62;De Veritate&#60;/a&#62;, if you are not going to take this friendship seriously, why don't we just go our separate ways? Seriously? I am just not getting the attention I deserve here... put yourself in my shoes. For real. </description>
