At RedState, Erick Erickson concludes: "It also seems to be a slander Herman Cain is picking up and running with as a way to get into second place." Glenn Reynolds remarks that until now Cain's "big appeal is that he's not just another black race-card-playing politician." Over at the Daily Caller, Matt Lewis calls Cain's remarks "a cheap shot, and, perhaps a signal that Cain is willing to play the race card against a fellow Republican when it benefits him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize that it's absolutely wrong to ever even suggest that the right wing might have a little problem with race (and this is enforced with an iron hand by pointing out that Republicans all love Herman Cain/Clarence Thomas/Alan West etc so it can't possibly have anything to do with race) but I think this is telling nonetheless.  They have no problem with race as long as black Republicans never, ever suggest that anyone on their own team might have a problem with race. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Adam points out:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The key phrase here is "fellow Republican." Because, you see, no one thought Cain was "playing the race card" when he said in the same program that black people are "brainwashed" into voting for Democrats and suggested that black people who vote Republican are "thinking for themselves." Cain wasn't rebuked by conservatives when he previously suggested President Barack Obama was not "a strong black man," implied liberals were out to commit genocide against blacks through support for abortion rights, and said he wouldn't appoint a Muslim to his cabinet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Playing the race card" has a very specific meaning. It means mentioning Republican racism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4013705-3830343352615352929?l=digbysblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (digby)</name></author><gr:likingUser>10257419373298164360</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Hullabaloo"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Hullabaloo</id><title type="html">Hullabaloo</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317666617609"><id gr:original-id="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/interview-schweitzers-plan-to-bring-canadian-health-care-to-montana/2011/10/03/gIQA025JIL_blog.html?wprss=ezra-klein">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bee6e3c488c3e40</id><title type="html">Interview: Schweitzer’s plan to bring Canadian health care to Montana</title><published>2011-10-03T17:30:00Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T17:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/click.phdo?i=396b8c8711cebb804237ac442324fc67" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.washingtonpost.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_296w//WashingtonPost/Content/Production/Blogs/ezra-klein/Images/Montana_Universal_Health_Care_013b0-209.jpg?uuid=5Jm1ku3XEeCBjMDNCiaRsA"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer is no stranger to aggressive, and controversial, attempts at health reform. In 1999, he began chartering much-publicized buses to Canada, where seniors could fill prescriptions at lower costs. He’s asked for permission to create a Medicaid drug prescription program for all his citizens (Health and Human Services said no.) and to import medications from Canada.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In advance of health reform, Schweitzer has a new idea: build a statewide, universal health-care system, modeled after that of Saskatchewan, the Canadian province just north of Montana.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We spoke this morning about his new plan to build a public option out of Montana’s Medicaid program, what federal waivers he would need to do so and why, like many of his Republican counterparts, he’s looking for something like block grant funding. What follows is a transcript, lightly edited for content and length.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sarah Kliff: Give me a bit of a history of what you’re trying to do here – what have you been working on?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gov. Brian Schweitzer: &lt;/b&gt;I’ve spent a great deal of time studying a lot of different countries’ health-care systems. This time around, I’m looking at a system straight north of us. In Saskatchewan, they have had universal health care since 1946, 20 years before the rest of Canada. We’re pretty similar: Montana has 990,000 residents and Saskatchewan has just over 1 million. They’re 10 percent Indian, we’re 7 percent. Their average age is just two months different than ours. But they have a health-care system where they have two years longer and have lower infant mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called up Brad Wall, the conservative premier of Saskatchewan and asked him, “Would you help me work through all your numbers, so I can compare that with our system?” I looked at what they spent and what we do. They have a slightly larger population and for every man, child and woman in their health-care system, the cost is about $4 billion. Remember, they live two years longer and have a lower infant mortality rate. In Montana, it’s about $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you went to a gas station, and you looked over at a car with a Canadian license plate. They were paying $1 a gallon for gas, and you’re paying $2. Wouldn’t that make you mad? That’s exactly what’s happening. I’m mad for all the people in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: How’d that influence what you want to do in Montana?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BS: &lt;/b&gt;We know that, because of the Affordable Care Act, Montana’s Medicaid population will double. So we’re saying, let us set up clinics across Montana like they have is Saskatchewan, for Medicaid, where we will have family practitioners, nurse practioners, taking care of patients. That will have about 20 percent of the state’s population in the pool. We’ll also add in all state employees, that’s another 60,000. Then, we’ll turn to private citizens and ask, do you want to buy into this? We’ll turn to small businesses and large ones, and ask them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: What you’re describing sounds like a public option for Montana, which builds off of your Medicaid program.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BS:&lt;/b&gt; This would be a hybrid of systems we have right now, serving Medicaid patients, state employees, university employees, the people who are currently Montana employees, we’ll start with that. If somebody else wants to get in, to deliver health care, too, we’ll be accommodating. Every patient would come in and pay a co-pay and the clinics would be staffed primarily by people who worked for the Montana Medicaid program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: What kind of waivers do you need from the federal government to do this?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BS:&lt;/b&gt; The waiver we’d need is Medicaid-related. It would allow us to deliver health care through community health-care clinics as opposed to contracting for specific services, with all kinds of clinics large and small across the state. We’re simply saying that we here in Montana are adults, we have a budget surplus, weren’t good at negotiating and not buying things we don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: Have you looked at other states in pursuing this kind of health reform? I know Vermont is working on a single-payer system that could be somewhat similar to what you’re doing.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BS: Yes, I definitely looked at Vermont, other states. Most of the Republican governors have either asked or plan to ask for a block grant, which is kind of what I’m talking about here. Send me the money and I’ll take responsibility for my Medicaid population. Don’t be my partner anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: What about the health reform law? Will you need any waivers from that?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BS:&lt;/b&gt; We’ll see what Health and Human Services says about that. They’re the judge and the jury. What I’m trying to do is claim jump it, not going to wait and see it drive our state into bankruptcy. The thing they say in Washington — other than it’s too hot, or I’m working too hard — is that they believe the states are the laboratories of democracy. We’re giving them an opportunity to do what they say, and let us be that laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SK: What kind of reception are you expecting from Health and Human Services? I know they’ve turned down some of your previous waiver requests.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BS:&lt;/b&gt; Since we’re proposing to save citizens money, you’d expect some kind of chorus and music, maybe a presentation with some plaques and flowers. That’s what you’d expect. But in my experience, that’s not what you get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;

We don’t care, because why is anyone waiting for some old newspaper to publish the news that everybody is making without the permission of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, right? But still, it’s funny how the first version of the &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; story about the Brooklyn Bridge fuckery by the NYPD was very quickly edited into a “tense showdown” that completely left out the part about the New York cops leading the protesters onto the bridge and into some weird Spiderman orange net trap, on purpose. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, complaining about the Corporate Media not reporting on the things you already know about is a waste of time. Corporate Media &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; reports on anything until they’re told about this thing by enough sources of Conventional Wisdom such as other media representatives, lobbyists, Senate staffers, the boss, and probably what they read on &lt;i&gt;Slate&lt;/i&gt; or whatever. (None of this applies if the turmoil is happening in a safely foreign country, because then the editors can use dramatic photographs of foreigners holding up their left feet, painted green, because that’s how they “show democracy” over there, and then the newspaper can win Awards from other newspaper people. It’s magic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway,&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; very rapidly changed this story written in a “factual way” to better reflect the &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; mission of ignoring whatever happens in New York until it’s big enough to be lied about, the end.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/10/03/derp/#comment-2807291"&gt;TooManyJens&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that this is an old headline from a student newspaper.  I reckon it’s making the rounds again because of this:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/cantor-obama-s-jobs-bill-is-dead-20111003"&gt;House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said definitively on Monday that President Obama’s $447 billion jobs bill will not be brought to the floor as a package, despite repeated calls from the White House to move on his legislation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“The president continues to say, ‘Pass my bill in its entirety,’ and as I’ve said from the outset, the all-or-nothing approach is just unacceptable, and I think from a purely practical standpoint, the president’s got some whipping to do on his own side of the aisle,” Cantor told reporters.&lt;br&gt;
Instead, Cantor said the House will move forward on legislative initiatives in October in which there is some agreement between the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue: making permanent the 3 percent withholding provision for government contractors included in Obama’s jobs bill; passage of three long-stalled trade pacts with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea; further repeal of regulations restricting business; and a bill coming out of the Financial Services Committee that will increase small business owners’ access to capital.&lt;br&gt;
“All of these things the president has spoken about and represents areas of commonality where we can boost economic growth and produce an environment for job creation,” Cantor said.&lt;br&gt;
Movement on the trade bills is the most significant announcement. Aides to Cantor said a more detailed announcement was expected as early as Monday afternoon outlining how Congress will move forward on the trade pacts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Phew! A quick save by me.  I’m totally current, y’all.  You’ve heard about “lolcats,” right?&lt;/p&gt;

Not the politics, of course -- his &amp;quot;Rebuild the Dream&amp;quot; project wants to achieve the antithesis of what the Tea Party has acheived. But he loves talking about why the Tea Party works, and why liberals should stop mocking it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Dick Armey and all of them came here and said &amp;#39;The Tea Party is over,&amp;#39; The Tea Party wouldn&amp;#39;t be over,&amp;quot; said Jones at the opening speech of the Take Back the American Dream Conference in D.C. &amp;quot;They used their charismatic leaders to build something bigger!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wordily-titled conference is a relaunch, a rebrand, of a Campaign for America&amp;#39;s Future conference series that used to look more like a liberal answer to the Conservative Political Action Conference. (It used to be called &amp;quot;Take Back America.&amp;quot;) The new conference is more outwardly militant; Jones schooled progressives on how they erred in hoping Barack Obama could solve their problems.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s one thing not to have a house,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s another thing to have a mansion, like we had in 2008, and then not to have a house.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressives had to understand why the Tea Party worked. &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t drive to Tea Party headquarters,&amp;quot; said Jones. &amp;quot;They didn&amp;#39;t brand an individual. They branded a network. They built a starfish and not a spider.&amp;quot; (He drove home the reference to a business theory that Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and other groups started adopting in 2009. &amp;quot;Some of y&amp;#39;all know what I&amp;#39;m talking about. The rest of you, use a search engine.&amp;quot;) So Rebuild the Dream had &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/06/17/netroots_nation_rebuild_the_dream_and_the_return_of_van_jones.html"&gt;copied the strategy&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;with no Fox TV, with no Koch brothers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Jones hinting that the Occupy Wall Street model -- apolitical, nearly anarchist -- was the way? No. He was subtle. Rebuild the Dream, for all the noise, is subtle. It does not &amp;quot;support&amp;quot; Barack Obama, but its clear goal is to keep him in power and move him left. &amp;quot;Why is the White House talking different?&amp;quot; asked Jones. &amp;quot;The White House is talking different because we are walking different.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>David Weigel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/rss.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/rss.aspx</id><title type="html">Slate Blogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel.fulltext.all.20.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317660136982"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4013705.post-8885646503399587997">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19bef557c7343a8b</id><title type="html">Tearing down the foundation</title><published>2011-10-03T16:30:02Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T16:30:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/tearing-down-foundation.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Tearing down the foundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;by digby&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize that it's fashionable at the moment to not care who wins elections because there's not a dime's worth of difference between any of them, but I suspect it still will matter quite a bit on the margins (which translates to the lives of millions of everyday Americans) if the Republicans win the presidency and both houses of congress at this peak moment of lunacy. Therefore, &lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/restrictions_could_keep_five_million_traditionally_democratic_voters_from_the_polls_in_2012.php"&gt;this is a problem:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Restrictive voting laws in states across the country could affect up to five million voters from traditionally Democratic demographics in 2012, according to a new report by the Brennan Center. That's a number larger than the margin of victory in two of the last three presidential elections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new restrictions, the study found, "fall most heavily on young, minority, and low-income voters, as well as on voters with disabilities. This wave of changes may sharply tilt the political terrain for the 2012 election."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;These new laws could make it significantly harder for more than five million eligible voters to cast ballots in 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The states that have already cut back on voting rights will provide 171 electoral votes in 2012 - 63 percent of the 270 needed to win the presidency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the 12 likely battleground states, as assessed by an August Los Angeles Times analysis of Gallup polling, five have already cut back on voting rights (and may pass additional restrictive legislation), and two more are currently considering new restrictions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;These voting law changes are radical and completely unnecessary," Wendy. R. Weiser, a co-author of the report, said in a statement. "They especially hurt those who have been historically locked out of our electoral system, like minorities, poor people, and students. Often they seem precisely targeted to exclude certain voters."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose if we are giving up entirely on democracy then this isn't of interest. But just in case we decide someday that the old, creaky process might be useful, it would probably be good to still have it in place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4013705-8885646503399587997?l=digbysblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (digby)</name></author><gr:likingUser>14332054732256689997</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Hullabaloo"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Hullabaloo</id><title type="html">Hullabaloo</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317660113793"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3798595.post-2307005383518541158">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/545fcc5e4ae4f37f</id><category term="GOP extremism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="2012 elections" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The muddled Republican presidential primary</title><published>2011-10-03T16:35:00Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T16:35:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Americablog/~3/UyzR6vjquCo/muddled-republican-presidential-primary.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.americablog.com/" type="html">Over at &lt;a href="http://elections.americablog.com/2011/10/chris-christie-confused-republican.html"&gt;AMERICAblog Elections: The Right's Field&lt;/a&gt;, I take a look at the ongoing saga that is Chris Christie's speculative candidacy.

Perhaps even more concerning, the inevitable moral hazard that followed Secretary Paulson and Secretary Geithner's repeated use of TARP funds to back up their pronouncements that they would not let the largest banks fail has not been adequately addressed by regulatory reform. ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As a result, the TBTF banks are even larger and more dangerous than ever, and could still hold the taxpayer hostage once again in the next financial crisis. Finally, TARP's most enduring legacy may be the HISTORICAL DISDAIN with which the American people now hold their government, which I believe has been fueled by Treasury administrating TARP with insufficient transparency and with undue deference to the largest financial institutions."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3798595-6993079592046359762?l=www.americablog.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/ujhcaad162js4l7fjcgfcb9m3g/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americablog.com%2F2011%2F10%2Fskepticism-on-3rd-tarp-anniversary.html" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch wants to focus on his A-B-Cs. The media giant, parent of the Fox network, Fox News Channel, 20th Century Fox and the Wall Street Journal, wants to make a push into the education business and has tapped New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein to be the point person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In a press conference, Klein said he’d been tapped by News Corp. to “put them in the burgeoning and dynamic education marketplace.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Sure, Klein is probably earning more money than God in his new role as executive vice president at News Corp. But the Justice Department attorney turned data-and-accountability school reformer signed up with Murdoch to get out of the harsh political limelight and help News Corp. make a mint selling educational technology products to school districts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Last November, shortly after hiring Klein, News Corp. acquired Wireless Generation, an education technology firm that had worked closely with Klein during his tenure as chancellor on two projects: &lt;span&gt;ARIS&lt;/span&gt;, acontroversial (and buggy) data system that warehouses students’ standardized test scores and demographic profiles; and School of One, a more radical attempt to use technology to personalize instruction, reorganize classrooms, and reduce the size of the teaching force.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;School of One.  Sounds lonely to me. The corporate school reform team better market-test that. &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/162201/scrutiny-murdoch-school-reform-agenda-grows"&gt;Maybe they could do one of those Fox News Luntz groups.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The acquisition put Klein, who was set to supervise Wireless Generation, in an awkward position vis à vis city ethics regulations.&lt;br&gt;
It seemed unlikely Klein would be able to fully follow those mandates when, in May, the city Department of Education renewed its contract with Wireless Generation, asking the company to provide testing materials and software. Last month, New York State moved to award Wireless Generation a $27 million no-bid contact to create a state student data-tracking system similar to &lt;span&gt;ARIS&lt;/span&gt;—despite the fact that many New York City principals have decided not to use the $80 million software, which doesn’t track helpful day-to-day information on attendance, behavior or homework completion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;News Corporation today announced that Kristen Kane, former Chief Operating Officer, New York City Department of Education and Dr. Peter Gorman, former Superintendent, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will take on leadership roles at its newly formed Education Division.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; “I’m thrilled to join News Corporation, and to work with someone of Joel’s caliber, and the rest of his team, to transform the educational system through digital technology and other means,” said Dr. Gorman. “News Corporation has a reputation for leading significant change across many industries, and I look forward to what lies ahead for the education sector.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I think it’s great that the corporate reformers have (finally) dropped the sentimental and deceptive nonsense about “the children” and now discuss their industry, the education sector. Second graders don’t really stand a chance unless we can get these people to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some media companies view education as a major growth area. The Washington Post Co. relies heavily on its education unit Kaplan Inc. In the Washington Post Co.’s third-quarter results, Kaplan had revenue of $743.3 million. It accounted for over 60% of the entire company’s revenue, according to the Washington Post. Walt Disney Co. is also a player in this field with its Disney-branded schools, and the New York Times has launched the New York Times Knowledge Network.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Disney-branded schools.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weareohio.com/landing/lhvideo.html?gclid=CMTdt7nyzKsCFcTBKgod5Cbj3w"&gt;If Issue Two passes in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, unions will be out of the way and we can move right to “branding” my local public schools with a corporate logo. Will we get a choice of brands, do you think? I’m not going to end up with “Koch Industries” am I?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The same media companies that have launched a crusade to discredit public schools and demonize public school teachers are in the for-profit education business.  With &lt;span&gt;FOX&lt;/span&gt; now entering the burgeoning for-profit education sector I’m confident media coverage of traditional public schools will only get more fair and balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;David Graeber is an anthropologist at Goldsmiths, University of London, and author of ‘Direct Action: An Ethnography.’ He was also one of the initial organizers of the ‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests. And he thinks the people asking for a list of demands are missing the point of the movement quite dramatically. We spoke this morning by phone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ezra Klein: So when did your involvement with these protests begin?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Graeber: July 2nd. That was the first actual meeting. What happened was AdBusters put out &lt;a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet"&gt;this call &lt;/a&gt;for these protests. We had heard there was supposed to be a general assembly on July 2nd. So I just showed up. But it was a rally, not an assembly. Some Marxist groups had set up stages and megaphones and was making speeches and were planning a march. So we said we don’t need to do this. We pulled a small group together and decided to have a real assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we wandered over to another part of the area and began a meeting and people kept migrating over. But we had a problem because we only had six weeks. AdBusters had already advertised the date to 80,000 people. And their date was a Saturday. You can’t really shut down Wall Street on a Saturday. So we were working under some significant constraints. We assembled 80 or 100 people and formed working groups for outreach, process, so forth and so on. And we began meeting every week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that helped a lot was a smattering of people from Spain and Greece and Tunisia who had been doing this sort of thing more recently. They explained that the model that seemed to work was to take something that seemed to be public space, reclaim it, and build up an organization headquarters around that from which you can begin doing other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: This movement is organized rather differently than most protest movements. There isn’t really a list of demands, or goals, or even much of an identifiable leadership. But if I understand you correctly, that’s sort of the point.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG: It’s very similar to the globalization movement. You see the same criticisms in the press. It’s a bunch of kids who don’t know economics and only know what they’re against. But there’s a reason for that. it’s pre-figurative, so to speak. You’re creating a vision of the sort of society you want to have in miniature. And it’s a way of juxtaposing yourself against these powerful, undemocratic forces you’re protesting. If you make demands, you’re saying, in a way, that you’re asking the people in power and the existing institutions to do something different. And one reason people have been hesitant to do that is they see these institutions as the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: So if you say, for instance, that you want a tax on Wall Street and then you’ll be happy, you’re implicitly saying that you’re willing to be happy with a slightly modified version of the current system.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG: Right. The tax on Wall Street will go to people controlled by Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: By which you mean government.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG: Yes. So we are keeping it open-ended. In a way, what we want is to create spaces where people can think about questions like that. In New York, according to law, any unpermitted assembly of more than 12 people is illegal in New York. Space itself is not an openly available resource. But the one resource that isn’t scarce is smart people with ideas. So we’re trying to reframe things away from the rhetoric of demands to a questions of visons and solutions. Now how that translates into actual social change is an interesting question. One way this has been done elsewhere is you have local initiatives that come out of the local assemblies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: It also seems that the tradeoff here, from an organizational standpoint, is that if you say you want, say, a tax on Wall Street, then the people who aren’t interested in a tax on Wall Street stay home. So remaining vague on demands can make the tent bigger. But it also seems that, at some point, people are going to need to be working towards concrete goals and experiencing dicrete successes in order to sustain the energy of a movement like this.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GB: As the thing grows, new organizational forms will develop. At this point, the New York occupation has 30 different working groups for everything from handling sanitation to discussing labor issues and tax policy. So we’re trying to set up ways that people with different interests can plug into the movement. There’s even a newspaper. The ‘Occupied Wall Street Journal.’ Of course, this is nothing compared to what happened in Tahrir Square, where they even had dry cleaners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: We’re also beginning to see “Occupy Wall Street” link up with with more traditional activist groups. Some members of the protest were speaking via videofeed at today’s big confab of liberal groups in Washington. MoveOn.org and organized labor are planning a march in support of the occupiers for Wednesday. How does that change what is, for now, a very decentralized movement?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG: It is organically happening but there are definite problems that occur. We found this back in the days of the globalization movement. Unions were very supportive and provided resources but they’re very different organizations. The real difficulty is how to work with people who are top-down and have a funding base, as it means there are things they can say in public and things they can’t, and groups where people can say whatever they want and the whole idea is to be decentralized. One problem I’ve already heard of is that people are coming in and changing the tenor of the general assemblies to speeches, and that’s not really what it’s supposed to be about. So you have to balance the aspect where you’re trying to show what direct democracy could be like and the effort to link up with groups that have a form of organization we’ve rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EK: The name of the group is “Occupy Wall Street,” but from what I can tell by listening to interviews with the protesters and reading messages at ‘&lt;a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/"&gt;We are the 99&lt;/a&gt;,’ it’s not just about Wall Street, it’s about the powerful in general, which include politicians and wealthy folks who don’t make their money in finance, and beyond that, it’s really about the less-powerful. The real running theme I’m hearing is hopelessness: that we did everything right and played by the rules and went to school or got a job and now we’re buried in debt and can’t make ends meet, while these folks at the top of the economy seem to just keep prospering and prospering.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DG: Right, and Wall Street is just a beautiful illustration of that. Here we have these guys who were just greedy crooks, who crashed the global economy and did terrible things to the lives of people all over the world. None of them have paid at all. There was a debate about whether their bonuses should be lowered. On the other hand, if people point out to vigorously that this has happened, they do get arrested. And that helps to point out the essential double standard of the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent part of Friday and Saturday at the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City. The main story, and an analysis of What It All Means, will appear later today. In the meantime, I've gone back over the conversations I had at the rallies to confirm the conventional wisdom: There is no agenda uniting the people showing up and expressing their anger at finance.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One of the first people I saw at the Friday rally was Justin Gray, whose sleeveless T-shirt revealed a Gadsden flag tattoo -- permanent ink of the Tea Party's adopted symbol.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t really agree with the Tea Party,&amp;quot; said Gray, a carpenter from Brooklyn, &amp;quot;but I don&amp;#39;t have strong feelings about them. For me, it was just… I guess it represents being American and being proud of it. It&amp;#39;s getting back to the roots of, sort of, live and let live. Early American politics around the Declaration of Independence are fascinating to me.&amp;quot; He agreed with some Tea Party goals. &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t keep spending money like we are.&amp;quot; But he was not a conservative. &amp;quot;The Tea Party is… whatever. It&amp;#39;s a fad.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bill McNulty was one of the rarer breed of occupiers -- a grey-haired veteran activist who had thought deeply about this stuff. &amp;quot;Generally speaking,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;the population is thoroughly taken by the myth that things are as they are being presented to them. Now that the reality is hitting them so hard -- their pensions are disappearing, their houses are being foreclosed on -- they&amp;#39;re organizing.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; McNulty, whose own activism has been directed against the School of the Americas, had no quibble with the variety of causes at the rally -- Free Mumia signs, anti-Bernanke signs, calls for vegan farming. &amp;quot;All these diverse messages here, they&amp;#39;re in the process of being connected to Wall Street.&amp;quot; It was a good thing. &amp;quot;The Tea Party brought out this anger against finance, but they were directed elsewhere by corporate money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

What did our pollsters ask &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time? To be weird, instead of asking a series of completely random questions, they focused on “Things Republicans Don’t Know.” For example, you’d think Republicans might know what “GOP” stands for, as they’ve all got those “GOProud” stickers on their repo’d Ford Expeditions. But they have no idea, and most probably pronounce it as a monosyllabic grunt, to ask for another microwaved styrofoam plate of CostCo “rib-meat bitelets.”  This may be the best survey of America yet! &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans also can’t keep track of who we’re supposed to HATE, because it’s so confusing since Reagan and Bin Laden tricked the Soviets into going to Afghanistan, to die as an empire, just like we did these last 10 years. So, to be safe, most Republicans &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; want to nuke the Soviets and also see Saudi Arabia as an actual Enemy of America that we are having wars against, even though the Holy Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s favorite ally in the War Against Muslims. The way Republicans see the world, you’d think Saudi Arabian terrorists successfully attacked New York and the Pentagon and totally terrorized the whole country into submission! (Oh wait ….)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2011/11/60-minutes-poll-201111"&gt;Vanity Fair press release:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMOST HALF OF REPUBLICANS THINK BOTH RUSSIA AND&lt;br&gt;
SAUDI ARABIA ARE ENEMIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS CONSIDERED THE MOST DECADENT CITY IN THE U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST MORE THAN HALF OF REPUBLICANS KNOW WHAT “G.O.P.” STANDS FOR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just more than half of Republicans (51 percent) and 45 percent of Americans overall correctly identify the meaning of “G.O.P.” as Grand Old Party. The second most popular choice, with 35 percent of the overall vote, was “Government of the People.” “Grumpy Old People” received 7 percent of the vote, “God’s Own Party” 3 percent, and 1 percent thought the abbreviation stood for “Gauntlet of Power.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;i&gt;unfair&lt;/i&gt;, survey people! You are not allowed to just make shit up because &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; a fraction of people will say “Yep that sounds right” no matter what you say. Unfair. Uncool. [&lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2011/11/60-minutes-poll-201111"&gt;Vanity Fair/CBS Poll Thing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

WHENNNN????" width="250" height="118"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All America really wants or prays for at this point is a RICK PERRY SEX SCANDAL to make life worth living again, but here’s some “placeholder” dirt the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story_4.html"&gt; dug up&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime: Perry’s family leased a back woods Texas hunting camp for the last couple decades where the Perrys have hosted hawt ritual gatherings to hump state political cronies and talk road kill recipes. Just to “fit in” in that part of the country, the camp was long ago insanely named “Niggerhead” on a big marker stone at the entrance, because that’s what racist Texas landowners have always called everything in rural Texas, to be dicks. At issue in this story is exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; Perry realized this was a racist name so that, uh, we can decide on a scale of one to ten how racist is Rick Perry. Maybe a 12? Perry says the family changed the name right away, in the eighties. Seven other sources told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; “eh, it was named that until a couple years ago.” &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the WaPo &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story_4.html"&gt;report: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mother and father went to the lease and painted the rock in either 1983 or 1984,” Perry wrote. “This occurred after I paid a visit to the property with a friend and saw the rock with the offensive word. After my visit I called my folks and mentioned it to them, and they painted it over during their next visit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ever since, any time I ever saw the rock it was painted over,” Perry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry’s version of events differs in many respects from the recollections of seven people, interviewed by The Washington Post, who spoke in detail of their memories of seeing the rock with the name at various points during the years that Perry was associated with the property through his father, partners or his signature on a lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few grafs further down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other local who visited the ranch with Perry during those years recalled the rock standing upright with the name visible. He said it was painted over years later; he was not sure exactly when but recalled remarking about the change with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We kind of laughed about it,” recalled this person, who said he would probably vote for Perry if he wins the Republican nomination. “My recollection is that it was several years ago. We were laughing because he had it painted. Because it had always been there. You couldn’t miss it, right there at the gate going in. We laughed about, ‘Rick’s covering his tracks.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAHAHAHA, a powerful white guy GOP Texas politician trying to pretend all of a sudden he isn’t racist. That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good one.

&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hat tip to &lt;a href="http://southernbeale.wordpress.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southern Beale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the news that Bloomberg Markets magazine has uploaded a new expose on “&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html"&gt;The Secret Sins of the Koch Brothers&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... A Bloomberg Markets investigation has found that Koch Industries—in addition to being involved in improper payments to win business in Africa, India and the Middle East—has sold millions of dollars of petrochemical equipment to Iran, a country the U.S. identifies as a sponsor of global terrorism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Internal company documents show that the company made those sales through foreign subsidiaries, thwarting a U.S. trade ban. Koch Industries units have also rigged prices with competitors, lied to regulators and repeatedly run afoul of environmental regulations, resulting in five criminal convictions since 1999 in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From 1999 through 2003, Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties and judgments. In December 1999, a civil jury found that Koch Industries had taken oil it didn’t pay for from federal land by mismeasuring the amount of crude it was extracting. Koch paid a $25 million settlement to the U.S.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Phil Dubose, a Koch employee who testified against the company said he and his colleagues were shown by their managers how to steal and cheat—using techniques they called the Koch Method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1999, a Texas jury imposed a $296 million verdict on a Koch pipeline unit—the largest compensatory damages judgment in a wrongful death case against a corporation in U.S. history. The jury found that the company’s negligence had led to a butane pipeline rupture that fueled an explosion that killed two teenagers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Former Koch employees in the U.S. and Europe have testified or told investigators that they’ve witnessed wrongdoing by the company or have been asked by Koch managers to take what they saw as improper actions…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“How much lawless behavior are we going to tolerate from any one company?” asks David Uhlmann, who oversaw the prosecution of the Koch refinery division when he was chief of the environmental crimes unit at the U.S. Department of Justice. “Corporate cultures reflect the priorities of the corporation and its senior officials.”...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It’s worth reading the &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt;, although if you’re easily agitated you may want to have your blood-pressure medication at hand.  Charles and David Koch have been accused, and frequently &lt;em&gt;convicted&lt;/em&gt;, of every possible crime this side of dog fighting &amp;amp; kiddy porn—and if they could find a safe-at-one-remove “corporate” method of profiting from those hobbies, it sure doesn’t sound like they’d hesitate due to issues of morality or the general public welfare.  They’re living embodiments of the old J.P. Morgan quote:  &lt;em&gt;“Whatever isn’t nailed down, is mine.  Whatever I can pry loose, wasn’t nailed down.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
