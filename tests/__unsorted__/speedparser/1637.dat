      <description>"Suffering" in Iran has nearly doubled, up from 14% in 2008 to 26% in 2011. One factor that may play into this increase is the lack of good jobs, as Gallup finds unemployment in the country above 15% and underemployment exceeding 35%.</description>

      <title>Democrats Dispirited About Voting in 2012</title>
      <description>Democrats are as likely to be "less enthusiastic" about voting in 2012 as they are to be "more enthusiastic." This contrasts with Democrats' strong enthusiasm during 2008 and 2004, and differs markedly from Republicans, who, by 2 to 1, are more rather than less enthusiastic today.</description>
