&lt;p&gt;In 2001, at least a dozen years after EPO had first begun to kill cyclists and destroy the reputation of cycling, the sport finally got an EPO test. Despite promising that any new EPO test would be applied to stored samples, the UCI decided to apply the test only to new samples. Still, something's better than nothing. Isn't it? And so long as the test was properly applied to all riders going forward, well, it'd catch the cheats. Wouldn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UCI, in its &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/1/19/1944770/tough-on-doping-tough-on-the-causes-of-doping-in-the-beginning-was"&gt;40 Years Fighting Against Doping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; document, released in 2001, reported the arrival of the EPO test as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;EPO IS DETECTABLE: THE 'MONSTER' HAS BEEN VANQUISHED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Success at last! During the Tour des Flandres, on 8 April 2001, the UCI proceeded with antidoping tests that can detect if exogenous EPO has been taken. The analyses of 40 riders who were tested were given to the laboratory of the University Institute of Legal Medicine (IUML) in Lausanne, and all produced negative results. No reliable method of detection existed previously. The blood tests set up by the SSCC measured the haematocrit value of riders, but were unable to detect its source - endogenous or exogenous (artificial). For health reasons, and not so much as a sanction, riders whose value exceeded 50% (47% for women) had an enforced rest period of 15 days imposed on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The situation changed drastically at the beginning of 2001.Thanks to the laboratory of Châtenay-Malabry (F), led by Prof. de Ceaurriz, it is now possible to prove through a urine test that a person has taken EPO to artificially enhance their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In close co-operation with other federations, the UCI validated the new test on 1 April 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"EPO, the star doping substance of the 1990s, captured the attention of the sporting world and of numerous laboratories for more than ten years. The sports federations were clearly unable to fight as effectively as they wanted to against a substance that remained undetectable for the researchers themselves. This problem has now been overcome, the 'monster', while not having been completely defeated, has at least been seriously injured!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those &lt;a href="http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/1/19/1944770/tough-on-doping-tough-on-the-causes-of-doping-in-the-beginning-was"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; with this document produced by the UCI, it will come as no surprise to learn that the above contains a number of mistakes, mis-statements and mis-directions. The EPO 'monster' was far from vanquished. The LNDD test was far from effective. And the 2001 Spring Classics were far from as pristine as the UCI tried to suggest by claiming that the Ronde was clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of April 18, at the start of the Flèche Wallone, Swiss cyclist Roland Meier (Team Coast) was subjected to a blood test. The results of this encouraged the testers to select him for a post-race anti-doping control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, April 19, Danish cyclist Bo Hamburger (CSC-Tiscali) was subjected to an out of competition anti-doping test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meier and Hamburger had been team-mates at TVM in the mid-nineties. But that was not the only thing they had in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 10, the Danish cycling union broke the news that Bo Hamburger was positive for EPO. A few days later, Hein Verbruggen hinted at the existence of a second EPO positive, while attending an international haematology congress in southern France. The Swiss Federation subsequently announced that the rider involved was Roland Meier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Jacques de Ceaurriz, director of the LNDD, had been &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/world/europe/04iht-lance.html"&gt;bullish &lt;/a&gt;when the EPO test was introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cyclists should be worried because they won't be able to take EPO the way they did in the Tour de France in 1998 and 1999. It's a major breakthrough, and gives us fresh impetus in the fight against drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Bengt Saltin, the Swedish head of the Danish anti doping agency, seemed to be echoing De Ceaurriz in his ebullience when he &lt;a href="http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/2001/may01/may11news.shtml"&gt;spoke to the media&lt;/a&gt; about the Hamburger case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought the cyclists were smarter. The test is so reliable that there will be no one that takes EPO without being caught. They might not have known how precise the test is, but now they do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saltin's confidence in the UCI's EPO test was mis-placed. The urine-based EPO test could only detect the drug if it had been used within seventy-two hours of the test. The test itself was easily defeated using detergent. And, in it's early use, was far from reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with the test was that it produced false negatives. The science bit: the test used electrophoresis to compare the quantities of basic isoforms of certain proteins in the urine sample. More means more likely to have used EPO. You or I might show a percentage of basic isoforms in the high twenties to low forties, depending on who is telling you these things. The IOC set a threshold of eighty percent (one IOC-accredited laboratory in Paris - presumably Chatenay-Malabry - actually sometimes used a threshold of eighty-five per cent) which includes a safety margin of more than three standard deviations from a mean value, calculated from the validation studies for persons who tested negative, plus an additional precautionary allowance of 10%. The CAS were of the opinion that this produced the probability of a false positive in one in fifteen thousand case. They didn't compute a figure for false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular micro-dosing kept riders below the threshold without diminishing the effectiveness of the drug. This would become especially clear once scientists started explaining the workings of the EPO test to the riders and their entourages, particularly when they told them about that large middle ground between a clean sample and one they would have to declare dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of false negatives, in 2008 the Copenhagen Muscle Research Centre in Denmark released &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/sports/26iht-26doping.14001565.html"&gt;results &lt;/a&gt;of a study it had conducted the previous year. Eight young men were dosed with EPO over a period of seven weeks. For the first two weeks they received injections of EPO every other day (the booster phase), followed by two weeks of weekly injections (the maintenance phase), followed by a three week period of no EPO use (the post phase). Urine samples were collected throughout the study period. These were submitted to two different WADA-accredited laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first laboratory correctly identified the use of EPO in all samples during the initial 'booster' phase of the study. The second laboratory declared only one sample to be positive and the other seven samples to be suspicious, but not positive. During the maintenance and post phases, the first laboratory declared two samples to be positive, three to be suspicious and the remaining nineteen to be clean. The second laboratory declared all the samples to be clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of sixty-four samples submitted to the two labs, eleven were correctly identified as being positive, ten were declared to be suspicious and the remaining forty-three were declared clean. The better performing lab had a 68.8% chance of declaring a false negative, the worse 96.9%. And this was in 2007. Six years after the EPO test had been introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2001, the UCI conducted 271 urinary EPO tests. Of those tests, 96% were not positive. The monster had been vanquished. Indeed. The eleven that did result in positives being declared were: Roland Meier (Team Coast), at the Flèche Wallonne; Bo Hamburger (CSC-Tiscali) in an OOC test the day after the Flèche; Sergio Barbero (Lampre) and Laurent Chotard (Mercury-Viatel) at the pre-Giro leg-loosener, the Tour de Romandie; Pascal Hervé (Alexia), Riccardo Forconi (Mercatone Uno) and Dario Frigo (Fassa Bortolo) during the Giro d&amp;#39;Italia; Txema del Olmo (Euskatel-Euskadi) at the Tour de France; the Swedish rider Niklas Axelsson at the World Championships; and Massimo Strazzer and the former USPS rider Juan Llaneras at the track World Championships. I&amp;#39;ll leave you to discover for yourself how many of those cases failed to result in suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think the chances of beating the UCI's test were high, think about what the IOC were doing. At the Sydney Olympics in 2000 - and again at the Salt Lake Winter Olympics in 2002 - the IOC used a combined blood/urine EPO test. An athlete needed to be positive under both tests in order to be declared positive. At Sydney, the blood test - which had a greater window of opportunity than the urine test's three days - highlighted nine athletes, none of whom were positive under the urine test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UCI chose to use only the LNDD-developed urine test as proof of EPO use, but would also sometimes use a blood test as a screener. This is what happened in Meier's case. No blood was drawn in Hamburger's case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/2001/nov01/nov09news.php"&gt;According &lt;/a&gt;to the head of the IOC medical commission, Patrick Schamasch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The urinary test alone is not sufficient to be able to determine a final result. We must keep in mind the legal questions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing of Meier and Hamburger's B samples commenced on June 5th. The testing was carried out by the same laboratory as had conducted the analysis of their A samples: the IUML. The B tests were witnessed by representatives of the riders. The results were passed back to the UCI and the respective federations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2001 it was announced by the Swiss Cycling Federation that Meier's B sample confirmed the A and accordingly he was to be suspended for eight months, with that ban suspended for the off-season. He would not be eligible to return to the pro &lt;i&gt;peloton&lt;/i&gt; until July 19, 2002. He was also handed some financial penalties. He appealed his suspension to CAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were a bit more complicated for Bo Hamburger. Hamburger seemed to attract complications. Like his Salbutamol bust at the Tour de l'Avenir in 1993. Or an alleged confession to having used Ventoline and Pulmicort in 1998. Or his Corticoids bust at the Tour de France in 1999. In June it was announced that his B sample had confirmed the result of the A. Hamburger was initially found guilty of using EPO by the Danmarks Cykle Union (DCU), but appealed this to the Danmarks Idraets-Forbund (DIF), the Danish Olympic committee. In August they cleared Hamburger of EPO use, citing a procedural error in the testing of his B sample. DIF spokesman Finn Mikkelsen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this case the problem was that there were two analytical results on the B sample. The lab has not given any indication of why there are two results - therefore there was doubt about the B result and thus the result from the B sample. I admit this is a strange case. The decision respected the EPO test, but they did not accept the circumstances around the B test."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UCI appealed DIF's decision in the Hamburger case to the CAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Laurent Rivier, of the Laboratoire Suisse d&amp;#39;Analyse du Dopage at the Institut Universitaire de Medicine Légale (IUML) in Lausanne, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/drugs_in_sport/1484524.stm"&gt;discussed &lt;/a&gt;the EPO test and the case of Bo Hamburger with the Danish newspaper, &lt;i&gt;Ekstra Bladet: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The tests are not one hundred per cent trustworthy but I think the UCI wanted to make one step forward to get things going and to diminish the massive use of EPO that has been observed in the cycling environment. The UCI definitely took some risks with introducing this test but now it will be interesting to see the legal effects it will have in the case of Bo Hamburger."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/sites/CaseLaw/Shared%20Documents/343.pdf"&gt;CAS decision in the Hamburger case&lt;/a&gt; makes for interesting reading. The most important part - from our point of view today - relates to the non-existence of an EPO threshold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The UCI's rules do not contain any provision whereby a sample can be considered positive only if the rEPO exceeds a certain threshold. Evidence of even only minimal quantities of rEPO is sufficient for it to constitute a violation of the UCI's Antidoping Regulations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UCI's amended rules, which came into force on March 15, had this to say about the testing for EPO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"the presence of an abnormal concentration of an endogenous hormone in class E or its diagnostic marker(s) in the urine of a competitor constitutes an offence unless it has been proven to be due to a physiological or pathological condition".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike the evidence required for certain substances such as nandrolone or caffeine, the UCI's rules do not provide that a result is positive only if the rEPO in the urine of a person who is tested exceeds a certain threshold. Rather, evidence of even only minimal quantities of rEPO is sufficient for it to constitute a violation of the UCI's Antidoping Regulations. The methods used by the IOC at the Sydney Olympic Games ultimately had the same objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS went on to state that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"the UCI's rules do not lay down any thresholds for the laboratory analysis. In particular, the threshold prescribed by the IOC, whereby a sample cannot be found to be positive unless more than 80% of the EPO findings are in what is called the 'basic range' of the test results, does not apply within the scope of application of the UCI's rules."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This threshold proved to be important. While the IUML testing of Hamburger's A sample had been above the IOC threshold, the testing of his B sample was more confusing. When first tested, it produced a value below the IOC threshold, 78.6%. The IUML staff had to carry out a second test on the B sample in order to produce a value - 82.4% - above the IOC threshold and consistent with the A sample, which showed 82.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUML's director, Martial Saugy, was satisfied that, even though Hamburger's B sample had first produced a value below the IOC threshold, that value itself could still prove the use of EPO. Saugy expressed the view to the CAS that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"there was no scientific justification for an 80% threshold and that a level marginally below 80% was reliable enough to allow one to assume a positive result."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saugy also suggested to the CAS that if they wanted to insist on the 80% threshold then the average of the two tests on the B sample produced a result above that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS decided that - effectively - Saugy and the staff at the IUML took a subjective 'I know it when I see it' approach to identifying EPO use. Worse, the CAS found that the IUML did not appear to apply their own rules consistently. In the case of Hamburger, Saugy was happy that an A sample above the IOC threshold could be supported by a B sample below that threshold. But had that A sample been below the IOC threshold he would have declared Hamburger clean, without reference to his B sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS found in favour of Hamburger, finding that the double analysis of the rider's B sample did not confirm the results of the A sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the test results of the B sample have not been measured using the same standards as in the A sample, the A sample is not confirmed, rather a new analysis has been carried out pursuant to a different method of evaluation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roland &lt;a href="http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/sites/CaseLaw/Shared%20Documents/345.pdf"&gt;Meier had also taken his case to the CAS&lt;/a&gt;, but his appeal was based on a variety of minor procedural errors of an administrative nature, along with the usual guff about the test itself being a piece of crap and the 'hey, could a face like this lie to you?' defence. In laughing Meier off the stage - his really was a slam-dunk case and the only grace the CAS showed him was to bring forward the commencement of his ban (meaning it would expire on May 17 2002) and reduce the fines imposed upon him - the CAS did make the following point with regard to the absence of a threshold for the detection of EPO in the UCI's rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In connection with the evaluation of the test results, it should be pointed out that the UCI's rules and regulations - unlike those of the IOC - do not lay down any threshold which must be reached for the finding to be positive. Although the Panel does not consider such thresholds to be absolutely necessary in the rules and regulations of the federations, they are desirable to enable greater objective verification and, moreover, also for the purposes of acceptability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of such a threshold, the CAS said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"the Panel must review, on a case by case basis, whether the levels, upon which the laboratory based its decision, justify a positive finding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS also again criticised the subjective 'I know it when I see it' approach to identifying EPO use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The witnesses [including the IUML's Martial Saugy] called by the Respondent [the UCI] gave the impression in their testimony that the finding of a positive doping result was based more on experience and subjective judgement than on objective reference points. The Panel does not, however, consider the standard, 'I know it when I see it', to be sufficient. The personal experience of a laboratory employee, no matter how much experience that employee has, is not sufficient to establish a positive doping result."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAS decisions in the cases of both Bo Hamburger and Roland Meier were delivered on January 28, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our trawls earlier this year through the fight against doping in the nineties the IUML cropped up a couple or three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, it was the IUML that the Canadian researcher, &lt;a href="http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/2/16/1997823/tough-on-doping-tough-on-the-causes-of-doping-francesco-conconi-and"&gt;Guy Brisson&lt;/a&gt;, was teamed up with in order to get the UCI's support, when he sought to develop a test for EPO. Brisson had wanted to carry out blood tests on riders at the Tour de Romandie, but the riders refused. Eventually, they agreed to allow themselves to be tested at the Tour de Suisse, after having received guarantees about the anonymity of the testing due to be carried out. Brisson's research, you will recall, came to nothing. Or, at least according to the UCI, it came to nothing. He himself, in 1998, claimed that he had actually developed a test for EPO which the UCI refused to implement, for fear of being sued by big name riders with deep pockets and guilty consciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the IUML was also at the forefront of the UCI's fight against &lt;a href="http://www.podiumcafe.com/2011/3/9/2040247/tough-on-doping-tough-on-the-causes-of-doping-the-h-test-what"&gt;PFCs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;40 Years Fights Against Doping&lt;/i&gt; again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the beginning of the 1999 season, PFC was put on the list of prohibited substances. The UCI, which in August 1998 commissioned the University Institute of Legal Medicine (IUML) in Lausanne, headed by Prof. Patrice Mangin, to checking for any presence of PFC in the blood of riders, has never recorded an offence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tests, you will recall, started some months after Mauro Gianetti had been taken ill at the Tour de Romandie and was thought to have used PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001 Patrice Mangin and two IUML colleagues, Laurent Rivier and Martial Saugy, drew up a list of the principle doping products being used in the &lt;i&gt;peloton&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting their side effects. As well as the usual suspects - EPO, steroids and corticosteriods - that list also included PFC. How the IUML knew PFC was being used if, as the UCI claimed, they had never once found any evidence of its use in the blood samples they tested ... well that's a question that has never been satisfactorily answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, while a newly developed test for homologous blood transfusions was being validated, the IUML were brought in. WADA at this stage were eager not to publicise the existence of such a test. The IUML applied the test to samples collected from cyclists, including some from the Tour de Romandie. The results were communicated to the UCI. For some reason, never satisfactorily explained, the UCI's Chief Medical Officer, Mario Zorzoli, discussed the results of those tests with at least one rider, effectively telling him to get his act together before the new test was introduced officially. Michael Ashenden, one of the developers of the new test, was particularly unhappy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can understand why they would be reluctant to embroil themselves in controversy and bust too many cyclists. But when you know someone has done this [cheated], and you don't go after them, there's no excuse in my mind for that. At that point, I was disgruntled, to say the least, with their attitude. We bust our guts to get the test in place and they then don't see it through."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the IUML's Martial Saugy was asked his opinion of the retrospective testing of urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France, which had apparently shown evidence of the use of EPO. Here's what he had to say then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You are looking at numbers and signals, but in the end what is most important here is the experience of the eyes of an expert. It's the 'now we see it - this looks like someone who has injected EPO."'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent months, the IUML has been back in the news concerning the EPO test and the early months of its implementation. Martial Saugy had this to say to the &lt;i&gt;Neue Züricher Zeitung&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They [the four suspect samples] were taken at four different stages [during the Tour de Suisse in June 2001], so I don't know whether they were from four different riders or all of the same athlete. But the tests were not covered up, and it is also not correct that they could have been interpreted as positive. They were suspect, and you wouldn't stand a chance at all with that sole argument in front of a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Paris laboratory of Chatenay-Malabry fixed the criteria for a positive test result. An athlete was positive only if eighty percent of the signs typical for the use of synthetic EPO were found. [A suspect sample was one that] showed between seventy and eighty percent of the typical EPO parameters. That meant that the probability of doping was high. But because such a result can also be produced naturally, it was all about excluding false positives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is Saugy speaking in 2011, nine years after the CAS pointed out that the UCI had no EPO threshold in 2001. Ten years after he and his IUML colleagues tried to bust Bo Hamburger using test results which fell below the 'threshold.' This is the same Martial Saugy who told the CAS then that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"there was no scientific justification for an 80% threshold and that a level marginally below 80% was reliable enough to allow one to assume a positive result."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that the IUML is sometimes referred to as being the UCI's lab in Lausanne?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;&amp;lt; new Twitter Search and Image view&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fmB15ER3LUQ?rel=0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter brings the most meaningful information in the world right to your pocket. And, we're constantly working on ways to make that even better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One good search can take you #anywhere.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today we're starting to roll out a completely new version of Twitter search. Not only will it deliver more relevant Tweets when you search for something or click on a trending topic, but it will also show you related photos and videos, right there on the results page. It's never been easier to get a sense of what's happening right now, wherever your curiosity takes you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you use this new version of &lt;a href="http://firefox.twitter.com/"&gt;Firefox with Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, you can type a #hashtag or @username directly into the address bar to go right to a search results page (try #idol) or someone's profile page (like @nba). Simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;140 characters, now worth 1,000 words.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millions of people share photos on Twitter every day. We're going to make that easier than ever. Over the next several weeks, we'll be releasing a feature to upload a photo and attach it to your Tweet right from Twitter.com. And of course, you'll soon be able to easily do this from all of our official mobile apps. A special thanks to our partner &lt;a href="http://photobucket.com/"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt; for hosting these photos behind the scenes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For users without smartphones, we're working with mobile carriers around the world so you can also send photos via text message (MMS). Share what's happening in your world, anywhere you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're really excited about our new search and photos experiences and can't wait for you to try them. We believe both make a huge difference in making the world feel even smaller.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23958943-2483145912913567161?l=blog.twitter.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt; the tool that&amp;#39;s behind the famous Google Flu Trends&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It all started with the flu. In 2008, we found that the activity of certain search terms are good indicators of actual flu activity. Based on this finding, we launched &lt;a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends"&gt;Google Flu Trends&lt;/a&gt; to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries. Since then, we’ve seen a number of other researchers—including &lt;a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/04/predicting-present-with-google-trends.html"&gt;our very own&lt;/a&gt;—use search activity data to estimate other real world activities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, tools that provide access to search data, such as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#"&gt;Google Insights for Search&lt;/a&gt;, weren’t designed with this type of research in mind. Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend. In other words, they wanted a system that was like Google Trends but in reverse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is now possible with &lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/"&gt;Google Correlate&lt;/a&gt;, which we’re launching today on &lt;a href="http://www.googlelabs.com/"&gt;Google Labs&lt;/a&gt;. Using Correlate, you can &lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/upload"&gt;upload your own data series&lt;/a&gt; and see a list of search terms whose popularity best corresponds with that real world trend. In the example below, we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like [cold or flu] in a similar pattern to actual flu rates. Finding out these correlated terms is how we built Google Flu Trends:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rRssnqcabRc/Td0dloLxSaI/AAAAAAAAIEY/49kHGc8x0y4/s1600/cdc+influenza.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rRssnqcabRc/Td0dloLxSaI/AAAAAAAAIEY/49kHGc8x0y4/cdc+influenza.png" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can also enter a search term such as [&lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=ribosome&amp;amp;t=weekly"&gt;ribosome&lt;/a&gt;] and find other terms whose activity corresponds well over time with the one you’re interested in:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-K4sBBhkOY/Td0dkknIJGI/AAAAAAAAIEU/vh8G_7wTgyM/s1600/ribosome.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-K4sBBhkOY/Td0dkknIJGI/AAAAAAAAIEU/vh8G_7wTgyM/ribosome.png" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It turns out cell biology isn’t all too popular in the summer time (sorry biologists!). What’s interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for [ribosome] brings up searches for other biology terms, such as [mitochondria].  Of course, correlation isn’t the same thing as causation, so we can’t explain why two terms follow the same pattern. But my guess in this case is that both terms are popular when schools teach these concepts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Search activity is an incredible source of data that may lead to advances in economics, health and other fields; but we need to handle that data with privacy controls in mind. With this system, we don’t care what any one person is searching for.  In fact, we rely on millions of anonymized search queries issued to Google over time, and the patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:-webkit-auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;We encourage you to read our &lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/whitepaper.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; describing the methodology behind Google Correlate. Or for lighter reading, check out our &lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/comic"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt;! We’ve enjoyed uploading different data sets to see fascinating and sometimes perplexing correlations. Plug in your data and &lt;a href="http://correlate.googlelabs.com/feedback"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; what you find.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run a small software business in central Japan.  Over the years, I’ve worked both in the local Japanese government (as a translator) and in Japanese industry (as a systems engineer), and have some minor knowledge of how things are done here.  English-language reporting on the matter has been so bad that my mother is worried for my safety, so in the interests of clearing the air I thought I would write up a bit of what I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Quick Primer On Japanese Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is an archipelago made up of many islands, of which there are four main ones: Honshu, Shikoku, Hokkaido, and Kyushu.  The one that almost everybody outside of the country will think of when they think “Japan” is Honshu: in addition to housing Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, and virtually every other city that foreigners have heard of, it has most of Japan’s population and economic base.  Honshu is the big island that looks like a banana on your globe, and was directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… to an extent, anyway.  See, the thing that people don’t realize is that &lt;strong&gt;Honshu is massive&lt;/strong&gt;. It is larger than Great Britain.  (A country which does not typically refer to itself as a “tiny island nation.”)  At about 800 miles long, it stretches from roughly &lt;strong&gt;Chicago to New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;.  Quite a lot of the reporting on Japan, including that which is scaring the heck out of my friends and family, is the equivalent of someone ringing up Mayor Daley during Katrina and saying “My God man, that’s terrible — how are you coping?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public perception of Japan, at home and abroad, is disproportionately influenced by Tokyo’s outsized contribution to Japanese political, economic, and social life.  It also gets more news coverage than warranted because one could poll every journalist in North America and not find one single soul who could put Miyagi or Gifu on a map.  So let’s get this out of the way: Tokyo, like virtually the whole island of Honshu, got a bit shaken and &lt;strong&gt;no major damage was done&lt;/strong&gt;.  They have reported 1 fatality caused by the earthquake.  By comparison, on any given Friday, Tokyo will typically have more deaths caused by traffic accidents.  (Tokyo is &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; massive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyagi is the prefecture hardest hit by the tsunami, and Japanese TV is reporting that they expect fatalities in the prefecture to exceed 10,000.  Miyagi is 200 miles from Tokyo.  (Remember — Honshu is massive.)  That’s about the distance between &lt;strong&gt;New York and Washington DC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japanese Disaster Preparedness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is &lt;strong&gt;exceptionally&lt;/strong&gt; well-prepared to deal with natural disasters: it has spent more on the problem than any other nation, largely as a result of frequently experiencing them.  (Have you ever wondered why you use Japanese for “tsunamis” and “typhoons”?)  All levels of the government, from the Self Defense Forces to technical translators working at prefectural technology incubators in places you’ve never heard of, spend quite a bit of time writing and drilling on what to do in the event of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your reference, as approximately the lowest person on the org chart for Ogaki City (it’s in Gifu, which is fairly close to Nagoya, which is 200 miles from Tokyo, which is 200 miles from Miyagi, which was severely affected by the earthquake), my duties in the event of a disaster were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ascertain my personal safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report to the next person on the phone tree for my office, which we drilled once a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Await mobalization in case response efforts required English or Spanish translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogaki has approximately 150,000 people.  The city’s disaster preparedness plan lists exactly how many come from English-speaking countries.  It is less than two dozen.  Why have a maintained list of English translators at the ready?  Because &lt;strong&gt;Japanese does not have a word for excessive preparation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another anecdote: I previously worked as a systems engineer for a large computer consultancy, primarily in making back office systems for Japanese universities.  One such system is called a portal: it lets students check on, e.g., their class schedule from their cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feature of the portal, printed in bold red ink and obsessively tested, was called Emergency Notification.  Basically, we were worried about you attempting to check your class schedule while there was a wall of water coming to inundate your campus, so we built in the capability to take over all pages and say, essentially, “Forget about class.  Get to shelter now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our clients are in the general vicinity of Tokyo.  When Nagoya (again, same island but very far away) started shaking during the earthquake, here’s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T-0 seconds: Oh dear, we’re shaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+5 seconds: Where was that earthquake?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+15 seconds: The government reports that we just had a magnitude 8.8 earthquake off the coast of East Japan.  Which clients of ours are implicated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+30 seconds: Two or three engineers in the office start saying “I’m the senior engineer responsible for X, Y, and Z universities.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+45 seconds: “I am unable to reach X University’s emergency contact on the phone.  Retrying.”  (Phones were inundated virtually instantly.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+60 seconds: “I am unable to reach X University’s emergency contact on the phone.  I am declaring an emergency for X University.  I am now going to follow the X University Emergency Checklist.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+90 seconds: “I have activated emergency systems for X University remotely.  Confirm activation of emergency systems.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+95 seconds: (second most senior engineer) “I confirm activation of emergency systems for X University.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T+120 seconds: (manager of group)  ”Confirming emergency system activations, sound off: X University.”  ”Systems activated.”  ”Confirmed systems activated.”  ”Y University.”  ”Systems activated.”  ”Confirmed systems activated.” …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While this is happening&lt;/em&gt;, it’s somebody else’s job to confirm the safety of the colleagues of these engineers, at least a few of whom are out of the office at client sites.  &lt;em&gt;Their&lt;/em&gt; checklist helpfully notes that confirmation of the safety of engineers should be done by visual inspection first, because they’ll be really effing busy for the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the view of the disaster from the perspective of a wee little office several hundred miles away, responsible for a system which, in the scheme of things, was of very, very minor importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenes like this started playing out up and down Japan within, literally, &lt;strong&gt;seconds of the quake&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mall I was in started shaking, I at first thought it was because it was a windy day (Japanese buildings are designed to shake because the alternative is to be designed to fail catastrophically in the event of an earthquake), until I looked out the window and saw the train station.  A train pulling out of the station had hit the emergency breaks and was stopped within 20 feet — again, just someone doing what he was trained for.  A few seconds after the train stopped, after reporting his status, he would have gotten on the loudspeakers and apologized for inconvenience caused by the earthquake.  (Seriously, it’s in the manual.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everything Pretty Much Worked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about trains for a second.  &lt;del&gt;Four One of them were washed away by the tsunami.&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;All Japanese trains survived the tsunami without incident.&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;Edited to add&lt;/strong&gt;: Initial reports were incorrect.  Contact was initially lost with 5 trains, but all passengers and crew were rescued.  See &lt;a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20110313-OYT1T00013.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in Japanese.]  All &lt;del&gt;of the rest&lt;/del&gt; — including ones travelling in excess of 150 miles per hour — made immediate emergency stops and &lt;strong&gt;no one died&lt;/strong&gt;.  There were no derailments.  There were no collisions.  There was no loss of control.  The story of Japanese railways during the earthquake and tsunami is the story of an &lt;strong&gt;unceasing drumbeat of everything going right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was largely the story up and down Honshu.  Planes stayed in the sky.  Buildings stayed standing.  Civil order continued uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the train line between Ogaki and Nagoya, one passes dozens of factories, including notably a beer distillery which holds beer in pressure tanks painted to look like gigantic beer bottles.  Many of these factories have large amounts of extraordinarily dangerous chemicals maintained, at all times, in conditions which would resemble fuel-air bombs if they had a trigger attached to them.  &lt;strong&gt;None of them blew up&lt;/strong&gt;.  There was a handful of very photogenic failures out east, which is an occupational hazard of dealing with large quantities of things that have a strongly adversarial response to materials like oxygen, water, and chemists.  We’re not going to stop doing that because modern civilization and it’s luxuries like cars, medicine, and food are dependent on industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; response of Japanese engineering to the challenge posed by an earthquake larger than any in the last century was to &lt;strong&gt;function exactly as designed&lt;/strong&gt;.  Millions of people are alive right now because the system worked and &lt;em&gt;the system worked&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the system worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this happened was, I say with no hint of exaggeration, one of the triumphs of human civilization.  Every engineer in this country should be walking a little taller this week.  We can’t say that too loudly, because it would be inappropriate with folks still missing and many families in mourning, but it doesn’t make it any less true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s Talk Nukes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lot of panicked reporting about the problems with two of Tokyo Electric’s nuclear power generation plants in Fukushima.  Although few people would admit this out loud, I think it would be fair to include these in the count of systems which functioned exactly as designed.  For more detail on this from someone who knows nuclear power generation, which rules out him being a reporter, &lt;a href="https://morgsatlarge.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/why-i-am-not-worried-about-japans-nuclear-reactors/"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instant response — scramming the reactors — happened exactly as planned and, instantly, removed the Apocalyptic Nightmare Scenarios from the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were some failures of important systems, mostly related to cooling the reactor cores to prevent a meltdown.  To be clear, a meltdown is not an Apocalyptic Nightmare Scenario: the entire plant is designed such that when everything else fails, the worst thing that happens is somebody gets a cleanup bill with a whole lot of zeroes in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure of the systems is contemplated in their design, which is why there are so many redundant ones.  You won’t even hear about most of the failures up and down the country because a) they weren’t nuclear related (a keyword which scares the heck out of some people) and b) redundant systems caught them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tremendous public unease over nuclear power shouldn’t be allowed to overpower the conclusion: nuclear energy, in all the years leading to the crisis and continuing during it, is &lt;em&gt;absurdly&lt;/em&gt; safe.  Remember the talk about the trains and how they did exactly what they were supposed to do within seconds?  Several hundred people still drowned on the trains.  That is a tragedy, but every person connected with the design and operation of the railways should be justifiably proud that that was the worst thing that happened.  At present, in terms of radiation risk, the tsunami appears to be a wash: on the one hand there’s a near nuclear meltdown, on the other hand the tsunami disrupted something &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dangerous: international flights.  (One does not ordinarily associate flying commercial airlines with elevated radiation risks.  Then again, one doesn’t normally associate eating bananas with it, either.  When you hear news reports of people exposed to radiation, keep in mind, at the moment we’re talking a level of severity somewhere between “ate a banana” and “carries a Delta Skymiles platinum membership card”.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far and away the worst  thing that happened in the earthquake was that a lot of people drowned.  Your thoughts and prayers for them and their families are appreciated.  This is terrible, and we’ll learn ways to better avoid it in the future, but considering the magnitude of the disaster we got off relatively lightly.  (An earlier draft of this post said “lucky.”  I have since reworded because, honestly, screw luck.  Luck had absolutely nothing to do with it.  Decades of good engineering, planning, and following the bloody checklist are why this was a serious disaster and not a nation-ending catastrophe like it would have been in many, many other places.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s economy just got a serious monkey wrench thrown into it, but it will be back up to speed fairly quickly.  (By comparison, it was probably more hurt by either the Leiman Shock or the decision to invent a safety crisis to help out the US auto industry.  By the way, wondering what you can do for Japan?  Take whatever you’re saying currently about “We’re all Japanese”, hold onto it for a few years, and copy it into a strongly worded letter to your local Congresscritter the next time nativism runs rampant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few friends of mine have suggested coming to Japan to pitch in with the recovery efforts.  I appreciate your willingness to brave the radiological dangers of international travel on our behalf, but that plan has little upside to it: when you get here, you’re going to be a) illiterate b) unable to understand instructions and c) a productivity drag on people who are quite capable of dealing with this but will instead have to play Babysit The Foreigner.  If you’re feeling compassionate and want to do something for the sake of doing something, find a charity in your neighborhood.  Give it money.  Tell them you were motivated to by Japan’s current predicament.  You’ll be happy, Japan will recover quickly, and your local charity will appreciate your kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of myself and the other folks in our community, thank you for your kindness and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Somewhere, sometime, this is all going to end in tears.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By John Mauldin, &lt;a href="http://investorsinsight.com"&gt;Investors Insight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the world is focused on the Middle East and Libya, and rightly so. We will look at that in a minute. (Sidebar: the White House spelled the country “Lybia” in a recent tweet. Can you imagine what the liberal media would have done to poor Dan Quail if that tweet was from him? Just saying.) And I agree the Middle East is important. But my eyes are focused on what I think is the far more important event of the day, and that is the election going on in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written about Ireland before, but we need to once again focus on what are not smiling Irish eyes. Ireland was once the envy of Europe, with one of the highest growth rates in the world. It was not long ago that Ireland could borrow money at lower rates than Germany. Now rates are 6% and likely to rise with the new government. Let’s look at a few data points from a brilliantly written article by Michael Lewis, who ranks as one of my favorite writers. When he writes, I read it just for the education on what great writing should look like, as well as for the always fascinating information. The article is at &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/03/michael-lewis-ireland-201103"&gt;http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/03/michael-lewis-ireland-201103&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I am often asked about how you can become a financial writer by young people who are starting out. I have just two suggestions. Write a lot and then write some more. Writing is no different than the piano or guitar. It takes a lot of practice, and then more practice. You don’t start playing concerts on day one, and your writing won’t be worth much either, but you will get better. Second, study the great writers and learn from them. Try to copy the styles of the guys you like for practice. Take the best and make it your own style. Lewis is one of the best.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      Housing prices in Dublin had risen by 500% since 1994. Rents for homes were often 1% of the price of the home. A $1-million-dollar home went for $833 a month. That is a very clear bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      Irish home prices implied an economic growth rate that would leave Ireland, in 25 years, three times as rich as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      In 1997 the Irish banks were funded entirely by Irish deposits. By 2005 they were getting most of their money from abroad. The small German savers who ultimately supplied the Irish banks with deposits to re-lend in Ireland could take their money back with the click of a computer mouse. Since 2000, lending to construction and real estate had risen from 8 percent of Irish bank lending (the European norm) to 28 percent. One hundred billion euros—or basically the sum total of all Irish public bank deposits—had been handed over to Irish property developers and speculators. By 2007, Irish banks were lending 40 percent more to property developers than they had to the &lt;em&gt;entire Irish population&lt;/em&gt; seven years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      As the scope of the Irish losses has grown clearer, private investors have been less and less willing to leave even overnight deposits in Irish banks and are completely uninterested in buying longer-term bonds. The European Central Bank has quietly filled the void: one of the most closely watched numbers in Europe has been the amount the ECB has loaned to the Irish banks. In late 2007, when the markets were still suspending disbelief, the banks borrowed 6.5 billion euros. By December of 2008 the number had jumped to 45 billion. As Burton spoke to [Lewis], the number was still rising from a new high of 86 billion. That is, the Irish banks have borrowed 86 billion euros from the European Central Bank to repay private creditors. In September 2010 the last big chunk of money the Irish banks owed the bondholders, 26 billion euros, came due. Once the bondholders were paid off in full, a window of opportunity for the Irish government closed. A default of the banks now would be a default not to private investors but a bill presented directly to European governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      A political investigative blog called Guido Fawkes somehow obtained a list of the Anglo Irish foreign bondholders: German banks, French banks, German investment funds, Goldman Sachs. (Yes! Even the Irish did their bit for Goldman.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      [And this is the kicker!] “Googling things, &lt;strong&gt;Kelly learned that more than a fifth of the Irish workforce was employed building houses. The Irish construction industry had swollen to become nearly a quarter of the country’s G.D.P.—compared with less than 10 percent in a normal economy—and Ireland was building half as many new houses a year as the United Kingdom, which had almost 15 times as many people to house.&lt;/strong&gt;” [That makes the US housing bubble look small by comparison.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·      And just for fun: “A few months after the spell was broken, the short-term parking-lot attendants at Dublin Airport noticed that their daily take had fallen. The lot appeared full; they couldn’t understand it. Then they noticed the cars never changed. They phoned the Dublin police, who in turn traced the cars to Polish construction workers, who had bought them with money borrowed from Irish banks. The migrant workers had ditched the cars and gone home. Rumor has it that a few months later the Bank of Ireland sent three collectors to Poland to see what they could get back, but they had no luck. The Poles were untraceable: but for their cars in the short-term parking lot, they might never have existed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s turn to that repository of all things leftist, the UK &lt;em&gt;Guardian,&lt;/em&gt; as they write about today’s elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Extra “15 Million” Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though the campaign has shed disappointingly little light on realistic options ahead, the financial numbers are scary. After 2000 the early Celtic Tiger years became a property-led speculative bubble, made worse by weak planning laws and 300,000 too many new homes. The crash saw GDP collapse by 11%, unemployment triple to 13.3% and government debt quadruple to 95%, which will rise to 125% by 2014 on IMF estimates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about that for a moment and compare it to the US. We built somewhere between 2 and 3 million too many homes in our bubble, depending on whom you ask. Total Irish population (including Northern Ireland) is 6 million people. If the US had built the same number of excess homes, there would have been 15 million of them! And the banks just kept lending!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish taxpayers are being asked to pay French, German, and British bond banks and the ECB, which bought that debt. It is 30% of their GDP, along with the rest of the debt. At 6% interest, that means it will take 10% of their national income just to pay the interest. It guarantees that Ireland will be in a poverty cycle for decades. The ECB and the IMF seem to think the solution for too much debt is more debt. And in order to pay the ECB, the Irish must take on an austerity program that guarantees even worse recessions and higher unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government that agreed to take on the bank debts is going to be voted out in spectacular fashion today. Whether one party can win or has to form a coalition government is not yet clear, but the mandate is to renegotiate the Irish debt. Both the ECB and the Germans have said that is not possible, that deals have been made. But asking Irish voters, you don’t get the sense they feel the same obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the venerable Martin Wolf of the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; agrees. Writing last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what might a new government seek to do? Its degrees of freedom are, alas, limited. Even excluding recapitalisation of the banks, the primary fiscal deficit (before interest payments) was close to 10 per cent of GDP last year. Under the IMF programme, this is to be turned into a surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2015. Given the lack of access to private markets, the deficit would have to be eliminated even more quickly without the official assistance. Again, the debt overhang would be huge, under any plausible assumptions. Ireland is doomed to fiscal stringency for decades, given its poor growth prospects, at least in comparison with its Tiger years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apart from the Armageddon of a sovereign default, two partial escapes exist. The more trivial would be a reduction in the rate of interest on Ireland’s borrowing: a 1 per cent reduction in the rate of interest would save the state 0.4 per cent of GDP a year. That would be a small help, at least. A more valuable possibility would be a writedown of existing subordinated and senior bank debt, which currently amounts to €21.4bn (14 per cent of GDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ECB and the other members of the European Union have vetoed this idea, fearful of contagion. Indeed, the assistance package was partly to prevent just such an outcome. Yet the idea that taxpayers should bail out senior creditors of massively insolvent banks at such risk to the solvency of their state is both unfair and unreasonable. If the rest of the EU is determined to protect senior creditors, it should surely share in the cost of doing so. Why should the &lt;a title="FT - Irish voters remain wary of a left turn" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f324866-3ac2-11e0-9c1a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1EXuvmZ8C"&gt;taxpayers of the borrowing country&lt;/a&gt; pay all? The new Irish government should make this point firmly.” (&lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/436234b8-3ebb-11e0-834e-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz1F1aZpM1L"&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/436234b8-3ebb-11e0-834e-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz1F1aZpM1L&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a significant number of Irish voters who wonder why they should pay any of it. Not the majority (yet), but enough. This is the Maginot Line for the ECB. If they renegotiate with Ireland, then Greece will be at the door in a heartbeat. Ditto for Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one story I read about Ireland said, “Parties we go to now are going away parties as people, especially young people, leave for other countries with better opportunities.” The mood of the country will grow more dour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this chart. Notice how well Iceland did after it simply repudiated its debt. It wasn’t easy, and inflation is brutal, but they are better off than if they had taken on a debt burden that would have made them indentured servants to British taxpayers for decades. The ECB, the IMF, and the rest of the EU is asking Ireland to willingly fall into a lengthy depression. Would walking away from the debt, or restructuring it, be any worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="jm1" src="http://pragcap.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jm12.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="350"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the opening negotiating line started was, “We will repay the principle, but no interest, and the timeline has to be stretched out over 25 years?” And no payments for five years. Oh, and we have about 300,000 houses you can have as our first payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Irish would be frozen out of the bond market. It would result in an even more serious recession. But they could actually grow their way out of it over time. A lot faster than if they were trying to pay off the debt at 6-7% interest. And remember that Argentina, for God’s sake, got money just a few years after defaulting – twice, if I remember right! If Ireland got back on a sound footing, they could once again find acceptance in the bond market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, that sounds radical. But give it a few years of austerity and see what the next elections bring. Irish debt will default, not because the Irish don’t have hearts of gold or don’t want to not pay their debts, but because they are under such a burden they can’t. And eventually enough voters will realize that. It may not be next month, or even next year, but it will come. You can only ask so much of a people. Defaulting on sovereign debt is only unthinkable in elite European Union circles. And asking German voters to pay for those defaults? Care to run on THAT platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to really roil the debt markets, not to mention the interbank markets. The US is doing ok, except that job creation has been slow. A European debt crisis could throw a wrench into the world gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the heart of the problem. The Irish really do want to do the right thing. The Greeks, not so much. Portugal? Spain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leadership of the EU is living in denial if they think that more debt is the answer to too much debt. It is all well and good for the Germans to tell everyone to cut back (and they should) but to do so means that the countries go into recession and have even less money to pay their debt burdens. They get into a debt spiral and the only way out is restructuring, which is default by a nice name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, sometime, this is all going to end in tears. The EU will be better off restructuring the debt, letting insolvent banks go the way of all flesh, or financing them and letting the euro drop like a stone, which will only make their exporting companies more competitive (not good for the US and China, but we don’t get to vote in the EU). Or they can break up. I think the former is better than the latter, but that’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world went crazy with debt. The US, Japan (where I fly to in less than 12 hours), much of Europe, and Great Britain. And now we have to deal with it. Acting like adults would be best, and recognizing that some countries just can’t assume their banking debts is just being realistic. A lot of people made bad choices and now those choices are coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all so very sad. People are hurting. I read the blogs in Ireland and it brings tears to me Irish eyes (or the large part of me that is of Irish heritage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no easy answers. No easy button. The only button we have is the reset button, for the Blue Screen of Death. That means pulling the plug and starting over. This time with realistic debt levels and bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Thoughts on the Middle East&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me offer a different, and perhaps cynical, view of what’s happening in the Middle East. First, the army was in control in Tunisia and Egypt, and still is. Some things will change, and hopefully the false, crony capitalism will be one of the things to go; but I don’t think we will see sweeping changes for some time. Libya is 2% of the world’s oil supply. Other than that, they are like Greece. They are not that big a player. Gaddafi is on his way out. His bank accounts are being frozen. He will end up in Venezuela or some equally wonderful place. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bad guy. The new leadership will most likely be the army, and it will get the oil turned back on as soon as possible. (See the trend here?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the idea that Saudi Arabia can make up for Libyan oil is a little fanciful. Libyan oil is light sweet crude, and it takes three barrels of Saudi oil to make as much diesel as Libyan oil. Oil could get very volatile and move up strongly if Gaddafi hangs on too long. $4 gas is not out of the question here in the US if he doesn’t leave soon; but at the end of the day, not too much will change in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key place to watch is Bahrain. Now THAT is an issue. It is a strategic country with the US 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; fleet based there, and it has a large Shiite population that could ally with Iran. There is no real way of knowing what will happen there, and that is something I have my Google notes set to watch, along with talking from time to time with George Friedman of Stratfor. Nice to have friends with inside information. But even he is not sure tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia? Pay attention, but so far it looks like the changes are still in the future. One day it will change, but it doesn’t appear imminent (although anything can happen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I hope changes? Maybe the Iran street will force some change. I am on record saying that one day Iran will be our new best friend. The population is young and getting younger. They’re on the Internet. They see what the world is like and they want it. Maybe not this year or next, but it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quick sidebar: My friend Barry Habib pointed out an interesting trend: the first day of the month has been a big up day for the markets.  And I think we could have a solid job number on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;
