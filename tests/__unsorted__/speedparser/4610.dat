Many
People were not yet familiar with the whole virtualenv and pip workflow, so I thought
I would put up the steps I use to get Pinax up.

&lt;script src="http://gist.github.com/87646.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/pinax-developer-quickstart/</guid></item><item><title>A simple Django life stream</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/simple-django-life-stream/</link><description>After reading Ryan Bergs' "The basics of creating a tumblelog with Django" &lt;a href="http://ryanberg.net/blog/2008/jun/24/basics-creating-tumblelog-django/"&gt;(part1)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ryanberg.net/blog/2008/jul/2/basics-creating-tumblelog-django-part-2/"&gt;(part2)&lt;/a&gt;, I realized that I wanted a similar tumblog/life stream but I didn't want to have to go through all the work of saving those objects to the database.  After all, isn't all that data already stored in their respective systems.  And since I am using FriendFeed, which is again duplicating all that data, I don't want to be duplicating it yet another time.
&lt;p/&gt;
That's when the light bulb went off.  Using the FriendFeed API and a bit of caching I can pull in my lifestream from FriendFeed using only a custom tag.  So I came up with what I call &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/"&gt;lifefeed&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;
Just add "lifefeed" to your installed apps and you can now do this from any template
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{% load lifefeed %}{% load cache %}
{% cache 900 friendfeed %}
	{% lifefeed "YOUR FRIEND FEED USERNAME" %}
{% endcache %}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You can use the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/source/browse/trunk/templates/friendfeed.html"&gt;default friendfeed.html template&lt;/a&gt; that comes with &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/"&gt;lifefeed&lt;/a&gt; or use your own.  You will most definitely want to use your own CSS to style the items since &lt;a href="http://socialistsoftware.com/site_media/css/friendfeed.css"&gt;I am no CSS guru&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/"&gt;lifefeed&lt;/a&gt; is very simple right now but I would like to add more to it.  Like&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate duplicate twitter/pownce/brightkite posts&lt;?li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display FriendFeed comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;
To see an example of &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/"&gt;lifefeed&lt;/a&gt; in action check the sidebar on this page, you may have to scroll down a bit.
&lt;p/&gt;
So what do you think?</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/simple-django-life-stream/</guid></item><item><title>Intense Debate Import Hack</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/intense-debate-import-hack/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wanted to try out the &lt;a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/"&gt;Intense Debate&lt;/a&gt; commenting system on this blog.  I didn't want to lose all the comments that I had already and Intense Debate only supports importing comments from Blogger, etc but not custom blog software.  Since I wrote this blog using the &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; framework using &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/comments"&gt;django.contrib.comments&lt;/a&gt; I needed to come up with my own solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took one &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966"&gt;Tamper Data&lt;/a&gt; request to see how an anonymous comment was posted into the Intense Debate system.  A few minutes later I had a script to import my old comments into Intense Debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="/site_media/python/intenseDebate.txt"&gt;intenseDebate.py&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
import intenseDebate
intenseDebate.postComment(blogpostid="", acctid="", anonName="", anonEmail="", \
    anonURL="", comment="")
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;blogpostid&lt;/b&gt; is the unique Intense Debate postId.  You can find this easily on any Intense Debate powered page using the &lt;a href="http://getfirebug.com/"&gt;firebug&lt;/a&gt; dom tab.  The key to look for is "IDCommentScript".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;acctid&lt;/b&gt; is your Intense Debate accountId.  This can also be found using the firebug dom tab.  The key to look for is "IDWUserWidget.acctid"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;anonName&lt;/b&gt; is the name of the commenter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;anonEmail&lt;/b&gt; is the commenters email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;anonURL&lt;/b&gt; is the commenters web address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;comment&lt;/b&gt; is the text of the comment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This method of importing comments does have it's problems.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual process to get the blogpostid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No way of getting the Date/Time into Intense Debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
But it's better than no comments at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Footnote: I don't have a problem with Django comments, especially when paired with &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-comment-utils/"&gt;django-comment-utils&lt;/a&gt;, I just wanted to give Intense Debate a try.

Friday after work I am going to Coors Field to watch the Rockies vs. the Devil Rays.  I am driving straight from the game to DIA to catch the red eye into Logan where I will pick up my rental car and go directly to the &lt;a href="http://open.e-scribe.com/wiki/DjangoDotJune"&gt;Django in June&lt;/a&gt; un-conference.
&lt;p/&gt;
I am really looking forward to this.  It will be great to meet some of the great people in the Django community.  I also hope to meet some people in Boston that might be interested in helping me populate &lt;a href="http://boston.bardiver.com/"&gt;boston.bardiver.com&lt;/a&gt; with some more great bars.  To ensure that this happens I will also be bringing with me some &lt;a href="http://boston.bardiver.com/blog/post/bardivercom-schwag/"&gt;BarDiver.com Schwag&lt;/a&gt; to give out. ;)
&lt;p/&gt;
Once the conference is done with I will be driving up to New Hampshire to play golf with my Dad on Fathers Day.  This should be a lot of fun.  This will be the 3rd time I have played this year.  After that and a quick visit with my Grandmother, I will be driving back into Boston to catch my flight back to Denver.

Sunday night I might actually get 8 hours of sleep before I have to be at work again on Monday morning.</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/django-june/</guid></item><item><title>Adding Lijit support to your RSS feeds</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/adding-lijit-support-your-rss-feeds/</link><description>I just finished &lt;a href="http://bardiver.com/blog/post/you-got-your-bardivercom-my-lijit/"&gt;adding Lijit support to one of the BarDiver.com RSS feeds&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
Lijit is a new service that aggregates your online identities and makes them searchable.  You can get more information on &lt;a href="http://www.lijit.com/about"&gt;Lijit here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
Lijit can use any RSS feed as and identity but with just a little extra work you can add meta information to that RSS feed to add even more value.  The &lt;a href="http://www.lijit.com/dev/rss"&gt;Lijit developers RSS page&lt;/a&gt; has all the info but the basics are straight forward.  For every &amp;lt;item&amp;gt; in the RSS feed add a &amp;lt;category&amp;gt; tag that contains either the text ".good" or ".bad".  For an example check out my BarDiver.com profile &lt;a href="http://bardiver.com/feeds/visitedBars/jay/"&gt;visited bars feed&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see the &lt;a href="http://www.lijit.com/informers?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbardiver.com%2Ffeeds%2FvisitedBars%2Fjay%2F"&gt;results here&lt;/a&gt;.  Those little green and yellow markers show that you got it right.
&lt;p/&gt;
Lijit is a great service that I can really see taking off.  I hope this encourages more developers to add Lijit support to their RSS feeds.</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/adding-lijit-support-your-rss-feeds/</guid></item><item><title>BarDiver.com Launches</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/bardivercom-launches/</link><description>Back in September I said that I was working on a surprise project.  Well today I am happy to announce that &lt;a href="http://bardiver.com/"&gt;BarDiver.com&lt;/a&gt; has officially launched.  BarDiver.com is a community driven search site to help you &lt;a href="http://bardiver.com/"&gt;find local bars&lt;/a&gt; that have the features and atmosphere you like.
&lt;p/&gt;
For this first release I am keeping BarDiver.com focused on Colorado only.  If that is a success and I get interest to open BarDiver.com for another city/state I will absolutely do that.  So please, check out the site and if you think your area could use BarDiver.com, &lt;a href="http://bardiver.com/contact_us/"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
BarDiver.com is built using the &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django web framework&lt;/a&gt;.  Django was instrumental in getting the site up fast.  I cannot get over how great Django is to work with.  I was able to use many of the goodies built into Django instead of writing them (again) myself.  Some of these things are the authentication, comments, sites, flatpages and of course the admin user interface.  I am really looking forward to the many cool new things that are being worked on in the seperate Django branches, such as &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/MultipleDatabaseSupport"&gt;Multiple Database Support&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/GenericAuthorization"&gt;Generic Authorization&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
I hope you enjoy BarDiver.com
&lt;p/&gt;
Dive In.</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/bardivercom-launches/</guid></item><item><title>Copper Conferencing Launches</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/copper-conferencing-launches/</link><description>I am proud to release yet another Django powered web site.  &lt;a href="http://copperconferencing.com/"&gt;Copper Conferencing&lt;/a&gt; went live last night.  &lt;a href="http://www.twentystar.com/"&gt;(twentystar)&lt;/a&gt; and I turned this site out in record time.
&lt;p/&gt;We have at least two more sites that are very close to being released and one really BIG surprise coming in the near future.
&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/copper-conferencing-launches/</guid></item><item><title>Groovix Testimonial</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/groovix-testimonial/</link><description>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skabber/203353738/" title="Photo Sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/58/203353738_6d61c430d6_m.jpg" width="214" height="240" alt="Groovix web" style="float:right;margin:6px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A while back I purchased a new computer from &lt;a href="http://groovix.com/"&gt;Open Sense Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.  I was tired of Linux hardware compatibility problems and I wanted something that was guaranteed to just work out of the box.  Not long after I had the machine OSS contacted me with a survey.  Now you can see my testimonial on the front page of their &lt;a href="http://groovix.com/"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p/&gt;
I have wanted to write a review of my new machine, but I just haven't got around to it.  But as you can tell from my testimonial, I really like it.</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/groovix-testimonial/</guid></item><item><title>I am going to The Future of Web Apps</title><link>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/i-am-going-future-web-apps/</link><description>I am going to &lt;a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/index.html"&gt;The Future of Web Apps&lt;/a&gt; conference this September and I was wondering if any other Django peeps were going to be there.
&lt;p/&gt;
I hope to hear some stories and advice from people who have had success in this business.  I also hope to pimp my super secret new web site.  Built with &lt;a href="http://djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; of course.
&lt;p/&gt;
I will be in San Francisco for the 2 days of the conference and I will be sticking around till Sunday to explore the city and eat a ton of sea food.  So if there are any like minded Django fans that are going to be in town, maybe we can meet up for a drink one night.</description><guid>http://socialistsoftware.com/post/i-am-going-future-web-apps/</guid></item></channel></rss>
