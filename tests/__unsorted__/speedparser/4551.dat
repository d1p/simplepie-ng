  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_b4bab9c2e6fcc844&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aug 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it starts with a girl, it ends with a girl. I've stopped smoking. This is day 0. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dreading 6-7 o'clock tonight. That's usually when my energy dips, and usually when my attempts to stop smoking fail on the first day. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've got the just stopped smoking sweats, and talking to people is gradually becoming more surreal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;And here come the second hardest few hours of the first day not smoking. Wish me luck! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the worst of it has passed for today. Lots of little moments when I pause, expecting to leave for a smoke break. Silly brain. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;My jaw aches with searing pain. About to go for dental surgery, and feeling very nervous about it. Still not smoking. This is day 1. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really want to smoke, even though I know that smoking doesn't actually help with the pain. Stupid cravings, I'm not listening to you. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 04 , 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to smoke so much right now. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 04, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emergency dentist appointment at 2, and I'm smoking again. I forgot how foul these things taste. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 04, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a parting shot, the roots snapped off while the devil tooth was being extracted. The dentist has forbidden me to smoke. This is day 0. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 05, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am smoking again. Apparently my need to emotionally pacify myself trumps my rational sensibilities. I will stop again soon. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 17, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stopped smoking. This is day 0. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aug 17, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saw a fat woman on a bench smoking a cigarette. Occurred to me how much she looked like a big baby with a dummy in her mouth. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sep 06, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have recently become an expert at throwing cigarette butts into a plant-pot. What a useless skill. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nov 29, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stopped smoking today. This is day 0. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nov 29, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's flavour is strawberry. Just walked past a couple making an igloo in a field with bricks fashioned from snow. That's very romantic! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nov 30, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cigarettes were the first thing I thought of this morning, and they'll probably be the last thing I think of tonight. This is day 1. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nov 30, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm having one of these lollipops for breakfast every day that I go smoke free, as a sort of good luck ritual. Today's flavour is apple. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 01, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want you, but I don't want to need you.&amp;quot; This is day 2. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 01, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cherry is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 02, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still waiting for that &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; feeling to go away. Thankfully, my feeling of pride is much stronger. This is day 3. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 02, &amp;nbsp;2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lime-Lemon is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;My sense of smell is starting to reassert itself. The most pungent thing in my life at the moment seems to be my bathroom. This is day 4. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watermelon is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watermelon is a really strange flavour for a lollipop. Not sure I like it. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 03, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've sent 70 tweets today. Wow. I knew I'd been tweeting a lot. But fuck me. Been fun though. Lots of drama. I blame my stopping smoking. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 04, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nice to wake up with a coffee instead of a coughing fit. This is day 5. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 04, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orange is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 05, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretty surprised my willpower survived a night out, and a hangover. Go me. This is day 6. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 05, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lemon-Lime is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 06, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crazy weekend. Not a single smoke though, not even a &amp;quot;cheeky&amp;quot; one that &amp;quot;doesn't count.&amp;quot; Think I'm on the home straight now. This is day 7. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 06, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orange is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 07, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pipes frozen, no running water, lost my wallet, and everything else seems to be going wrong. But I will not be broken. This is day 8. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 08, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still no running water, and now I'm ill to boot. Chowing down on the Lemsip, and wishing I could wash my hands. This is day 9. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 08, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orange is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 09, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ugh, still feel bunged up and feverish. Thought I'd had my fair share of illness this season. Still no running water either! This is day 10. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 09, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strawberry is today's flavour. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 10, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feverish, sore throat, cold, cough, blocked sinuses, ear ache, tooth ache, and no running water. YOU WILL NOT CRUSH ME. This is day 11. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 10, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watermelon is today's flavour. Though, truth be told, I'm not really in the mood for lollipops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 11, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today I learnt that you can manually flush a toilet with a bucket of water collected from an external tap. This is day 12. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 11, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orange is today's flavour. Only one lollipop left, so no more of these tweets. They lasted me two weeks though, which is good going. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 12, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laying on the sofa, taking it easy, and trying not to worry about feeling so ill. This is day 13. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 13, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just booked a doctor's appointment. This is day 14. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 14, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;My doctor gave me the all clear, for now. This is day 15. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 15, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know you're ill when you're using &amp;quot;I didn't cough up blood today&amp;quot; as a baseline for feeling well. This is day 16. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dec 31, 2010 &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who needs new year's resolutions? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is day 32. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://addictionis.org/this-is-day-0/&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1LDgXLCWQ4cJ8JuXITGExzkH_0g&quot;&gt;http://addictionis.org/this-is-day-0/&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_eb6baf77658f4280&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The context for this dream was so apparent to me, that I didn't even think to mention it. &amp;nbsp;But that does rather assume that you know enough about my life to share the context, which you don't. So, I'll try to fix that now. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was at an exhibition of &amp;quot;contemporary art&amp;quot; quite recently. It was a strange type of thing that lacked even the veneer of profundity. It was trite, but without any of the pretence. Or maybe the pretence was thin enough to see right through it. At least with some other things, you get an initial impression of profundity. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was told a story about Andy Warhol where he was asked about the meaning of a series of self-portraits he'd done. Apparently, he replied that there was none, and that he'd just been bored. I'm not sure how apocryphal this is, as I cannot find any reference to it on the web. Anyone know anything more about that? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the same impression I got from this exhibition. That the people responsible had been a bit bored, and rather fancied the idea of being &amp;quot;an artist.&amp;quot; Instead of developing their craft, they decided to &amp;quot;break the rules.&amp;quot; Not that I'm in any position to criticise. I'm terrible at art. But I don't think I'd put on an exhibition, either. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, what really amuses me about the whole thing is that the sign for this exhibition labelled it quite proudly as &amp;quot;contemporary art.&amp;quot; And it seems that my subconscious mind felt like inventing a term to retro-fit over that claims. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_58df613c1070b43f&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The sense of perspective that goes into a name like Contemporalism or Modernism is actually more nuanced that temporal provincialism. In both cases, the focus is less on the present, and more on the present in comparison to the past. But ultimately, they both seem to forget that time moves forwards. Any concept that anchors itself in a word that changes meaning as time progresses would seem to fall in the same category. Is there a name for this? It reminds me of something Morris Bishop wrote. &amp;quot;The Middle Ages is an unfortunate term. It was not invented until the age was long past. The dwellers in the Middle Ages would not have recognized it. They did not know that they were living in the middle; they thought, quite rightly, that they were time's latest achievement.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;

  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_2f9426145d128f23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In part of my dream, we were attending some sort of class. I remember being sat around in rows, and listening to a teacher as he taught us stuff. Strangely enough, he seemed to be projected onto a screen, and the video looked very old. I say strangely, because he was asking questions and people were responding to them, and he was responding to the responses. I wondered for a time whether they were stooges, or perhaps he was just so good at what he does that he knew what people would be asking. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reminds me of this Eddie Izzard sketch: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqnJxafaOGbQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3tVKQyyBzFXrhuklf4P2SmWi_ZA&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJxafaOGbQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Language labs came in when I was at school, and that was great. They get that little cubicle, you have a a tape going round, headphones on. The tape will go 'Oú est la plume de ma tante?' And you go 'La﻿ plume de ma tante est pret de la chaise de ma tante. As well you know.' And the tape will go 'Oui, la plume de ma tante est pret de la chaise de ma tante.' And you go 'How does this tape know what I'm talking about?' And the tape would continue, 'Oú est la plume de mon oncle?' And you go 'La plume de mon oncle est bingie bongie boogie bongie.' And the tape will go Non! Pas du tout! Je ne﻿ me connais pas &amp;quot;bingie bongie boogie bongie&amp;quot;. Qu'est-ce que vous dites? Vous êtes un putain!'&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, He was teaching us about art theory, or perhaps cultural studies. I'm not sure. I'm tempted to look up what I'm about to describe to you, to see where the roots of the idea lie, but I am worried that I will contaminate the memory. He was teaching us about this thing he called Contemporalism. I'm not sure whether this was an artistic movement like Modernism, although it clearly suffers from the same temporally provincial nomenclature. I think perhaps, it was less about the mode in which art was created, and more about the mode in which it was consumed. But that's not to say it didn't reach back in and influence the production of art. Because I remember him giving some specific examples. But it was more cultural than this. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;My memories are, once again, fragmentary. I will try to assemble the scraps I can grasp on to, and maybe a picture of the large concept can be figured out. He said that Contemporalism has has its roots in the 80s. And from there, it started to grow, and blossom, throughout the 90s and into our current decade. I remember that he gave us these photocopied sheets from a book, which listed examples. Pop music, consumerism, microwave meals, the Yuppy culture, people flying to New York for weekend shopping trips. The examples all seemed linked to be linked by a sense of entitlement, an over-abundance of resources, and an excessive and wasteful squandering of them. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;It moved on to art, and started to list some really curious examples. I remember a Rubik's cube, but shaped like a pyramid. And all the coloured squares had been painted over really haphazardly. But there was this specific example which was so significance in the dream, I still remember the gist of it now. It was talking about an art gallery, but in the sense of it primarily being a building that should serve a purpose. It said that, in the view of Contemporalism, the building should either display art that is immediately understandable, or it should store art of the same nature that is not being displayed at the moment. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a really weird construction, but there were to key points in there that the teacher had to explain. The first one was the Contemporalist focus on immediacy. A work of art had to be immediately accessible. People are too busy and too rushed to be bothered with anything else. Culture needed to be bent to the shorter attention span of the MTV generation. What's the sense in putting in 10 minutes to understand a work of art, if the payout is not guaranteed to be worth it. Something which took days or weeks of study was completely out of the question. This married with the microwave meals, and excessive, entitled consumerism. They Contemporalists wanted a never ending stream of instantly understandable, instantly accessible, bite-sized objects that could be consumed one after the other. Presumably, to be shit out the other end in a stream of largely undigested diarrhoea. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second thing was a focus on utilitarianism. The Contemporalist wants to make sure that the physical building used as an art gallery is being used to its maximum potential. They couldn't justify an entire room being used for an installation, if 80 smaller ones could be installed in its place. And they certainly couldn't justify housing an exhibition that required the guests to stop and consider the meaning of the piece for any significant amount of time. It was seen was a waste of gallery resources, and of patron resources. The primary goal was was that you could walk around the gallery at a brusque pace, feeling good about yourself and the fact you were in an art gallery, while presumably stroking your chin and remarking on how wonderful and profound everything was. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, many artists had understood and embraced the move towards Contemporalism, and had started to create art to suite the zeitgeist. Our teacher gave us many examples of this. Unfortunately, most of them slip my mind. I do remember one example he was giving about special effects in films, and he was moving his hands around with these virtual blocks moving around as if he was holding them. We were watching him on a TV screen, if you remember. The graphics were very old, like something you'd see in the original Tron movie. It was a little strange. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he was doing this, I was using my iPad to find the lyrics to We Want Your Soul, by Adam Freeland. It seemed relevant at the time. I wanted to ask him if the lyrics were a commentary on Contemporalism. But I didn't have the balls to raise my hand and ask the question. So, instead, he told me off for playing around on my iPad and not concentrating! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here's boy bands, here's Mackers, here's Britney, here's cola. Here's pizza, here's TV, here's some rock and some roller. Watch commercials, long commercials, watch Jerry, not Oprah. Buy a better life from the comfort of your sofa. Here's popcorn, here's magazines, here's milkshakes, here's blue jeans. Here's padded bras, here's armpit wax, here's football shirts, here's baseball caps. Here's live talk-shows, here's video games, here's cola-lite, here's ten more lanes. Here's filter-tips, here's collagen lips, here's all-night malls, here's plastic hips. We want your soul.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;

         <title>A little too perfect</title>

  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_ab154a0dea8576ad&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was in a room, and we were watching TV, or talking about the news. My friend wanted to do something, he was planning something. I asked him what it was. I wanted to know the details. We could only discuss it in circles, starting from the beginning. Perhaps he wanted to escape, or find a way out of here. I was starting to get frustrated. Every time I thought we were getting somewhere, we'd be back to where we started. We were watching TV again, or talking about the news. Suddenly, my friend was gone, and I was talking to this famous actress. I wanted to know what was happening. Where had my friend gone? She was only interested in one thing. I didn't care. Some more people came into the room, and they asked me about the actress. We talked about it like it had been a film. She wasn't there any more. Someone put the TV on, and we watched it instead of talking. I was getting angry. Nothing seemed to make sense. I started to write my thoughts down onto some paper. People asked me why I was upset, so I explained it to them. By the time I had finished, they couldn't remember how I started. They looked at me like I was crazy, and they went to sit down to watch some TV. When I went over to them, they had gone. I told my friend I wanted to escape this place, so we got into his car. I told him that nothing was right, and he seemed to get it. The car was flying, and there was a curtain of fabric behind us. I was watching myself in the third person. It was happening again. I asked him if he thought this was normal. He grinned back at me. But the car wasn't moving. It was stationary, on a mat, against the cold hard concrete floor. We were in a warehouse. Behind the car, huge cushioned panels that extended towards the sky. These panels repeated, one after another, into the distance and over the horizon. We were in a warehouse as big as a city. I could see myself in the tiny car, so far away. The wheels were spinning, and we suddenly took off and started to bounce around in this space. A tiny car on a gigantic bed. Everything was padded like a mattress. My friend was laughing at the film. I didn't find it funny. I stood up from the sofa and started to shout. I wanted to get out of this place. I needed to escape. I ran through corridors, and into an old classroom. People were sat around waiting for appointments. I saw my friend behind the desk, handing out tickets. I took him by the scruff of the neck and demanded to know what was going on. I wanted him to wake me up. I didn't want a part of it any more. Stop making people forget things. He just looked at me, and smiled. I walked over to the window, and opened it. I threatened to jump out. I told him to stop playing his evil tricks on me. I jumped out of the window, and landed onto the couch. My friends were sat at the other end of the room, fixing the old TV and talking to each other. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a terrible description of the dream, but my memories of it are more emotional than they are based around narrative. It felt like something, or rather someone, wanted to lull me into a false sense of security. The more I struck out against the logic of the things around me, the more my circumstances would try to compensate by making things more enjoyable, or resetting any progress I had made. It felt like we were supposed to be having fun, in a very passive way. But the more this was forced on me, the more I fought against it, and more absurd things became from my perspective. People appeared and would talk to me just long enough to explain what was going on, before being replaced by someone else, or leaving. It felt like someone wanted things to be a calm as possible. But this lack of conflict is precisely what caused me to reject the nature of my reality. Things were too perfect. There are obvious connections here with Descarte's daemon, brains in vats, and the Matrix. I wondered whether this might make a good short story. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had been reading a letter. I think it was a letter I had sent someone. It told the story of meeting a wrestler. He'd been quite famous. We'd met in the street, and talked to each other about something unusual. I wanted to tell my friend about it. The letter was very normal. I remember reading it, and taking in all the details. Then right towards the end, it started to get a little strange. It talked about ribbons of red that were flying from the curb and sketched out lines that tie into concrete. I can't remember exactly what it said, so this is only an approximation. But it felt like it meant something important to the author, even though I couldn't work out what that was. Which is strange, given that I was the author. But I guess the same might happen if you were to return to one of your old own notebooks. Old entries without context still feel meaningful, even when they seem opaque. I remember thinking how wonderful it was that this story had ended so abruptly with some strange bits of poetry.
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_873cefdd7733e69b&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'd like you to imagine this totally realistic situation: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;You're at a job interview, but the company has told you that the other candidate is going to get a job. While you wait for the interview you know is pointless, you start to rummage through the pockets of the other people in the waiting room. When you find 10 coins in the pocket of the other candidate, you conclude that the person who's going to get the job has 10 coins in their pocket. What you don't realise is that the person who's going to get the job is actually you, and you happen to have 10 coins in your pocket. But you're also a lizard, so you have no interest in taking the job. And lizards aren't qualified for manual work anyway. The machinery wouldn't fit your lizard hands.

Then those books wherein the character 'builds' imperceptibly. &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; 'she bumped her head on the low beam' = height &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; 'she threw down the xxx impatiently' = short tempered. &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; I.e the character comes out through her actions and thoughts, not plain text? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; which is more interesting informative for the reader? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ah yes. &amp;quot;Show, don't tell.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This came up in the novel writing course I'm also doing at the moment. In one of the examples read out by a student, a set of keys is described as shaking in the protagonist's nervous hands. Our tutor pointed out that the nervousness of the character could be inferred from the fact that the keys were shaking. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this week's exercises were more about getting a feel for the characters, as an author who has to work with them — as opposed to describing them for the reader. Almost like you were building a library of resources to fall back on, as reference points and sketches of the landscape, while working on the final text. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hadn't realised how important this type of exercise was until a few weeks ago. On the novel writing course, we were asked to write the first paragraph of a story — without worrying about where the story was going, or who the characters were. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not knowing these things felt strange. I was adding bits of detail, because it sounded nice, or because I felt like there should be some detail in such and such a place. But without having a fuller picture, the choices I made felt quite arbitrary.

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_222e02ed4bf26f40&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[I woke up this morning, 10 minutes before my alarm was due. I had woken up during an exciting card game at a casino. While everything seemed perfectly normal about the scene at first, I realised within a few seconds that this game I had been playing doesn’t actually exist — and that I could probably jot down some notes about it while it was still fresh in my memory. I fumbled about for a notebook and a pencil, and took 14 pages of notes while still half asleep under the duvet. I have attached photographs of these 14 pages, along with a transcript I took over lunch. Diagrams have been described based on what was drawn, and what I still remember of the visuals. The text has been copied as faithfully as possible, but I have corrected for spelling, punctuation, and implied words — where necessary. All additions to the text have been marked up with square brackets.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Diagram showing schematic of table from above. The table is split into two major components. The largest of the components is divided lengthways into two halves, one for each team. On each team’s side, there is a mat in front of an array of betting slots that are recessed into the table. The betting slots run lengthways against the dividing element. To the left of the major component of the table is a raised platform on which a deck of cards is located. This platform also runs lengthways to the table and is flush with the dividing element of the major component of the table. On either side of the card platform is a recessed bucket in which the player’s chips or money can be deposited for easy access between rounds of play.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Diagram showing elevation of table features from angled side view. The dividing element of the major component of the table is seen raised from the betting slots on either side. The card platform can be seen to be raised by a lesser height. The betting slots and chip bucket are seen to be recessed into the table by some considerable depth. The team mats are padded slightly, but otherwise at the same height as the table surface.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Diagram showing four seats, one at each corner of the player mats. When a full game of four people is in session, one person sits on each seat. Each side of the table, being two people, comprises one team.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Game for four players. [There] was some thing about a tradition of wearing brightly coloured clothes. One colour for each corner of the square (table)[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Diagram showing close up of the card platform. There is a deck of cards located in the centre of the platform, and the top card is face up showing the Ace of Hearts. The foreground of the diagram shows a partial depiction of the chip bucket, with coinage deposited inside.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[An arrow is drawn, pointing to the deck of cards, with the note “one card is shown after the bets are placed[,] and [this] determines the winner.”] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Another arrow is drawn, pointing to the chip bucket, with the note “inset container for chips[,] or in my case[,] money. I started out using pound coins[,] but then used notes.”] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[I had pile of (possibly red or pink, and hence £50) notes in the chip bucket, and I remember taking them out at one point, and stuffing them into the betting slots. At this point, the croupier seemed embarrassed and remarked that I was increasing the stakes too early for her, and that she’d not had chance to familiarise herself with the game yet.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[The] money is bet into a single container in the row in front of you. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Diagram of the betting slots, as seen from the player’s view point. Two wider slots (marked as “wider side container” in both instances) are shown at either side of an array of regular sized slots.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bet is allowed to be a “bet or a bluff” / so you can put money down in one of the slots — but it could be money[.] That slot will OR wont correspond to the card shown. Opponent has to guess which you’ve done[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;If played with other people, each round, you swap turns to make the initial bet or the response bet (bid?)[.] If playing singly against the croupier — it is your turn every round[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The odds were about 50/50 of winning any round. If you won you doubled your money, but if you lost[,] you lost your money. Odds presumably stacked slightly towards house’s favour by wider end slots/royals?? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think you might have been able to chain bets — as pretty croupier I had been playing with wasn’t too hot on the rules, and when she realised she’d not been [putting/getting?] her own money [down/back?] — I wanted my last few bets back[,] which were still in the bet slot. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something about the game usually being played by stupid people — heh — and so I felt I had an advantage. Was building up to betting £100 — and was thinking about the potential £200 prize/win[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[I had been in some strange war simulation before this, and had been throwing metal gas canisters from half-demolished houses at the jeeps in the streets bellow. At some point later in the dream, I’d gone to get a drink from an almost empty vending machine in an abandoned canteen of sorts. I noticed that if I hit the buttons in the right order, I could get things out of it, along with twice the money I put into it. I became so obsessed with this idea of making small, easy, wins that I found myself in a casino.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rich cowboy type man asked my croupier to fetch him a drink, and I remember being annoyed that I couldn’t continue playing as long as she was gone from the table. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue was raised by my croupier that how would she know if my “play” (?) was a bet or a bluff. This had not occurred to me either — and we didn’t resolve the issue[.]. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[The] deck could have 1 or 2 jokers in it — and slots could correspond to guesses about the card that comes up[.] So even/odd, or suit. Joker would tip favour to house’s advantage[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Croupier might not have been required — she might just have been having a match with me?? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[After taking these notes, I left the house for a walk into town. Ace of Spades by Motörhead was the first song my music player decided to put on, selected completely at random. I couldn’t help but grin, and play air guitar, as I walked along the river. I made a quick note on my phone.“Explanation of bet or bluff. Either half of slot board only has one side of a/b bet. Even, red, high... If you're bluffing[,] you mean the opposite. Next player on your side has the opposite [(]in meaning, suite, colour[)] slots to bet with.” After having thought about it some more, it would make sense that the deck of cards had two jokers in it. Similar to a game of roulette, these cards stack the odds agains the player — like the green zero — because the slots are bets against properties of the cards that only exist in the suits. Such as red or black, odd or even, and what have you. Corresponding to this model, the two wider slots on either side might be bets against the jokers, like you can bet on the green zero when playing roulette.] &lt;br&gt;

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_890c19485c526235&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apologies to the people who are now bored of this subject. I realise my posts have become quite focused on this — but since taking two courses in creative writing, most of my free times has become almost completely saturated with reading and the associated course work. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this weeks's creative writing assignments, we were asked to pick a character from last week's work. I thought I'd go a little bit further than that, and pick two characters. I chose to pick the woman from the Wild Garden on the Wind piece, and the man from the Mystery on the Moors piece. It was only after working through these exercises that I realised how opposite they are to each other. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snap Judgements &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this exercise, we were asked to run through this list: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sex - Male, Female, Androgynous, Neutral &lt;br&gt; Age - Give a range rather than a specific age unless absolutely necessary &lt;br&gt; Physical Appearance – Eyes, Skin, Hair, Build &lt;br&gt; Movement – Mannerisms, Way Of Walking, Mobility &lt;br&gt; Verbal Expressions – Catchphrases, Slang, Pitch, Speed of Speech &lt;br&gt; Appearance – Clothes, Uniform, Cleanliness, Style &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without thinking about it too much, we were to use this as a way of building up an impression of the character — in the same way you build up an impression of someone within a few seconds of meeting them. I found it a little hard to visualise both characters, and ended up drawing on things I've noticed about other people — either in real life, or from fiction itself. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Wild Garden on the Wind &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A woman in her 70s. A healthy figure, wrinkled skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair. She’s walks slowly and with a sense of purpose. She’s always smiling, and has a soft, comforting voice. Her hair is messy and long — with a number of plaits, braids, wraps, and the occasional flower. Her fashion is eclectic, and includes floral shirts &amp;amp; dresses, scarfs, pendants, and sandals. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Mystery on the Moors &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man in his 30s. Slim, brown eyes, and dark hair. He fidgets when he sits, walks quickly, and is generally quite clumsy. He has a posh accent, and talks quietly &amp;amp; without confidence. He has a number of nervous ticks, and is constantly distracting himself by fiddling with his clothes or hair. He dresses smartly, and wears a dusty old jacket. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maslow's Hierarchy &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this exercise, we were to consider this hierarchy of needs: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Physiological Needs: Food, water, air shelter, sex &lt;br&gt; Safety: Security, stability, order, protection, freedom from danger &lt;br&gt; Social Needs: Love, acceptance, belonging &lt;br&gt; Ego Needs: Esteem, reputation, self respect, status &lt;br&gt; Self Actualisation: Creativity, self expression, fulfilment. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;For our character, we had to decide which stage of the hierarchy they had achieved. And from there — presumably — what their immediate wants, needs, and desires are. This was surprisingly useful for me, because it made me realise things about the characters that had not occurred to me before framing it within this context. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Wild Garden on the Wind = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s attained the Self Actualisation stage of the Maslow hierarchy. After living a long and fulfilling life — she finds joy &amp;amp; happiness in the smallest aspects of her existence. She wakes up early, tends to her garden, reads a story, talks walks around the neighbouring countryside, and sketches in her notebook. &amp;nbsp;She doesn’t need anything except a pillow to sleep on, and some food to eat. She wants is to live her life in harmony with the world around her, and to enjoy every day to its fullest potential. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Mystery on the Moors = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;He teeters between the Safety and Social Needs stages of the Maslow hierarchy. At his lowest points, he worries about his security and about his safety from the cold and nasty world he perceives. People intimidate him, and new situations scare him. Occasionally, he finds confidence through the love and acceptance of those around him. He needs stability, acceptance and a sense of belonging. He wants to find peace &amp;amp; harmony within himself. He desires a love, affection, and praise from people he feels close to. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Character Questions &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last exercise was to run through these questions: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;- When was he/she happiest? &lt;br&gt; - What talent would he/she like to have? &lt;br&gt; - If he/she could change one thing, what would it be? &lt;br&gt; - What is his/her greatest achievement? &lt;br&gt; - What is his/her most treasured possession? &lt;br&gt; - What is his/her greatest extravagance? &lt;br&gt; - When does he/she lie? &lt;br&gt; - What is his/her greatest regret? &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without thinking about it too much, I simply answered them from the perspective of an omniscient narrator. I tried to keep it short and sweet. Again, some of these were harder than I expected — and I really had to think about it for a while, trying to imagine what this invented person would feel or do in a certain situation. Others came very naturally to me. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Wild Garden on the Wind = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When was she happiest? &lt;br&gt; A. Falling in love with her husband. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What talent would she like to have? &lt;br&gt; A. Better artistic skill at painting and music. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. If she could change one thing, what would it be? &lt;br&gt; A. She wished she was closer to her children. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is her greatest achievement? &lt;br&gt; A. Raising a happy family. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is her most treasured possession? &lt;br&gt; A. brooch that belonged to her mother. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is her greatest extravagance? &lt;br&gt; A. She dances with wild abandon. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When does she lie? &lt;br&gt; A. To protect people’s feelings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is her greatest regret? &lt;br&gt; A. Depression following her husband’s death. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Mystery on the Moors = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When was he happiest? &lt;br&gt; A. The carefree days of his youth. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What talent would he like to have? &lt;br&gt; A. The academic prowess of his father. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. If he could change one thing, what would it be? &lt;br&gt; A. His lack of self-confidence. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is his/her greatest achievement? &lt;br&gt; A. Becoming a successful newspaper reporter. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is his most treasured possession? &lt;br&gt; A. His father’s research papers. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is his greatest extravagance? &lt;br&gt; A. He’s an unusually gifted musician. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When does he lie? &lt;br&gt; A. Whenever he thinks people will judge him. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is his greatest regret? &lt;br&gt; A. Disappointing his parents. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I checked to see what the other students had done, I noticed that many of them had chosen to answer the questions in the voice of the character. So, I decided to do the same — in addition to the first set of answers I had provided. There was about an hour between answering both sets, and I chose not to look back at the answers I'd already given. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Wild Garden on the Wind = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When were you happiest? &lt;br&gt; A. Whenever I was with my husband. Ever since the day I met him, he’s brought happiness to my life. Even in death, he still manages… &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What talent would you like to have? &lt;br&gt; A. Oh, well I like to sketch things in my notebooks — but I’m not very good. I’d like to get better at that, maybe teach myself how to paint. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. If you could change one thing, what would it be? &lt;br&gt; A. I live alone, and I don’t get to see my children very often. I’m glad they have happy lives, but I wish we could speak with each other more often. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest achievement? &lt;br&gt; A. I know it sounds silly, but my children are my greatest achievement. I never really cared that much about doing something grand with my life. All I’ve ever wanted was to raise a happy family, because I knew it was something I could keep working on. You can never say &amp;quot;Okay, I've done that. So what's next?&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your most treasured possession? &lt;br&gt; A. Something my mother gave me before she passed away. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest extravagance? &lt;br&gt; A. I can be a bit wild, and unpredictable — and I’m impulsive! People think I’m eccentric, but I’m just in love with life. I can’t get enough of it. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When do you lie? &lt;br&gt; A. When I need to, just like everyone else. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest regret? &lt;br&gt; A. I try not to have any regrets. Everything I’ve ever done has made me who I am today — and I should be thankful for that. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;= A Mystery on the Moors = &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When were you happiest? &lt;br&gt; A. When my father was still alive. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What talent would you like to have? &lt;br&gt; A. I’d like to have the skills needed to continue my father’s research. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. If you could change one thing, what would it be? &lt;br&gt; A. I’d make the world a nicer place to live in. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest achievement? &lt;br&gt; A. I’m still waiting to find out… &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your most treasured possession? &lt;br&gt; A. I have an old shoebox that’s full of letters, photographs, birthday cards, train tickets, and other little mementos of my life. Whenever I’m feeling a little directionless, I have a rummage through that box. I don’t know what I’d do if I lost it. It helps me remember who I am, and who I’ve been. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest extravagance? &lt;br&gt; A. I know a few magic tricks, but I’m not very good. They’re an easy way to impress people at dinner parties, and what have you. It’s the one quirk of my personality which seems to help me in social situations. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. When do you lie? &lt;br&gt; A. I’m not the kind of person who lies to people. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What is your greatest regret? &lt;br&gt; A. I wish I’d done better at University, and stayed on to be a researcher like my father. I disappointed him when I went into journalism. I thought it was the right decision at the time, but I’m not so sure any more.

Massive lights are set up on the neighbouring structures, and a dazzling spectacle of shapes &amp;amp; colour are projected onto the ancient buildings throughout the night.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I was talking about this with some friends today, and I came to the conclusion that if was commissioned to design one of the installations, I'd like to treat one of the church as a sculpture - and paint it with light, literally. Filling in the details of all the ornamental brickwork, the high-up bits people rarely see, the gargoyles, and everything.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You'd need to get some pretty detailed plans, I reckon, and then digitally trace the outlines of the features so that you could colour them in and project them back onto the building accurately enough. If you managed to pull it off, the mix of bright colour with ancient brick work might be as novel as the Roman statues from antiquity when seen with their original paintwork and vivid colours.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This idea probably came from Prague Astronomical Clock event I saw, where they &amp;quot;showed it being built, torn down, rebuilt, and peeled away to show its internal mechanisms and the famous animated figures, as well as various events in the clock's history. The video interacted with the tower's architecture, such as rain rolling off the arch, and showing the passage of time with moving shadows&amp;quot;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Addendum:
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I decided to check the event's website before posting this, and found that one of the centrepieces is an installation almost exactly as I describe it. I'd like to say I'm annoyed, but actually — it's more amusing than anything. It felt like an original idea, but I must have seen this at some point. His version doesn't pick out the gargoyles though, nor does it cover the whole church — so technically, I still win. Oh, and when they plugged it in yesterday, they caused a two hour city-wide power-cut.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Addaddendum:
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I did some more research, and found that my idea is not only unoriginal, but has a name, a technology, and a primary practitioner. Apparently, chromolithe &amp;quot;is a light art that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours.&amp;quot; Wikipedia goes on to point out that some &amp;quot;of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of Patrice Warrener's can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         <description>&lt;div id=&quot;body&quot; class=&quot;mb cb fontsize2 &quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_6c2bbf79eb689609&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Around this time, every year, my hometown puts on a light-show using the local historical architecture. Massive lights are set up on the neighbouring structures, and a dazzling spectacle of shapes &amp;amp; colour are projected onto the ancient buildings throughout the night. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was talking about this with some friends today, and I came to the conclusion that if was commissioned to design one of the installations, I'd like to treat one of the church as a sculpture - and paint it with light, literally. Filling in the details of all the ornamental brickwork, the high-up bits people rarely see, the gargoyles, and everything. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;You'd need to get some pretty detailed plans, I reckon, and then digitally trace the outlines of the features so that you could colour them in and project them back onto the building accurately enough. If you managed to pull it off, the mix of bright colour with ancient brick work might be as novel as the Roman statues from antiquity when seen with their original paintwork and vivid colours. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This idea probably came from Prague Astronomical Clock event I saw, where they &amp;quot;showed it being built, torn down, rebuilt, and peeled away to show its internal mechanisms and the famous animated figures, as well as various events in the clock's history. The video interacted with the tower's architecture, such as rain rolling off the arch, and showing the passage of time with moving shadows&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Addendum: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to check the event's website before posting this, and found that one of the centrepieces is an installation almost exactly as I describe it. I'd like to say I'm annoyed, but actually — it's more amusing than anything. It felt like an original idea, but I must have seen this at some point. His version doesn't pick out the gargoyles though, nor does it cover the whole church — so technically, I still win. Oh, and when they plugged it in yesterday, they caused a two hour city-wide power-cut. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Addaddendum: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did some more research, and found that my idea is not only unoriginal, but has a name, a technology, and a primary practitioner. Apparently, chromolithe &amp;quot;is a light art that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours.&amp;quot; Wikipedia goes on to point out that some &amp;quot;of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of Patrice Warrener's can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;

I've been programming since I left school. I got into it because I found it easy, and fun, and it turned out I could make money while doing it. At school, I flunked anything that involved essay writing. English and history was particularly hard for me. I guess that's why I'm interested in it now. I want to challenge myself. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_184074&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My suspicion is that it's less about how much time I spent on each one, and more to do with the angle they were approached in.

That is, something that is poetic and incomplete, or incomplete and hence poetic. Or an admixture of the two. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;You wouldn't say I was trying to finish Sean's sapphiad by writing a story about it, because it is already finished. Part of the poetic nature of a sapphiad is its unfinishedness, by definition. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_184075&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; But it hit home (for me) and hence my reaction? It 'painted the picture'. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sure, that makes sense too! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_184076&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Perhaps something worth bearing in mind though. What you want to do, vs what you may find naturally easier? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If I took the easy way out, I would be cheating myself. :p

I'm not sure what it means exactly, but I like the concept.) Or to put it another way, it's more of a story without an idea to explore yet. I think you'd want to figure out what you wanted to explore, and then use the narrative to circumnavigate that. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Perhaps it was that aspect, I don't know. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_183109&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; I had imagined that I wanted to write about drama. American Beauty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Virgin Suicides, or anything by Richard Linklater are among my favourites films. There's a kind of magic about them that's hard to explain unless you've also seen them. I figured I'd end up exploring the same themes. So, it's pretty strange to be coming up with &amp;quot;locked room&amp;quot; stories. Early days though, I guess! &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Perhaps something worth bearing in mind though.

I think that failed for a number of reasons — but mostly because my way of approaching things wasn't very good, and the commentary I provided was a bit crap. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still bring it up quite frequently, when it ties into something I'm thinking about. I think that's working out much better than a structured approach. And now, instead of trying to drum up discussion about the book between the few people who already own a copy, I figured I'd put my efforts in to expanding that group of people. &lt;br&gt;

The first one started out as a sapphiad (the name Sean gives to a fragment of &amp;quot;unfinished&amp;quot; poetry that is poetic in its own right) and I used that as a kernel to spin the idea for a narrative around. And even at this stage, it's still more of an idea to explore without a story yet. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrative spun around those pictures lacks a kernel of &amp;quot;truth.&amp;quot; (I'm borrowing this word from a Star Trek episode I watched recently, where an old playwright told a younger one that he was having problems because he couldn't find the &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; of his story. I'm not sure what it means exactly, but I like the concept.) Or to put it another way, it's more of a story without an idea to explore yet. I think you'd want to figure out what you wanted to explore, and then use the narrative to circumnavigate that. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_68497&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; I'd start looking at a career in writing 'things that go bump in the &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; night' stories if this theme persists. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hehe, yeah. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had imagined that I wanted to write about drama. American Beauty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Virgin Suicides, or anything by Richard Linklater are among my favourites films. There's a kind of magic about them that's hard to explain unless you've also seen them. I figured I'd end up exploring the same themes. So, it's pretty strange to be coming up with &amp;quot;locked room&amp;quot; stories. Early days though, I guess!

         <title>A mystery on the moors</title>

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_8514429f4a76945d&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That last creative writing exercise we had to do this week was pretty interesting. Instead of taking a prompt to a list of sources, or a list of words, our task was to take inspiration from some photographs. The instructions suggested that we grab a nearby newspaper or magazine, cut out any photographs that we find interesting, and then try to arrange them in some order that made sense. After that, we were to imagine a narrative that is inspired by those images, and write up a 100 word summary. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve been sat in a coffee shop all evening working on my assignments, so I looked up from my computer and had a quick scan around. As luck would have it, there was a travel guide from The Daily Telegraph on the table in front of me. This seemed as good a place as any to find some interesting photographs. I didn’t cut them out, as the paper didn’t belong to me, but I did make a bit of a fool of myself taking photographs of them on my camera — after finding a good light. I think I was fairly fortunate, given my source, that I didn’t end up with a story about a murderous ski instructor, or a newlywed couple on their honeymoon OF HORROR! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A man travels to the moors to visit with his estranged family for a celebration of the summer solstice. But all is not as it should be. During the climactic night of the festivities, our man bares witness to an ancient ritual of the faeries. The next morning, he finds that some of his traveling companions have gone missing. Determined to find the truth, he breaks through the feigned ignorance of the locals, discovering what really goes on in this sleepy little village. And in the process, he uncovers a terrible secret, an enchanted graveyard, the country’s oldest surviving church.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if this is more or less liberating than being constrained to two sentences, as in the previous exercises this week. I have, however, noticed a bit of a running theme in the ideas that I churned out this week. I would not have thought that mystery and crime would play such a large role in the story ideas I came up with. A part of me suspects that in an attempt to give the story a hook, or something to interest the reader, crime and mystery are the two easiest and most obvious tools within my immediate reach. &lt;br&gt;

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_6fec75b678e09194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In another creative writing exercise we were asked to list a bunch of unconnected people, places, and props. Once we’d done this, our task was to link one of each to create an idea for a story. I tried to be as strict as I could about not allowing myself to think ahead, plan anything, or to relate the items to each other in any conscious way. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was a little hard than I imagined. But for my list of people, I chose a reporter, fisherman, taxi driver, traveler, barman, and gardener. For places, I chose a forrest, graveyard, basement, hotel, library, and museum. And for props, I chose a letter, photograph, ring, hairpin, safe, and wallet. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reporter / Graveyard / Photograph &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A reporter investigating the disappearance of a local woman sets out to search every graveyard in the area, after receiving a photograph in an unmarked envelope through the post. When he finds it, the mystery deepens as he discovers the gravestone is hers and she died eight years ago. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fisherman / Forrest / Ring &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;While on his summer holiday, a fisherman discovers a ring with a strange inscription on it in the stomach of a fish he caught. Deciphering this clue sets him on a perilous journey, that takes him into the depths of the forrest to unravel a mystery which has been kept secret for half a century. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taxi Driver / Hotel / Wallet &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A taxi driver picks a man up from an expensive hotel and takes him to a restaurant on the outskirts of town. When he finds the man’s wallet in the back of his car, he returns it to the hotel — but the man is found dead in his room, and the taxi driver was the last known person to see him alive. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traveler / Library / Letter &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;A traveler is backpacking around Europe with friends, soaking up as much culture as he can before going to University. While reading up on a local local mystery in one of the libraries he finds, he discovers a letter hidden between the pages that sets them off on a quest to find the truth. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barman / Basement / Safe &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The colleagues of a barman notice something strange, and break down the door of the basement to find him brutally murdered on the floor. The room was locked from the inside, and the murder weapon — along with the key to the basement — are found in a closed safe by the man’s body. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gardener / Museum / Hairpin &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;While gardening, a woman discovers an old hairpin with an intricate design and a sparkling jewel encrusted in the body. When she’s told to take it to her local museum for them to identify, they realises it matches up with a mythological figure from local history and decided to excavate her garden. &lt;br&gt;

         <description>&lt;div id=&quot;body&quot; class=&quot;mb cb fontsize2 &quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_6001aa1d2b7ce86f&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a creative writing exercise, we were asked to take inspiration from either: a personal experience, a newspaper story, a magazine article, an existing work, historical event, imagined event, overheard conversation, object, dream, or God. Picking one of those, we had to write a one or two sentence idea for a short story. Choosing a dream would have been an obvious, and easy, choice for me — so I avoided it entirely. Instead, I thought I would pick an existing work and try to extrapolate that into a short story idea. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Abyssinian Moon, Sean B. Palmer outlines the idea for a poem in a note-like fragment which is quite poetic in its own right. I read this about a year ago now, but the concept is one which stuck with me quite profoundly. I’m not going to cheat and refer back to the original — instead, I’m going to run with the idea of whatever I remember it as, as a kind of personal interpretation of his original note-like fragment. As far as I remember, it described a wild garden that spilt out into the neighbouring town, with exotic plants cropping up in all sorts of nooks and crannies. On top of old postboxes, drystone walls, and the edges of pavements. That sort of thing. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;After much editing to remove any unnecessary words, as well as to convey as much of the ambiances as possible in such a short amount of space, I finally arrived at the following two sentence description. “An old woman dies, and her house on the cliffs falls into disrepair. Assisted by the wind, the exotic wildlife from her secluded garden spills over into the neighbouring seaside town and blossoms in the most unexpected places.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the things I like about this idea is that it beautifully captures an aspect of that tenacity of life which gives it the ability to thrive against all odds. I was sitting in my garden a few months ago, when I spotted an unlikely branch protruding from the dry &amp;amp; barren brickwork of the wall that surounds the house. This inspirational little twig — all covered in pretty blue flowers — had managed to take root in the concrete, and was eking out a proud &amp;amp; defiant existence for itself. But it wasn’t the only thing that was flourishing. Despite my lack of care or cultivation, my entire garden had started to blossom. I spent a few days being astounded that so many flowers had managed to spring up from the dull &amp;amp; boring soil that had seemed so lifeless to me. And it was around this time that I discovered a haiku by Alexis Rootlet which summed up my feelings much better than I could have. “The branchlet / I forgot to prune / did not forget to bloom.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I first thought about taking Sean’s note-like fragment and turning it into something larger, I originally conceived of it being a news article — like a clipping from a local paper. I also wanted to connect this story with the idea of death and rebirth. I wanted the air-borne blossoms to be a counterpoint to something. The death of an old woman, living in isolation from the town, seemed like a fitting first cause for this mysterious chain of events. Through her death, the artificially restricted life of her garden begins to swell, breaking the confines of her house, and spilling out into the lives of the people around her. The love and care she put into cultivating that wild garden causes ripples of new life to bloom after after her death — spreading happiness, and bringing beauty to the people of her neighbouring town. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The allegoric component of this story is another thing which attracts me to it. Here’s a women who’s love and care has the potency to spread and affect the lives of her friends, and the lives of the friends of her friends, and so on and so on. I’ve often wondered at the ability for us to spread ourselves through other people, by sharing ourselves with them. The more I know someone, the more I am able to absorb parts of them into myself — and the more I find them influencing the way I live my life. In this respect, I think that sharing yourself with other people might be the metaphorical life after death that many people wish for. Of the people I’ve loved, and who’ve died, I would like to think that part of them lives on inside me, and lives on whenever I share stories about them, and the life we had together.

  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_1510347e670afeec&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’ve gone a bit quote mad with all of this. You’ll have to excuse me. I found the subject matter pretty interesting, and there’s a whole bunch of stuff I wanted to note down for my own sake — so that I can come back to it at a later date. I’m not really sure about how much or how little to quote, so any feedback you can provide me with would be helpful. It does occur to me that with Google, and particularly Google Books, most of this stuff can be found with a relative amount of ease. And what’s more, I really admire the style of Abyssinian Moon — where so much is left to the reader to hunt for. But then again, Abyssinian Moon also quotes some really choice things — and I think that works really well too. So maybe there’s a ballance? Maybe it’s important, and maybe it’s not. Sorry again, though, if it’s distracting! Which is to say, here’s the last of the passages I found interesting. Hehe. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sextus Empiricus makes an interesting point about how opinions are formed, and defended. I can’t help but find similarities between this and some of the various online communities I’ve been involved with. “When there are rational grounds for an opinion, people are content to set them forth and wait for them to operate. In such cases, people do not hold their opinions with passion; they hold them calmly, and set forth their reasons quietly. The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed, the passion is the measure of the holder’s lack of rational conviction.” The editor follows this up with another point. “As it is, they are observers of the complex set of mutually conflicting claims that make up the history of metaphysical philosophy, observers who notice that with ingenuity and luck as strong a defence can be made for any one claim as for any other. And this notion of ‘strength’ is broad and qualitative, not as precise and quantitative as the balance-scale would suggest. This ‘equality’ simply means that reason is a rogue, that having no decisive grounds for proving matters beyond everyday experience and custom it can make anything as possible (or implausible) as anything else.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also great passage where he describes the ninth mode of argument, which is concerned with the rarity of occurrence. “The sun is surely a much more amazing thing than a comet. But the sun we see constantly, whereas we rarely see a comet. Hence our astonishment at the sight of a comet is such that we may even believe it to be a divine omen, while we are not at all astonished at the sight of the sun. If, however, we only imagine the sun as appearing rarely and setting rarely, illuminating everything at once and causing everything to be thrown suddenly into shadow then we shall observe great astonishment at the occurrence. Earthquakes, also, do not cause a like degree of confusion in those who are experiencing one for the first time as they do in those who have become accustomed to them by habit. And how great is the astonishment the sea causes in a man who beholds it for the first time! But also the beauty of the human body, in a subject we see for the first time, and suddenly, excites us more than if the sight should become a common one. Rare things seem to be valuable; things familiar to us, and easily obtainable, not at all. For example, if we suppose water to be a rare thing, how much more valuable it will appear to us than all the things which are held to be valuable! Or if we ponder the thought of fold simply lying about in large quantities on the ground like stones, to whom shall we suppose it would be so valuable, or so much worth locking up? Since therefore, according to the frequency or rarity of their occurrence, the same things seem sometimes to be astonishing or valuable, and sometimes not at all so, we conclude that we shall perhaps be able to say what the nature of each of these things appears to be in the context of its frequent or rare occurrence, but that it is not within our power to state the nature of each eternal object considered purely and simply in itself.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_7620a4ebbf34048c&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the first things that came to mind after reading about the Skeptics, was the topic of qualia. Me and Sean spent a few weeks arguing about the topic last year, and came to no real conclusion. As far as I remember, I was arguing that they didn’t exist, and he was arguing the opposite. A mutual friend of ours joined in one time, and managed to settle the debate in a single sentence. Though, I can’t remember what he said, for the life of me! My best guess was that it was an argument from relativism, which consequentially rendered the debate completely moot. Which is exactly why one of the first things I did after the class this week was check to see what the Skeptics had to say about qualia. Of course, I couldn’t find anything — but that’s probably something to do with the fact that the term was invented in 1929, some 1,719 years after Sextus Empiricus died! If anyone knows of a similar or related term that Skeptics used, I would be interested in reading more about what they had to say on the topic. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_da3ba4c6e12e1652&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There’s an interesting passage from Cicero in Academica, where he says that “almost all the old philosophers […] maintained that the senses are limited, the mind feeble, the span of life short, and that truth (in Democritus’s phrase) is sunk in an abyss, opinion and custom are all-prevailing, no place is left for truth, all things successively are wrapped in darkness.” Cicero goes on to talk about Skepticism in terms of probability. He describes the conditions around taking a ship to another country, and how you can’t know the truth about the sea-worthiness of the ship, the skill of the sailors, or the conditions of the weather on the journey. He goes on to say that you can, however, deduce — through various means — that it is improbable that the ship will sink. I think this is interesting, but it still seems to cling on to the philosophy for it’s method instead of wanting to abandon it. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our seminar, someone raised the topic of science, and asked if it told us anything objective about the universe. Such as, do atoms really exist? What is the true nature of the Universe? Do we all exist as a 2D holographic projections on the surface of the cosmological horizon? If you took the same approach as the Skeptics, you’d shrug off the question and suspend your judgement on the mater. I mean, what does it matter if we are holographic projections? How does that help us to live a better life? Science is a tool. We use it to build bridges, and cars, and make sick people better. Yet, there’s a strange sense that people look to it for truth about the things. Like it can help us to understand the objective nature of the world around us, and of our place in existence — which is, in a way, what the Stoics were trying to do, and what the Skeptics rejected as dogmatism and nonsense. Perhaps the opposite of this way of thinking would be some sort of Pyrrhonean natural philosophy — where the scientific method was applied as a tool only, and not looked towards as a source of any absolute truth. I’m not sure though, it may just be a case of me smushing together all the new words I’ve learnt this month into something that sounds cool. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This search for the objective truth about the universe is covered in a humorous footnote from the editor: “The much discussed Sage of the Stoics (who was never found) often was the subject of Sceptical assault and humorous irony. He was to be the arbiter, the judge whose experiences and judgements were to give men the final truth about the universe, and about man’s role in it. Supposedly, of course, he would confirm, when he finally did arrive, what the Stoics has said about these matters.” And this is countered by the Skeptics, in another footnote which reads: “Scepticism is a practical-wisdom philosophy, one that seeks (as did post-Christian Stoicism and Epicureanism) eudaimonia, ‘happiness,’ by way of peace of mind, or ataraxia. Th truth is not its ultimate goal. Moreover, the proof of the falsity of particular dogmatic claims is not its motivation or goal either. The arche of Scepticism is peaceful happiness by way of a suspension of judgement.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;[A repetition of a quote here — sorry about that!] &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will quote an interesting section where Sextus Empiricus gives us his take on the relativity of sensory perceptions. “Take paintings, for example. To the eye they seem to have hollows and prominences, but certainly not to the sense of touch. And to some, honey appears to be pleasant to the tongue, but to the eyes it appears unpleasant; thus it is impossible to say whether it is in itself pleasant or unpleasant. With perfume the case is similar; it delights the sense of smell but is disgusting to the taste. […] Therefor we are not in a position to say what each thing is by nature, although it is possible to say what it appears to be on each occasion. We could easily cite more examples, but to avoid waste of time, on account of the plan of the treatise, we need say just this. Each appearance that we perceive through the senses seems to present itself under many forms; an apple, for instance, seems smooth, fragrant, sweet, and yellow.” There is an interesting footnote that follows this passage. “This smooth, sweet apple turns up again in Montaigne’s ‘Apology for Raymond Sebond,’ and in the same context, though after thirteen centuries it ripened and was red for Montaigne.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;This final quote, along the same lines, seemed like a nice summary of his views on relativism. “The eighth mode is the argument from relativity. By this mode we conclude that, since all things are relative, we shall suspend judgement as to what they are absolutely and in themselves. […] The result, however, is clear once we show in this manner that all things are relative. We shall not be able to say what each object is in its own nature and absolutely, but what it appears to be under the aspect of relativity. Hence follows the necessity of our suspending judgement concerning the nature of things.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_c92c9a5f603919ab&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had not noticed the connection between Scepticism and Wittgenstein until the editor pointed it out in a footnote that spanned three pages. In an attempt to summarise that footnote, I will quote: “Both philosophies contend that when men twist or ignore their ordinary ways of talking and thinking they get into hopeless puzzles or Sackgassen, blind alleys. Both are suspicious of attempts to look behind our living experience of words, things, or minds; they content that language when it is most fruitfully employed is a functional part of action or everyday life. […] Both say, in effect, that the claims of metaphysics float in mid air away from the facts, offer no way of deciding whether or not they are true. And so these claims are squabbled over endlessly, and produce insoluble puzzles for their creators. […] A third basic similarity between their philosophies is that both wish to do away with philosophy itself. Both wish to make philosophy unnecessary by helping us to restore that rogue reason and the language he uses to their home in everyday life. The aperient or laxative notion of doubt […] is matched in Wittgenstein’s philosophy by the conviction that analysis is a cure for a disease — the disease of arbitrariness, of building castles in the air and believing in the them. […] Once we are reminded that freedom involves freedom from jail, freedom from censorship, something being free of charge, a girl being free for a date, etc., we drop our nonsensical puzzles and learn to think about freedom fruitfully and clearly. And when we do this well and habitually, philosophy of all sorts, metaphysical as well as Wittgensteinian or Skeptical, becomes unnecessary. In both philosophies, philosophy washes itself away with the nonsense it works upon.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I came across a passage while reading How to Write a Book Proposal by Michael Larsen that seems strangely related. &amp;quot;Michelangelo believed his statues were waiting for him inside the blocks of marble he carved with hammer and chisel. Imagine that you are a sculptor and that your idea is an enormous block of marble inside of which is a magnificent edifice, that perfect embodiment of your idea. Your job is to use your craft and vision to chip away the superfluous until only an effective, organic structure remains in which form and function are inseparable. One sign of great art is that the artist's technique is so effective that is disappears into the work.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder whether you could generalise away from creative technique, and apply this same idea to any craft, tool, philosophy, or method. That is, you might view a good method as something which falls away once you’ve finished with it, rather like scaffolding does once the building has been built. That the method or craft should vanish into the finished product. If there is anything left of the method, when you’re finished applying it, the method might be faulty. In the same way that if there’s any philosophy left once you’ve finished applying it, the philosophy might be faulty. With this in mind, the way of the Pyrrhonean philosopher seems to be an interesting approach. That is — philosophy not for philosophy’s sake, but for the sake of living a decent life. And to avoid any philosophy that does not set out to undo itself as a primary goal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sextus Empiricus describes Skepticism as being able to “follow a certain line of reasoning which indicates to us, in a manner consistent with appearances, how to live in accordance with the customs, the laws, and the institutions of our country, and with our own natural feelings.” He also adds that the “definition of the Pyrrhonean philosopher is also virtually included in the concept of the Skeptic discipline. It is, of course, he who shares the ‘ability’ we have spoken of.” I like the description provided by the editor too. “Scepticism is a practical-wisdom philosophy, one that seeks (as did post-Christian Stoicism and Epicureanism) eudaimonia, “happiness,” by way of peace of mind, or ataraxia. The truth is not its ultimate goal. Moreover, the proof of the falsity of particular dogmatic claims is not its motivation or goal either. The arche of Scepticism is peaceful happiness by way of a suspension of judgement.” Followed by a nicely put reminder that life “is restored to its ordinary course when the doubting is done.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the seminar we had on the subject, I noticed something else a little curious. The ideas of Phyrro are only really known through the descriptions provided in Outlines of Pyrrhonism by Sextus Empiricus. Most of the ideas recorded by his student, Timon of Phlius, have been lost to history. Not that I know much about her, but this reminded me of the poetry of Sappho. Of course, one major difference between the two (except subject matter!) is that Phyrro didn’t write anything down in the first place. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_6672e3827ceb7ea8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The way that Skepticism was came into being is quite fascinating, and reminds me a lot of the stories you hear about Zen enlightenment. In talking about a hypothetical man and the original Skeptic, Sextus Empiricus states that “His initial purpose in philosophising was to pronounce judgement on appearances. He wished to find out which are true and which are false, so as to attain mental tranquility. In doing so, he met with contradicting alternatives of equal force. Since he could not decide between them, he withheld judgement. Upon his suspension of judgement there followed, by chance, mental tranquility in maters of opinion. […] The Sceptic, in fact, had the same experience as that related in the story about Apelles the artist. They say that when Apelles was painting a horse, he wished to represent the horse’s foam in the painting. His attempt was so unsuccessful that he gave it up and at the same time flung at the picture his sponge, with which he had wiped the paints of his brush. As it struck the picture, the sponge produced an image of horse’s foam.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_5dfdd1ed85928242&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sextus Empiricus makes an interesting argument based around the idea of being “party to the controversy.” The general impression I get from this argument is that any attempt to reason about something from within the very thing you’re reasoning about, is inherently flawed. The idea is that by being within the system, or being party to the thing you’re trying to judge, you perspective on things is tainted by the very thing you’re trying to pass judgement on. It reminds me of a summary I once read about Wittgenstein’s views on language, and to the best of my memory, how we’d need to lift ourselves out of language before we were able to discuss it properly. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;He first sets out a description of the various states you can be in during your life, and how these effect your perception of the world. Among them are ill people, and old people, and some more esoteric examples such as “blood-shot” people and “jaundiced” people. “Now, considering the fact that so much discrepancy is due to the states we are in, and that men are in different states at different times, it is easy, perhaps, to state the nature of each object as it appears to this or that person, but difficult to say further what its real nature is. This is because the discrepancy does not lend itself to judgement. In fact, whoever attempts to resolve the discrepancy will find himself either in one or the other of the aforesaid states or else in no state at all. But now to say that he is in no state at all, that he is neither healthy nor sick, neither at motion nor at rest, that he is not of any particular age, and that he is free from the other states, is perfectly absurd. On the other hand, the fact of his being in some state or other while attempting to pass judgement will make him a party to the controversy. And moreover, he will be confused by the states in which he finds himself, and this will prevent hi from being an absolute judge in the matter. A person, therefore, who is in the waking state cannot compare the impressions of a sleeping person with those of waking persons, and a healthy person cannot compare the impressions of sick people with those of the healthy. We do, after all, tend to give our assent to those things which are present and have a present influence over us rather than to things which are are not present.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the bits that caught my eye involved the discussion of how reality appears to us in our dreams. This is something I’ll come back to later when I start rambling about Descartes and the dream argument. “Whether one is in a sleeping or waking state also makes a difference in the sense-impressions, since our manner of perception while awake differs from the perception we have in sleep; and our manner of perception in sleep is not like our waking perception. As a result, the existence of non-existence of our sense-impressions is not absolute but relative, since they bear a relation to our sleeping or waking state. It is probable, therefore, that although our dream-images are unreal in our waking state, they are nevertheless not absolutely unreal, for &amp;nbsp;they do exist in our dreams. In the same manner the realities of the waking state, even if they do not exist in dream, nevertheless exist.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;div id=&quot;inbdy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_b2b9672029636013&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When Sextus Empiricus talks about the tenets of Scepticism, you get a really good impression of his ancient Greek weltanschauung, or world view. I don’t know if this is the same phenomenon that Ezra Pound calls a periplum, but it certainly feels similar. Although Sextus Empiricus presumably doesn’t set out to provide us with something akin to a periplum, we seem to get one anyway. His sketch map of the ancient world is embedded into the text, and woven into and around his argument. He uses a fascinating catalogue of very specific examples to back up some of the arguments he’s making. And what’s really quite surprising is that although most of them would probably be considered pretty dubious by the modern reader, the logic of his argument still appears valid. That ability to both use, and side-step, his temporal provincialism seems to be quite an interesting skill — unintentional or not! &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was interesting to see so many casual references to what seems like Forteana, only presented in a very ordinary way. There’s one such passage (which, according to the editor, may actually have been slipped in as a bit of a joke — though I am not too certain) that calmly explains how “Sea-monsters will flee from the crackling noise produced by the pounding of beans, and a tiger will run from the mere sound of a drum.” In another example, he describes how “the ears have winding, narrow passages and are foul with vapourous discharges which are said to gather from the various parts of the head.” As you read these descriptions of the world around him, as he saw it, you get a wonderful impression of how he ready he is to accept the mysterious and the unknown — without too much of a problem. It occurs to me that this might have been a prevailing attitude of the culture he was living in, or at least, of the audience he was writing for. Specifically, he talks about these things as if there’s nothing too strange about them. A sort of non-Forteana Forteana. An anomalous occurrence which is not doubted — but accepted for both it’s anomalous nature, and the fact that it cannot be explained and does not need to be explained in order to be believed. There’s no sense of the taboo, or the credulousness you get with many modern Fortean accounts. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one of the more amusing passages of this nature, he explains the origin of various types of creature. “Some animals are produced without sexual union, others coition. Of those which are produced without sexual union, some are generated out of fire, such as the little animals that appear in furnaces, others out of stagnant water, such as mosquitoes, and others from soured wine, such as ants. From the earth come earthworms, from mud come frogs, from dung, maggots. From asses come beetles, and from vegetables caterpillars. Other animals come from fruits, as the gall-insects from wild figs; and still others from rotting animals, as bees from bulls and wasps from horses. Of the animals produced by sexual union, some (most of them, in fact) are the offspring of the parents of like kind, some of parents of different kinds, as are mules. Speaking of animals in general again, some are born alive, as are human beings, some are born as eggs, as are birds, and some are born as unformed flesh, as bears.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not wanting to quote the whole chapter, I will include the following passage as it quite nicely demonstrates some of the more interesting aspects of his this embedded weltanschauung. “We differ also in our constitutional peculiarities: for some people, beef is easier to digest than rock-fish, and some suffer diarrhoea from inferior Lesbian wine. There used to be an old woman in Attica, they say, who could take thirty drams of hemlock with impunity, and Lysis used to take four drams of opium without harm. And Demophon, Alexander’s butler, used to shiver when he was in the sun or in a hot bath, but when he was in the shade he felt warm. Athenagoras of Argos was not affected by the sting of scorpions and poisonous spiders; the tribe called the Psyllaeans are not injured by the bite of snakes and asps; and the Tentyritae, an Egyptian people, suffer no harm from the crocodiles. Also, the Ethiopians who live along the Astapous River on the other side of Lake Meroë eat scorpions and snakes and such-like animals without ill effect. Rufinus of Chalcis would drink hellebore without vomiting and without any evacuation at all; he could simply take it and digest it like any of the usual beverages. Chrysermus, of the school of Herophilus, ran the risk of a heart attack whenever he took pepper, and Soterichus the surgeon used to suffer from diarrhoea whenever he caught the odour of fried sheat-fish. Andron of Argos was so unaffected by thirst that he even journeyed across the waterless part of Libya without requiring a drink. Tiberius Caesar could see in the dark, and Aristotle tells us of a certain Thracian who had the hallucination that a man was continually leading the way in front of him.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s another paragraph which catches me in the same manner. “Now, since some animals have yellow eyes, others bloodshot eyes, while others have eyes which are white, and others have eyes of still other colours, it is reasonable to suppose, I think, that their perception of colour is different. Moreover, if we fix our gaze on the sun for a long time and then look down into a book, the letters appear to be gold-coloured and going in circles. Also, some animals have a sort of natural brilliance in their eyes, and send off from them a fine light which travels easily, so that they even see at night. […] It is quite possible that there are peoples unknown to us, to whom things rare with us are common occurrences and with whom the conditions obtaining with us are comparatively rare. It might turn out, for example, that those who feel no pain at the bite of spiders are in the majority, and that some feel pain only rarely; and this might be similarly the case with the other constitutional peculiarities mentioned above.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;References: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scepticism, Man, &amp;amp; God &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selections from the major writings of Sextus Empiricus &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edited by Philip P.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_544c6bed9518ae76&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing about the place away from home was unexpectedly much easier. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I’m away from home, I like to find a cute little coffee shop and hole myself up in a corner to do some writing. My favourite one at the moment has a rooftop sky lounge you can go to. Given how frequently I end up alone there, it seems reasonable to suggest that I might be the only person who knows this place exists. The space is quite expansive, and there is a row of towering windows on one side that look out over the river. The sofas are black and comfortable, and the walls are panelled with wood. The lighting is kept low, which only adds to the feeling of secludedness. Sat up there, you can watch the tiny lights of the busy city in the distance, and the life that seems to be going on within it — while feeling warm, and safe, and calm. An experience that is only heightened when the rain is pelting against the windows, or the snowflakes are swirling around in the air outside.&amp;quot;

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_5ccf764b52233d62&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We were asked to write about our writing space at home. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down to write this around lunch-time today, and came up with: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I’m at home, I like to write while sat up in my bed. The room is dark and cavernly, enveloped in a warm reddish glow from my bedside lamp. Musical notes hang in the air like water droplets above the dew point. At night, it almost feels like a womb. My anima enjoys the return to that safe &amp;amp; comfortable environment, where I can incubate my thoughts and ideas in total isolation from the world. It is the place I go back to at the end of every day, it is the place where I dream, and it is the place that greets me every morning. A daily cycle of death and rebirth, anchored by subconsciousness. When I’m sat alone in my bed, adrift in a vast &amp;amp; starless galaxy of darkness, it almost feels like I can paint the walls with my imagination.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I left it for a few hours and did some other things. When I came back to it, I found that it sounded quite affected. The water droplets above the dew point thing particularly. I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that. I had in my mind an image of musical notes dancing around in the air — but this does not seem to have anything to do with that bizarre description. As someone who is familiar with my own writing, I could also see that it suffered heavily from being over-edited. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I sat down to write a second version just now: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I’m at home, I tend to do a lot of my writing at the coffee table, as that is where my laptop seems to live. I do, however, prefer to write in my bedroom, sat up in bed. Ever since I can remember, my bedrooms have resembled a womb in some way or another. At ten, I was allowed to paint the walls black with a constellation of stars. These days, I tend to keep them very minimal, and dark, and install soft red lamps. There’s nothing quite like sitting up at night, alone in the darkness, surrounded by music. There’s a wonderful feeling of safety &amp;amp; comfort that envelops you. It’s the place I come from each morning, and it’s the place I return to each night. The daily cycle of death and rebirth that I experience in that room makes me feel creative and bristling with imagination whenever I’m there.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure it's any better, but it certainly reads a lot more honest and natural to me.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_19dfdf8346f525cd&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next task was to pick up an everyday object that you have lying about the house, and write about it without directly saying what it is. One of my favourite possessions is an old biscuit tin I found a while ago. The tin has obviously lived a long and productive life, and yet I know practically nothing about it. After finding it, and taking it home — I felt a little remorseful, as if someone might have come back to collect it at some point. I tried messaging everyone I knew in the local area, to see if anyone knew anyone who had lost a biscuit tin. Which is, in retrospect, a great way to make yourself seem totally bonkers. Anyway, such a mundane &amp;amp; mysterious object seemed like the perfect thing to describe. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/tumbolia/browse_thread/thread/204f13e9af888e23/?hide_quotes=no#msg_19dfdf8346f525cd&quot;&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qheader_shown_198008&quot; class=&quot;hqt&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;- Hide quoted text -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qheader_hidden_198008&quot; class=&quot;sqt&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot;&gt;- Show quoted text -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_198008&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; This object is small and light, but big enough to be held in two hands. It feels cold to the touch, and makes a hollow metallic sound when you tap on the surface. The exterior feels smooth, but textured like paint. The lid is curved outwards, as if there is some air inside that has expanded and is desperate to escape. This dome has a few dimples &amp;amp; depressions, from being knocked about over the years. The inner surface of the lid is a golden yellow colour, and has some lovely antiquated writing in the centre. The main interior of the object is a silver colour, with specs of rusty brown. The outer surface is a dark blue colour, with plenty of chips and imperfections. The lid has a curious little painting of “A Scene in Venice” on it. There is a gondola sailing up a river to the left of a narrow street. There are some people in the distance, and a woman is carrying two buckets in the foreground. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Notes on a creative writing course</title>

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_d033702331bb541e&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I started a creative writing course recently, and I thought I might post some of the exercises here. I don't expect them to amount to much, but I figured it might be a nice way to preserve them for my self. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first exercise was to write a 100 word biography, to introduce yourself to the other students. I spent a while agonising over such a thing a year or so ago, so I know how hard it can be. The last version of that effort is no longer online, so I figured this might be a decent excuse to fish it out of the archives, dust it off, and share it with the world again. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_183134&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; I'm just a guy in the world. I enjoy programming, writing, telling stories, taking pictures, watching films, talking with friends, a strong cup of coffee and a good book, evening meals, winter mornings, lazy summer afternoons, a cosy corner in the garden, wine, women, and song. Among other things! &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; I work with the Web, which puts bread and cheese on the table. I like to hack in my spare time, and have been involved with a number of community software projects, including GNU, Debian, and the ASF. I've written for O'Reilly and have a book about CouchDB.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sean once commented, in reply to this: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_183135&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Your new “I'm just an average guy!” homepage today reminded me of all &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; this, because it works very well along these lines. It tries to show &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; you as you are, using sticky slope design, not as you imagine or would &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; like or would like to pretend yourself to be. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;– &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://groups.google.com/group/tumbolia/t/698f4d6510d2d4cc&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVTZt_SlsVzxeWNw3zdCvHu54U7Q&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/tumbolia/t/698f4d6510d2d4cc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one of the other biographies that was shared with the class, a girl on the course explains how she has a background in various scientific areas. As she felt like she wasn't good enough for those subjects, she's moving to writing because she enjoys it and feels that it is something she can do well. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_183136&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;In response, I wrote: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;quot;I liked this, because it's almost the mirror image of why I find myself here. I was always good at physics, and maths, &amp;amp;c. But terrible at most other subjects! I pursued these things into a career as a computer programmer — which I've been doing for 10 years now. I'm interested in writing precisely because that was the subject I always found hard, and technology has begun to get quite boring for me. Writing lets me expand parts of my brain that I've been ignoring for far too long.&amp;quot;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_34404d39fd6ba851&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My first real web site was based on inducing and influencing lucid
&lt;br&gt; dreams. There's certainly a random element to the world our minds
&lt;br&gt; fabricate as well as the choices we make in them. From flying to weird
&lt;br&gt; gravity to third party isometric overhead views there's little that
&lt;br&gt; our minds can't conjure in dream states. Sadly, dreamsnare is no
&lt;br&gt; longer active.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to see our unconscious as always on, but our conscious decision
&lt;br&gt; making mind inhibits most of it's enthusiastic pattern matching while
&lt;br&gt; we are awake. The less I'm in control, the more creative I feel. I
&lt;br&gt; haven't done any real research to see of this trend holds for other
&lt;br&gt; folks.

As glimpses into my unconscious, I find them fascinating in their own right. There's also an aspect of wanting to know where the influences come from, and of wanting to capture the unique or interesting ideas.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I'm less inclined to attribute too much meaning to them, as Jung or Freud would. From experience, I know that some of my dreams quite clearly have a symbolic message within them — because I can tie the metaphors up to things which have been going on in my waking life. But a lot of the time, there seems to be no apparent meaning, and I'm not too inclined to force one upon them.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; When I take a naps in the afternoon, I usually experience a period of what is known as hypnogogia. I find this quite entertaining usually. It usually comprises sequence of apparently unrelated imagery, and more often than not, sounds. If I am lucky, I can even control these experiences to some extent — though it is often tricky to do so without waking myself up from the experience.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Anyway, I've not remembered many of my dreams recently. I did, however, have an interesting one a few nights ago. I was dreaming about something which was really quite important — or so it felt at the time. I had come up with an idea that was absolutely going to be one of my best ideas ever.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I woke up at some point, and realising that I still had everything in memory, reached for my notepad and jotted down a rough outline. Quite happy that I had perfectly encapsulated the idea, at least enough to reconstruct it upon awakening, I put the notepad back down and fell back into my dream.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; When I awoke, I found the following:
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (cont.)
&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This bitterly ironic abbreviation was the only thing I had written. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_72f6ff16bdd58cb4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Dali story has been adapted in your quotation (which was not my &lt;br&gt; description btw). Apparently (and I say 'apparently' with trepidation as &lt;br&gt; usually that precedes any statement which is very often heresay! As in: &lt;br&gt; overheard conversation in a bar) Dali used to sit in a chair, not lie down &lt;br&gt; in bed. I think this reported description is important as it implies his &lt;br&gt; 'waiting' for the moment of visualisation, rather than an expectation of &lt;br&gt; comatose sleep. In sitting upright he would (presumably) be not too far from &lt;br&gt; his desk / easel / writing and drawing implements. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason, there seems to be little citation for this story (which is, &lt;br&gt; incidentally, widely recounted on the internet and usually on sites that &lt;br&gt; deal in sleep issues), &lt;br&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://www.neatorama.com/2008/10/10/sleeping-giants-5-go-getters-who-found-time-to-nap/&amp;usg=AFQjCNGb-RDytS1vBDvREzVO7jYxqq424A&quot;&gt;http://www.neatorama.com/2008/10/10/sleeping-giants-5-go-getters-who-...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; however there is a lot of reportage of Dali's fascination with Freud and &lt;br&gt; Jung, whose theories were a turning point in his artistic explorations. He &lt;br&gt; went on to develop his 'Critical–paranoiac method' &lt;br&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoiac-critical_method&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG6MEiWtXgyQ_1tGdqxFqWCgv6bA&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoiac-critical_method&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;I might add that I first heard the story from my lecturer whilst at art &lt;br&gt; college. My own explorations into the technique has only ever been through &lt;br&gt; audio recordings of my own voice -which is most curious upon waking: my &lt;br&gt; tone, manner and general demeanor sounds to my ears like someone else and &lt;br&gt; the subject matter is no longer part of my memory making it sound like a &lt;br&gt; recording of someone I don't know, recounting incidents I have never heard &lt;br&gt; before. Perhaps the most successful of these experiments was one night when &lt;br&gt; I awoke with an entire 36 bar song, words / melody and chords, completely &lt;br&gt; fully formed. I sketched out what i could remember of the form and sung the &lt;br&gt; words in the melody onto a tape. Over the following days I reviewed the tune &lt;br&gt; and found it, surprisingly, worthy and included it in my 'set' (I was a &lt;br&gt; gigging musician at the time). For the record, it was a love song, a ballad &lt;br&gt; - curiously, in the style of a 1930s 'slow-step'. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of 'dreaming' music is also widely experienced and Quincy Jones &lt;br&gt; tells the story of how he was once awoken from sleep with (what he believed &lt;br&gt; to be) the 'greatest' most beautiful song that had ever been written, &lt;br&gt; swirling around his half-awake consciousness. He went to his piano and &lt;br&gt; sketched it out only to find, the following day that he had merely &lt;br&gt; transcribed the 'middle eight' or 'bridge' from the popular song: &lt;br&gt; &amp;quot;Stardust&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it works, sometimes it's just an illusion, it would seem. In our &lt;br&gt; dream state we perhaps perceive our commonplace experiences and memories as &lt;br&gt; if we were outsiders to them. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;JB &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/tumbolia/browse_thread/thread/2c990b7f790cee53/?hide_quotes=no#msg_72f6ff16bdd58cb4&quot;&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qheader_shown_174388&quot; class=&quot;hqt&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;- Hide quoted text -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qheader_hidden_174388&quot; class=&quot;sqt&quot; style=&quot;display:block;&quot;&gt;- Show quoted text -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div ID=&quot;qhide_174388&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot; class=&quot;qt&quot;&gt;On Sat, Oct 16, 2010 at 12:19 AM, Noah Slater &amp;lt;nsla&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/groups/unlock?_done=/group/tumbolia/browse_thread/thread/2c990b7f790cee53/72f6ff16bdd58cb4%3Fshow_docid%3D72f6ff16bdd58cb4&amp;msg=72f6ff16bdd58cb4&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;@tumbolia.org&amp;gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; My dad told me a story, which can be summarised as: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;The artist Salvador Dali used the same technique. Dali would lie down in &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; bed while holding a spoon over a dish on the floor near his bed. As he fell &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; asleep, the spoon fell from his hand, landing on the dish with the resulting &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; noise stirring him awake. Frequently, as he awoke, he had some fascinating &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; image in mind which he then painted.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; — Craig Karges; Ignite Your Intuition &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Frustratingly, I cannot find any original source to back this up. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Jung used to paint his dreams too. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Here's an interesting incident that ties into his ideas about &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; synchronicity: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;A year later I painted a second picture, likewise a mandala, with a golden &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; castle in the centre. When it was finished, I asked myself, 'Why is this so &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; Chinese?' I was impressed by the form and choice of colours, which seemed to &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; me Chinese, although there was nothing outwardly Chinese about it. Yet that &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; was how it affected me. It was a strange coincidence that shortly afterwards &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; I received a letter from Richard Wilhelm enclosing the manuscript of a &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; Taoist-alchemical treatise entitled The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; request that I write a commentary on it.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; — Carl Jung; Memories, Dreams, Reflections &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; After hearing about these two stories, I've been considering something &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; similar. A while a go, I dreamt about a war. In this war, people were using &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; a weapon that was functional as a sword, a shield, and a pistol. I sketched &lt;br&gt; &amp;gt; this in the morning when I woke up.

The camera looked less like a photographic tool in that dream, much more like some futuristic combination of a &amp;quot;laser cannon&amp;quot; kind of thing and a water gun. I lucidly remember orange appliances mounted around what might have been the lens, and much more. Afterwards, I tried to sketch it, and although I can still clearly recall the picture in my mind, I didn't manage to capture the characteristic elements in a drawing. Might be a matter of practise.

  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; name=&quot;msg_bfa9b84b90bfb9fc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My dad told me a story, which can be summarised as: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The artist Salvador Dali used the same technique. Dali would lie down in bed while holding a spoon over a dish on the floor near his bed. As he fell asleep, the spoon fell from his hand, landing on the dish with the resulting noise stirring him awake. Frequently, as he awoke, he had some fascinating image in mind which he then painted.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Craig Karges; Ignite Your Intuition &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, I cannot find any original source to back this up. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jung used to paint his dreams too. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's an interesting incident that ties into his ideas about synchronicity: &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A year later I painted a second picture, likewise a mandala, with a golden castle in the centre. When it was finished, I asked myself, 'Why is this so Chinese?' I was impressed by the form and choice of colours, which seemed to me Chinese, although there was nothing outwardly Chinese about it. Yet that was how it affected me. It was a strange coincidence that shortly afterwards I received a letter from Richard Wilhelm enclosing the manuscript of a Taoist-alchemical treatise entitled The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a request that I write a commentary on it.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Carl Jung; Memories, Dreams, Reflections &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;After hearing about these two stories, I've been considering something similar. A while a go, I dreamt about a war. In this war, people were using a weapon that was functional as a sword, a shield, and a pistol. I sketched this in the morning when I woke up.
