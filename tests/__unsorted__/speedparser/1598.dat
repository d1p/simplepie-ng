  <title>this took so many times to crosspost, i feel like i finished a MAGICAL SCIENCE</title>

  <description>I&apos;ve found a couple Glastonbury clips from the MTV stream on youtube,     amazing quality. I&apos;m assuming MTVWorld took it down (and if they  didn&apos;t,    does anyone know a proxy server I&amp;nbsp;can use? In  the States,  I&amp;nbsp;can&apos;t   view MTVWorld). I&amp;nbsp;also found a really poor couple which said  the Clint    Eastwood was Snoop Dogg ft. Gorillaz XD Isn&apos;t it the other  way around,    guys? Anyway, I&apos;ll either finish hunting down clips  (which I don&apos;t  like   because the clipping is up to the uploader, not  the viewer) or  see if  I&amp;nbsp;can get the full stream somewhere. If I do,  I&apos;ll  give up my  annoyance  at fandom and upload the whole thing cut  and uncut.  There  are a few  people who go out of their way to thank me  and ask me  if  I&amp;nbsp;could take  the time for more but it&apos;s  okay if  I&amp;nbsp;can&apos;t. Apparently  youtube has the   power to be the most polite place  ever. So I&apos;m going  to consider this   uploading for those guys, not  the ones who are  annoyances. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I   have no idea what the fuck  Snoop Dogg is  rolling out because it&apos;s poor   quality, but that may be  because I spent  the entire thing alternatively   trying to puzzle out  what the fuck he  was wearing or wanting to stick a   fez on him so his  apparent cosplay  of Russ would be complete. :P The   whole thing was  kind of weird, what  with Damon brandishing his melodica   in the air  like it was a rifle and  waving it around, and any sight of   the thing  (whether or not it was  being played) sent the crowd into   hysterics.  Shit, dude, the melodica  is getting respect now? ;.; I AM   FINALLY NOT  CONSIDERED A LAZY  MUSICIAN PLAYING A BASTARD CHILD FOR IT   BEING MY  SPECIALITY SINCE I  WAS 10? Aaaaaah omg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also at one point Jamie  got in Snoop&apos;s face so close I&apos;m sure his mic was on Snoop&apos;s nose,  which, lol wtf?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously snoop   wtf are you wearing ok are  you  going to make me have to tweet you  asking  why, why, why&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damon   seems to have shed his usual concert  gear  (LOL NAAAKEEED) from the   jeans and red shirt to a leather jacket,  black  shirt and black pants   of some material. Also he looks like he  stole  Shaun Ryder&apos;s glasses.   If he did, I&amp;nbsp;approve of  this measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----  why is gorillaz_news   so quiet, wtffff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel  Good, INC, I am not  sure what he&apos;s   singing but it is not the concert or  album version at  all. I think   it&apos;s Noodle&apos;s Demo cut down for time  (which is very  fitting) but   I&amp;nbsp;can&apos;t say for  sure without a lyrics sheet, of which  nobody has made.   I&apos;m making my own  later. If so, it makes complete  sense, the timing   could not be more  appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the  MC&apos;ing is being   handled this year, I&amp;nbsp;hope that once they involve the  fictional band    members they&apos;ll put catchcalls back in. Considering the  fact they had   so  little dates in the Demon Day tour because an MC  fucked up so badly    (basically, this guy verbally abused the audience  and the band and  it   got bad enough that the concert hall refused to pay  them and the  rest  of  the tour canceled out. That&apos;s a huge reason of  why we had  Demon  Detour  instead), even this makes me happy. It&apos;s just a  sort of  general   catch-all, anyone on stage can step in. It&apos;s very   disorganized  appearing  but I&apos;m sure Damon and Jamie have it   meticulously planned  out, because  they never do things anyway else   (even if they crash and  burn in the  process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys. Guys. I&amp;nbsp;got  a  tentative  number for  my music stipend from school. $3500 is the   estimation. I&amp;nbsp;need to plan  what to do with this, both instrument  and   concert-wise. Anyone willing  to help, please?&amp;nbsp;:D  I&apos;m seeing Gorillaz  at  leat once in the States  and in Mexico if I&amp;nbsp;can manage it.  I&apos;ll  have a  clarinet and melodica   by then, so they don&apos;t figure in. Hrm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More   Glastonbury  thoughts as I&amp;nbsp;get ahold of the videos. Right now, all   I&amp;nbsp;know is that it  needs to be October &lt;em&gt;right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=2990&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>

(is she real, is she real)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that day, (something&apos;s starting today)&lt;br /&gt;Lost my mind (where did he go?)&lt;br /&gt;Lord, I&apos;m fine (where you wanted to be)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in time (you know, november has come)&lt;br /&gt;You&apos;ll want to be mine (is she real, is she real)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something&apos;s starting today&lt;br /&gt;Where did he go? why you wanted to be?&lt;br /&gt;Well you know, november has come&lt;br /&gt;When it&apos;s gone away..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these demon days (it&apos;s so cold inside)&lt;br /&gt;So hard for a good soul to survive (is she real, is she real)&lt;br /&gt;You can&apos;t even trust the air you breathe (because mother earth wants us all to leave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreams aren&apos;t bad, &lt;br /&gt;I had turned back&lt;br /&gt;I love the girl (is she real, is she real)&lt;br /&gt;But God only knows it&apos;s&lt;br /&gt;Getting hard to see the sun coming through&lt;br /&gt;I love you...&lt;br /&gt;But what are we going to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sinking soul&lt;br /&gt;There you are&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&apos;t make side to&lt;br /&gt;But it won&apos;t be long&lt;br /&gt;Cause kids with guns&lt;br /&gt;Kids with guns&lt;br /&gt;Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture I&apos;m a dreamer&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ll take you deeper&lt;br /&gt;Down to the sleepy glow&lt;br /&gt;Time is a low..&lt;br /&gt;Don&apos;t you know?&lt;br /&gt;What are we going to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they&apos;re turning us into monsters&lt;br /&gt;Turning us into fire&lt;br /&gt;Turning us into monsters&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s all desire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go back&lt;br /&gt;All the second selfless days&lt;br /&gt;You&apos;re in love with him&lt;br /&gt;I want to see you again&lt;br /&gt;I love you...&lt;br /&gt;But what are we going to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pick yourself up, it&apos;s a brand new day&lt;br /&gt;So turn yourself round&lt;br /&gt;Don&apos;t burn yourself, turn youself&lt;br /&gt;Turn yourself around&lt;br /&gt;To the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my huge gorillaz project before i move to other things. the goal is to manage to mix every single song on demon day (excluding d-sides) into one megamix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the template is hardly finished and a lot will change, but suggestion would still be awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is even trickier since they made their own sampler, but that one&apos;s simple cut and paste, i want to josh this all into one song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=2148&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>

  <description>Started out considering Deltron vs Gorillaz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drafting a timeline, not editing anything at all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back in and dumped most the tracks, cut it for the idea it wanted to be anyway, which was a mix of Kids with Guns and Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey&apos;s Head. Now it&apos;s basically a completely different project altogether. Funny how that works sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting it down to the quick, new draft, simple transitions, sound manipulation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I get to go in and decide whether it speaks for itself, or if it needs some fanciful embellishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;creative processes are fun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=1891&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>

  <description>I started fucking around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ore-sama.ca/outpost/dancing%20bones%20draft.mp3&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; awhile ago, but it just wasn&apos;t working. Up to 1:12 only needs some volume envelopes balanced. The rest has 30 second spots that I am satisfied with sparsed between &apos;well, THAT is a rough draft&apos;. Really, I should stop being annoyed at myself because this was my second serious attempt at a project. Still.  When something isn&apos;t working, you get down to the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with what I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ore-sama.ca/outpost/gorillaz%20interviews.mp3&quot;&gt;instead&lt;/a&gt; is that each half by itself is what I wanted, but apparently I developed an entirely different idea today as to how I wanted to do it than last night. But I had fun with it, it just needs some sore spots smoothed over before it can be finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions for either, comments, would be awesome. :D &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it may all be in the draft. The problem with the first is I just made it up as I went along. The second had a template that was only vagually followed in the end, but it still helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&apos;ll tear out all the crap in the Black Parade mix then write a template. I guess that&apos;ll work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=1060&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>

  <description>&lt;s&gt;MCR/Black Parade megamix! 75% done, need to fix some transitions/bad volume spots. Constructive criticism would be awesome. :D&lt;/s&gt; Acid Pro fucked up all the rendering and ruined a lot of stuff. If you heard it already THAT&apos;S NOT WHAT IT&apos;S SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will fix this later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put to task:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(gorillaz)Money for the Free-&amp;gt; 50%&lt;br /&gt;(mcr/black parade)Dancing Bones-&amp;gt; 65%&lt;br /&gt;(shiny toy guns)Mall Rescue 101-&amp;gt; 5%&lt;br /&gt;(various)Pop Star Battle Arena-&amp;gt; 25%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=954&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>

  <description>Last night&apos;s experiment was as thus: write lyrics as they come through, things around you, words that pop up suddenly (even quotations) and make them all fit together with as little editing as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve been screwing around with Sonic Acid Pro 4.0. Yesterday I created what I think the inside of (milliways)Kaworu&apos;s head &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ore-sama.ca/outpost/kaworu.mp3&quot;&gt;sounds like&lt;/a&gt;. Today I started to work seriously on my first project. I&apos;m doing another with Shiny Toy Guns, but that one&apos;s far from posting, yeah :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No name yet, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ore-sama.ca/outpost/hash%20beat.mp3&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s only a template right now - any blank spot or odd transitions are going to be adjusted later. I&apos;m replacing Sound Check (Gravity) with Demon Detour: El Mañana. Might twist a bit of another Demon Detour live, &apos;Clint Eastwood (Live - feat. De La Soul &amp; Bootie Brown)&apos; and a mic soldier riff. We&apos;ll see what happens, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The template is basic, but hopefully I can make it sound good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=today_in_stereo&amp;ditemid=717&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; alt=&quot;comment count unavailable&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot;/&gt; comments</description>
