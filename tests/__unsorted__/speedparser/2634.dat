I made most of this mix back in May, when I was sleeping on friends couches, bouncing from place to place, and had no time for music, but that was just when I needed these consistencies more than ever.  There&amp;#39;s more space between songs, and I even added some silence, especially after what I think the crux of the mix, High for This.  The original, my song of the season, is great, and the remix only serves to add more gravity.

Revolution is in the air.  My favorite formula of building into the electronica from folk and hip hop with all new music or remixes.  No seasonal connection though.  Just the sense of what forces push us to act from beyond the grave. And Jesus, is that Bright Eyes and Coldplay? Wow, I can&amp;#39;t believe what I&amp;#39;ve become!  So embarrassing, but the effect works.

I&amp;#39;ve been sitting on this for a few weeks, trying to get a good combination.  I&amp;#39;m pleased with how this turned out.  It&amp;#39;s fun.  No season or reason for this one.  Maybe just a general concern for our commonwealth.

As a concept, I wanted to look at how much of (my) current music is influence by the 1980s.  This is part of the general revival around me.  But I ended up cutting the actual 80s music, and stuck with the folksy stuff I know and love.  It makes it more timid, less tubular.  I hope that&amp;#39;s not symbolic that this decade won&amp;#39;t be as gusty as the 80s.

A soundtrack to something quite similar to life.  Using pop songs for purposes again.  This is out in quick succession from Progression since there are several several songs that I couldn&amp;#39;t get to work on that which I used here, particularly the rock.  Still very nice I say!

I feel this CD is unfinished, and I may replace it with a second version very shortly.  But I need to get this out.  This is a collection I&amp;#39;m thrilled with, and hope you enjoy the songs as much as I do.  The cover there is ironic?  I hope so.  Also, this is the first mix I&amp;#39;ve done with Adobe Soundbooth, rather than Audacity.

!I put the exclamation mark at the beginning of the sentence here.  It seems like that&amp;#39;s the way to go.  Freedom is scary stuff.  With no Berlin Wall what the hell you gonna do?

&amp;quot;Take My Place&amp;quot; is another of my all time favorites.  I began on it in December 2006, and came back to it later, as I added more meaning to it leading up to graduation in 2007.  It has a much more distinct story and plot to it compared to my others, and though its generally popular or classic music, the lyrics all work very well together.  Enjoy!

&amp;quot;New Rose&amp;quot; is an all time favorite of mine, even though it&amp;#39;s now four years old.  I made it while abroad in Turkey in Spring 2006, and some of that warmth and traveling spirit comes through.  I also made this for my cousin&amp;#39;s mixtape trade that month.  The name is a homonym with Newroz/Nowruz/the Perso-Kurdish new years festival held on the vernal equinox.  Enjoy!

&amp;quot;The Road South...&amp;quot; was a mix for Autumn 2009, and though the title has &amp;quot;Road&amp;quot;, I didn&amp;#39;t actually make it to be a driving CD.  I should have used &amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Journey&amp;quot;, but too late now.  It starts mostly upbeat, even a couple lyric-less songs, but slows, and I tried to get in the idea of that first cold night of the Fall, which takes the listener by surprise, despite the warnings.  Then the music must migrate south for warmer climates!  I&amp;#39;m still pleased how this came out.  Enjoy!

&amp;quot;it&amp;#39;d be different if you were here&amp;quot; is my winter 2009/2010 mix.  It&amp;#39;s a little melancholy with some of the folk, and idiosyncratic in that the songs correspond to specific things I did this winter. Like starting with a song from Fantastic Mr. Fox, for example. Still, a worthy outing with some good songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there isn&amp;#39;t much holiday music, maybe only three that mention winter or Christmas, I try to get the feel of the holidays in their rush and the abrupt shifts between Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, and Valentines.  The title comes from the Ra Ra Riot song, which I probably would have used last year had I known it then.

&amp;quot;Never Alone in the Empty Desert&amp;quot; is technically a seasonal CD made for Spring 2010.  However, I got eager, and made it in February, and I think it shows. There&amp;#39;s not much sun and more cold air then previous Spring mixes. However, I feel this is more coherent mix than recent ones, and presents a blend than is more harmonizing than my recent creations, which thrived in extremes of genres and sharp contrasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time I chose not to put the title on the cover of the disk. I felt more text took away from the poetic XKCD comic, which says the idea so beautifully. In Scorsese&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Last Temptation of the Christ&amp;quot;, John the Baptist encourages Wilhem Defoe&amp;#39;s Jesus to venture out into the wilderness of Judea because “the God of Israel is a god of the desert. If you want to speak to Him, then you’ll have to go to the desert… be careful. God isn’t alone out there.” So in a Old Testament/New Testament way this is a sequel to last spring&amp;#39;s mix, which was about Passover. Enjoy!
