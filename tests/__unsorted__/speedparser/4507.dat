			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve worked with business development managers that don&#8217;t believe in creating comprehensive term sheets when putting together a deal. What they end up with is a short summary and a disjointed string of e-mails with all of the details. They say it&#8217;s faster. I say it&#8217;s lazy, it ends up taking longer, and it causes problems further down the line.</p>
<p>From the Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation titled &#8220;<a title="Conflict Management From The Start - Harvard Law School" href="http://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/business-negotiations/conflict-management-from-the-start/" target="_blank">Conflict Management From the Start</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>After reaching an agreement, professionals often rely on their lawyers  to draw up the official contract. Unfortunately, miscommunication  between negotiators and their lawyers often leads to costly mistakes.  Contract terms may not accurately represent the negotiated agreement,  key deal terms could be missing, or clauses might contradict one  another.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The biggest miscommunications happen when the lawyers don&#8217;t have a term sheet to work from. If you just give them a summary, some e-mails, and perhaps the other party&#8217;s standard contract, they have no idea what to do with it. What follows are a long series of questions and back-and-forth on the contract terms. All of which could have been avoided if they&#8217;d had something more structured to work with from the beginning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done it both ways. A term sheet is always the better, faster way to go. The legal process takes far less time, you end up with a contract that covers what you expected, and you don&#8217;t get blind-sided by anything 6 months into the deal.</p>
<p>You can equate not using a term sheet to trying to launch a new product without having detailed written requirements. That too doesn&#8217;t work so well. Take the time to write everything out and gain agreement on it. You will be glad you did.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently my shopping list is pretty short. I want a new iPhone 5 when they come out and I want one of the <a title="Tech Crunch" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/amazon-kindle-tablet/" target="_blank">Amazon Android tablets</a>. I&#8217;m pretty excited about both, though obviously the iPhone is clearly at the top of the list. I don&#8217;t want an iPad because you can&#8217;t own one without at least occasionally tethering it to a PC, especially at setup. That strikes me as ridiculous. Thus Amazon is going to get my business instead unless Apple fixes that really fast.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book focuses on innovations through slow, trial-and-error approaches. Marketers with the right attitude can benefit greatly from this approach. Those with a “growth mindset” are not afraid to fail. They see challenging themselves and failing as learning opportunities. Using the “affordable loss principle,” marketers should focus on what they can afford to lose rather than what they expect to gain. This allows them the leeway to take smaller initiatives and give them a chance to grow and evolve over time. With this approach, the gains tend to be more evolutionary than revolutionary. But they are much easier to implement and less risky. This is important for marketers working in larger organizations that tend to be more risk averse. I wouldn’t recommend this approach to those creating products in a start-up environment.</p>
<p>Thanks for recommending this Nate.</p>

<p>Texas continues to improve each week <a title="Yahoo Sports" href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=201109170064" target="_blank">beating UCLA 49 -20</a>. This avenges a loss at home last year to UCLA.</p>
<p>Case McCoy started the game at quarterback, sharing snaps with David Ash. McCoy went 12 of 15 for 168 yards and 2 TDs. Ash went 3 for 3. Neither threw an interception.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to watching Texas become a contender in the Big 12 as their young players gain more experience.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>McCoy looks like the real deal at QB.</li>
<li>Freshmen Malcolm Brown and Jaxon Shipley continue to look good at RB and WR. These guys will be stars.</li>
<li>D.J. Grant is emerging at TE with 3 TD catches.</li>
<li>The defense grabbed 4 turn-overs and applied lots of pressure on opposing QBs.</li>
</ul>

<p><a title="Yahoo Sports" href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/boxscore?gid=201109100083" target="_blank">#24 Texas squeaks by BYU 17-16</a>. Texas looked horrible during the first half. But the defense played good enough to keep them in the game holding BYU to 13 points despite QB Garrett Gilbert&#8217;s 2 interceptions. He was booed out of the game by the hometown fans.</p>
<p>David Ash and Case McCoy (Colt McCoy&#8217;s younger brother) shared snaps during the second half to rally Texas to a come-from-behind victory. It sounds great to hear &#8220;McCoy to Shipley&#8221; again. Receiver Jaxon Shipley is Jordan Shipley&#8217;s younger brother. Both the older McCoy and Shipley are now playing in the NFL. McCoy has the most wins of any Texas QB and Shipley is the leading receiver. Perhaps we&#8217;re going to see a repeat.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garrett Gilbert has regressed. Neither the team, nor the fans are behind him. His time as starting QB should be at an end.</li>
<li>Case McCoy looks like a viable replacement for Gilbert.</li>
<li>The Texas running game continues to improve. The combination of Cody Johnson for short yardage and Malcolm Brown for explosiveness looks good and should only get better.</li>
<li>The Texas defense is still be settling into the new system, especially in the secondary. But they showed signs of improvement in the 2nd half. They got stops when they needed them.</li>
</ul>
