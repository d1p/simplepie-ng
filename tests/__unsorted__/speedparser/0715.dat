<div class="title_box">Goal Gradient Hypothesis</div>
<div class="content_box">
<p>The closer we get to a perceived goal, the harder we work to achieve it.</p>
<p>Like rats in a maze.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="shadow shadow_medium aligncenter shadow_center"><img src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/themes/cold/lib/timthumb.php?src=http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Pac-Man-Maze-r100.jpg&amp;w=280&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1" alt="" class="border-img" /></div>
<p>via <a href="http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/loyalty-programs-of-rats-and-men.htm">Loyalty Programs: Of Rats and Men | Neuromarketing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what do rats have to do with loyalty programs? Well, back in the 1930s, researchers made an interesting discovery: rats running a maze to reach food ran faster as they got closer to the food. This finding led to the “goal gradient hypothesis,” which states that the tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal. Simply put, the closer the goal, the more effort you expend to get there.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Columbia University researchers examined the goal gradient hypothesis using unwitting human subjects, and found that people behave a lot like rats. Give them a coffee punch card that rewards them with a free coffee when full, and they will drink coffee more frequently as they approach a fully stamped card.</p></blockquote>
<p>This bit&#8217;s interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most interesting findings is [...] We perceive progress as a percent of completion, so <strong>providing someone with a “head start” can be an effective boost to a loyalty program</strong>. A plane ticket that requires using 25,000 frequent flyer miles would not seem as “close” as one that requires 35,000 miles but in which the customer starts with 10,000 miles. Coffee shops should consider adding a cup or two to their cards, but having their staff give an equivalent number of bonus punches upon first use. Not only will the card seem more complete, but the establishment will get credit for being generous.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose I&#8217;d be a better blogger if I went on to show you loads of examples of Goal Gradient Hypothesis in games. But I&#8217;m fairly sure you can think of examples yourself.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emphasis</strong> mine, throughout.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap6">1</span>See this (a write-up of <a title="Transmedia London Meetup" href="http://www.transmedialondon.com/events/17822301/">Transmedia London Meetup</a> from <a title="Joseph Humfrey - Transmedia London July write-up" href="http://josephsimaginings.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/three-transmedia-projects-and-varytale/">Joseph Humfrey</a> on a talk by <a title="Noamso on The Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/noamso/">Noam Sohoachevsky</a>, a designer at <a title="Gamelab at Picklive" href="http://gamelab.picklive.com/">Picklive</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Noam Sohachevsky surprised me, by interesting me in something football related gosh!. His company, Picklive, makes a type of live fantasy football game. You watch a match on your TV, and simultaneously earn points by betting on real-time events, as they occur, using Picklive’s website. To enter, you pick three players, which you earn points for as they pass, score goals etc, over the course of five minutes. It reminded me of the Apprentice game that the BBC hosted last year. You could make predictions throughout the show on who you thought would be fired, and could see rest of the country’s predictions displayed as a bar chart, which changed in real-time. Although it could be distracting at times, it gave a great sense of community while watching, and the gamification was well integrated.</p>
<p>There was a hint at the psychological theory of attention that was involved in designing a game that can be played on your laptop while watching TV what did he call it <strong>&#8220;dual screening&#8221;?</strong>. I guess this is partly what I found so fascinating. Noam showed graphs of the type of attention patterns that you might see while watching a football match compared to watching The Apprentice. There are clear points where a match requires your full attention. For example, as a striker approaches the goal. Compare this with the down-time when the ball goes out of play. If you can synchronise your game design around these patterns, the two screen activities are likely to integrate more seamlessly. The Apprentice is a good example of a show with a very <strong>noisy attention graph</strong> – high and low points come and go unpredictably. And in fact, this is a problem I found with the BBC’s web-app – it was easy to miss important parts while you diverted your attention to updating your predictions.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="dropcap6">2</span>Then see <a title="Transmedia vs Multiscreen Distractions" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/michaelmatthews/2011/07/08/transmedia-vs-multi-screen-distractions/">Transmedia vs Multiscreen Distractions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a recent <a href="http://www.yume.com/content/ipg-media-lab" target="_blank">IPG Media Lab and YuMe study</a>, it was stated that smart phones present a real threat to attention and is considered <strong><em>distraction media</em></strong>. The results concluded that smartphones accounted for 60 percent of TV distractions. The reason is mainly that marketers have been slow to embrace the opportunity of phones, among other devices, being used as a tool for supplemental or enhanced consumer engagement. When they do, these devices move from being a distraction to an opportunity.</p>
<p>In Canada, the Food Network and Paperny Films integrated mobile strategy into the release of a new TV series called <a href="http://eatst.foodnetwork.ca/" target="_blank">Eat St</a>. The TV show launched simultaneously with an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/eat-st/id425451799?mt=8#" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> of the same name. The app offered location-based services linking users to vendors featured on the show as well as thousands of others across North America. The app gives fans a deeper experience — they can find carts in their cities and begin accessing them. This digital integration worked two ways: <strong>fans of the app could check out the TV show, and fans of the show were introduced to the app</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>How utterly we despise the silly little bricks of the toyshops! They are too small to make a decent home for even the poorest lead soldiers, even if there were hundreds of them, and there are never enough, never nearly enough; even if you take one at a time and lay it down and say, &#8220;This is a house,&#8221; even then there are not enough. We see rich people, rich people out of motor cars, rich people beyond the dreams of avarice, going into toyshops and buying these skimpy, sickly, ridiculous pseudo-boxes of bricklets, because they do not know what to ask for, and the toyshops are just the merciless mercenary enemies of youth and happiness—so far, that is, as bricks are concerned. Their unfortunate under-parented offspring mess about with these gifts, and don&#8217;t make very much of them, and put them away; and you see their consequences in after life in the weakly-conceived villas and silly suburbs that people have built all round big cities. [...] But our box of bricks almost satisfies. With our box of bricks we can scheme and build, all three of us, for the best part of the hour, and still have more bricks in the box.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Just how popular were Richter&#8217;s Anchor blocks? Based on the printer&#8217;s marks in the plan books, which generally provide the date and the planned press run, it seems that a few (probably between three and five, but certainly less than ten) billion (Milliarde) stones were sold.</p>
<p>If these blocks were such important and interesting toys, why aren&#8217;t they more popular as collectors&#8217; items today? The simplest answer is weight. This virtue, which makes possible such large and beautiful buildings, is also the vice which makes the sets very inconvenient for dealers to handle. A relatively uninteresting and common set, a GK-NF # 6 with 105 stones, weighs seven and a half pounds; the slightly more interesting GK-NF # 12, with four trays holding 499 blocks, weighs 31 pounds. And no dealer will really want to take to a toy fair the largest of the more common sets, a GK-NF # 34, which contains 3,848 stones in a case 21 by 17 by 27 inches and weighs over 180 pounds.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Great Castle of 1884 was built for the Antwerp Universal Exhibition, where it won a first prize. Several contemporary accounts mention that it had a very high octagonal tower, as high as a man. The Leipzig Daily Advisor, on September 1, 1885, noted that a castle, very artistic and the height of a man, could be seen at the shop Lehrmittel-Anstalt of Dr. Schneider, on Schulstraße.</p></blockquote>

But this time I set out merely to tell of the ordinary joys of playing with the floor, and to gird improvingly and usefully at toymakers. So much, I think, I have done. If one parent or one uncle buys the wiselier for me, I shall not altogether have lived in vain.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Notes:</h1>
<p>Loads of images here on <a title="ankerstein.ch - Anker Steinbaukasten" href="http://www.ankerstein.ch/">ankerstein.ch</a>. And templates where people share their designs.</p>
<p>But nowhere near as many as <a title="Images of Anchor Blocks - Ankerstein" href="http://cva.flying-cat.de/">here</a>, where there are 6GB of images. If you want to check out what people made, look at the the Alte Meister section, which has photographs of models made by <a title="See the Alte Meisters bit" href="http://cva.flying-cat.de/">Old Masters</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Ankerstein.org" href="http://www.ankerstein.org/">Ankerstein.org</a> is a site devoted to the blocks. It&#8217;s a bit breathless. Here&#8217;s an <a title="Anchor Stone Constructions blog" href="http://rekna.blogspot.com/">Anchor Stone</a> blog from a hobbyist.</p>
<p>You can buy them (in the UK) from <a title="Anchor Blocks" href="http://www.anchorblocks.co.uk/">Anchor Blocks</a>. They&#8217;re not cheap.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a programme called <a title="AnkerCAD" href="http://www.anker-steine.privat.t-online.de/AnkerCAD/stones.htm">AnkerCAD</a> which will help you make all the pictures, if that&#8217;s the kind of thing you like to do. It&#8217;s very simple to use ie I managed it.</p>
<p>These things come under the category of &#8216;Architectural Construction Toys&#8217; apparently. There&#8217;s a sort of typology of Architectural Construction Toys at <a title="Architectural Construction Toys" href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toysvari.html">architoys.net</a>. Other Architectural Construction Toys that I hadn&#8217;t heard of before but which fill me with nostalgia are <a title="All About Block City" href="http://shimbopottery.com/BlockCity/about.html">Block City</a> and<a title="Super City" href="http://www.americanplasticequipment.com/ampcat/crafts/supercity.html">Super-City</a>. From the era when dads always had a pipe in their mouth.</p>
<p>Anchor Stone Blocks on <a title="Anker-steinkaubasten on The Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_Stone_Blocks">The Wikipedia</a>. They&#8217;re made of a kind of artificial stone by the way.</p>
<p>HG Wells - <em><a title="Little Wars, by HG Wells, Project Gutenberg" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3691/3691-h/3691-h.htm">Little Wars</a></em> (his other game design book) on Project Gutenberg. Both are quick, half-hour reads. And both are a model for what instruction manuals could be like. (Digression: I know it&#8217;s too late now, because we all download. But why weren&#8217;t more instruction manuals designed to be read on the bus?)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The internet. . .</h3>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-undermine-collective-imagining.-r100.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" title="9-undermine-collective-imagining.-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-undermine-collective-imagining.-r100.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="354" /></a></p>
<h3>Inapprehension</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly what to make of this series of four videos (which comes via <a title="Rock, Paper, Shotgun - Sunday Papers" href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/06/12/the-sunday-papers-174/">Rock, Paper, Shotgun&#8217;s Sunday Papers</a> and <a title="Metafilter - Will Self, Self-referential" href="http://www.metafilter.com/104629/Self-Referential">Metafilter</a>) featuring Will Self talking about our digital lives, the internet and games.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he makes some interesting points.</p>
<p>Digital stuff isn&#8217;t &#8216;immediately apprehensible to the senses&#8217; and so I suppose, in that way, it might have something in common with religious experiences.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not sure I agree that &#8216;the internet experience is very fragmenting&#8217; or that our digital lives are &#8216;uncollective&#8217;.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of things are fragmenting. But then new things are being reformed.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve stopped watching/participating in a load of things we used to all do together. But that doesn&#8217;t mean our experiences are uncollective.</p>
<h3>Preposterous!</h3>
<p>I do, however, totally agree with this:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-y-r100.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123" title="9-y-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-y-r100.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-z-r100.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124" title="9-z-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/9-z-r100.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<h3>Gaming and the Detestable Self</h3>
<p>But how&#8217;s this for preposterous?</p>
<p>From the same Rock, Paper, Shotgun Sunday Papers round-up – the Brainy Gamer, <a title="Notes on Becoming" href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2011/06/notes-on-becoming.html">Notes on Becoming</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of identity, I recently finished <em>L.A. Noire</em>, which frustrated my desire to connect with my avatar, Cole Phelps. As the game wore on, I grew to loathe him and found myself conducting an internal Q&amp;A with myself. Is this arrogant cop supposed to represent me? No. But I&#8217;m controlling him. Yes. Doesn&#8217;t that create an unnerving disconnect? Yes. How do I feel about that? I don’t like it. Is that interesting to me? Absolutely.</p>
<p>As a contemplation on self and non-self, <em>L.A. Noire</em> does something fairly outrageous. It deliberately distances me from &#8216;my&#8217; character while forcing me to &#8216;control&#8217; him. Consequently, the concept of ‘self’ is thrown out of whack. How do I make the right choice when my avatar can’t be trusted to properly execute my decisions? With each promotion up the ladder, why do I feel implicated in the detestable thing Cole Phelps is becoming?</p>
<p>We often use the term ‘dissonance’ to describe a tension or clash between two disharmonious elements in game design, and <em>L.A. Noire</em> is full of such clashes. But in this case, I’m not sure that’s a bad thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not preposterous, but it certainly involved the flexing of some kind of imaginative muscle.</p>
<p>Will argues that the <a title="febrility ie feverishness" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/febrility">&#8216;febrility&#8217;</a> of screen-based media means that nobody has to make much effort. And I suppose he&#8217;s right – BrainyGamer didn&#8217;t <em>have to</em> make the effort to write a piece about gaming and Buddhism.</p>
<p>Where were we again?</p>
<h3>Digital Paradigms</h3>
<p>Will also says that when all these gamey, webby, digitalish things happen on the same screens, we can&#8217;t help but afford them the same ontological status &#8211; basically, that we lose the ability to be able to tell them apart.</p>
<p>Well, <a title="The Psychology of Horror (in video games)" href="http://games.slashdot.org/submission/1475384/The-Psychology-of-Horror-in-Video-Games-and-Movies">maybe</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that does make sense is the observation that games often do reflect a certain way of looking at the world, a rather specific paradigm &#8211; here, talking about some research on what new media might look like he did for Phillips in the late 80s:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5-advancing.-r100.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" title="5-advancing.-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5-advancing.-r100.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>And this rings true-ish, at first blush:</p>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/7-common-denominator.-r100.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120" title="7-common-denominator.-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/7-common-denominator.-r100.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="351" /></a></p>
<h3>Now we see the violence inherent in the system</h3>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The use of violence in video games is – at least partly – often a function of our limited intefaces. It&#8217;s a <a title="We Need More Verbs!" href="http://hypergogue.net/2011/05/20/we-need-more-verbs/">lack of verbs</a>, as much as bloodlust. <a title="Auntie Pixelante on level design lesson: to the right, hold on tight" href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=465">Auntiepixelante</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>games (digital or otherwise) are composed of rules. certain rules give the player liberty to change the state of the game (the “game state”) in specific ways: i like to call these “verbs,” as in the part of speech. if mario is the subject of most of the sentences in super mario bros.’s story, then “jump” is the verb that most often follows – jumping is so crucial that it gets its own button on the control pad.[1] the idea of jumping into a box to open it or onto an opponent to defeat it makes little sense out of context, but since the player’s foremost means of interacting with the game is through the verb JUMP, all of the game’s elements have been designed as potential objects of that verb.</p>
<p>“mario jumps into a block.” “mario jumps onto a goomba.” “mario jumps on top of a pipe.” “mario jumps across a pit.” this is why almost all of the doors in metroid are opened by gunfire, even though i’ve never encountered a door i had to shoot to open: samus aran, having a gun for an arm, interacts with her world primarily by shooting. it makes sense, within the context of that game, for doors to open upon being shot.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I <a title="Punch Trees" href="http://punchtrees.com/index.php">punch trees</a>, I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m stooping to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Will&#8217;s big problems here is that he&#8217;s almost certainly right about some things, but that he hasn&#8217;t really bothered to make the effort to investigate. For somebody who revels in such visceral writing, his is a remarkably bloodless analysis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all the sensible things he might have to say are undermined by his lack of understanding. Ultimately, this image pretty much sums it up:</p>

<p>However you dress it up, this is slapdash analysis dressed up in thoughtful vocabulary. If you&#8217;re going to come out with dire warnings about a younger generation then you&#8217;ll probably have to do a little bit more than think, and a little bit more than observe.</p>
<p>You have to take part and find things out for yourself.  Otherwise, it&#8217;s just preying on the same old moral panics which we&#8217;ve always had:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Proteus: a game/toy that's trying to do something similar to a near-plotless manga.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How&#8217;s <em>this</em> for a comic?</p>
<blockquote><p>Who takes the time these days to climb a tree in bare feet to rescue a child’s toy? To stop and observe the birds? To play in the puddles after a storm? To go down to the sea to put back a shell? The Walking Man does as he strolls at random through urban Japan—often silent, often alone—with his vivid dreams that let time stand still.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a title="Shaenon K Garrity's LiveJournal" href="http://shaenon.livejournal.com/38931.html">Shaenon K Garrity&#8217;s LiveJournal</a>:-</p>
<p><strong>The Cover</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_cover-r100.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-130 aligncenter" title="walking_cover-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_cover-r100.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="704" /></a></p>
<p><strong>A typical action sequence</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_sea1-r100.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-131 aligncenter" title="walking_sea1-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_sea1-r100.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="865" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The climax</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_tree2-r100.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-132 aligncenter" title="walking_tree2-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/walking_tree2-r100.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="872" /></a>A comic about a man walking around seems like a fine idea to me, especially when it&#8217;s drawn so beautifully.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As does this game, <a title="Proteus - by Twisted Tree, download from here (21.06.11 - it's still in Alpha)" href="http://twistedtreegames.tumblr.com/">Proteus</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Proteus.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134" title="Proteus" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Proteus.png" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Proteus</em> is a game by <a title="Twisted Tree Games - on Tumblr" href="http://twistedtreegames.tumblr.com/">Twisted Tree</a> in which you wander round making music.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ambient music.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the <a title="It turns out there's this The Walking Man..." href="http://twistedtreegames.tumblr.com/post/5691061995/it-turns-out-that-theres-a-wonderful-meditative">developers sa</a>y:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">It turns out that there’s a wonderful, meditative, near-plotless manga called The Walking Man which seems similar in some ways to what we’re trying to do with Proteus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s some links to Proteus videos on the <a title="Twisted Trees - Proteus Video Round-up" href="http://twistedtreegames.tumblr.com/post/6460548929/youtube-video-roundup">Twisted Trees Tumblr</a>. Like this one:</p>
<p><object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/luDQu4RSBL0?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/luDQu4RSBL0?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I suppose there&#8217;s inevitable comparisons with the-monster-that-is-Minecraft. But, with its theme of &#8220;Ambient Exploration&#8221;, it&#8217;s more like the Inception App, RjDj and other explorations of <a title="Accoustic Ecologies" href="http://ludexed.com/2011/05/19/out-of-the-box/">Accoustic Ecologies</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the minute, there&#8217;s not a great deal happening in the demo. The world doesn&#8217;t feel responsive enough to qualify as a toy or a game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But it&#8217;s still exciting and it&#8217;s made me happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note: translation of the book&#8217;s inner-flap comes from <a title="Soliloquy in Blue" href="http://www.flaminggeeks.com/swanjun/?p=1359">Soliloquy in Blue</a> where there is this splendid description of one of the stories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“The Long Trail,” in which the walking man and an older fellow keep passing each other on a trail, but end up walking together by the end.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Space Alert is a game like a Space Opera. Or, at least, a space musical. It's a game of panic, screaming and leadership.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/space-alert-board-r100.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-99 aligncenter" title="space-alert-board-r100" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/space-alert-board-r100.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Then the computer announced a serious threat. We flipped the card, revealing some monstrous alien battleship that got a boost to its shields every time we damaged it, and my eager crew looked up at me for instructions. What did I do? I looked at the board, crunched some numbers in my head and realised… we couldn’t beat it. We were all in the wrong place, and so were our energy reserves. Metaphorically speaking, the game had noticed we were off balance, leapt forward and locked us into a choke hold.</p>
<p>It was such a hopeless moment as to be inspiring. Here was my crew, their lives hanging by a thread, and here was me, too stupid to know what to do and too cowardly to admit it. I stopped breathing, scared that the fact that we wouldn’t be coming home would somehow escape my lips together with all that hot air. I looked across the table at my lieutenant who would, in theory, take over if I resigned. Could he deal with this?</p>
<p>Then I realised that this is what leadership is. What I was experiencing was a shade of what countless leaders have felt throughout history when they realised that they were fucked. When they needed to find a way when there was no way, when they wanted to throw in the towel but that wasn’t an option either. I felt so overwhelmingly privileged that a boardgame was letting me experience this that I decided, in the face of hopelessness, to do my best, and attempted to lock each of the players at my disposal into position, like cogs in a machine.</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/06/11/not-cardboard-children-space-alert/#more-61973">Not Cardboard Children: Space Alert | Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>.</p>
<p>Space Alert – a &#8220;game of panicking, of screaming at your friends&#8217; which, <a title="It turns out" href="http://jsomers.net/blog/it-turns-out">it turns out</a>, helps you practice your leadership skills.</p>
<p>The execution is interesting. A CD soundtrack provides pace and atmosphere, the board gives a spatial metaphor while cards add detail and randomness. And the randomness is often what makes for depth.</p>
<p>On reading about the CD, it sounded <a title="Dragon's Lair - learn the script" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon's_Lair#Reception">Dragon&#8217;s Lair</a> lame. But it&#8217;s actually pretty neat, if you&#8217;re one of the lucky people able to suspend disbelief effectively it works pretty much the same way the songs do in a musical &#8211; dialogue for plot, songs for emotion:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-xRtAWFQIhw?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-xRtAWFQIhw?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>And I think <a title="Have you heard of Space Alert" href="http://videosgames.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/have-you-heard-of-space-alert/">Quinns</a> is right, it is fun to move around bits of plastic. (If you&#8217;re interested, <em><a title="I am a doctor" href="http://http://ohfuckyeahmemes.com/post/6339803825">this</a></em> is why.

In this case Space Alert is simply too much of a game about communication. Doing it remotely would strangle that.</p>
<p>(Not to mention that it’s important not to forget the childish appeal of sliding bits of plastic around a table.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a criticism of Space Alert from <a title="Bit-Tech review of Space Alert - a mixed review" href="http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2010/12/27/bit-tech-plays-space-alert/1">Bit-Tech</a>, which actually sounds like a compliment to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine playing something similar, such as Tetris, which requires constant attention. Now imagine you’ve got four other people looking over your shoulder, each desperate to save the day and get involved, and they&#8217;re all grabbing at the screen and telling you where to put the next blocks and what to look out for. One of them is always telling you how you’ve just messed up, while another is urging you to only look at the preview of the next piece. That’s exactly what playing Space Alert is like, which perfectly illustrates why it would be fantastic as a single-player game, and why it fails as a multiplayer shouting match.</p></blockquote>
<p>A review by <a title="Space Alert" href="http://www.iguk.co.uk/products/space-alert-8218.aspx">Likeless at IGUK</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not usually a fan of time limits. I tend to find they stress me out and I like to think clearly to enjoy a game. But the dynamic of Space Alert somehow switches this problem around. The &#8220;puzzles&#8221; in the game are simple enough that, with no time limit, everybody would perform effortlessly in each mission. The time limit therefore *is* the game.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="color: #ed5050;">Acid</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved this story about <em>Acid Tracks</em> by Phuture, widely regarded as<a title="Phuture - Acid Tracks | First acid house record" href="http://dilate.choonz.com/index.php?id=1621"> the first Acid House record</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Acid Tracks</em> was something of a technological immaculate conception, making Acid House a sound born entirely of machine: one day Earl Spanky bought a Roland 303 and Spanky, Pierre and Herbert J had a go with it: “We didn’t know how to program. When we plugged it in, it was already making that sound. It had plenty of different acid loops. As we didn’t know how to ‘create’, we worked on the only one that sounded good. No one really invented it, it was already in there. We sequenced it, and Spanky made the beats.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="highlight2">When we plugged it in, it was already making that sound &#8230; it was already in there.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this evening, it was decided that one of us at home would have to drive to the supermarket. I leapt at the chance.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the <a title="Inception - the App" href="http://inceptiontheapp.com/">Inception App</a>. Which I wanted to play with in a shop.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d already walked through some fields, singing, whistling, chanting and even rapping (I know, how embarrassing, and me at my age etc). And I&#8217;d spent a bit of time by a roadside. Now I wanted to try it around people.</p>
<p>I wanted to <em>play with</em> it in a shop.</p>
<p>The Inception App is essentially the soundtrack from the film mixed with <a title="Augmented sound, and other senses" href="http://www.augmented.org/blog/2011/04/sound-and-other-senses/">augmented sound</a>. Which basically means that the phone&#8217;s microphone picks up sounds which it integrates into the music.</p>
<p>And there are also some &#8216;pervasive gaming elements&#8217; ie you can only unlock certain bits of the soundtrack by doing various things, sitting still, travelling fast, playing on a full moon, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And it was fun. I could hear bitchy shop assistants bicker unnaturally clearly, their voices looped and treated. Another shopper dropped a coin, which I liked – I suppose that bit was quite like the film.</p>
<p>I spent five happy minutes picking up various types of dried bean and listening to the app muck about with the crinkly sounds.</p>
<p>And all the time I was whistling. If you like whistling, you should definitely try it.</p>

<h1 style="color: #ed5050;"> Acoustic ecology</h1>
<blockquote><p>Just as the mis-en-scène of a game is everything in front of the camera &#8230; soundscape in a game is the total combination of everything the player hears, from footsteps to achievement notifications. It can be predicted to a degree, but will never really be known until one is immersed in it. This is because a soundscape is constructed out of, among other things, dynamic sounds and the mobile player&#8217;s constantly changing distance to 3D sound sources. I like to call this soundscape possibility space the level&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_ecology">acoustic ecology</a>. The acoustic ecology is a fundamental part of what transforms the abstract space composed of physical relationships between objects into a place that communicates context for narrative meaning to be derived from.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s Michael McBride-Charpentier talking about his <a title="Soundscape experiment in Half Life 2" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichelMcBrideCharpentier/20110509/7585/Acoustic_Ecologies_HalfLife_2s_City_17.php">soundscape recording</a> of a short walk through Half Life&#8217;s City 17.</p>
<p>And it pretty much explains what the Inception app does. It <em>transforms the space</em>.</p>
<p>Into what, I&#8217;m not exactly sure. But I&#8217;ve never chosen food before by sound. Or noticed the other people so much. And maybe that&#8217;s the point.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the soundscape recording from City 17:</p>
<p><object width="100%" height="81"><param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F14702521" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F14702521" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object> <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/michelmcbride/city17-soundscape">City 17 Soundscape</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/michelmcbride">michelmcbride</a></span></p>
<h1 style="color: #ed5050;"> RjDj</h1>
<p>Similar to this (and by the same team) is <a title="RjDj" href="http://rjdj.me/">RjDj</a>, which I can&#8217;t quite get on with. It seems to demand a lot more interactivity &#8211; it&#8217;s more toy than pervasive game.</p>
<p>But, equally, it might be that I&#8217;m too tight to pay for any of the tracks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what all this augmented sound stuff means for the future of music ™ or, even, if it means anything at all. But I do know that a surprisingly large proportion of my music collection sounds like the very pleasant noises the toy below makes. A person can put up with a lot if they make something themselves, even if it&#8217;s only a little bit.</p>
<p>I just need Spanky to make the beats.</p>

<p>At some point, I&#8217;ll add all this stuff to the <a title="Toy department - on rails" href="http://http://ludexed.com/toy-design/">Toy department</a>. But not yet.</p>

<p>Blizzard&#8217;s just released details of a new follower system for <a title="Diablo 3 - Official Site" href="http://http://us.blizzard.com/diablo3/">Diablo 3</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a smart move<a title="Follower system detailed on G4TV" href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/712625/diablo-3-follower-system-detailed-enchantress-templar-or-scoundrel/"> to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We specifically wanted to change them from the notion of a faceless, nameless person that you hire to a distinct character who has a strong personality, strong views of the world, a unique class and chooses to follow you not because you pay them, but because they look at you as a great hero that they want to be around and help.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s something more here than <a title="Details on followers in Diablo 3 from the official site" href="http://us.blizzard.com/diablo3/world/systems/followers.xml">improving your odds</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The followers act as your companions in the world, rather than as pets. While the followers are not core story characters, they enhance the story elements of the game.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/a-boy-and-his-dog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41" title="a-boy-and-his-dog" src="http://ludexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/a-boy-and-his-dog.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>I started off thinking that <a title="Minecraft" href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> was an <a title="Omega Man" href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20101106151026/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067525/plotsummary">Omega Man</a> simulator - later  kind-of-remade into <a title="I am Legend" href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20101106151026/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/">I am Legend</a> with Will ‘the Fresh Prince’ Smith. And then, because it’s a cooler film, I started thinking of <a title="A Boy and his Dog" href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20101106151026/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072730/">A Boy and his Dog</a>. In both of these films, a lot of the story, in the early parts where nothing much actually happens, comes from the &#8216;boy&#8217; and the &#8216;legend&#8217; just talking to their dog.</p>
<p>I think that – in any game – if you were given a dog that followed you around, and moped, and bounded, and panted, and did doggy stuff, a story would emerge.</p>
<p>And, of course, Minecraft has introduced the <a title="Minecraft Wolf" href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wolf">Wolf</a>. Which attack the mobs, but also give you something to do. Having a pet gives you some kind of emergent story.</p>
<p>These Diablo NPCs are cooler, I suppose. But if you don&#8217;t have the resources to build something like this, you could just <a title="Fable 2" href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20090227054514/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable_II#Gameplay">add a dog</a>.</p>
