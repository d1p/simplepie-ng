<p>After a much needed and wonderful holiday break, it is great to be back in the office for the first workday of 2011. This year is already looking like an exciting year as we will be releasing our first iphone/ipad application and will be making a much bigger push into the web/interactive design world. We have also created some regular blog series to keep the blog populated through the year. We wish you all a very happy new year and hope that 2011 turns out to be an excellent year for you. We look forward to working with you, meeting you, seeing you at an AIGA event or just communicating with you digitally.

		    <description><![CDATA[<p>We were connected with <a href="http://moodypublishers.com" title="Moody Publishers' Site" target="_blank">Moody Publishers</a> through <a href="http://flypropeller.com" title="Propeller's Site" target="_blank">Propeller Consulting</a> to work on a new microsite to coordinate with the release of <a href="http://garychapman.org" title="Gary Chapman's Site" target="_blank">Gary Chapman&#8217;s </a>book, <em>Things I Wish I&#8217;d Known Before We Got Married</em>. Gary Chapman is an author, speaker, pastor and counselor with a passion for people and for helping them form lasting relationships. Moody Publishers asked that the side kept with the design of the book. Additionally, they asked that the site be managed through wordpress and easily updated. Some key features of the site include Vimeo integration which allows for videos posted on Vimeo to automatically appear on the site, drop down menus for purchasing the book and pop up windows for viewing video content. In addition to the site, we also created a newsletter template and banner ads to promote the site.

		    <description><![CDATA[<p>Girls of Grace is a series of conferences targeted to junior and senior high girls. The conferences were founded by the popular female Christian music group Point of Grace. We were asked to design a new mark for the conference on an extremely limited time frame which did not allow for us to go through the typical process of development that we go through for logo work. The client asked for a logo that would be modern and sleek for today&#8217;s teen. We decided that given the time frame and the brand recognition that already existed with the conference, a word mark would be the most successful approach. Therefore, we developed a series of word marks and presented the client with the four most successful solutions.

		    <description><![CDATA[<p>1000 Generations is a piano-driven pop rock band who we were connected with through <a href="http://flypropeller.com" title="Propeller Consulting"  target="_blank"> Propeller Consulting</a>.&nbsp; The band wanted a brand new website to coincide with the release of their most recent album, <em>Turn Off The Lesser Lights</em>. 1000 Generations had a large amount of content that they wanted available on their site and wanted to be able to manage all of it through Wordpress. Additionally, they wanted for a number of the information channels to be automatically populated through RSS feeds from elsewhere on the web. Through adapting a number of Wordpress&#8217;s features, we were able to create a site that could be managed and populated through a basic interaction with Wordpress. Additional features include an e-commerce section, an audio player, rotating images, an exclusive content section, and a Musician&#8217;s Lounge that features chord charts and audio samples to aid in learning to play the band&#8217;s songs.

<p>In an effort to get the student groups more involved, our local AIGA chapter in Nashville decided to do an event to kick off the school year. <a href="mailto:ryan@kangaroopress.com" title="Contact Ryan Nole">Ryan Nole</a>, who runs <a href="http://kangaroopress.com">Kangaroo Press</a> and I have been wanting to screen print a poster together for some time so this seemed to be the perfect opportunity. </p>

<p>It has been a number of years since I have been rollerskating. Aside from countlessly falling down, I remembered being fascinated by the lights. Therefore, I attempted to recreated this experience in the form of a two color poster. </p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to work on a project with <a href="http://kangaroopress.com">Kangaroo Press</a>, then I highly recommend that you do. The shop is full of tee shirt presses, an automatic screen printer for posters, letterpress equipment and finishing tools. Here are some pictures of the process. </p>

		    <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, we have worked with the Catalyst Conference on designing apparel for both sale as well as for their staff. Catalyst takes place each year in Atlanta, GA and has expanded to include a West Coast Conference. The conference intertwines both faith and leadership with a goal of creating a new generation of church leaders. Attendees of the conference often fall into both the college age group as well as later twenty-something age group. Each year, we approach the project with both the Catalyst brand in mind as well as the year&#8217;s theme of the conference. This has resulted in a striking line of products that have been well received by the attendees of the event.

		    <description><![CDATA[<p>Over several years, we have had the opportunity to manage the merchandise for the popular rock band Relient K. This role has involved not only designing the products but also art directing other designers and  managing the creation of the physical item. Fans of Relient K tend to range from about 16 to 24 years old. The band is known for their witty lyrics infused with catchy melodies. From the beginning, we saw Relient K as a brand with their merchandise being and extension of that brand. The merchandise has been designed to target the intended audience while communicating the quirky qualities of the band.&nbsp; Merchandise continues to be a successful stream of revenue for the band.
