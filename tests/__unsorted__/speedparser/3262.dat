I&#8217;ve known Tina for many years through our work together at Grechen&#8217;s Closet, but I had never met her until I was in NYC the week of Labor Day.

<p>This past weekend, my friend &#038; one of my FAVORITE jewelry designers, <a href="http://www.tinatang.com/index.php/">Tina Tang</a>, was in town for a trunk show. I&#8217;ve known Tina for many years through our work together at Grechen&#8217;s Closet, but I had never met her until I was in NYC the week of Labor Day.  And if you&#8217;ve read Grechen&#8217;s Closet for a while, you will probably know that I am ALWAYS wearing my <a href="http://www.tinatang.com/index.php/star-lucky-charm.html">Tina Tang necklace</a>.  Literally.  I never take it off, and I don&#8217;t think I have since she sent it to me, about four years ago.</p>
<p>Tina&#8217;s designs are so versatile, and really work for almost any style.  She has simple, classic pieces, but also more bold &#038; interesting designs, like some of her new ones, the <a href="http://www.tinatang.com/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/3331/s/buddha-head-bracelet/category/138/">Buddha head bracelet</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.tinatang.com/index.php/minotaur-horn-necklace.html">Minotaur horn necklace</a>.</p>
<p>Please visit her site when you have a chance &#8211; like I said, she designs something for everyone, and in all price ranges.  And I&#8217;m working on getting her back here next year for an event TBA, so stay tuned for the next opportunity to meet Tina in person!</p>

<p>Have you visited <a href="http://shop.schatzeleinaustin.com/">Schatzelein</a> (shots.a.line &#8211; is how you pronounce it)? It&#8217;s a quaint, unassuming little house/boutique on S. 1st street in Austin, and it is AMAZING.  Owner Christine Fail has stocked the shop with so many beautiful &#038; accessible pieces of jewelry, it&#8217;s always hard to leave without buying something.  Christine also designs her own line of simple, minimal jewelry, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/failjewelry">Fail</a>, which are some of my favorite pieces in the shop.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s 100% worth the visit; once you go, I guarantee you&#8217;ll become obsessed. I know I am.</p>
<p>About the pictures:</p>
<ol>
<li>LOVED these friendship bracelets by <a href="http://shop.schatzeleinaustin.com/product/julie-rofman-galapagos-thin-handwoven-beaded-bracelet">Julie Rofman</a> so much I almost left with one.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;m always a sucker for good skull jewelry&#8230;</li>
<li>Love the mixed metals &#038; textures of <a href="http://shop.schatzeleinaustin.com/artist/fail">these pieces</a> by shop owner Christine Fail.</li>
<li>More pieces by Fail Jewelry &#8211; love the delicate bracelets &#038; rings. </li>
<li>This is the second time I&#8217;ve tried on a pair of the <a href="http://shop.schatzeleinaustin.com/product/fail-large-14k-gold-infinity-earring">&#8220;infinity&#8221; earrings</a> (also by shop owner, Christine Fail).  They&#8217;re stunning, and really easy to get on once you know the trick.  I almost left with a pair of these as well, but didn&#8217;t.  That&#8217;s okay, I need an excuse to go back <img src='http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been obsessed with these Verabel &#038; Fox lockets since I saw them online several months ago &#8211; they&#8217;re even prettier in person <img src='http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
<li>I generally prefer &#8220;delicate&#8221; rings, but lately I&#8217;m starting to appreciate the larger, statement-making ring &#8211; like these by Bora.  Sharon has one, and it&#8217;s perfect.</li>
<li>And speaking of Sharon&#8230;here she is modeling two of her purchases from Schatzalein that day: the vintage horn bracelet and <a href="http://shop.schatzeleinaustin.com/product/fail-14k-thin-gold-cuff-bracelet">hammered gold-fill cuff.</a></li>

<p><a href="http://www.tessdress.com">Tess</a> is a new company, and this is Theresa&#8217;s first foray into designing, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like it when you look at her dresses.  I was immediately impressed with the pieces&#8217; interesting details, colors, patterns and attention to quality that it felt like I was looking at an established line.  Theresa&#8217;s inspiration is vintage, but she designs for the modern woman; I kept imagining a woman who loves pretty frocks dressing up in some of the <a href="http://www.tessdress.com/catalogue/day-dresses/margot-peacock">simpler shifts</a> with a jacket for work, then changing into the <a href="http://www.tessdress.com/catalogue/day-dresses/audrey-0">Audrey</a> or <a href="http://www.tessdress.com/catalogue/day-dresses/marlene-floral">Marlene</a> dresses after work or on the weekends for a bit of fun.</p>
<p>As I touched and played with the dresses, I really got a feel for their heirloom quality and the unique details &#8211; like 100% rayon linings and matching belts &#8211; that make them special.  And even though those of you who know me know that &#8217;50&#8242;s &#038; &#8217;60&#8242;s vintage-inspired frocks aren&#8217;t necessarily my style, I always appreciate good design and interesting details when I see them. You probably also know that I&#8217;m a sucker for a good story, local design &#038; local manufacturing, which Tess has too.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in seeing for yourself what goes into Tess&#8217; designs and have a chance to touch, feel and try on some of the pieces, save the date for our Happy Hour/Showroom visit with Tess on August 11th!!  More details to follow&#8230;</p>
<p>**and just today Theresa announced her new line of <a href="http://www.tessdress.com/conversation/dresses/2011/07/summer-separates-announcement">Summer separates</a>!</p>
<p>About the images:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detailing at the shoulder &#8211; I loved all the details Theresa inserts into her designs; they are so thoughtful and unique.</li>
<li>Some of Theresa&#8217;s sketches for next season.  My favorite is the second dress from the left on top &#8211; such a pretty silhouette!</li>
<li>The rack of dresses and some fabric for inspiration</li>
<li>Fabric swatches!! </li>
<li>This was my favorite fabric. Can you imagine a dress or skirt made out of this with the design blooming from the bottom hem? I can, and it would be GORGEOUS!!!</li>
<li>I loved the style and print of this dress.  It&#8217;s kind of perfect for super-hot Texas summers: wear it belted for more structure (or for work), then for the weekend, wear it as-is!  Incidentally, most of Theresa&#8217;s dresses come with matching covered belts she has made especially for her.</li>
<li>This was another of my <a href="http://www.tessdress.com/catalogue/day-dresses/audrey-0">favorite dresses</a>.  The print caught me immediately (I love poppies), but I also love the square neck and then plunging back!  Notice the button detailing and zipper down the back&#8230;</li>
<li>Speaking of details&#8230;Theresa explained to me how the flat pannel at the front of this dress (in between the pleats) helps to hide a tummy!  I also loved the color of this print.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which dress is your favorite? Can you choose??</p>

<p>Another one of my FAVORITE boutiques in Austin is <a href="http://spartan-shop.com/">Spartan</a> (which shares space with <a href="http://shopbowsplusarrows.com/">bows+arrows</a> &#8211; another one of my favorite places!).  I hesitated even going in there just to take photos yesterday because I&#8217;m always tempted to buy something; they have such a fabulous selection of independent jewelry designers at very reasonable prices.  And as far as I know, they&#8217;re the only place in town that carries a good selection of <a href="http://www.seevivier.com">Clare Vivier bags</a>, a designer I have been OBSESSED with for years&#8230;</p>
<p>I did manage to leave without buying anything, but am going back today to buy the small, delicate gold bracelet you see in the last picture.  It&#8217;s just what I was looking for, funnily enough, after seeing a picture of Clare Vivier wearing a similar style on my friend&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://www.stylebite.com/2011/06/orange-nails.html">Style Bite</a>!</p>
<p>About the photos:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of <a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/tags/67-travel/75-travel-bags?page=2">Clare Vivier&#8217;s</a> amazing bags</li>
<li>AMAZING <a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/811-perfumed-locket">perfumed locket by Erica Weiner</a> &#8211; the locket is beautiful itself, but it also comes with fabric swatches and perfumed oils.  I&#8217;m going to be saving my pennies for this one.</li>
<li><a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/976-polemos-necklace">Erin Consadine</a> &amp; manimal necklaces.  The Erin Consadine necklaces are so beautiful &#8211; they&#8217;re made with organic/eco-friendly dyes, threads &amp; findings.  And Manimal uses leftover leather from Moccasins to make her necklaces.</li>
<li>More <a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/tags/67-travel/75-travel-bags?page=2">Clare Vivier</a> bags &#8211; such a great size for Summer</li>
<li>Manimal vegan moccs &#8211; and baby sizes!! So cute!!!!</li>
<li><a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/1016-mojave-clutch">Triangle print pouch</a> &#8211; love the colors and simplicity of this, also that the company aims to create relationships with artisans in developing countries.</li>
<li>Small <a href="http://spartan-shop.com/products/1066-tiny-enameled-locket">enameled lockets</a>, and delicate ring/bracelet by Trois Petits Points</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you been to Spartan? What do you love there?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Please bear with me, I&#8217;m trying to get used to having my fiance&#8217;s son here for the Summer and haven&#8217;t been able to get my act together enough to do any more photo-shoots at my favorite Austin boutiques, but I did make my bi-weekly pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.mossdesignerconsignment.blogspot.com/">MOSS</a> yesterday and spotted some amazing pieces:</p>
<p><img src="http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mossgucciinstagram.jpg" alt="" title="mossgucciinstagram" width="612" height="612" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100" /></p>
<p>(aren&#8217;t these Gucci&#8217;s amazing? they&#8217;re a size 37, alas, too small for me, but they looked to have been hardly worn&#8230;)</p>
<p><img src="http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mossmissoniinstagram.jpg" alt="" title="mossmissoniinstagram" width="612" height="612" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99" /></p>
<p>(can you spot the Missoni?? I can&#8217;t even imagine putting something that warm on my body right now, but the colors are amazing, and I loved that it was a longer length.  And the navy/crocheted dress in the front was SUPER cute!!)</p>
<p>Contact <a href="http://www.mossdesignerconsignment.blogspot.com/">MOSS</a> if you&#8217;re interested in anything you see &#8211; or better yet, stop in and SHOP!!! And say hi to Sari if you do <img src='http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Have you been to <a href="http://www.mossdesignerconsignment.blogspot.com/">MOSS Designer Consignment</a> yet? Since they opened last Fall I&#8217;ve been more times than I can count; I go at least once every two weeks, sometimes more often if I clean out my closet <img src='http://austinfashionseen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Some of my favorite pieces now in my closet are from MOSS: vintage Wrangler denim shirt, DvF dress, Kurt Geiger shoes&#8230;and I&#8217;ve also sold a lot of stuff via MOSS (anyone out there buy my camel brown caged Robert Clergerie wedges, or striped A.P.C. tees?).  </p>
<p>Part of my love for MOSS is that it&#8217;s run by some of my favorite fashion people in Austin (Emily &#038; Masha from <a href="http://feathersboutiquevintage.blogspot.com/">Feathers</a>) and my friend Sari.  It&#8217;s a fun place to hang out, try stuff on, and play around with pieces you might not normally come in contact with &#8211; like a pair of Alexander McQueen box clutches they got in recently.  And I always find something I can&#8217;t live without, although I will admit I&#8217;m relatively new to second-hand and vintage shopping.  But it&#8217;s really one of the best ways to buy high-quality, designer pieces without spending a lot of money; if you fall in love with something at MOSS, you know it&#8217;s unique, and high-quality.</p>
<p>Have you bought anything at MOSS? How often do you visit? </p>
<p>About the pictures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love the design of MOSS&#8217; space (by Paul Valentine) and the custom clothing racks.</li>
<li>How gorgeous is this Philip Lim dress? Since Alexander Wang started putting zippers all over his bags, I&#8217;ve been obsessed&#8230;</li>
<li>More zippers! This (also) Philip Lim skirt is amazing, but HEAVY! totally worth it though&#8230;</li>
<li>Pucci scarves.  Sigh.</li>
<li>I love that they display the most interesting shoes up front on the marble table.  I try to make these Jill Stuart huarache flats fit every time I go in, but they&#8217;re too big. (I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re an 8 1/2)</li>
<li>Mociun tank top &#8211; Mociun is fabulous and always attention-getting.</li>
<li>I just loved the colors and zipper detailing on this Benhaz Sarafpour dress!</li>
<li>Jimmy Choo&#8230;</li>
<li>Tsumori Chisato top &#8211; this isn&#8217;t for everyone, but paired with white skinny jeans and red espadrilles? SO cute for Summer.  And you won&#8217;t see this on anyone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy Shopping!!</p>
