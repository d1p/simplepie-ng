Like, quite a bit. I&#8217;d also like to write one some day. Here is something I wrote recently, with the theoretical intent that it might have a place in my unwritten detective story some day. Enjoy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*   *   *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Surely you can&#8217;t be serious,” remarked the Brit, fiddling absently with the rings on his left hand.</p>
<p>“I am serious,” I replied, and with a last gasp of ill-advised bravado continued “and don&#8217;t call me &#8216;Shirley&#8217;.”</p>
<p>The Brit&#8217;s eyes narrowed. His lips drew into a thing line.</p>
<p>“How clever,” he sneered, and gestured to someone behind me with that doughy, bejeweled hand. I heard the floor creak as what I estimated to be a rhino&#8217;s worth of meat shifted its inhuman bulk and approached.</p>
<p>Suddenly I noticed that the back of my head hurt a lot, and then I didn&#8217;t notice much of anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take me very long, once I woke up, to realize where I was. I don&#8217;t know if that weird empty-stomach feeling is something everyone gets, or if I&#8217;m somehow unique. I like to think that it&#8217;s unique;  sort of a minor superpower. Then again, it&#8217;s not particularly useful to sense when one is on a plane: Usually there are a few other tip-offs.</p>
<p>As I felt the wind roaring past the thin hull on which I lay, a tiny part of my brain laughed—had this been some sort of macabre humor in the part of the Brit? The rest of me was busy being utterly and completely terrified.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a beast appeared from some other part of the plane. His lumbering walk, which make the metal floor creak under each footstep, was unmistakable: He was the gentleman responsible for my late unconsciousness. I opened my mouth to fire off some smart, cavalier turn of phrase, but all I was able to manage was a high-pitched moan, followed by a choking sort of grunt. Apparently unmoved by my startling display of wit, the rhinoceros man hefted me over his shoulder like a duffel full of dirty clothes and began moving toward the rear of the craft.</p>
<p>My captors had not even bothered to bind me, so convinced were they of my own incompetence. As we near the gaping portal which, it seemed clear, was to be my final destination, I took advantage of my relative freedom and began to flail and kick at my ride in a desperate bid for escape. I might as well have punched a brick wall for all the good it did me.</p>
<p>My escape attempt a failure, I looked around frantically—perhaps the Brit would give me one last chance to bargain for my life. No such luck. It appeared he was not much of a “hands-on” boss, which was, perhaps, for the best: I wasn&#8217;t terribly fond of his hands.</p>
<p>Then we stood atop the precipice.</p>
<p>The rhinoceros turned to me and spoke in a light accent with the voice of a man who had eaten three square meals of cigarettes for thirty-plus years.</p>
<p>“Boss said to tell you he wants his money by next week, Chief.”</p>
<p>It seemed an odd message to give to a man who would shortly be distributed over a much larger area than he traditionally occupied, and so I responded with appropriate polite confusion.</p>
<p>“Buh&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Means he wants what&#8217;s his, capiche?”</p>
<p>Why a Mexican tough in the employ of a British gangster felt the need to talk like a mafioso was beyond me, but before I could inquire into the reasoning behind his word choice, I felt suddenly light and discovered that he had divested himself of my body and that I had thereby exited the plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few people experience free-fall.</p>
<p>Skydivers, certainly, but their experience is—I imagine—markedly different from my own. For instance, they have a reasonable expectation of surviving the experience.</p>
<p>Although its other virtues were few, my impromptu flight did allow me the opportunity to test something I had occasionally wondered about, namely whether or not my body would chose to void its bowels when faced with sheer, unavoidable terror. To my minor relief, I discovered that my sphincter was capable of maintaining its composure in the face of my rapid descent and imminent demise. My bladder, unfortunately, was not so obliging.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what it&#8217;s like to fall to your very messy death from an airplane, here is the Reader&#8217;s Digest version:</p>
<p>First, you are utterly terrified.</p>
<p>Then you fall for a while, and you get even more terrified. Also, it is very loud.</p>
<p>Then it hurts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/themes/benspants-v2/icons/rainbow.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="Blog" /><br/><p>I&#8217;d like to have kids some day. Since Marina has, thus far, been unwilling to allow me to plant my seed within her, I&#8217;ll probably end up settling for adopted children (Not to my future children who may find this: You are the light(s) of my life; my reason(s) for living. I have never once regretted purchasing you from a stranger.) which has become food for thought.</p>
<p>See, I&#8217;m reasonably confident in my genetic material. My parents are awesome, I am awesome, and my sister is especially awesome and arguably far more interesting than me. Any children sired by me would grow up to be atomic supermen (or -women) more or less by default. Marina&#8217;s genetic material is, by her own admission, one of the major reasons why she is not interested in producing children The Way God Intended. Why? Well&#8230;I&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.marinarosemartinez.com/?p=40">let</a> <a href="http://www.marinarosemartinez.com/?p=37">her</a> <a href="http://www.marinarosemartinez.com/?p=84">explain</a>. The point is, we won&#8217;t be making our own, when leads to my concern&#8230;</p>
<p>What if my kids suck?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean the process or act of having/raising them. I know that&#8217;ll suck from time to time, but by all accounts it&#8217;s generally pretty fulfilling. (Unless everyone is just lying because they refuse to admit they wasted 18-plus precious years of their life on some ungrateful little shithead. Which would be really, really depressing.) What I&#8217;m worried about is if they suck, like, as people.</p>
<div id="attachment_302" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/group2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-302" title="A blue guys and some faries and...a robot I guess?" src="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/group2-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What the fuck were you thinking, Mom?</p></div>
<p>For instance, I can&#8217;t count how many times my parents (well, okay, usually my mom—my dad is usually somewhat more taciturn re: affection) have told me that something I made was Wonderful, or that I did a Great Job in that play, and so on and so forth. I do not now, and I like to think I did not then, have such a high opinion of my own endeavors that I really believed they were that awesome. I was an okay actor, I imagine, but I somehow doubt that my high-school portrayal of Algernon Moncrieff was really anything to write home about—apart from what was apparently a passable British accent. My drawings were and, to a somewhat lesser extent, are, slightly better than the average bear&#8217;s, but not by much. The point here being that my parents either thought my stuff was really The Shit, or were just really good at lying to me to massage my ego.</p>
<p>If they were lying to me, okay, whatever. I can deal. We both know that shit wasn&#8217;t very good, and it&#8217;s certainly more important that a child feels like he&#8217;s got at least two people who support his self-indulgent foolishness than to have parents who are going to critique his 6-year-old scribbles for having poor balance. What concerns me<em> far more</em> is if they were, in fact, telling the truth.</p>
<p>Because when I look at stuff I wrote when I was younger, the truth is that it <em>sucks enormous balls</em>. I am not even kidding. My drawings? Pretty shitty too. So I just worry that when I have kids of my own, I&#8217;m going to say shit like this:</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 203px"><a href="http://toughpigs.com/uploaded_images/Michal-Richardson---Lefty-778268.JPG"><img class="    " title="Crayons" src="http://toughpigs.com/uploaded_images/Michal-Richardson---Lefty-778268.JPG" alt="" width="193" height="242" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An artists rendition of...something. I&#39;ll be honest: I have no idea what the fuck we&#39;re looking at here.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I appreciate the, ah, effort, Bergeron, but crayons really aren&#8217;t a very impressive medium. I mean, is this grass here? Or a bear trap? I can see how that metaphor could work, but you need to <em>commit</em> to it. And this here&#8230;Mommy, I assume? Yes. I notice the only way you differentiated her from Daddy is that Mommy has a triangle here which I assume you meant to be a rudimentary skirt, and you&#8217;ve added a pair of circles beneath her arms, which I assume are intended to be breasts and not lymph tumors or something? See, you&#8217;ve reduced mommy to nothing more than her reproductive organs—the breasts, as symbolized by the circles, and the vagina, as symbolized by the crude yonic symbol of the triangle. You&#8217;re suggesting here that the only thing that gives her value, or any sense of importance, is her ability to reproduce—not her personality, or intelligence, or accomplishments. I don&#8217;t know what sort of rubbish they&#8217;re teaching you at that school, but we do <em>not</em> glorify the patriarchy in this house, young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Antigone, it just wasn&#8217;t&#8230; I just didn&#8217;t <em>feel</em> anything from you. I know the flowers don&#8217;t actually have speaking or, uh, moving roles, but I just felt like you could have&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230; Done <em>something</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Prometheus? You realize I don&#8217;t smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the truth is that it is next to impossible to me say that something that sucks is great. Or even good. Even if I do, for whatever perceived greater good, I&#8217;m sure that anyone with a brain can telling I&#8217;m lying. So will something magical happen when I have children, and suddenly everything that erupts from their filthy paws fills me with fatherly pride and joy? I&#8217;ll be honest: It&#8217;s difficult for me to imagine being impressed, ever, with macaroni art.</p>
<p>Then again, now that I think about it I probably <em>will</em> be inexplicably amazed with everything my children do. After all, everything my cat does fills me with joy and wonder, and she&#8217;s kind of like an especially hirsute child who can&#8217;t talk. She could drop a loaf on my chest, and I would probably coo over it because it was the most adorable and perfect poop in the history of poops.</p>
<p>So I guess the solution to my problem is either<br />
a) Treat my kids like my cat.<br />
or<br />
b) Get more cats.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>Dear FileZilla,</p>
<p>You are seriously great. I like you a lot. We&#8217;ve had some great times together. I&#8217;d really like to take this to the next level, but I have to be honest. You&#8217;re&#8230;missing a few things.</p>
<p>Not much! They&#8217;re just little things, but&#8230; Would it be too much to ask that you allow me to re-arrange items in the upload/download queue? And really, I think everyone would be happier if you has a REAL upgrade mechanism, not this &#8220;download another copy and install it&#8221; crap.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still love you, I just had to get this off my chest. I hope we can still be friends.</p>
<p>-Ben</p>

Things  like the bridge from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, or the Guardian of  Forever or  a crashed Federation shuttlecraft. In Dragon Age, just now,  I came across a random encounter wherein a middle-aged man and his wife  &#8220;Marta&#8221; discover a smoking crater containing a child and a strange ore.  FUCK. YES. I love you, BioWare.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/themes/benspants-v2/icons/rainbow.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="Blog" /><img src="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/themes/benspants-v2/icons/controller.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="Games" /><br/><p>People who &#8220;keep up&#8221; with the &#8220;news&#8221; in the gaming industry may have heard rumors of a game code-named (or named?) &#8220;Epic Mickey&#8221;, referring—of course—to Disney&#8217;s ubiquitous mouse. Early leaked documents and what is commonly referred to as &#8220;scuttlebutt&#8221; pointed to a game with a sort of steampunk aesthetic, where everything was falling apart, haphazardly constructed, or both. Even to someone like myself, who gives approximately zero shits about Mikey and his anthropomorphic brethren, the idea was intriguing.</p>
<p>Recently, it was <a href="http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/10/epic_mickey_is_gonna_be_epic.php"><em>confirmed</em> </a>that this game will, indeed, be happening. It will feature the titular mouse in a staring roll, where he is pressed into service to save his threatened world. No surprises there. What I <em>did</em> find interesting, however, is that Mickey is not fighting invaders from another realm, but instead old Disney characters, long since forgotten by our younger viewers. Lead by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_the_Rabbit">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit</a>—whom I am sure none among you will not recognize as Disney&#8217;s first cartoon hero—these long-ignored creatures have banded together to take their revenge on the characters who have usurped positions which were once theirs. Apparently they release something called the &#8220;Phantom Blot&#8221;, which goes around using black ink to do&#8230;stuff(?) and &#8220;[make] all the colors of the world run together&#8221;, and the player is recruited to run around as Mickey with a paintbrush, paint thinner, eraser, etc, and make right what has gone wrong. But that&#8217;s not what interested me here.</p>
<p>When I read the first sentence of this article, where it discusses the forgotten characters that have been left to rot by a world that no longer cares for them, I thought &#8220;Ah ha! This does sound awesome! Surely, I will play as one of the estranged rebels, fighting desperately for the recognition and respect which I so richly deserve!&#8221; I&#8217;ve never been terribly attached to any Disney characters (with the possible exceptions of Mulan and Stitch), and so I found the prospect of fighting as the underdog against the representative of a massive, evil empire very, very satisfying. As you might imagine, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that this would not be the case. But there are other, more interesting this to discuss here, apart from my disappointment.</p>
<p>Stuff has a long history of putting the hero (or, in the case of games, the player) in the position of underdog. Star Wars in one of my favorite examples. For years, I had difficulty understanding that &#8220;Rebels&#8221; were not always the good guys. Pretty much every good story has the hero outnumbered, outgunned, outmaneuvered, etc. Most people (I think) enjoy playing the underdog, perhaps because we like the idea that something small—an analogue for ourselves—can triumph or something much, much larger—an analogue for the world, our jobs, making ourselves go to the gym, etc. Being the avatar of a massive multinational corporation, and wielding your significant power to crush any and all who stand against you seems somewhat less rewarding, and on some level, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be doing in Epic Mickey, or whatever the fuck they end up calling it. Sure, I&#8217;ve no doubt that Mickey will be faced with what appear to be insurmountable obstacles, superior enemy forces, etc, because you need that shit to build tension. But at the end of the day, you&#8217;re the face of one of the biggest entertainment companies on earth, putting down creatures who&#8217;s greatest crime was, apparently, thinking it was kind of fucked up that nobody knew who they were or acknowledged their contributions. It would be a little be like if the President of the United States said &#8220;Hm, I think it might be a good idea for me to just destroy anyone who doesn&#8217;t do what I say or says I&#8217;m a dick&#8221;. OH WAIT. But who knows—maybe Epic George would sell like gangbusters.</p>
<p>You may think, at this point, I&#8217;ve mined this tiny article for all it&#8217;s worth, but you&#8217;re <em>wrong</em>. I can still talk about racism.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s entirely possible that my white guilt is causing me to read too much into this, as well as my tendency to read to much into everything, but it seems a little weird to me that the premise of this game is the wholesale destruction of a minority, who&#8217;s only fault appears to be that they didn&#8217;t really like being a minority. Yes, they summon some kind of monster or something, but otherwise their summary execution would be a little bit harder to swallow.</p>
<p>Of course, I have to admit that this is really kind of reaching, and I know next to nothing about this game.  You could certainly look at this as an attempt to incite controversy or&#8230;something&#8230;but in all honestly, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m try to do. I just thought it was interesting that this game is apparently based on the idea that subjugated minorities are dangerous, and are desperate for revenge against us &#8220;normal&#8221; folks. And the idea that the villain is doing his villain thing by &#8220;making the colors of the world run together&#8221;? HMMM. Yes, well, we certainly can&#8217;t have <em>that</em> sort of thing going on, can we?</p>

<p>Much as I liked the huge face (and he is still around), it wasn&#8217;t really coming together the way I wanted, so I thought I&#8217;d trying something a little more simplistic. And simplistic this is. Hopefully the need to fill all of these columns will drive me to post more. Not that it will matter terribly, but still. It would be nice to see some content from time to time.</p>

<p>So a friend of mine recently got a nice, new tablet, and that got me thinking about my old tablet. I&#8217;ve had it for quite a while, and I&#8217;ve tooled around with it a couple times, but nothing serious. My friend was talking about a program called SAI that&#8217;s supposededly rather nice for working with tablets. I downloaded it (there&#8217;s a free trial), and I&#8217;m working on coloring <a href="http://squattingturnip.deviantart.com/art/Orbus-Caelum-Cover-Pencils-134042103">this</a>. So far I&#8217;ve only done the Deadlord, and—let&#8217;s be honest—he could have turned out better. He&#8217;s somewhat more pastel than he should be, and there&#8217;s no variation in line width on the inking, since I&#8217;m having trouble getting the pressure sensitivity to work properly. Still, I feel pretty good about him, and I&#8217;m looking forward to doing more stuff like this.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.benspants.com/wp-content/themes/benspants-v2/icons/game-reviews.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="Game Reviews" /><br/><p>So, I&#8217;m a Fallout 3 fan. I don&#8217;t really think I could say I&#8217;m a Fallout fan in general, since I never played the first game, and I never finished the second, but Fallout 3? Totally a fan. Not too long ago, I downloaded and played both of the DLC expansions, and figured I might as well write up a review of them. So here you go!</p>
<blockquote><p>Holy mother of God… A review? From Ben? Believe it or not, it’s real. This time I’ll be tackling the two recent DLC packs for one of the best games <em>ever</em>, Fallout 3—specifically the PC version—although which version shouldn’t come into play too much here. We’ll do this thing chronologically, so I’ll start with Operation: Anchorage, and don’t worry kids—I’ll be sure to give you ample warning should spoilers appear.</p>
<p><span id="more-90"></span></p>
<p><strong>Operation: Anchorage<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Concept here is pretty simple, and you probably already know it: climb into a simulator, kill some Red Chinese, get some loot when you get back to the Capitol Wasteland. Easy as pie, and truthfully, I agree with most of the other stuff that’s been said about this particular expansion (see, that’s what we called these thing back in the old days; in the dark times, before the Empire), namely that it eschews a great deal of the Role-Playing part of the Role-Playing Game in favor of shooting dudes up. Which is more or less OK by me, since Fallout 3’s combat system is, in a word (OK, two words) Fucking Awesome. Still, even if the thought of doing a minimum of that talk-y shit and a maximum of slaying gets you hot, Operation: Anchorage does run into its share of problems.</p></blockquote>
