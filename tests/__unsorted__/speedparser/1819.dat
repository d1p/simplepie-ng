			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After recording <a href="http://www.sadfellows.com" title="Sad Fellows">Sad Fellows (acoustic)</a>, I finally started to work on the Autumn Fears recordings. I&#8217;ve been playing five of the songs for a while so I quickly sketched them in my digital recorder in order to work on tempo and drums first. </p>
<p>Then I felt more embarassed with the other ones, for I didn&#8217;t play them much. So I decided to start playing them acoustic before, in order to be more familiar with their structures and figure out what I could do with them later.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m into rehearsal, focusing on 5 other songs, then I&#8217;ll have to work on the 3 last ones. And my Martin guitar cries every morning&#8230;</p>
<p>Because I tend to work on some sort of &#8220;batch mode&#8221;, I&#8217;d really love to sketch all the songs with a basic drum loop and a simple organ part before starting working on the real, more complicated parts.</p>
<p class="img-cnt"><img src="http://www.burzinskimusic.com/wp-content/uploads/autumn-fears-rehearsal-2.jpg" alt="autumn-fears-rehearsal-2" title="autumn-fears-rehearsal-2" width="400" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2456" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid all of this takes time, fortunately I keep on waking up early every morning. Around 6, yes&#8230; Sometimes I feel I&#8217;m a little bit crazy&#8230; But I can&#8217;t help it&#8230; Good news, I feel less needs to take pictures even if I keep on it. I&#8217;m eager and eager to dive into string structures, guitar lines, hypnotic drums and bassy screams&#8230; </p>
<p>Go go go !</p>

<p>I&#8217;m friend with Isabel for a couple of months now on FaceBook because of my music, and it happens she&#8217;s an amazing painter. Her work is clearly inspiring, and i&#8217;ve been of course honored when she told me my music has been a source of inspiration for her on this one :</p>
<p class="img-cnt"><img src="http://www.burzinskimusic.com/wp-content/uploads/isabel_painting.jpg" alt="isabel_painting" title="isabel_painting" width="400" height="531" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2417" /></p>
<p>This one is one of her favourite, too bad the image is small, it deserves a real big frame format.</p>
<p class="img-cnt"><img src="http://www.burzinskimusic.com/wp-content/uploads/isabel_painting-2.jpg" alt="isabel_painting-2" title="isabel_painting-2" width="400" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2427" /></p>
<p>You might also like to check more of her work through a video :</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>And you can be friend <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000527869423" title="Isabel on FaceBook">with her on facebook</a>&#8230; Enjoy !</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After moving etc., I&#8217;m also back from holidays, and spent some time thinking about what doing next.</p>
<p>First of all I started to work on the recordings of Autumn Fears, the next album, last monday. I decided to wake up at 6 every day in order to have enough time to work on it before going to my dayjob. Hope to sustain the rythm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m conscious it will take me a long time, so I also decided to set up a new website consisting of acoustic versions of songs : Previews, acoustic versions of existing ones, covers&#8230; One song published each month.</p>
<p>The website, that endless acoustic album, and the first song I recorded, are all called <a href="http://www.sadfellows.com" title="Sad Fellows">Sad Fellows</a>.</p>
<p>Guess now I&#8217;ll have to be involved a little more into music rather than into pictures, but I will constantly keeping on publishing new pics on my <a href="http://www.untimelytales.com" title="Burzinski Untimely Tales">Untimely Tales photoblog</a>. Maybe 3 pics a week whereas I published one a day&#8230; A better balance considering the lack of time I have for all of this.</p>
<p>I now can&#8217;t wait to complete all those new songs, of course, so I&#8217;m happy to be some sort of &#8220;alive&#8221; again with the acoustic versions to come each month :</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s over. I moved last thursday. To a new apartment where I&#8217;m afraid there is a lot to do. First of all I&#8217;ve got to change all the windows. I knew I had to do that, but it&#8217;s mandatory because the place is quite noisy&#8230; Street noise&#8230; Can&#8217;t record there properly in that situation&#8230; Unless you want to listen to far trains, drunk people and cars&#8230;</p>
<p>So busy with a lot to do, no music I&#8217;m afraid&#8230; even not enough pictures to sustain a daily publication on <a href="http://www.untimelytales.com" title="Untimely Tales pictures">Untimely Tales</a>. Don&#8217;t even have an internet access at home yet&#8230;</p>
<p>Fortunately it&#8217;s summer, even if the weather is not that good here in Paris. So I won&#8217;t publish anything new until september, probably. Just hope you have great holidays in great places right now and don&#8217;t care much about what&#8217;s happening on the web !</p>
<p>Well, I can&#8217;t help thinking of something new all the time&#8230; Something might come <a href="http://www.sadfellows.com/" title="">around here</a>, one day&#8230;</p>
<p>Cheers <img src='http://www.burzinskimusic.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
