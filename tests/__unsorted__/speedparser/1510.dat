Techniques for directing film.  More than the script, bigger than the screen - the tangible and mystical characteristics of truly great filmmaking.</description><title>Beyond the Frame</title><generator>Tumblr (3.0; @directingfilm)</generator><link>http://directingfilm.net/</link><item><title>A letter from Francis Ford Coppola to Marlon Brando, imploring...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lscdltQjGK1qii8rzo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter from&lt;strong&gt; Francis Ford Coppola&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Marlon Brando&lt;/strong&gt;, imploring him to reprise his role as Vito Corleone in &lt;em&gt;The Godfather II&lt;/em&gt;.  Brando eventually acquiesced and then left again - leaving the opening for &lt;strong&gt;Robert De Niro&lt;/strong&gt; to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all trivia.  The interesting part to me is this excerpt from the letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I’m saying is that if you will be in this movie; I will do my very best to make it be good; and human, and express the notion that the Mafia is only a metaphor for America and capitalism, which will do anything to protect and perpetuate itself. (I will do this anyway, if you’re not in the film…but if you were in it, it would be better, and you would help me with your ideas as I work on the script.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As protesters march on Wall Street largely ignored by the majority of America, and parties bicker about tax rates while the United States engages unfinanced battles overseas, it seems that Coppola had an important point to make.  However, this point, like any discussion on the merits of capitalism, is lost largely in jargon and posturing. Coppola ended up being guilty of the same problem; he obscured the essential point of the Godfather series in favor of some boyhood fantasy of Italian machismo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which people (not necessarily filmmakers) have influenced your way of filmmaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m also asked this by readers, I thought I’d post it here&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My films are influenced on many different levels by a wide range of people. The list below is organized by each person’s primary sphere of influence:  as a filmmaker (craft), as a spiritual person (spirit), and as a citizen of the world (society).  In considering this list, brevity was not the goal, but spontaneity - the names that came to me first are the names that made the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft&lt;/strong&gt;: Akira Kurosawa, Darren Aronofsky, Milan Kundera, Arthur C. Clarke, Sam Delany, Blixa Bargeld, F.M. Einheit, Brian Eno, Astor Piazzolla, Paul Rand, Jeff Minter, Wassily Kandinsky, Egon Schiele, William De Kooning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;: Andrei Tarkovksy, Dag Hammarskjold, Anaïs Nin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Arvo Pärt, John Downland, JS Bach, Mosche Feldenkrais, Bahá’u’lláh, Buddha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Society&lt;/strong&gt;: Charlie Chaplin, Dr. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, Betty Friedan, Steve Jobs, Dani Bunten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother, my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 70% are of European decent and male.  Not that there is anything necessarily wrong with that.  But it’s good to know.  They are also primarily people that have lived in the last one hundred years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me feel like reading something written by an insightful woman that lived five hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Transmedia storytelling is an increasingly relevant technique...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llsvqzivqo1qfg4oyo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmedia storytelling is an increasingly relevant technique to filmmakers.  The issue becomes the depth of audience engagement - that is how much time and effort should a storyteller expect out of their audience outside of passively watching their video?  Andrea Phillips has an interesting perspective that she shares in an interview with &lt;a href="http://latd.com/clients-us/"&gt;Latitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itizen.com/"&gt;Itizen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a big advocate of what I call the “illusion of interactivity.” It’s possible—it’s not even that difficult to write something so that, no matter what the audience does or says, the outcome is eventually the same. If you do it too shallowly and too obviously, then they’re onto you, and it sort of spoils the magic trick. But if you do it really well, and you have a kind of flowchart where the “yes” and the “no” have one step that’s different but they both lead back to the same thing, then production costs really aren’t that high because you can still count on a few basic milestones no matter what direction the story takes in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, simple rules, complex results.  A mantra of the late, great &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/feature/2003/03/18/bunten"&gt;Dani Bunten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ü&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and speaking of games with narratives - narratives that cross millennia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Lewis chessmen&lt;/strong&gt; are a group of chess pieces discovered on the Isle of Lewis in 1831. They were carved from walrus ivory and whale teeth in the &lt;strong&gt;12th Century in Norway&lt;/strong&gt;. There are 78 pieces: 8 kings, 8 queens, 16 bishops, 15 knights, 12 rooks, and 19 pawns, from as many as 5 different sets. The pieces were probably part of the stock of a trader dealing in luxury goods. Some of the pieces bear traces of red pigment, indicating that the two sides were white and red, unlike the modern white and black. Unlike modern chess sets, the rooks are portrayed as soldiers, including four berserks, chewing their shields, while the pawns are small geometric pieces, resembling standing stones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading a book called &lt;em&gt;Directing the Film: Film Directors on Their Art&lt;/em&gt;, which features anecdotes from over forty directors from Alfred Hitchcock to John Huston, George Cukor to Roger Corman, and William Friedkin to Steven Spielberg. It’s a wealth of information wherein each section of the book is broken down into the stages of filmmaking, and each director tells a story of their approach to each department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s largely great advice, and I see a lot of the things that I did on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mB9WCQ5B10&amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lilith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of the things I didn’t. And herein lies the conundrum with filmmaking advice and instruction, which is that there’s no one right way to do things. In one instance you have Alfred Hitchcock saying that he storyboards everything and that the film is made in pre-production, and in the very same chapter a few pages later, you have John Cassavettes saying improvisation during filming is where the film is born. One page after another, the directors in this book contradict one another in the best way to go about making a picture. In fact the only constant advice is that the camera should be turned on when filming. Amazingly, even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; tenet can be contradicted, as avant-garde filmmakers like Ken Jacobs and my mentor Stan Brakhage have made films without the benefit of a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 13% of the films mentioned by readers were shot before 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lynch and Mallick were listed twice.  Even Tarkovksy once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was surprised by the directors who were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mentioned.  The New Hollywood brats - Spielberg, Scorsese, De Palma, Lucas and Coppola (pictured above) - were not listed once.  Of course, most of their best work happened before 1990.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few specific responses I enjoyed:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jodema.tumblr.com/"&gt;jodema&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Hours&lt;/em&gt;. I was young and impressionable. Luckily, it impressed upon me the importance of empathy.&lt;/li&gt;

The last act makes a film. Wow them in the end, and you got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you’ve got a hit. Find an ending, but don’t cheat, and don’t you dare bring in a deus ex machina. Your characters must change, and the change must come from them. Do that, and you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Deus Ex Machina: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a &lt;a title="Plot device" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device"&gt;plot device&lt;/a&gt; whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object.

&lt;p&gt;I know I say this all the time, but nostalgia is one of the pillars upon which cinema is built. 90% of the films I’ve seen this year look to the past as a site of not only interesting stories and characters to be plundered, but also as some sort of mythical fantasy to restore our belief in a golden age of life and art, something we can restore perhaps though necromancy, bringing back the dead - not making but remaking, not creating but quoting. It was the case with one of my favourite films this year, the brilliant documentary &lt;em&gt;Senna&lt;/em&gt;, and also one of my biggest disappointments, &lt;em&gt;Super 8&lt;/em&gt;. I wallow in nostalgia for the past as much as any real cinéphile, but I am also growing increasingly suspicious and wary of the trickster mechanisms of retro-style filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ü&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In and out of history, like the Tartari invasion portrayed in Tarkovksy’s film &lt;em&gt;Andrei Reublev&lt;/em&gt;, waves of barbarians have come riding across the tundra to rape and destroy the tender fruits of culture, defiling the holy places and trampling crops into the ground.  Finally, pressed ever closer together on our tiny planet, we are coming to the realization that the barbarians are within, that ‘them’ is in fact ‘us’.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently discovered my passion for scriptwriting and i realised i wanted to be a screen writer, but an advisor told me it involves alot of networking, which i suck at since i deactivated my facebook account 2 hours after creating it. I love being creative but i can't get over the fear of failure.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Allow me to reframe your question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filmmaking is a collaborative effort.  There are some who wield more control than others - like Charlie Chaplin - but for most of us, we depend on other people to make films happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you put yourself in a position to find others who share your values?  Those people are certainly not so painful to network with because they are more likely your friends.  They make your work more enjoyable, not less.  And really good friends are going to push you to be a better screenwriter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So think about making lasting friendships with collaborators you respect.  Hopefully one of them will be extroverted and really enjoy the act of networking.  Someone has to champion your work.  If it’s not you, it has to be someone else.  Otherwise, no one will ever know about it.  That may not be such a bad thing to you but it certainly doesn’t go far in paying the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ü&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps - Regarding your fear keep this in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

Here is my response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Films are great teachers. In making and sharing my films, I am always a student. Endless creative possibilities teach restraint. They require intimate knowledge of a subject. And a completed film is a test of what works and what does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films are the gateway to the future of audience engagement. The creative medium of the 21st century is going to build on the lessons learned from 20th century cinema. Movies are young and still evolving, endlessly corruptible and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films are the evidence of a few fundamental truths. The ancient principles of storytelling, aesthetics and mystery reveal an essential binding language shared by all. Great films are moments of unity that can transcend culture. At the same time, cinema is also a propagator of diverse lifestyles and values. Films provide tangible insight and inspire empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love film because it is all these things. And all these things are important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you interested in filmmaking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for all the focus on locations, the film’s dominant mode is motion; cars, ultimately, are its spiritual center. “It’s one of those things you do and then you don’t remember doing it,” Gosling said of driving. “We wanted to capture that feeling that always seems to slip away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gosling and Refn first met to discuss how to bring Sallis’ novel to the screen, things came into focus when the actor was driving the director back to his hotel. REO Speedwagon’s “Can’t Fight This Feeling” came on the radio and the two began belting out verses. They decided to depart significantly from the book, which has few actual driving sequences in it, instead creating a music-oriented movie about a man who drives around Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Refn notes, he doesn’t drive himself and doesn’t even have a license. But true to his persona, there’s a rich and geeky explanation for that. “I’ll never get a license,” he said. “Like [J.G.] Ballard in ‘Crash,’ I find driving so sexual and exciting, and I’m very much aroused by speed. So I will never control a machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosling, looking increasingly disturbed as Refn offers this thought, is asked if he likes when his collaborator gets esoteric. “Not,” he said, “after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to make an analogy of where it currently stands, transmedia is very much at the phase where, in the silent era, they would shoot stage plays. And we are at the moment where someone realised, ‘Oh wait, we don’t have to point the camera at the stage any more, we can take the camera outside’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously other Tumblr users offer great quotes but, believe it or not, books are still the primary resource.  I’ll type something in that I find particularly astute.  &lt;/p&gt;
