<blockquote>
 <p><em>(T)he rules of SEO aren’t magic or arbitrary. They’re based on the goals of a search engine, which is to</em> find relevant results<em>.

All of the rules have come about due to their utility in detecting those three positive metrics. Good SEO is a by-product of not being a dick on the internet.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>
<em>(W)hen you’re feeling unsure about what you’re doing, you don’t need more questions, but rather, answers and solutions.

<p>This is a good reminder, and something I needed to hear this week when there&#8217;s been a fair bit of self-doubt floating around in my brain. But I know it happens to everyone at some point or another. Even the most talented and successful people that I look up to and draw inspiration from face their own inner critics from time to time. The key is to recognize it and get it under control, and then carry on doing great things.</p>
<p>Denise <a href="http://vimeo.com/25736918">touched on this in her talk</a> at the <a href="http://interlinkconference.com/">InterLink Conference</a> back in June. The video of that talk is below, and <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27985/DeniseJacobsSlides.pdf" target="_blank">the accompanying slides can be downloaded from Dropbox</a>.</p>

<p>Be inspired, and go create something awesome. Critics (inner and outer) be damned.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few people have asked me if it&#8217;s possible to prevent someone from viewing their connections on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, and if so, how to do it. The answer is yes, it is possible, and in this post I&#8217;ll show you how.</p>
<p>For the savvy user this is basic stuff. But for those who are new to LinkedIn, or haven&#8217;t taken much time to explore their profile settings, then hopefully this post will be useful.</p>
<p>By default, LinkedIn only lets the people you have already accepted as connections view the rest of your contact list. So if the person you want to hide your list from is not already a connection then you have nothing to worry about. But if they are a connection, you have two choices: you can either delete the person from your connections, or adjust your privacy settings so that, with the exception of shared connections, your contacts are hidden from everyone on your list.</p>
<p>As of this writing, these are the only options that I&#8217;m aware of for hiding your contact list. LinkedIn does not currently offer a way to pick and choose different privacy settings for different connections the way that, say, <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131">Facebook does</a>. Bascially it&#8217;s all or nothing. So, here are your options:</p>
<h3>Option 1: Delete the contact:</h3>
<p>Log in to your profile and select <strong>Contacts &gt; My Connections</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/contacts.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - My Connections Link" title="LinkedIn - My Connections Link" width="350" height="201" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1452" /></p>
<p>Click &quot;Remove Connections&quot; from the top right hand corner.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/remove-link.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - Remove Connections Link" title="LinkedIn - Remove Connections Link" width="350" height="140" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1451" /></p>
<p>Check the box next to the person (or people) you wish to remove, then click the &quot;Remove Connections&quot; button to the right of the list.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/remove-contacts.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - Connections List" title="LinkedIn - Connections List" width="500" height="235" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1453" /></p>
<p>Next you will be prompted to confirm that you want to remove them. Click &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it &ndash; the person is no longer a connection, and they will not be able to see any of your connections.</p>
<h3>Option 2: Adjust your privacy settings</h3>
<p>Log in and select <strong>Your name &gt; Settings</strong> from the top right hand corner.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/settings.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - Settings Link" title="LinkedIn - Settings Link" width="350" height="164" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1448" /></p>
<p>Under the &quot;Privacy Controls&quot; column, click &quot;Select who can see your connections&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/privacy-controls.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - Privacy Controls" title="LinkedIn - Privacy Controls" width="350" height="198" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1450" /></p>
<p>In the pop up box, select &quot;Only you&quot; from the drop-down menu, then click &quot;Save changes&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/connections.jpg" alt="LinkedIn - Hide Connections" title="LinkedIn - Hide Connections" width="500" height="194" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1449" /></p>
<p>And you&#8217;re done &ndash; now your connections will only be able to see others on your list that you share in common. (Remember: this setting affects <em>all</em> of your connections, not just the person you want to prevent from seeing your list).</p>
<p>Now you might ask why someone would want to do this. After all, social networks are supposed to be all about openness, and you only accept trusted contacts on LinkedIn, right? That may be the case, but whether or not this is a &quot;right&quot; thing to do is a discussion for another day.</p>
<p>Personally, I have no reason to hide my own connections from anyone, but someone else may have perfectly legitimate reasons for doing so on their profiles. If you&#8217;re one of those people, I hope this post has helped!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a long weekend here in most parts of Canada, which usually means there&#8217;s a lot of barbequing going on. Last year I posted a great recipe for <a href="its-barbeque-season-lets-make-hamburgers">bbq beef burgers</a>, which still draws quite a few readers to my blog. This summer I thought I would share a vegetarian alternative, which is just as tasty, and as simple to make too.</p>
<p>These instructions will get you about 4 burgers, and should take approximately half an hour to make.</p>
<h3>Here are the ingredients:</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-726 aligncenter" title="Black Bean Veggie Burgers Ingredients" src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/black-bean-veggie-burgers-ingredients.jpg" alt="Black Bean Veggie Burgers Ingredients" width="400" height="250" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1 16oz can of black beans</li>
<li>1/2 green pepper</li>
<li>1/2 onion</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tbsn chili powder</li>
<li>1 tbsn cumin</li>
<li>1 tsp hot sauce</li>
<li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here&#8217;s how to make them:</h3>
<p>Fire up the barbeque and let it get nice and hot while you prepare the burgers.</p>
<p>Drain the black beans and pour them into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mash them together with a fork. They should form a thick paste.</p>
<p>Chop the green pepper, onion and garlic into fine pieces. Mix them in with the beans.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, stir together the egg, chili powder, cumim and hot sauce, and stir into the bean mixture.</p>
<p>Stir the breadcrumbs into the bean mix until it all holds together. Use more breadcrumbs if necessary until you reach a desired consistency.</p>
<p>Divide the mixture into balls with your hands, and then flatten them into patties. You should get four large patties out of it.</p>
<p>Place the patties on the bargeque and grill them for about 8 minutes on each side. Add cheese slices if you like about a minute or so before they&#8217;re done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729" title="Black Bean Veggie Burgers Served" src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/black-bean-veggie-burgers-served.jpg" alt="Black Bean Veggie Burgers Served" width="400" height="250" /></p>
<p>Serve with your favourite condiments and enjoy! As a side dish idea, try out this <a href="would-you-like-yam-fries-with-that">yam fries recipe</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a>, making <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity">the case for owning your online identity</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(P)roprietary networks that want to own and hold in your content are reversing much of the web&#8217;s progress in some&hellip; areas, such as the durability and quality of online identity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good point. I&#8217;m reminded of a <a href="http://www.slaw.ca/2008/02/10/closed-networks-the-problem-with-facebook/comment-page-1/">similar argument made by Steve Matthews</a> back in 2008 (he was talking about Facebook&#8217;s usefulness for web marketing, but whether your identity is personal or business the point is basically the same).</p>
<p>I enjoy and get a fair amount of value from social networks like Facebook, and will continue to do so. But it&#8217;s important to understand that these are businesses, and as much as it might seem like they will be around forever, they won&#8217;t. This is one reason I generally feed my content (at least the content I care about) to my Facebook account, rather than hosting it there exclusively. Besides the fact that Facebook gets &quot;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php">non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post</a>&quot; (which, by the way, I don&#8217;t think is as scary as it sounds), ultimately I want control over my own stuff.</p>
<p>Marco <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity">continues</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you care about your online presence, you must own it. I do, and that’s why my email address has always been at my own domain, not the domain of any employer or webmail service.</em></p>
<p><em>You might think your @gmail.com address will be fine indefinitely, but if I used a webmail address from the best webmail provider at the time I broke away from my university address and formed my own identity, it would have ended in @hotmail.com. And that wasn&#8217;t very long ago.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced. I&#8217;ve been debating for sometime whether it&#8217;s better to use my GMail account (which I&#8217;ve had since 2004) or to switch to one of my own domains. It&#8217;s time to switch.</p>

Grace is a free theme that&#8217;s just as powerful as some of the premium themes we looked at. It has an elegant, minimalist design, and was really simple to customize.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://photosbyjen.ca"><img class="size-full wp-image-1414 aligncenter" title="Photos by Jen - Homepage" src="http://handcoded.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pbj-homepage.jpg" alt="Photos by Jen - Homepage" width="450" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Out-of-the-box, Grace includes some slick functionality, including a rotating banner for displaying feature photos on the homepage, and auto-generated thumbnails for the galleries.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://photosbyjen.ca"><img class="size-full wp-image-1424 aligncenter" title="Photos by Jen - rotating banner &amp; thumbnails" src="http://handcoded.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pbj-banner-and-gallery.jpg" alt="Photos by Jen - rotating banner &amp; thumbnails" width="450" height="152" /></a></p>
<p>By default, the theme&#8217;s navigation focuses only on the categories used in the gallery. But we also wanted a navigation for the site&#8217;s pages. So I created a separate navigation menu above the main content area, managed with a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen">custom menu</a> that I built into the theme&#8217;s backend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://photosbyjen.ca"><img class="size-full wp-image-1426 aligncenter" title="Photos by Jen - Main navigation" src="http://handcoded.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pbj-mainnav.jpg" alt="Photos by Jen - Main navigation" width="450" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>The category navigation, which by default was a simple list of text links, was then modified with some CSS styling to make the clickable area larger, and to improve the menu&#8217;s overall look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://photosbyjen.ca"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1428 aligncenter" title="Photos by Jen - Gallery navigation" src="http://handcoded.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pbj-gallerynav-393x257.jpg" alt="Photos by Jen - Gallery navigation" width="393" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>And last but not least I created a couple of custom page templates for the About and Contact Pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://photosbyjen.ca" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-1431 aligncenter" title="Photos by Jen - About page" src="http://handcoded.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pbj-aboutpage.jpg" alt="Photos by Jen - About page" width="450" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>Jen has added a couple dozen photos to the gallery to kick things off, and will continue to add more in the days and weeks to come. I hope you&#8217;ll take a look and enjoy some of her photos.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is my wife Jennifer&#8217;s first Mother&#8217;s Day. To start the day off right I made her apple pancakes for breakfast. I thought I would share the recipe here.</p>
<h4>These are the ingredients</h4>
<p><img src="http://robgolbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pancakes-ingredients.jpg" alt="Ingredients for Pancakes" title="Ingredients for Pancakes" width="250" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of sea salt</li>
<li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of sugar (or equivalent sugar substitute &ndash; I used Splenda)</li>
<li>1 3/4 cups skim milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter or margarine, melted</li>
<li>1 or 2 apples, sliced</li>
</ul>
<h4>This is how to make it</h4>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and sugar. Stir in the milk and melted butter, then stir the whole thing into the flour mix.</p>
<p>In another bowl, beat together the egg whites and gently fold into the flour mixture.</p>
<p>Mix in the sliced apples and stir the combined ingredients until smooth.</p>
<p>Coat a griddle or frying pan with non-stick spray and heat over medium. Spoon desired amounts of batter onto the griddle to form each pancake and cook until the tops begin to bubble, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until the edges begin to brown, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>This recipe should make about 9 medium sized pancakes, or 18 small ones. Serve with your desired side dishes &ndash; we had ours with eggs and sliced strawberries.</p>

<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the neighbourhood I grew up in there was a small drug store not far from my house. My mom and I used to stop there sometimes while we were out on our walks. I was five.</p>
<p>The drug store was located on a riverfront street along with a row of other businesses, including the pawn shop where I bought my first cassette tape (<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/1984-Van-Halen/dp/B00004Y6O3">Van Halen&#8217;s &#8220;1984&#8243;</a>), and a bank that later became a tattoo parlour run by the Hell&#8217;s Angels. Like most drug stores, this one probably sold more toys and household items than pharmaceuticals. The toys are what made going there enjoyable to me.</p>
<p>One toy in particular sticks out in my memory. It was a blue plastic gun with big yellow cylinder-shaped bullets that made a loud POP when fired from the gun&#8217;s over-sized barrel. I wanted one badly. So badly that I asked for it every time we went to that drug store. But my mom said no. She quite reasonably didn&#8217;t want her five year old to have weapons as toys.</p>
<p>At least not then. Within a few years I had a BB gun and who knows how many cap guns, not to mention my massive collection of G.I. Joes.</p>
<p>But when I was five I could only dream about having the gun I so wanted from that drug store. Quite literally, in fact, because I remember clearly a dream I had in which my little town was overrun by an army of giant gorillas. They were big and scary, and everyone was terrified. Everyone but me. Because in that dream I had one of those guns, and I used it to fend off the hairy beasts and drive them far away from our town. People cheered. I was a hero.</p>
<p>When I woke up I told my mom about the dream, probably thinking that it would convince her to buy me the gun. But she still wouldn&#8217;t let me have one.</p>
<p>Life is so unfair when you&#8217;re five.</p>
