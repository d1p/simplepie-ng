This was a selection of songs I was going to play at a gallery opening this past weekend, but my laptop broke so I threw something together now instead. &lt;br /&gt;As usual I&amp;#39;m not really a DJ so it&amp;#39;s not beat-matched or anything; just good songs.

Almost 2 hours of Italo Disco, although there are a couple of tunes I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily classify as Italo on here as well. This was a mix I promised after I ran Italo Week over at my vinyl blog (&lt;a href="http://owlsdustyvinyl.tumblr.com/tagged/italo_week?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;http://owlsdustyvinyl.tumblr.com/tagged/italo_week&lt;/a&gt;), so after a slight delay here it is. The tunes are a selection of vinyls I found in an 80s DJ collection I bough a while back (there are probably more as I still havenâ€™t gone through all of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make no claims of being a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; DJ or anything, I just have lots of music, but I do try my best not to fup the mixes :). So you know, if there are a couple of rough transitions, that&amp;#39;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had to code this down quite a bit to fit the size requirement here, but you can grab a better copy over at my tumblr (via the link above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a listen to the whole thing today and it seems it dropped a couple of tunes towards the end, no idea why. As I can&amp;#39;t replace the audio here, I&amp;#39;ve replaced the download (from the site above).
