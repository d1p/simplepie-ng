			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Domino Project has released a new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719282/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mwshead-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936719282">End Malaria</a>. The book is available for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CKBF4I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mwshead-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CKBF4I">Kindle</a> and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719282/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mwshead-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936719282">paperback</a>. It is a great idea! They got a bunch of authors together and put together a book where $20 from every sale goes to help end malaria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719282/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=mwshead-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1936719282"><img class="size-full wp-image-8867 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2011-09-16 at 9.12.08 AM" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-16-at-9.12.08-AM.png" alt="" width="480" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>The contents are short essays by many famous business authors. There are three sections: Focus, Courage, Resilience. The contents of the book are great. They are all short and you can pick it up and randomly read any page to get something out of it.</p>
<p>What most impressed me though was just the idea for the project. It is a great example of how creative thinking and a little organization (ok maybe a LOT of organization) can bring people together to make the world a better place. The proceeds (at least $20 from each book) wil go to <a href="http://www.malarianomore.org/">Malaria No More</a> which has a mission to eliminate death from malaria in Africa by 2015. It is a big goal, but with projects like this to fund it, they just might do it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p> A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Donkey and a Mule, both well laden.  The Donkey, as long as he traveled along the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear.  He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request.  The Donkey shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden.  Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Donkey in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the Donkey, after he had skinned him.  The Mule, groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself:  &#8221;I am treated according to my deserts.  If I had only been willing to assist the Donkey a little in his need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as well.&#8221; ~Aesop</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you ever had a small problem that you didn&#8217;t feel like dealing with? Something that was easy enough to ignore where there didn&#8217;t seem to be any harm in just putting it off? Enough about donkeys and mules. Let me tell you how I ruined two perfectly good garden hoses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8833" title="hose" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hose-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Last week we <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/chief-lying-officer/8828/">went to Florida</a>. (You know there is something wrong when you head to Florida to beat the heat in Kansas.) Anyway right before we left we got a lot of rain so when we came back the yard was well past the point where it needed to be mowed. We have about 2.5 acres and even with a 54 inch riding mower, it takes a while. I didn&#8217;t get started until late and was racing the encroaching darkness. I had a few hoses set up to water some trees and an area of the yard on a timer. I didn&#8217;t want to take the time to wrap them all up so I decided to just mow over them. Even with the blade on the highest setting I managed to nick the 100 footer that ran to the trees. It was small enough that I thought I could probably repair it, but I didn&#8217;t learn my lesson and 5 minutes later managed to completely mangle a shorter hose cutting it into a bunch of foot long pieces and getting it wrapped tightly around the left blade of the lawn mower.</p>
<p>By the time I got the hose off the blade, picked up my mess, threw the trashed hose away, and then patched the nicked hose I spent way more time than it would have taken to simply move the hoses and that doesn&#8217;t even include the time  I&#8217;m going to have to spend to go get a replacement for the hose I destroyed.</p>
<p>Shortcuts are often the longest way of doing something. I&#8217;d write more, but I need to go to the store to get another hose.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader named Susan left an <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/never-hire-an-mba/7918/comment-page-2/#comment-241441">interesting comment</a> on <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/never-hire-an-mba/7918">Never Hire an <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/on-the-job-mba/6626/" class="kblinker" title="More about mba &raquo;">MBA</a></a>. She doesn&#8217;t like the article, but what I found interesting was this part of her comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you familiar with discrimination laws, well although there is not currently a discrimination law that would protect individuals from potential employers from discriminating against individuals who are unemployed, I am proud to say that I am one of thousands who have signed a petition against little minded people who discriminate against the unemployed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard of this before, but after a little research I found that some employers are including requirements in their job postings that basically say, &#8220;we only consider job candidates who are currently employed.&#8221;  Some people are upset about this because they feel it discriminates against people who don&#8217;t have a job. Which it obviously does.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2144" title="jobs-main" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/jobs-main.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="250" /></p>
<h3>Why would you do this?</h3>
<p>So why would a company do this? Well if you were wanting to hire someone and knew that you&#8217;d get hundreds of applications, wouldn&#8217;t you want to restrict those applications to the pool of people who would statistically be best for the job? Lets say you have 1,000 workers who all have identical skill sets.  Half of them have a job and half were fired 9 months ago.  If you randomly choose someone from the first group and randomly choose someone from the second group who do you think has a better chance of being a good hire?  Lets say you repeat the experiment 100 times. Do you think you&#8217;d get a higher percentage of good hires from the employed group or the unemployed group?</p>
<p>Now regardless of what <strong>you</strong> think will happen, some HR departments think their chances would be a bit better with the employed group.   If you have 1,000 employees, an excellent employee appraisal system and suddenly needed to let half of them go, would the people you lay off be random?  Probably not. You&#8217;d try to let people go who are least tied to your ability to make profit.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that they are all bad workers. If Sue&#8217;s expertise is in project X and you are about to cancel X, you&#8217;d probably let her go before you let Bob go who works on Z where Z is your main money maker.  But you&#8217;d also let go people who aren&#8217;t as productive, who show up late, who are harder to work with, etc. Another reason employers might do this is because they realize that job skills can get out of date very quickly. Since a lot of people have been out of work for a long time, they may feel more comfortable concentrating on people who are currently employed.</p>
<p>So HR departments figure they would rather hire the workers that other employers can&#8217;t do with out&#8211;not because they think everyone in the unemployed pool is a bad worker, but just because they think that their chances of randomly getting a good worker from the employed pool are better. Is it fair to a particular individual? No. Is it completely irrational? Not as irrational as other decisions HR makes. Besides HR may be admitting that they have very little ability to do their jobs and find good job candidates. If they are going to select a job candidate at random, they better try to do it in a way that increases their odds.</p>
<h3>What can you do about this?</h3>
<p>If you are unemployed, what can you do about this?  Well you can do try to find some petition to sign, but there are more productive options.  Here is what I would do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take any job</strong> &#8211; Find a job where you will learn something and take it as a learning experience. I&#8217;ve always wanted to work for McDonalds for a few weeks just to see how their systems are organized. It wouldn&#8217;t make any financial sense from a salary perspective, but from a learning perspective I think it would be fascinating. You could get a job selling cars or doing some form of direct customer service. The idea is to build your skills by doing something.  Now the problem with this approach is that unemployment seems to help people more if they wait for a high paying job.  It basically introduces an artificial element into the employment process that keep people from going out and getting any job just to stay working, but that is an issue best addressed in a different post.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer</strong> &#8211; The next option would be to volunteer somewhere. Keep yourself on a schedule where you have to get up in the morning and go somewhere to do some type of work. If you are on unemployment, society is basically paying you a salary so do your best to contribute back while keeping yourself busy doing something. At the very least, volunteering will help make sure you are out <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/9-tips-for-efficient-meetings/6620/" class="kblinker" title="More about meeting &raquo;">meeting</a> people and the best way to get a job is always going to be through someone you know.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute Online</strong> &#8211; This is similar to volunteering, but getting involved in online community projects can be another great option.  If you code, you can program for an open source project. You can help open source projects with their documentation, test for bugs, write up meeting notes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong> &#8211; Read the top 10 books in your field that you haven&#8217;t had a chance to read. Take an online class or work toward a <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/online-degree-programs/8423/">certificate or citation</a> program or get started on some type of <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/harvard-masters-degree/6463/">masters degree</a> in your field. Look for things that are quantifiable that you can put on your resume.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> &#8211; Write about stuff in your field. You can review the top books about the area where you want to get a job. You can do interviews with people in your field and post them on your blog.</li>
</ol>
<div>The point is, don&#8217;t be lazy. There are hundreds of things you could be doing to take advantage of the time you have when you get laid off&#8211;things that will significantly improve your chances in the job market.</div>
<div>Maybe the policy of not interviewing people who don&#8217;t currently have a job is a reaction to dealing with hundreds of applicants who have been unemployed for the last 6 months and have simply been sitting at home watching television. I best there wouldn&#8217;t be anyone making policies like that if everyone followed those five steps mentioned above.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife, two kids and I had a trip planned to Florida to spend a week with her family on the beach. Originally we were going to drive, but at the last minute decided that was a bad idea and bought plane tickets on Delta. My parents graciously drove us to the airport in Kansas City. We checked our luggage and paid the $50 to take the pack and play and our suitcase. The fee was expected, but it still amazes me how much airlines can get by with. Oh well, at least Delta doesn&#8217;t charge for using the restrooms like some airlines are trying. We went through security, found we had drastically over-estimated how long that would take, and settled in to wait for a few hours watching the planes with our kids.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6957" title="airline-main" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/airline-main.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="250" /></p>
<p>The gate next to ours was supposed to be heading to Chattanooga and every 15 minutes they would announce that the plane was still being repaired and that the flight had been delayed yet again. When we boarded our flight, the plane to Chattanooga still hadn&#8217;t pulled up to their gate. We got our luggage stowed and the kids settled in. Katy our 4 year old had the window seat and Benjamin our 22 month old was sitting on my wife&#8217;s lap in the middle seat. Even after spending two hours watching the planes from the airport, they were still fascinated with the ground crew as they prepped the other planes.</p>
<p>This would be the first leg of our flight which would put us in Memphis. An hour later our second plane would take us to Panama City Beach.  Traveling with kids sure is a lot more work. We had carefully planned what time we put them to bed the night before in order to make sure the youngest would be tired enough to take a nap on the drive up to Kansas City so he&#8217;d still be relatively happy when we made it to Florida and took a taxi to the condo around 9pm&#8211;about 2.5 hours after he normally goes to sleep. So far everything was going according to plan.</p>
<p>Everyone was seated and the crew was getting ready to close the door when there seemed to be a bit of confusion.The stewardess went to talk to the pilot and after a few minutes the pilot came on the PA system.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dispatch just called me and said that this plane isn&#8217;t going to Memphis. I tried to get them to let us take it, but we are going to have to get off.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That seemed a little odd. It also seemed like we weren&#8217;t getting the whole truth. But with all the airline security issues, I figured it was best to just get off quickly and orderly and then just get on whatever plane we were supposed to be on.  As we got off the plane, they changed the sign to say Chattanooga and loaded up all the passengers who had been waiting for the broken plane. &#8220;Good for them,&#8221; I thought. Although I did wonder how they could have been delayed for hours when their correct plane was sitting right there and no one noticed. Since we had an hour layover, I figured a 15 to 20 minute delay to board our plane wouldn&#8217;t make too much of a difference.</p>
<p>I asked a stewardess what had happened, and was told that we had been boarded on the &#8220;wrong plane&#8221;. This seemed pretty odd because it would have required a huge number of errors from a very large number of people. They would have had to pull the plane to the wrong gate in the first place. The pilots would have needed to overlook the fact that it wasn&#8217;t the plane they were supposed to fly. The technicians would have had to  overlook that it wasn&#8217;t the right plane. The plane would have had to be the exact same type or the seat numbers wouldn&#8217;t have matched up, etc. The chances that an airline could make that many mistakes without having serious safety issues elsewhere is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>The more I thought about her explanation the more nervous about the safety of flying Delta at all. We were supposed to get on the &#8220;right plane&#8221; in a few minutes with an airline that had just told me they couldn&#8217;t keep track of which plane went where.  What if someone got confused again and only put half the amount of fuel on the plane thinking it was headed somewhere else. What if they accidentally got the water truck and the fuel truck confused and the bathroom sink was now dispensing jet fuel?   What if they took off and then realized that the &#8220;pilot&#8221; was actually a bagage attendant who and momentarily forgotten his job and thought he was the pilot?</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if I felt very safe putting my family on this next plane that they were getting ready to direct us to.  That should happen any minute right? Well no. Somehow our plane was now broken and the mechanics didn&#8217;t know if or when they could fix it, but instead of leaving at 3:45, the soonest we&#8217;d be leaving was 7 and that was looking unlikely. The new time strangely matched the time the people waiting on the broken plane for Chattanooga had been last told. Then I realized what had happened. Some computer had shown the airline that it was going was cheaper to bump and re-route everyone on our flight than to try to re-route the people on the Chattanooga flight. That way the airline wouldn&#8217;t have to put all of them up in a hotel. That made me feel a bit better about the safety of the airline, but not so good about our chances of making it to Florida on time.</p>
<p>Evidently the computer had said that our flight was one where they could put the fewest people in a hotel because almost everyone could reach their destination through other flights that afternoon. There was one destination that they couldn&#8217;t reach&#8211;Panama City Beach where we were going. In all fairness the people who helped arrange a hotel for us were courteous and friendly.  They gave us our tickets for the next day along with vouchers for the hotel and a few meals. I carefully checked the tickets to make sure we were all sitting together and discovered there were no seat numbers. I was told the seats would be assigned the next day.</p>
<p>After an uneventful (but not particularly restful) night in the hotel, we checked in our luggage and got our seat assignments. Unfortunately the person making the seat assignments decided that the best place for us to sit was in the very back&#8211;where the engine completely covers the windows and the kids can&#8217;t see out at all.  Maybe I didn&#8217;t adequately explain that yes we all needed to sit together and yes the ability to see out was somewhat important&#8211;something I had put a lot of effort into earlier when selecting our flights.</p>
<p>We finally did make it to the beach a day late. It was a nice week spent talking with family, watching dolphins, playing in the waves, making sand castles and swimming in the pool.</p>
<p>So back to the &#8220;wrong plane&#8221; thing.  Either the airline told us the truth and they had accidentally put us all on the wrong plane or they lied and it was just cheaper to have us get off and put other people on that plane. I am almost certain that it was option 2 because if they did make all the mistakes that would have been necessary to put everyone on the wrong plane, I&#8217;m pretty sure they wouldn&#8217;t admit it. Mistakes of that magnitude would require a huge number of people to do the wrong thing at a scale that would mean the airline would probably have planes running out of gas in mid-air and bumping into the terminal.</p>
<p>So assuming that we were on the &#8220;right plane&#8221; until they decided they wanted to use it for something else, why would they make up a lie that made them look horribly inept? Imagine this exchange between a police officer and a thief who stole money from a vending machine:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Police</strong>: So did you steal money from that soda machine last night?<br />
<strong>Suspect</strong>: No.<br />
<strong>Police</strong>: What were you doing last night from 8 to 10 pm?<br />
<strong>Suspect</strong>: I was murdering someone.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>: Did you make a business decision that will make us miss a day of vacation?<br />
<strong>Delta</strong>: No.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Then why is the plane I was on headed somewhere else.<br />
<strong>Delta</strong>: We have no idea where are planes are or where they go. Our employees don&#8217;t even check to see if a plane is the right one or if it is at the right gate.<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Are you sure it wasn&#8217;t just to get the most people to their destination?<br />
<strong>Delta</strong>: Yes. It definitely was caused by a general state of confusion about what plane goes where.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming it was a business decision, I can understand what Delta did. Now I think they should have made the decision before we all got on the plane, but it is understandable even if I don&#8217;t like how it change my family&#8217;s plans. But I can&#8217;t at all imagine why they would lie about it&#8211;particularly with something that makes them look far worse.</p>
<p>I propose that Delta needs a CLO&#8211;chief lying officer who can oversee that any lies being told don&#8217;t make the company look worse than the truth. The first thing this person would be tasked with is creating a lying handbook or maybe some type of online employee portal where you can select what the situation is, and it will give you a list of lies to tell that don&#8217;t make the airline look worse than the truth and a list of lies that you aren&#8217;t allowed to use.</p>
<p>For example if a plane is grounded because of maintenance, unacceptable lies would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FAA has grounded all of our flights because our planes are held together with rubber cement and twisty ties.</li>
<li>Three of our pilot&#8217;s pet rattlesnakes got loose and we haven&#8217;t been able to find them. We <em>think</em> they escaped on this plane, but it could have been any of our planes.</li>
<li>The plane is infested with bloodsucking cockroaches and will need be radiated for 5 months before anyone can enter it.</li>
</ul>
<div>Acceptable lies to choose from would include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is bad weather between here and your destination&#8230;. No it won&#8217;t show up on the weather map on your smart phone&#8230;.It is special weather that doesn&#8217;t show up on a smart phone&#8230;. next.</li>
<li>Someone (dirty look at a random bystander) tampered with the smoke detector in the lavatory and we will need to fix it.</li>
<li>The toilets are frozen and FAA regulations prevent us from flying with frozen toilets&#8230;.I know it is 108 <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/harvard-masters-degree/6463/" class="kblinker" title="More about degree &raquo;">degrees</a> out, but it is really cold at 20,000 feet and they freeze in the air.</li>
</ul>
<div>Or maybe, just <strong>maybe</strong> it would be easier to tell people the truth.</div>
</div>
<blockquote><p>Note: If someone from Delta wants to set me straight and say that the flight going from KC to Memphis on August 13th was somehow pulled up to the wrong gate, prepped without anyone noticing it, boarded by the pilots and crew without anyone noticing that they weren&#8217;t on the correct plane until right before they closed the door, I&#8217;d be happy to update and clarify that I was wrong and we were told the truth.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Plus &amp; Google Apps</h3>
<p>Google Plus is starting to offer games on their new entry to social networking. However, they still haven&#8217;t figured out how to let Google App users (you know, the people who pay google to use Gmail on their own domain) join the service. It seems odd to roll things out to you paying customers last.</p>
<h3>Are Ebooks a Good Deal?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen from several sources that students are buying ebooks in record numbers.  I can understand the advantage of ebooks, but the economics are usually pretty <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/10-signs-you-will-be-poor/472/" class="kblinker" title="More about poor &raquo;">poor</a>. If you buy a real book, take care of it and sell it to someone taking the class next semester, I think you&#8217;ll have a hard time justifying the cost of ebooks. Of course if everyone switches to ebooks, you won&#8217;t have anyone to sell it to.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Presidential Campaigns</h3>
<p>Anyone that wants the presidency so much that he&#8217;ll spend two years organizing and campaigning for it is not to be trusted with the office. ~ <a href="http://www.noteaquote.com/quotee/13/1">David Broder</a> (<a href="http://www.noteaquote.com/quote/147">source</a>)</p>
<h3>Zen Koans and Programming</h3>
<p>A koan is a story or question where you can&#8217;t logically deduce the meaning, but using intuition you can figure it out. It is a part of the way Zen Buddhism is taught. It turns out, it is a very effective way to teach programming languages. Programming language koans generally consist of an ambiguous question or statement followed by a line of code that is broken.  You have to fix it somehow and the ambiguous statement provides clues, but not the answer. If you are looking to learn a programming language, trying searching for a set of koans for it.  Here are a <a href="http://sett.ociweb.com/sett/settJan2011.html">few</a>.</p>
<h3>Khan Academy</h3>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy </a>for awhile, you really should check it out.  It covers the bulk of what someone would learn through high-school in easy-to-approach 5 to 10 videos.  They have added a number of exercises&#8211;particularly on the math side of things along with video game style achievements.</p>
<h3>American Express Concierge</h3>
<p>My experience with Amex Concierge has been a bit <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/american-express-concierge/517/">hit or miss</a>.  I recently asked them to deliver a book for me to a foreign country where it needed to be there by a certain date. They told me it would get their two days ahead of schedule, but it didn&#8217;t end up arriving until several days late. This might not have been their fault because it was in an area where street addresses are a bit non-formal. Anyway while talking to the person who called to apologize, I learned that they often get called on to retrieve articles left in foreign hotel rooms.  This guy was telling me about how difficult it was to get a diamond ring back out of India because of their laws on shipping valuables out of the country.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the country, state and federal funding is being cut for education and this has left many communities scrambling to figure out what to do.  I was originally hopeful that less money would prompt a reassessment of the fundamentals of education and encourage schools to really focus on the things that will give kids the tools they need for a successful career and benefit society as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5284" title="class-main" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/class-main.jpg" alt="" />Unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t seem to be what is happening.  The small town where I live voted to raise local taxes to make up some of the difference in funding to try to maintain the status quo as much as possible. I&#8217;m not opposed to paying more in taxes if the result is better educated kids but doing the same thing we&#8217;ve always done with just a bit less total funding isn&#8217;t going to result in any deep an meaningful innovation.</p>
<p>The problem is that we are terrified of implementing change&#8211;often for good reason. If you are on the school board, pushing for change means that some people are not going to like you. Re-evaluating the purpose of education and aligning your efforts with that purpose means there are going to be people whose pet projects and favorite programs are going to get modified or even cut entirely.</p>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to meaningful change is good <a href="http://www.leadership501.com" class="kblinker" title="More about leadership &raquo;">leadership</a>. A committee of people doing things in a way to minimize the blame is not an inspiring model. Change requires that someone stand up, takes responsibility and communicates clearly a compelling vision of the future.</p>
<p>Think about the difference. Which do you think it more likely to be able to make real changes in education?  A committee of people wringing their hands at the test scores and lack of funding or a person who stands up and says &#8220;Here is what we can do to make sure our kids are the smartest in the state at a lower cost than we&#8217;ve ever done it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t just apply to school systems.  Change is hard in every area.  Here are three things that you can do to get innovative ideas and then see those ideas actually put into action.</p>
<h3>1. Have good ideas and a vision</h3>
<p>This sounds like a very basic thing, but it is surprisingly uncommon.  If you have a goal and a plan to get there, you are going to be miles ahead of everyone else.</p>
<h3>2. Understand and communicate your purpose</h3>
<p>Part of the reason change is hard is because people don&#8217;t agree on what you are trying to accomplish.  Simply being able to communicate and build consensus around a focused purpose is a huge step.</p>
<h3>3. Test, measure &amp; be willing to undo</h3>
<p>People are a lot more willing to try something they don&#8217;t fully like, if you are clear how it will be measured and what threshold will justify abandoning it. People have been burned too many times by ideas that aren&#8217;t ever fully implemented, never achieve their promised potential and are kept around anyway. In fact this is why many people get suspicious of your motives when you propose change.  They don&#8217;t expect you to actually measure if the change is beneficial or not, so they think you may have ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Change is hard, but it is very necessary. Unfortunately most people aren&#8217;t going to support change until terrible things happen&#8211;terrible things that are often the result of putting of change for too long. With the right person,  the right ideas and the right vision of the future change can happen that isn&#8217;t driven by catastrophe.  Support that person.</p>
<p>Better still, be that person.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/free-book-read-this-before-our-next-meeting/8772/">review</a> of <a href="http://amzn.to/rojokx">Read This Before Our Next Meeting</a> by Al Pittampalli. It is a good book and well worth the money. Al was gracious enough to do an interview with us about his passion for creating better <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/9-tips-for-efficient-meetings/6620/" class="kblinker" title="More about meeting &raquo;">meetings</a>. You may end up buying a bunch of extra copies to give to give out at the office.  Also check out the <a href="http://modernmeetingstandard.com/">Modern Meeting Standard</a> website.</p>
<p>Al used to work for Ernst &amp; Young where he spent his working with a bunch of different companies. A good percentage of his time was spent in meetings, so he is in a good place to understand the problems with normal meetings. More importantly, he has some great ideas about how meetings should be used and how they should be avoided.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8798" title="Al PIttampalli" src="http://www.productivity501.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_0250-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Why are you so passionate about making better meetings?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with the idea of organization. The promise of organization is that individuals working together in alignment, can achieve way more than the the sum of those individuals could on their own. This is how we put a man on the moon, invented the Iphone, and created the internet.</p>
<p>But in so many organizations, meetings are disgracing that promise. Meetings are debilitating collaboration, and preventing forward progress instead of enabling it. I&#8217;m fascinated with the possibilities that could be realized if we fixed this problem.</p>
<p><strong>What if someone takes exception to some parts of the Modern Meeting Standard?</strong></p>
<p>The Modern Meeting Standard at it&#8217;s essence is a posture, an attitude, one that demands we reinvent meetings. I&#8217;ve developed a methodology, and people may not agree with everything, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Every organization has different needs, and each one must develop a meeting system that works for them (as long as it addresses the delayed decision making, culture of compromise, and false urgency I write about).</p>
<p>What is crucially important is realizing that the meetings system is broken beyond repair and we need to fundamentally reinvent it. Start there.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like one of the leading causes of unnecessary meetings is organizations where the person who needs to make the decision doesn&#8217;t necessarily have the authority to do so. How do you structure an organization so this isn&#8217;t the case?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no one structure. Every organization is different. What I do know is that the real problem is not structure, it&#8217;s culture. Stephen Covey wrote years ago about the speed of trust. I think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re missing: trust.</p>
<p>Do you empower your people to make quick decisions, or do they have to seek your approval every single time? Do we feel the need to be included on all decisions? Are we able to accept the consequences of someone who makes a bad decision?</p>
<p>If we want an organization with flexibility, velocity, and power, we need to embrace a culture that trusts others to make decisions without requiring endless approvals. The Modern Meeting Standard forces teams to confront this fact every time they have a meeting. That&#8217;s a powerful first step.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the modern meeting crisis is caused by <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/10-signs-you-will-be-poor/472/" class="kblinker" title="More about poor &raquo;">poor</a> writing and reading skills?</strong></p>
<p>Too much. We call a meeting instead of writing because we know our people don&#8217;t read. We don&#8217;t read, because we&#8217;re certain that if the information is that important, someone will probably call a meeting. It&#8217;s a horrible conundrum, that results in absurd meetings where people are herded into a room just to be force fed information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an incredibly wasteful epidemic where there is a simple (though not easy) cure: Everyone agrees to cancel all the informational meetings and instead write clear, cogent memos. And in turn everyone commits to reading the memos without fail.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you learn to write better? I know a lot of people really struggle with writing and often don&#8217;t feel there is anything they can do to change that.</strong></p>
<p>The only way to get better is to practice. I wish there was a shortcut but there isn&#8217;t. Try going an entire week (or at least a couple of days) without picking up the phone or calling a meeting. Force yourself to write cogent thoughtful messages to your colleagues instead. That&#8217;s a great first step.</p>
<p><strong>If someone reads your book and likes the concept of the Modern Meeting Standard, how should they get started? (Particularly when they aren&#8217;t in a position to dictate company wide changes.)</strong></p>
<p>Convince just one person to hold a modern meeting: your boss, a colleague, a manager. This isn&#8217;t easy, but it has to be done. Your organization depends on it. This revolution can spread fast inside your company. All it takes is one courageous person to stand up and say, &#8220;Hey, can you <a href="http://amzn.to/rojokx">read this</a> before our next meeting, please?&#8221;
