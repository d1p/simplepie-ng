Happy Birthday Hina!!!! I didn't forget about you! On the contrary, I think I talked about him most while I was living with an old fan friend in London. It's actually kind of ironic how I went to spend a week with a fan friend I knew before I ever went to see 8, to drown my sorrows about missing my first tour lol. But it worked! She's the sweetest thing too, putting up a picture of 8 in the guest room before I arrived hahaha! Had the best vacation possible! :)<br /><br />Been hearing great things about Yoko's drama and Yasu's CM. Really proud of them both. And of course the birthday boy gets all my love just for playing himself. I miss him so much. :(<br /><br />And really, I'll be back to reply to comments when I'm not studying or doing overtime, or sick.

We went to the Pyrenees today. I started laughing to myself when I spotted this during lunch. (Sorry it's a bad cellphone picture.) With my reputation at stake, I explained it to the rest as "Oh I really like this symbol.." LOL. Can I cash snow in for yen so I can go to the countdown?! I've not given up 100% but I know it's just wrong for me to go to Osaka for concerts when it costs exactly the same to fly home for Christmas. I can't do that to my grandmother. I love 8 but family definitely comes first.<br />

Well I had to work overtime. :( The good news is, we're throwing a birthday celebration for two tomorrow so I'm definitely going to celebrate the dear man's birthday in style (secretly?). The bad news is, I've not kept my promise about posting before Maru's birthday. Next time though, I'll definitely post before the next birthday. Hina's is two months away! And I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I had completely gave up on the tour. Even though I'd probably have to sell a kidney to afford it.<br /><br />Happy Birthday Maru! Of course I love you so much to you. That alone means more than anything else I can say. I can't even begin to describe how annoyed I am about missing Freeter and all the news that comes along with it. Seriously. I have no idea what's going on with 8 anymore. And it scares me. I've never not known. :(<br /><br />On the personal end, I'm still insanely busy. I'm barely surviving at work cause I don't love my job, and as much as I love my language class I really think I'll start falling behind if I don't work harder. But it's so difficult to find the energy! It took a lot of studying for me to catch up with what I missed cause I joined the class late. Well at least it was the first time I was missing class for a reason unrelated to 8 lol. I just wasn't here yet. Gotta quit being so last minute.

But if you thought I'd be able to post in time.. lol. Well it's still evening where I am so let's not take Japanese time into account for now.<br /><br />Happy birthday Ryo! I wish I had time to dig up today's Janiben reports! At least I hope he was there! Lucky fans, Janiben recording always seem to coincide with their birthdays.<br /><br />Argh I really miss being in 8-mode, and just writing about them. I've only been here for about 25 days but it feels like 25 weeks away from 8. I can't stand not knowing anything! But it's so hard to just go back to regular programming now that I've missed so much. I'll never be done with 'settling down'. There's always so much to do! I promise to be back before Maru's birthday though.<br /><br />Right now I'm just feeling bummed cause it really feels like 8 hates me. The one and only time I'm missing their tour since their debut and they finally give me what I want?! Can someone teleport me to Japan? Why didn't this tour start a month ago?! :(<br /><br />Oh and it's not that I'm being secretive but I really think it'd be more interesting if someone managed to guess where I am. A good hint.. hmm, I don't speak the local language. The other day in language class we read a story about this girl with a Japanese friend named Yoko. Now that's a sign.

I'm sorry. I feel bad for leaving without saying a word but things got really insane last week. The last thing I had time for was my blog, even if I knew there was probably A LOT to post. (To think I went and did the catch-up post, thinking I'll be able to go back to my daily thing the next day.)<br />
<br />
So I decided to move to Europe. Bought a plane ticket on Thursday and left on Saturday. I've been here since Sunday (it takes THAT long to fly over) and obviously settling in has been my first priority. In fact I didn't even turn my netbook on till yesterday (for like 20 minutes?). This is the first time I'm sitting in front of my computer for real since I got here. Can't believe it's almost been a week. I don't know how long I'll be here for. One step at a time, I guess.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I don't know if I'll find time to post. I don't think I can do the daily thing for now, but I'll try to drop in as often as possible. There's just SO MUCH to do right now. But I really don't want to give up on this blog. I've never 'abandoned' it for so long, and frankly it's quite upsetting to see these empty pages. (I'm really psycho about the daily thing.) SIGH.<br />
<br />
Take care guys! I'll be back soon!]]></content></entry><entry><title>[Kanjani8] スバラジ</title><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://kimiko.jugem.jp/?eid=1985" /><id>http://kimiko.jugem.jp/?eid=1985</id><issued>2010-10-02T23:15:00+09:00</issued><modified>2010-10-03T19:00:59Z</modified><created>2010-10-02T14:15:00Z</created><summary>Radio

∞ Subaru will have his own radio show on FM Nack5 from 10/2!<br />
<br />
Named "Kanjani8's Shibutani Subaru's Subaraji", it will focus on his love of music and feature challenging comedic segments. Subaraji is an adorable name! I never would have thought Subaru would be offered a solo radio show! Definitely the most exciting news I've heard in a long time. I love getting an insight into Subaru's head so I'm definitely tuning in! &#9829;<br />

To say I'm not excited would be a lie, but this doesn't surprise me at all. I mean, they LOVE Hina! Fans have definitely seen this coming from a mile; we just didn't expect it would take this long. I'm really happy for Hina! &#9829;<br />

<br />
You can hear the entire show on bayfm's website. I'm so glad I'm a regular listener! (Tamaki is my favourite actor, plus I love his voice!) Listening to Kura's message gave me a "my boy has grown up!" moment. So the boy has no stage fright now?! Did he read off a script?! He sounds too smooth to be true. XD At this rate, he'll have his own movie or drama in no time. He can already handle the press run on his own! Oh and I'm happy he shares my taste in men. XD He clinched a headline for his Tamaki comment at the 9/27 premiere - so proud of him!<br />

Sorry for posting two entries at once. I needed to get back on track, and these were from today so I didn't want to confuse anyone (e.g. myself). Neat freak.

BECKY IS JOINING ARIEHEN?! How did I only find out now?! LOL. I ADORE HER! She's funny and so nice, omg. And I think I'll go blind from watching her, Yasu and Miwa-san in one frame. Just imagine the amount of colour from their clothes (and hair)!<br />

ARGH I love 'evil Kura'. Someone hand him an evil character to play in a high profile drama soon! On a side note, the other night I tried to explain Oooku's characters' relationships to a couple of friends. It was impossible. LOL.<br />

∞ Ryo was in such a good mood at today's News concert (in Osaka) that he sang just a bit of LIFE before singing his solo. He also reminded everyone that "Kanjani8's LIFE ~Me no Mae no Mukou e~ is out in stores right now."<br />
<br />
Wonder if he did it cause he's in Osaka? Or was he in that much of a good mood? XD]]></content></entry></feed>
