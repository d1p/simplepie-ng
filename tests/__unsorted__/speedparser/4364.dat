		</div>
<p>We strive to improve our intranets, adding functionality and honing usability. Intranet Managers are inundated with feedback, requests for features and criticism; everyone has an opinion about the intranet!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2276" title="Gadget" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3178813312_bf93aa1658-300x400.jpg" alt="Gadget" width="300" height="400" />Even when we implement features and functionality at the behest of stakeholders to meet the needs of the business and intranet users, there&#8217;s <strong>no guarantee that people will care</strong>. Sometimes we launch a new feature, only to see it misused, <em>or worse</em>, go unused. We should be able to predict if a new function or feature will be useful, usable and adopted, but it&#8217;s difficult. Ask any marketer involved in product launches -<em> Zune anybody?</em></p>
<p>There <strong>are</strong> a few basics we have to tick off; we need the intranet platform to support the new feature; we need the new feature to be easy to use &#8211; completely usable &#8211; and we need written governance (however brief) to layout the ownership and purpose of the feature. It should look something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good Tech + Good Usability + Good Governance should = Good Usage</p></blockquote>
<p>How can we fail? If we&#8217;ve got a modular intranet then it should be especially easy to just plug in a new widget!</p>
<p>But &#8216;good usage&#8217; is relative; different audiences have different needs and perceive / gain value from features differently. We might be looking for a 90% adoption rate,<em><strong> but why?</strong></em> A 5% adoption for some features may be considered &#8216;high&#8217;, and such adoption by active users can benefit 100% of the business. If 5% of staff regularly blog about their tips and ideas about customer service, product development, intranet use and tips for effective presentations then everyone benefits. Not all features need to be used by absolutely everyone in order to be considered a success.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Something can be brilliantly executed, but valuable to a small audience. Maybe measure usage as a % against theoretical max.&#8221;<br />
<a title="Twitter quote" href="https://twitter.com/#!/DigitalJonathan/status/99047863622975488">Jonathan Phillips</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There may be <strong>real reason</strong> why the new feature isn&#8217;t adopted, or proves unpopular. User Acceptance Testing may not always be appropriate, but focus groups (that don&#8217;t become &#8216;group think&#8217; experiments) can help you consider all the angles.</p>
<p>People might have found a<em> different</em> way to create the same benefit with an<em> alternative system</em> or feature. While you might love the new feature you&#8217;ve rolled out, it may be prudent to support the popular feature, unless of course it must be retired / shut down (like unwieldy legacy systems). People are going to use whatever seems easy, convenient and most beneficial to themselves; they&#8217;re not going to switch to a new system without going through &#8216;change pain&#8217; unless they can experience immediate improvements to their ways of working.</p>
<p>Then again, there may just be a<strong> lack of awareness</strong> about the feature and its benefits; &#8216;good governance&#8217; should include good communications, but such tactical matters can&#8217;t be guaranteed without a comprehensive long-term communications plan. Too often we &#8216;launch and let go&#8217; &#8211; meaning we promote the new feature in the run up to launching (over egging it perhaps) and then step back and move on to our next project. We don&#8217;t maintain momentum, we fail to follow through, and we then wonder why people haven&#8217;t heard about our wonderful <em>thing-a-majig</em> three months later.</p>
<p>People need to be shown (not told) the purpose and benefits (to them) of a feature, through examples and narratives. Not only do we need to embed the new feature into the heart of the intranet through regular use ourselves (how many times have you launched a themed blog only to have the articles dry up after three weeks?) but we need to apply good communications theory to the subject. We need to tell different audiences in different ways in different formats, multiple times.</p>

<p>This is the big one; while I might have convinced intranet managers to put pen (or crayon) to paper, sketch out the <em>conceptual vision</em> for the intranet and lay down the <em>roadmap</em> for improvements, documenting the <strong>intranet strategy</strong> is harder.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/20110704-110705.jpg" alt="Strategy" />The intranet strategy shouldn&#8217;t be a gargantuan, complicated, document, even if it discusses some complex requirements. The intranet strategy can be presented as a number of points with supporting explanations and examples, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a dry, dull, business document. But it does have to meet a few criteria in order to be useful.</p>
<p>Firstly, a <strong>strategy</strong> <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a list of goals and <strong>tactics</strong>. Crafting the future of your intranet requires strategic thinking, and an understanding of where your company is going over the next few years. Everyone feels that business changes at the speed of thought these days, and organisations are always undergoing some kind of &#8216;change management&#8217; process. A strategy needs to be able to weather all that stuff, for the next couple of years are certainly not going to be any smoother!</p>
<p>Strategies express &#8216;how&#8217; to approach matters, with long-term overarching goals in focus. Strategies provide context and frameworks for decisions and tactical actions. Certainly the intranet should have <strong>objectives</strong>, and measurable deliverables / key performance indicators — but the strategy itself, the pure strategy, should focus on the overall direction of the intranet, not on the day-to-day running of the system.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most important point is to ensure the intranet strategy reflects, supports and complements the <strong>business strategy</strong>. Intranet and Comms managers need to be close enough to the business (ear to the ground) and to the business leaders in order to fully understand the company as it is and as it will be in the future. The only way for the intranet to truly demonstrate its <em>worth</em> is if it makes reaching business goals easier, if it supports core (and peripheral) business activities.</p>
<p>In light of this crucial element, the <strong>intranet objectives</strong> should support the business objectives. I don&#8217;t mean they should be a like-for-like repetition, or a close shadow, I just mean that the intranet objectives should be seen to address the business objectives directly.</p>
<p>The business strategy and objectives are published and referred to, aren&#8217;t they? (Of course they are, how silly of me to ask.) And so the intranet strategy and objectives will be published too, along with all the governance guidance.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s that? The intranet strategy must be informed by the <strong>overall business strategy</strong>, it must be supported by <strong>objectives</strong> and <strong>metrics</strong> and it must be <strong>published</strong> and <strong>referred</strong> to, in order to have any value or affect. OK, but <em>what&#8217;s in it?</em></p>
<h2>Contents of your strategy</h2>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s such a challenge to craft a strategy that everyone around the business can get behind. Just what goes in it? Where do you start?</p>
<p>Start by reading your intranet vision. Then think about what the business would like to see more of, and less of.</p>
<p>Would you like to increase the speed to market of your products? Would you like to improve the quality (and firmness) of your decision making? So you then want to increase and improve collaboration and communication on the intranet, and reduce sending uncontrolled valuable documents around by email.</p>
<p>Would you like to improve the culture of the business, or help two previously separate companies merge to become truly one? Then you&#8217;ll want to provide faster, more relevant communications and help people break out of their silos and work with others; you&#8217;ll want to help people connect with others based on their skills and project experience, and open up collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>Would you like to streamline business activities, cut paper and reduce the time to process requests? Then you&#8217;ll want to implement end-to-end online task completion and self-service on the intranet, focusing on usability and business impact.</p>
<p><em>Furthermore, how empowered do you wish people to feel and to be?</em> Your strategy should lay out how you mean to &#8216;control&#8217; or &#8216;enable&#8217; people&#8217;s work online. Do you mean to centralise control within the intranet and comms team, or will you decentralise ownership and publishing across the business over the next 18 months? Do you want 90% of people managing their own Word documents, or do you want just 10% of people allowed to manage project documentation, leaving the rest to muddle through with shared drives and email?</p>
<p>Look at your governance model now, and lay out how you&#8217;ll support or change the model over time.</p>
<p>I could go on and on; I haven&#8217;t even touched on engaging senior manager and different departments to make sure the intranet strategy reflects needs from across the business. I haven&#8217;t discussed &#8216;walking it around&#8217; to gain buy-in and support from leaders.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the biggest challenge?</em> Making your strategy matter; too many stakeholders will be happy for the intranet to just &#8216;chunter along&#8217; with no investment of time, effort or money. I didn&#8217;t say it would be easy, I just said it would be the truth.</p>
<p>Like I said, this is a big one; but don&#8217;t let its importance destroy your momentum. Reference the vision, refer to the roadmap, and craft your first draft. It can always be improved, but you need it written, agreed and published now.</p>

<p>Intranets can be unwieldy dynamic systems, with hidden depths and wide flatlands of undiscovered joy or horror. If, as the intranet manager, you’re at the end of your tether with the lacklustre technology, departmental adoption or the dearth of management support, my advice is to seek some small wins to bolster people’s perceptions of the intranet and your management of it.</p>
<p>Sure, that new <em>recognition and reward programme</em> that HR have been screaming for isn’t off the ground yet because the identity authentication process is screwed up and IT keep saying it’s got something to do with ‘Active Directory’ and ‘keys’, but don’t let that destroy your <a title="Intranet governance 101 – the vision" href="http://kilobox.net/2206/intranet-governance-101-the-vision/">vision</a> for the intranet. Don’t let these badly managed massive projects derail the continuous improvements your intranet’s <a title="Intranet governance 101 – intranet roadmap" href="http://kilobox.net/2223/intranet-governance-101-intranet-roadmap/">roadmap</a> lays out.</p>
<h2>Seek the small; look for the easy wins that match your people’s personalities</h2>
<p>Before thinking about bespoke development for massive solutions, look around and see if there’s an off-the-shelf <em>widget</em> or module for your intranet that can meet your basic needs. There’s no shame in browsing a list of widgets and <em>then</em> deciding you ought to have one! Yes, I’m against ‘whistles and bells’ but there’s nothing wrong with implementing attractive features on your intranet if you can justify it by the end result.</p>
<p>What I’m saying, in a ‘round about fashion, is that rather than implementing <em>no</em> improvements this quarter simply because the budget won’t be approved for that thing head office want, you should<strong> implement some small, meaningful improvements</strong> that your people can get their hands on. Focus on immediate benefits; focus on people&#8217;s online habits. Think about the feedback you’ve received over the last year; think about all those ‘wish lists’ that people talk about when they discuss their work. Don’t seek perfection; perfection kills good concepts. What small idea can you realise that will get people talking about the intranet?</p>
<p>Small improvements can have big effects. Imagine if you spend 30 hours on <strong>task analysis exercises</strong>, where you ask people to perform some specific tasks on the intranet and watch / record there actions. You’ll learn how convoluted people’s clicks are when they’re trying to do something new online, and so you’ll be able to reduce those clicks my clarifying your navigation or creating some new links / reducing links. Imagine if you spent £1000 on refining the <em>look n feel</em> of your intranet, not so that it looks cooler, but so that the design of the intranet improves the <strong>usability</strong> of the intranet by (perhaps) increasing the contrast of content or content areas?</p>
<p>Or, what if you took it upon yourself to always always <em>always</em> have the restaurant menu online and up-to-date without fail? Or numbers and menus for the local sandwich shops. Or car park details. Or the lottery, or football (not my bag; like the weather, I feel the web does these jobs).</p>
<p>Whatever your people would appreciate, <em>do</em>. It really doesn’t have to be a big thing; the big things are expected. That’s just business. It’s the little things that people fall in love with.</p>
<p>What’s your little idea that could transform your intranet?</p>

<p>A roadmap, a list of things to come, is often used to layout updates and new features in a piece of software or a system. Windows has a roadmap; Mac OS X has a roadmap; one hopes the BBC has a roadmap&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2232" title="mindmap" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mindmap.jpg" alt="Mindmap - crayons and felt-tips" width="300" height="300" />Considering your intranet&#8217;s underlying software platform, probably a content management system (CMS) of some kind, it&#8217;s tempting to discount the value of laying out the roadmap. You may not know what the next version of the CMS will bring, or you know for a fact that you can&#8217;t afford to buy the next upgrade. I know how this feels, having inherited ageing intranets running on unidentifiable platforms.</p>
<p>But your intranet roadmap is so much more than a <em>copy n paste</em> list of software updates. Your intranet roadmap should layout, in a visual manner if possible (horizontally, over time), the improvements the communications and intranet team(s) mean to make. Following the intranet strategy (which supports the business strategy) and referring to the <a title="Intranet governance 101 – the vision" href="http://kilobox.net/2206/intranet-governance-101-the-vision/">intranet vision</a>, the roadmap lays out the up and coming features and functional improvements for the next year or two.</p>
<p>Yes, you should discover what upgrades or additional modules / widgets the company that supplies your CMS platform offers, and make a <em>business case</em> for spending some money on developing the capabilities of the intranet over the next twelve months. But no, this isn&#8217;t all about software and upgrades. The intranet roadmap highlights the <em>continuous improvements</em> the comms and intranet team(s) will make, which might include <strong>refining the layout of the home pag</strong>e, <em>launching a new blog</em> (with a specific theme and purpose), supporting HR and employee engagement with a new <strong>recognition and reward programme</strong>, <em>increasing the number of images</em> (and up-skilling the web team in <a title="Image editing crib sheet for the web or intranet" href="http://kilobox.net/1401/image-editing-crib-sheet/">image editing</a> and sourcing) and a host of <strong>DIY tweaks</strong> and improvements. Don&#8217;t forget to review <a title="Long multi-topic or short single-topic intranet pages?" href="http://kilobox.net/1525/long-multi-topic-or-short-single-topic-intranet-pages/"><strong>page layout</strong></a> and see about training content authors in <a title="Average pages" href="http://kilobox.net/1949/average-intranet-pages-are-ok/">how to write</a> for the screen.</p>
<p>A roadmap demonstrates that someone is at the helm, and that the intranet is being led. As an intranet manager or stakeholder, <strong>do you want to be a caretaker or a leader?</strong></p>
<p>Remember all that <strong>feedback</strong> you get about communications and the intranet from the annual and quarterly employee survey? Well, the roadmap demonstrates that you&#8217;re <strong>listening</strong>, prioritising and taking action. The roadmap, along with other governance processes, gives you something with which to to reply when you receive negative or damning feedback via email. Because that happens, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Start today</strong>; consider your <em>vision</em> for the intranet, talk to your IT contact over coffee and discuss needs and wish lists with your manager. Don&#8217;t ignore software upgrades or purchasing functional modules just because there&#8217;s no budget &#8211; if you keep talking about the benefits and the problem-solving functionality the intranet could provide you might get a budget next year. You have to start talking now, and your roadmap will help people see what you mean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Governance&#8217; is such a big word, it almost loses its meaning when we start talking about intranet governance. There are strategic experts out there and resources to rely on when considering how your intranet is governed and managed, but allow me to share some tactical ideas to help intranet managers get to grips with governance in a practical sense.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2218" title="futuro" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/futuro.jpg" alt="The future" width="300" height="436" />Let&#8217;s start with <strong><em>the vision</em></strong>. Now don&#8217;t roll your eyes; I&#8217;m not talking about the mission and values of your intranet (although that&#8217;s part of it) and I&#8217;m not talking about some <em>highfalutin</em> PDF signed by the CEO that never gets read. I&#8217;m talking about the big picture, the <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a>, the <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_line">log line</a>; something to <em>talk</em> about.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>&#8220;You gotta have a dream. If you don&#8217;t have a dream, how you gonna make a dream come true?&#8221;<br />
South Pacific</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>I think a simple document / intranet page that lays out the overall vision for the intranet is something that stakeholders and everyone can refer to, not to read, but <em>to talk about</em>. The points within the vision article have got to be succinct enough so that people can talk about them. Intranet managers have got to be able to rattle off key phrases in lifts and in corridors. The vision article is a <strong>touchstone</strong>, something to return to whenever people query the intranet strategy. The vision shapes the way people talk about the intranet, and how they will think about it.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The vision needs to be about what people will do on the intranet, not <em>how</em> they&#8217;ll do it. It&#8217;s not about technology, upgrades and specific functionality, it&#8217;s about what people do using the intranet as a platform to get things done. It&#8217;s about expressing the ease of reacting to changing business and of supporting business processes and goals. The vision is about saying what the intranet <strong><em>will</em></strong> be, not what it is today. It therefore needs updating by the intranet manager (working with the steering group) every so often, every six months.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that <strong>intranet managers</strong> sit down and <strong>write out their hopes for the intranet</strong>, without self-editing or censoring. The first draft should be veritably brimming with positivity and empowering language and ideas. The second draft may be a little more realistic, but don&#8217;t squash the ambition from the vision. Without rich ideas and high aims, what will people have to talk about and reach for?</span></p>
<p><span>The vision can be in any format you favour; several paragraphs, bullet points, or perhaps something more creative. But it must be clear enough that people can remember and talk about it without having it in front of them. A PowerPoint presentation may not be ideal (it separates ideas out too much).</span></p>
<p><span>Intranet managers could draft the vision alone, but incorporating ideas from <em>just everyone</em> &#8211; so lots of coffees are needed. Approval should be sought face-to-face, not by sending an email to all stakeholders. The vision needs <em>walking around</em> to get it embedded. The long-term benefits of this <em>human</em> approach pay dividends for years.<br />

<p>I meant to tell you properly, but I <strong>quit my job</strong> as the intranet / web manager for Severn Trent Water back in late February. I did my best to help my team mates take on my tasks during my three month notice period, but I was working hard right up to the last minute of my last day.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2196" title="mountain" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mountain.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Then I went home, <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/yappietales">walked the dog</a>, fed the <a href="http://twitpic.com/5023vy">ducklings</a> and, um, kinda <em>failed to apply</em> for a single job for several weeks. I must thank several friends and contacts for suggesting roles to me. But in the end, I have <a href="https://twitter.com/nigeldanson">Nigel Danson</a> to thank for noting my focus on intranet design and use here at Kilobox Communiqué and Twitter, and asking to see me for a consultancy role at <strong><a href="http://www.interact-intranet.com/">Interact Intranet</a></strong>.</p>
<p>After a couple of meetings, discussing the role and interviewing me in a very practical sense, I joined Interact Intranet on the 23rd of May as an intranet consultant, working across the UK. I shall have the privilege to share some thoughts on intranet design and use on the <a href="http://www.interact-intranet.co.uk/blog.asp">Interact blog</a> too, so I&#8217;ll keep you up to date with what I learn over the months ahead.</p>
<p>You will have noticed that I have some ideas and &#8216;good practice&#8217; guidelines that I like to share, that I&#8217;m pretty much focused on <a href="http://kilobox.net/category/intranet/">intranet</a> design and use, and having worked within Internal Communications and MarComms for several years I have some understanding of the need for <a href="http://kilobox.net/category/communications/">good communications</a> and supporting processes and systems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been an intranet manager, a practitioner, since something like 2004, and so I know how it feels to have a <strong>broken intranet</strong>, a <em>damaged structure</em>, an <strong>overwhelmed home page</strong> and an <em>unimpressed, disengaged audience</em>. I know what it takes to <strong>redesign and renovate</strong> the structure and the content, and I know how hard it can be plan and implement a new intranet.</p>
<p>Now, for Interact Intranet, I shall help companies across the UK improve how they use their intranet and, for product customers, plan and build their new intranet based on <a href="http://www.interact-intranet.com/product/feature/full-feature-list/">Interact 4.8</a>.</p>
<p>Having used several Content Management Systems, seeing a demo of Interact 4.8 made my eyes widen &#8211; just the People Finder alone made me wish I&#8217;d had such an intranet in the past.</p>
<p>So, my focus remains on good communications with an emphasis on using intranets as part of the digital workplace. But can I walk into other companies, meet brand new people (who probably don&#8217;t tweet&#8230;) and help them find the best ways for their business to use their intranet? That&#8217;s my challenge in June, and I&#8217;ll keep you posted for sure.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
<p>You simply must <strong><a href="http://d.pr/c7jM">read the very kind announcement Interact Intranet made</a></strong> about my joining the team. It&#8217;s too too kind of course.</p>
<p>Then, if you like, read how I got into intranets see <strong><a href="http://kilobox.net/2179">all the people who gave me my many breaks</a></strong>; I know this isn&#8217;t the <em><strong>Oscars</strong></em>, but I have several people to thank for who I am today.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like I steer my life&#8217;s direction through this stochastic universe, other times I feel like nothing more than jetsam on the inexorable tides of other people&#8217;s oceans. There&#8217;s <em>some truth and none </em>in both ideas, especially when considering how often I&#8217;ve moved home (30+), how many jobs I&#8217;ve had (lots) and how focused my career has been (laser like).</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2192" title="oscars" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/oscars.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />I&#8217;ve had many &#8216;breaks&#8217; in life and some tragedies. At times I&#8217;ve been alone on the street but mostly I&#8217;ve been supported and empowered by friends and people who just wanted to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just taken a big step in my career as an intranet and comms person, and I can&#8217;t help reflecting on the path that got me here.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Kylie</strong> for supporting me when I had to quit that job in the pet shop because the owner killed animals with her own two hands. We needed the money, but Kylie understood. She also supported me, like all my friends, when I finally decided to go to university.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Marie</strong> for giving me a job at Marconi, having met me in a pub when I was facing hunger and homelessness (again). Our fortuitous meeting meant that I got a foot in the door of a large corporation, and had the luck to be managed by someone like Marie, someone who protected me when I messed up and encouraged me when I did good work. I was *this* close in following her into environmental matters.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Helen</strong> for taking me on as the intranet manager for Marconi. Helen turned me down owing to the weakness of my CV, but I asked for a review and she was impressed with my writing and publishing outside of the boundaries of work as I have always run a voluntary organisation. We often chuckle at her having rejected me, and my having fought for the position.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Claire</strong>, <strong>Val</strong>, <strong>Mark</strong>, <strong>Nathanael</strong> and <strong>Tim</strong>, while at Marconi and then Telent (and beyond), for encouraging me to see the worth of my work and valuing my time and friendship.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Jules</strong> for standing by me as our voluntary organisation went through some difficult growing pains and organisational change. When other people took destructive paths, Jules looked for protective measures and has become the guiding voice in the org.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Chris</strong> for letting me try so much in my career, for letting me be unemployed at times and supporting my crazy ideas, like when I (briefly) worked in Germany for Vodafone and just *all* my bizarre personal and web projects.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Dan Hawtrey</strong> at <a href="http://www.contentformula.com/">Content Formula</a> for literally valuing my work here at Kilobox Communiqué by sponsoring my blog for a time. It&#8217;s just incredible to me to think that people take more than a passing note of my ramblings and &#8216;good practice&#8217; ideas. I&#8217;m humbled by all my readers&#8217; and colleagues&#8217;-in-arms passion and expertise. Dan is a vibrant leader and the intranet management and internal communication services his company and team offer are surprising and refreshing. I must also thank Dan for valuing my expertise, and demonstrating that what I do and what I think about intranets has worth in the real world.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Helen</strong> for trusting me with the Severn Trent Water intranet and believing that I could improve the writing of the internal communications and the general &#8216;paginess&#8217; of the old intranet. I hope and trust the year-long slog to move to SharePoint 2010 pays dividends in 2011.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Kurt Kragh</strong> at <a href="http://my.intrateam.dk/gb">IntraTeam</a> for inviting me to their Copenhagen Event, an incredible three day intranet conference.</p>
<p><strong>Now I have to thank <a href="http://twitter.com/NigelDanson">Nigel Danson</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelmuirhead">Rachel Muirhead</a> at <a href="http://www.interact-intranet.com/">Interact Intranet</a> </strong>for taking me on as an intranet consultant, guiding my career from that of a fire-fighting intranet practitioner to ~ well, I hope to help scores of companies each year get more out of their intranet, so we&#8217;ll see who and what I become over time.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the many experts in our field who choose to share their knowledge and learnings, rather than just &#8216;switch off at 5 o&#8217;clock&#8217;. Intranets and internal communications can be hidden and secret, trapped within the firewall. It&#8217;s thrilling to be able to connect to other practitioners and consultants because of their blogs, tweets, conferences and then over coffee.</p>
<p>I had no idea I could meet so many awesome people who care as much about their roles and duties as I do. Ten years ago I didn&#8217;t know people enjoyed their work and liked learning enough to tweet n meet strangers!</p>
<p>The kind or guiding words from people have kept me blogging, and kept me working in the sometimes frustrating world of intranets. People like William Amurgis, Christy Season, Sharon O&#8217;Dea, Dana Leeson, Martin White, Shel Holtz, Chris Brogan, Luke Mepham, Shonali Burke, Mark Morrell, Kurt Kragh, Sam Marshall, James Robertson, Jen Cutler, James Royal-Lawson, Richard Baker, Linda Bolg, Diana Railton, Sean Williams, Charlene Kingston, Ashli Ahrens, LikeMinds, Jeremy Vine, Matthew Wright, Bas Zuhrberg, Susan Lambe, Csaba Szücs and too many to link to and too many to remember during an exciting week!</p>
<p>This reflective post came about because of my <a href="http://kilobox.net/2183">new job</a>, read all about it, and check the <a href="http://d.pr/c7jM">too too kind press release</a>!</p>

<p><a title="Intranetizen" href="http://intranetizen.com/about/">Luke Mepham (et al.)</a> has made a list of <strong>ten laws</strong> that intranet managers and communicators in the UK should be aware of to a fair degree.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2162" title="judges" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/judges.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />It&#8217;s a fantastic list, over at <a href="http://intranetizen.com/">Intranetizen</a><span style="color: #ff00ff;">*</span> and a resource I shall  refer to time and time again, and so I wanted to share it with you. I have been greatly annoyed in the past when certain colleagues have <em>flouted</em> the laws of the land merely because they felt it more <em>convenient</em>, or worse, assumed that the laws and morality don&#8217;t apply to &#8216;internal&#8217; work&#8230; <em>&#8220;Copyright? But I got it off Google&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act</strong> 2000 (&#8216;RIPA) &#8211; Impact: Monitoring employee activity</li>
<li><strong>Data Protection Act</strong> 1998 (&#8216;DPA 1998&#8242;) &#8211; Impact: Privacy</li>
<li><strong>EU Data Protection Directive</strong> 95/46 &#8211; Impact: Data protection and cloud computing</li>
<li><strong>Equality Act 2010</strong> &#8211; Impact: Employment and discrimination &#8211; replaces the famous DDA &#8211; Disability Discrimination Act 1995 &#8211; <em>information has to be available to people of all abilities, which may  mean ensuring your CMS / intranet / ITC systems can be used easily by  everyone</em></li>
<li><strong>Defamation Act</strong> 1996 &#8211; Impact: What can and cannot be said about colleagues and companies</li>
<li><strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> 2000 (&#8216;FOI&#8217;) &#8211; Impact: Limited, except for public sector intranets</li>
<li><strong>EU Electronic Communications Framework</strong> (&#8216;EU Cookie Law&#8217;) &#8211; Impact: on intranets that use cookies, as most modern systems do</li>
<li><strong>Human Rights Act</strong> 1998 &#8211; Impact: Personal data storage and use</li>
<li><strong>Financial Services and Markets Act</strong> 2000 &#8211; Impact: What you can and cannot say on news or CEO blog</li>
<li><strong>Trademark Act </strong>1994 &#8211; Impact: using logos / marks of other companies<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> / Copyright, Designs and Patents Act</strong></span> 1998 &#8211; Impact: Images / works you use on your intranet.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am so committed to following copyright regulations, and I just adore <a href="http://creativecommons.org/"><strong>Creative Commons</strong></a> &#8211; which many people on Flickr use.</p>
<p><strong><a title="10 laws for intranet managers" href="http://intranetizen.com/2011/05/10/10-laws-for-intranet-managers/">Read Luke&#8217;s original post</a></strong> with all the <strong>relevant links</strong>, and note the legal caveats and acknowledgements at the bottom :)</p>
<p>Yes, you may have a <strong>legal team</strong> or a <strong>General Counsel team</strong> to guide you, but <em>you actually need to talk to them</em> about your work in order to protect your company and respect other people, their lives and their works. <em>If you don&#8217;t have a good relationship with the legal team then build one!</em> They may appear to be incredibly serious and important, but they&#8217;ll be flattered and pleased to help a communicator who takes the company&#8217;s duty seriously.</p>

<p>Often used to discover the thoughts of users regarding ‘where’ they would like to find topics on the intranet, card sorting is a low-tech exercise that helps people influence the design of a site. By collecting real-world information based on <strong>people’s expectations</strong>, rather than relying on the design or intranet team’s logic and <em>wishes</em>, a site can be built that is people-centred and meets users’ needs.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2149" title="Card sorting" src="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/card-sorting.png" alt="" width="166" height="361" />Download my <a href="http://kilobox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/card-sorting-crib-sheet.pdf">card sorting crib sheet</a> [PDF; 425KB] [<em>right-click</em> to save] which covers the basics of this article.</p>
<p>Card sorting isn&#8217;t a panacea, it won&#8217;t cure everything that ails your intranet. But it&#8217;s a good place to begin, rather than starting from a &#8216;desired design&#8217; or a &#8216;wish&#8217; about how people &#8216;should&#8217; use your intranet. Yes, expertise, experience and logic can come in and influence the number of menu items and the groupings, but we should begin with real-world expectations of the users, rather than assumptions that designers and &#8216;intranet experts&#8217; bring.</p>
<h2>Card sorting process</h2>
<p>Participants can work in a <strong>group or alone</strong>, and should be representative of the audiences of the intranet / website. It may be beneficial to ensure plenty of ‘non-expert users’ participate. Several sessions will be needed, and 5 to 30 people should be canvassed from a variety of departments / audiences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scores and scores of index <strong>cards</strong> / note cards are prepared with <strong>topics and actions</strong> (hand written) based on business needs and any previous intranets / information systems in use. More topics can be created during sessions and marked ‘new’.</li>
<li>Participants should work through the stack of cards, <strong>laying them out</strong> and moving them into groups as they deem suitable. It is natural for the number of groupings to be fluctuate throughout the session; participants should feel free to start a <em>new group</em> or <em>combine groups</em> as and when they feel it is natural to do so.</li>
<li>Participants might work quite quickly during a ‘first pass’ of the cards, and <strong>reflect and discuss</strong> their reasoning more during ‘second and third passes’. A ‘don’t know’ or ‘miscellaneous’ pile can be used, and reviewed throughout the session.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results are recorded</strong> and later analysed to discover <strong>patterns</strong> and consensus. The intranet team and designers should review the results to create the final navigation / structure of the site.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Modern intranets / sites offer more than a simple ‘reading experience’. Many support business content, crucial communication, collaboration, and action / task execution.</p>
<p>Sites can focus on the needs of the people who use it, rather than any single expert. Designing the intranet around the organisation structure may seem obvious, but has few benefits for new employees or those outside of a particular department. Such a design can emphasise ‘silos’, hobble knowledge sharing and increase repetition.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Task-oriented, people-focussed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Matching the site’s structure to the expectations of daily users enables people to work more efficiently and effectively, ultimately benefiting the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h3>Open or closed</h3>
<p>The number and / or names of categories can be predetermined by the intranet team / designer or by previous rounds of card sorting. If predefined, card sorting is known as ‘closed’. If participants develop as many ‘theme piles’ as necessary, it’s known as ‘open’ sorting.</p>
<h3>Online sorting</h3>
<blockquote><p>Physical cards bring an immediacy to something that can seem ephemeral, but when expediency is needed, online card sorting is a quick way to gather expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>A major benefit is that an online service will analyse and factor-down the results for you. <a href="http://websort.net">Websort.net</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Read more from James Robertson (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/s2d_jamesr">@s2d_jamesr</a>) at Step Two Designs &#8211; <a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cardsorting">card sorting</a>.</p>

<p>Card sorting isn&#8217;t new, but it is clever, but it&#8217;s not the only exercise when considering your Information Architecture. What do you use? What <strong>flaws</strong> do you find in card sorting? <strong>What else is needed?</strong></p>
