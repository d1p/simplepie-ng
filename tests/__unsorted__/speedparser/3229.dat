<p>&#8230; or if zombies ever inhabit the earth.</p>
<p>ok well we really just went to try out shooting, and it was quite fun! Tried the .22 long rifle, 9mm and the .40 S&#038;W on various guns&#8230; the last one was a bit scary for me because the recoil made me feel like I&#8217;m always shooting the roof (but don&#8217;t worry, I wasn&#8217;t, I was shooting at <del>Hello</del> Goodbye Kitty)</p>

<p>10.5 months, baby! For four years of university and an expensive piece of paper :/ I didn&#8217;t even bother to frame my bachelor of fine arts, it&#8217;s even smudged in some parts from the snow during my convocation. I think it&#8217;s piled under a shoe box somewhere.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m going to finish my celebratory beer and go to sleep :p</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love BC in the summer! There&#8217;s lots of outdoor stuff to do. This is the third time we went camping this year, and probably the most successful because we managed to put our own tarp up. And let me tell you.. Putting up tarp takes a lot of skills. Like rope-tying, and measuring&#8230;.</p>
<p>The rest of it was easy though! BBQ-ing on the campfire and making banana s&#8217;mores xD our campsite was also close to a private-ish beach.</p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110909-163957.jpg" alt="lake view" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110909-164142.jpg" alt="lake view 2" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>We crossed this river&#8230; Or creek. It was about 20 meters across and halfway through crossing I thought I was going to die. The water was rushing and my legs were frozen, if I gve up I might as well be washed into the lake and drown :(</p>
<p>But obviously made it to the shore and back!</p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110909-164534.jpg" alt="sitting by the river" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Not sure why I was pointing at my foot.. Probably happy they were still intact.</p>
<p>No more camping until next year. My coworkers are all looking forward to snowboarding season. I still have to get snowpants! Sexy.</p>

<p>Was posing with a dress, with Oscar in his suit all evening&#8230; Our  friend William wanted to take photos of us to practice for an upcoming wedding, and his mom happens to own a wedding/photography store, filled with racks of pretty dresses! Am curious what the results will be from all the beach/wind/flash lighting tonight.</p>
<p>I am glad to be back in sweatpants and a t-shirt after all that posing. it is hard work to model and hold a pose!!! models don&#8217;t have it easy at all&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got a second lobe piercing on my left ear today. Last year I wanted a cartilage piercing really badly, but then decided against it when my friend, who is studying Chinese medicine, said a piercing in the cartilage will disrupt blood flow&#8230;</p>
<p>I am already cold all the time anyway, which means my blood circulation is pretty crappy to begin with, I didn&#8217;t want to make it worse -_-</p>
<p>So lobe it is! My friend and I checked out Claire&#8217;s, but there were so many horror stories, I was hesitant. Plus, their jewellery was expensive for what it was. The only post earrings I liked were $37.50, which was stupid for ONE piercing.</p>
<p>Looked at reviews on the internet, seemed like <a href="http://www.nextbody.com/">Next! Body Piercing &#038; Tattoo</a> had really good reviews. I planned on making my way there, and did&#8230;</p>
<p>However, we passed by <a href="http://www.adrenalinevancity.com/">Adrenaline</a> (both happened to be on Granville street) and checked out their prices. Adrenaline looked clean, sold clothing on one-half of the store, and jewellery on the other, some private rooms in the back for piercings and tattoos. We asked for prices, and found out it was $25 for a stud I liked, piercing fee included. Thanked the lady who helped us, walked out feeling excited&#8230;</p>
<p>Kept walking down Granville&#8230; Passed by some hobos&#8230; Some construction&#8230; Some really questionable-looking apartments&#8230; Some shady and dirty night clubs&#8230; We arrive at Next! and Luzhi says &#8220;This looks really sketchy&#8221; and it was true. The piercing &#038; tattoo parlour had bars all over its windows, but I&#8217;m not one to judge a book by its cover or a store by its jail-like bars&#8230;</p>
<p>We walked in, it looked decent, the only thing is it&#8217;s boiling hot and no one said hello to us until we walked up to the table. Maybe because Luzhi and I do not look very hardcore or cool&#8230; We look like little asian girls who probably scream when we see hello kitty (just to clear things up, we wouldn&#8217;t [what I mean is... We don't look like we will get very expensive tattoos or exciting piercings])</p>
<p>So when we asked about piercing, the guy said it&#8217;s $15 to get it done, and jewellery starts around $20. There&#8217;s a lot of options, but I didn&#8217;t see anything I particularly wanted to dedicate the next 2-3 months to, so we thanked him and left.</p>
<p>Back to Adrenaline we went! I was feeling nervous because the last time I had my ears pierced was 11.5 years ago, when I turned 12. I asked my mom for ear piercings and she agreed. We went to a hair salon in the mall and they used the gun, two ladies did it at the same time, before I could even say &#8220;Blueberry Cheeseburger&#8221;, I had ear percings!</p>
<p>However, when I was considering a cartilage piercing, I read that guns are bad. So bad. so very very bad. My first piercings turned out okay, but some other people had really horrible experiences with infections&#8230; Maybe the places they had piercings done did not clean their guns, regardless I wasn&#8217;t about to risk an ear infection (something that only happens to teenagers! not cool).</p>
<p>So, when I decided to get my 1 easy lobe piercing done at a piercing/tattoo place, I thought they would use a needle. I don&#8217;t like needles. Needles are scary to look at. When I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I always looked up whenever the oral surgeon gave me the anesthesia injection. He was very good at hiding the needle with his hand, but still&#8230; I looked away!!!</p>
<p>But the girl who did my piercing today, did not bring out any needles&#8230; Nor did she bring out a gun. She took the earrings out of the package, and I didn&#8217;t really pay attention because I was thinking she was going to get something else, but she said &#8220;Ok, now take a deep breath&#8221; and then I heard a CLACK! and it was in! I didn&#8217;t even see what she was holding, but at this point I didn&#8217;t care because she said to check out the piercing in the mirror :D</p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2nd-lobe-piercing.jpg" alt="2nd Lobe Piercing" title="2nd lobe piercing" width="525" height="700" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Oh this entry is getting quite long&#8230; I still need to explain why the title is &#8220;Holey Butters&#8221;! I got a card with post-piercing care instructions, and a product for earlobe stretching was called &#8220;<a href="http://www.bodyartpro.com/store/holey-buttr-vegan-stretching-care-p-93.html" title="Holey Butt'r">Holey Butt&#8217;r</a>&#8220;&#8230; Which amused me. Yes I am easily amused, but isn&#8217;t it witty? So witty and pretty and gayyyyyy??????</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past long weekend we went to Osoyoos again&#8230; Went seadooing but there&#8217;s no pictures because no one wanted their cameras/phones to break.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of this:</p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110804-004842.jpg" alt="on a tube" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>awwwriiight.. so asian, sunglasses and hat. booyah.</p>
<p>I am kind of sad looking at this picture&#8230; because I lost that hat while we were on the seadoos and now I am back to work. Kind of. 3-day work week for me. Monday was a holiday and I have tomorrow off because I&#8217;m going to court with my friend (traffic ticket). Then soon it&#8217;s a weekend again!</p>
<p>Long weekends are the reason why I haven&#8217;t been blogging&#8230; Plus I am barely on the computer after work nowadays. Camping in 2 weeks! Trying to cram as much outdoors summer stuff before the winter comes.</p>
<p>By September I think I will have crammed enough summer activities to tolerate the rain coming once again&#8230; It will probably be something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://raindeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/umbrella-ella-ella-eh.jpg" alt="under my umbrella ella ella eh" title="umbrella-ella-ella-eh" width="500" height="562" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>and if it gets really cold we can hotpot.</p>
<p>blah! late night blogging makes for a lot of incoherance.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know you&#8217;re old when you have the urge to download an urban dictionary app in hopes of deciphering  what the hell kids are saying on Facebook these days.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t download the app&#8230; If I do it means I have truly entered the world of seniors. I would really be abdicating my spot in the &#8220;youth&#8221; cohort and be filed under the &#8220;useless and smells like moth balls&#8221; category.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to sleep now.. Tomorrow I will wake up and go to work. And I&#8217;ll try not to think about having to google what &#8220;trolling&#8221; meant the night before</p>
<p>/ ______ \</p>
<p>Oh right I had the remaining two of my wisdom teeth taken out this last weekend. of course only the one side is swollen&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice this last time but it&#8217;s a little retarded to be swollen on only one side of the face. The second day after the extraction, the boyfriend would go on one side of my face and go &#8220;AWW CHIPMUNK!!!&#8221; then go to the other side and say &#8220;pretty girl&#8221; .. Then back to the other side with his nonsense chipmunk babbling.</p>
