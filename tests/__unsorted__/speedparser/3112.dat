		<description><![CDATA[There was a pain to be associated with not knowing, it was a social pain, a stigma and as a kid I felt it intensely. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When I was a kid it seemed that the worst thing that could befall an individual was not to know something. You were ignorant, excluded. The sheer number of times I or someone I knew would claim to know about something someone else was talking about (but not be able to explain it to anyone else) was truly amazing. There was a pain to be associated with not knowing, it was a social pain, a stigma and as a kid I felt it intensely. </p>
<p>I came to realise that my teachers were much better than my peers at explaining what they wanted from me. They gave me detailed descriptions of what they wanted and (for the most part) I complied. <span id="more-3177"></span>It is as true of TAFE (where I’m currently studying Business and Information Technology courses) as it was of high school. University was another beast entirely &#8211; sure they gave you strict formatting and referencing guidelines and frameworks within which to consider things, but ultimately your conclusions and your prose were your own. Sometimes this freedom seemed empowering – I could follow my whims, like the time I used a communications subject as an excuse to wax lyrical about soap operas – but other times it seemed too much freedom and I didn’t know where to start. </p>
<p>There’s a huge difference between knowing you could do anything and actually doing something. Doing something is grounded in specifics – specific ideas, specific actions. We have a word for this and I’m sure you’ve heard me use a lot. They’re called <B>constraints</B>. You might know them as guidelines or parameters. They nudge you in a direction and you can follow the flow of that direction or fight against, but either way you have a starting point. </p>
<p>Like <A HREF="http://www.johnlacey.com/creativity/i-shall-be-telling-this-with-a-sigh/">that Robert Frost poem</A>, we have to realise that some actions and directions preclude other actions and directions. By deciding to turn left, we – consciously or unconsciously – decided not to turn right.  It gives us a direction and an identity, we choose certain mediums and certain modes of expression. We become known as a poet or a portrait painter or a blogger or&#8230; <I>whatever.</I></p>
<p>The alternative is to be overwhelmed by choice and stalled by inaction. </p>
<p>The thing I learnt as an adult which escaped me as a kid is that there actually isn’t much to be gained by pretending to know things. All you really know is what you don’t know and even then it’s usually only the tip of some larger iceberg. So learn, try, play.</p>
<p>It is my hope to adopt a two prolonged approach to my creativity. Firstly to actively work on the creation of creative works. But secondly – and perhaps even more importantly – to practice, to play, to experiment. To practice making marks with a brush or pencil or a stick of charcoal just to better understand the medium, to better understand my own preferences as an artist and my personal visual language. To take some prose and rewrite it – perhaps without the letter ‘e’, or by using a thesaurus to change every third word. Just to see how it reads, how it sounds. Just to get a sense of what else is possible.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>So this book of poetry I&#8217;m featured in is an actual book somewhere. It exists as a tangible object. It went from an idea to a thing&#8230; I guess that is what creation is. I get a bit of a buzz out of it to be honest.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.johnlacey.com/relatedfiles/bound-by-the-secrets-book.jpg" alt="Bound By The Secrets We Trust Book" title="Bound By The Secrets We Trust Book" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3169" /></p>
<p>I was approached about submitting stuff for an earlier book. And I stumbled. I hadn&#8217;t written anything in ages and it just all seemed too hard. Plus even though I was contacted there was no guarantee that I would be accepted. It felt like I was setting myself up to be rejected and my skin was much too thin. </p>
<p><span id="more-3167"></span>But there was another opportunity and I wrote a few things and I raided my archives for the rest. I was surprised then too because writing was an alchemy I thought I had long lost the secret to.</p>
<p>The muse stopped showing up, and I stopped showing up and over time it just seemed easier. Easier to not show up. Easier to not write. Easier to watch TV. Easier to fill my days with minutiae and pretend writing was never something I was interested in.</p>
<p>There are few things as truly soul destroying as pretending to be &#8220;fine&#8221; when you&#8217;re not, as pretending that something (or someone) important to you actually isn&#8217;t. It is a betrayal of the self and you probably won&#8217;t even realise why you feel so crummy because you haven&#8217;t admitted there&#8217;s a problem (you&#8217;re a blocked writer). And as the old adage goes admitting you have a problem is the first step in solving it. Perhaps writing about it is the second.<br />

<p>&#8220;I hardly recognize myself it’s such a strange thing<br />
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans<br />
I’ve come so far and I’ve been so long away from home<br />
I’m like a photograph who’s image is still changing<br />
The letter that I never sent to you explaining<br />
All I want is a place for my heart to belong&#8221;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>My friend Michael Meloni started a personal blog recently. I actually read one of his blog entries and found myself thinking, &#8220;Oh it would be so cool to have a blog&#8230;&#8221; And then &#8211; <I>of course</I> &#8211; it dawned on me that I did have a (much neglected) blog. So yes, here I am. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to gush too much but I&#8217;ve been going to art lessons for a few months now and I have to say it is one of the best things I&#8217;ve ever done. I want to try to unpack some of the benefits I&#8217;ve experienced from having a great art teacher. </p>
<p><B>The Obvious &#8211; Technique</B><br />
A good art teacher will provide you with specific technique relating to your medium. Perhaps it&#8217;s about improving what you do already, perhaps it&#8217;s about introducing a whole new skill set. You may be surprised at what you can do even with a medium you&#8217;ve practiced with for some time. Sometimes it&#8217;s just about getting a new perspective. </p>
<p><B>Philosophies</B><br />
It&#8217;s not just technique that your teacher passes onto you as a student, it is also their philosophies. One of teacher&#8217;s favourite sayings is, &#8220;The only difference between a good painting and a bad painting is more work.&#8221; </p>
<p><B>The Stuff That&#8217;s Not Written In The Books</B><br />
And then there are those tips and tricks that are garnered through a life time of creating and shared with you the student. Whether it&#8217;s cost effective ways of reusing old objects (a stay wet palette made out of a sponge, an icecream lid and some cling wrap?) or when to use industrial hardware over &#8220;artist supplies.&#8221;<br />

		<description><![CDATA[People need people. Artists need an audience. Sometimes even the whispered possibility of an audience. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Robert Frost&#8217;s <I>The Road Not Taken</I> is familiar to many of us. While I&#8217;ve mused over <A HREF="http://blog.johnlacey.net/knowing-how-way-leads-on-to-way/">the meaning of this poem</A> elsewhere, today I want to really focus on the part that stays with me. Specifically the last stanza. </p>
<blockquote><p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
I took the one less travelled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.</BLOCKQUOTE></p>
<p>What interests me here isn&#8217;t the final line, not even the final three lines, but rather the first two. Frost will share his adventures with someone, he is so matter-of-fact on this point, there&#8217;s no doubt in his mind. Perhaps he did this conversationally, certainly he uses a poetic form to share it with his readers. He has such a profound sense of audience. </p>
<p>People need people. Artists need an audience. Sometimes even the whispered possibility of an audience. <span id="more-3144"></span>It is the reason that videos are uploaded to YouTube channels with no subscribers. It is the reason that poetry gets taken from a journal in a bottom drawer and transcribed into blog form. If it&#8217;s out there, perhaps someone will find it. Perhaps someone will see it or read it or watch it. Julia Cameron refers to it as being witnessed. If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear it does it make a sound; moreover, if nobody notices we were here did we actually exist at all? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the reason too when we don&#8217;t have someone to talk to face-to-face we blurt things out online.</p>
<p>I was taken aback by how succinctly a handful of tweets summed up so much of my life, how much they embodied things I hadn&#8217;t said or was reluctant to say.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>I became a writer because I was a frustrated musician. And then I became a visual artist because I was a frustrated writer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved music but even as a seven year old a part of me genuinely thought, &#8220;If I&#8217;m a rock star maybe people will love me then.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t play an instrument, or sing. I studied audio engineering and music business management. I figured I&#8217;d be a producer.</p>
<p>Somehow on completing uni it became apparent there were no opportunities for me. I came home to live with my parents and get a dayjob.</p>
<p>And I kept that dayjob for about five years until I was so driven by despair (with a broken heart) that I gave it all away.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s basically the John Lacey story in a nutshell.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>Nobody replied, I don&#8217;t know if anybody read those tweets. But still I share them there &#8211; and <I>here</I> &#8211; in the hope that someone bear witness.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I started going to art classes four weeks ago. And as much as I enjoy them, I often find them frustrating because even after having something explained to me I&#8217;ll still be clueless and lost. After three sessions of working on this possum I was so sick of it. But after a couple of days I am looking at it again and it seems to be better than I remembered. </p>

<p>I guess what I find helpful is the instruction&#8230; what to do, or what you might do differently next time. But more than anything I think I need to stand back and get a sense of the painting as a whole rather than obsess over individual details.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s been too long between posts, I know. In my defense I&#8217;ve been sick in bed with the flu for much of the week. My recovery seems to be a slow going one, but I&#8217;m hopeful (and impressed by the wonders of western medicine, which, honestly, I had been quite distrustful of). </p>
<p>I was in the local art supply store a few weeks ago when the woman working behind the counter happened to mention some life drawing sessions that take place in the area. I was vaguely interested, but didn&#8217;t quite take in all the details. When I got home I searched the web to see if I could find any details &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t, but through my search I found something much more interesting. </p>
<p>Turns out that there were weekly art classes in the area. I was interested but tentative, my experience had lead me to believe no teacher is better than a bad (mean spirited, unsupportive) teacher. I sent off an exploratory email and mused over the reply. And the following week I decided to go.</p>
<p>I was so glad that I did too. It is such a wonderfully supportive environment. Minutes into the first class I started nervously denigrating some of my artwork and was promptly told I wasn&#8217;t allowed to do such things. It really put me at ease. The other students are all working on their own projects and they&#8217;re fascinating. One woman was literally burning an image onto animal skin. It was just really inspiring and invigorating to come into contact with interesting creative people doing creative things.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel frustrated with what I&#8217;m working on, but just knowing there&#8217;s someone there to ask for guidance from is a blessing.<br />
