&lt;p&gt;It's been a little over a week since joining &lt;a href="http://plus.google.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;, and as the new car smell wears off, I can't help but ask, "Do I really need another place to connect to people online?" Fortunately, Google pulled through with some nice innovations. &lt;b&gt;Circles&lt;/b&gt; emphasizes the fact that most people know each other in different contexts. You have friends, co-workers, people you've never met, etc. So when you make posts, it asks you which circles you'd like to share them with. It feels very natural, making it a huge selling point. Other flagship features include &lt;b&gt;Hangouts&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Huddle&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sparks&lt;/b&gt;. But it's still very young and could use some tweaking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/20/Google%2B+First+Impressions/"&gt;More&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Sheehan</dc:creator><guid>http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/20/Google%2B+First+Impressions/</guid></item><item><title>FreeWheelWomen Take to the Long Road</title><link>http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/19/FreeWheelWomen+Take+to+the+Long+Road/</link><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/19/FreeWheelWomen+Take+to+the+Long+Road/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/media/photos/2011/06/20/fwwomen_1.png" alt title="FreeWheelWomen Take to the Long Road" style="padding-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community, biking, and social change. Just a few things that drive the ladies behind &lt;a href="http://www.freewheelwomen.org/" target="_blank"&gt;FreeWheelWomen&lt;/a&gt;, a local group that's taken to the road on a cross-country trip to spread their grassroots ideals. In support of their endeavor, Forward Interfaces has donated a blog-centric &lt;a href="http://www.freewheelwomen.org/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to their cause.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/19/FreeWheelWomen+Take+to+the+Long+Road/"&gt;More&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Sheehan</dc:creator><guid>http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/19/FreeWheelWomen+Take+to+the+Long+Road/</guid></item><item><title>Wedding Creators Make Planning Easy</title><link>http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/18/Wedding+Creators+Make+Planning+Easy/</link><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/18/Wedding+Creators+Make+Planning+Easy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/media/photos/2011/06/17/wcreators.jpg" alt title="Wedding Creators Make Planning Easy" style="padding-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weddings can be fun, beautiful, and memorable, but often times planning them isn't all smiles. Between finding the perfect hall, getting a cake, and dealing with those relatives you never talk to, it can go from overwhelming to an outright headache.

&lt;p&gt;Today is a very special day as it marks our two year anniversary. Many startup companies don’t make it past one year let alone two and we are grateful to still be here. But it wasn’t because of luck; we’ve been working hard to reach our goals, keeping a steady eye on the future. I think one thing that separates us as a company is our ability to make optimizing decisions while still maintaining our standards and character.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/16/Happy+Birthday/"&gt;More&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jeff Lobdell</dc:creator><guid>http://www.forwardinterfaces.com/blog/16/Happy+Birthday/</guid></item><item><title>Pintley Expands Your Horizons...
