		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/10/03/american-grace-and-public-sociology/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/american-grace/" ><img hspace="7"  vspace="2"  align="right"  class="alignright"  title="American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010)"  src="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/American-Grace2.jpg"  alt=""  width="164"  height="250"   style="float:right; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px;"/></a> In view of the recent push within sociology to promote “<a title="Michael Burawoy | For public sociology, American Sociological Review, vol. 70, no. 1, 2005"  href="http://asr.sagepub.com/content/70/1/4.short"  target="_blank" >public sociology</a>,” it is worth considering the fact that the last two sociological bestsellers have been written by political scientists—both of them, as it happens, at Harvard. First, Samuel Huntington’s 1996 <em><a title="Samuel Huntington | The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order (1996)"  href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zbQNAQAAMAAJ"  target="_blank" >The Clash of Civilizations</a></em> has dominated post-Cold War thinking about international relations for a generation. Its thesis was first essayed in an <a title="Samuel Huntington | The clash of civilizations, Foreign Affairs, Summer 1993"  href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/48950/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations"  target="_blank" >article</a> in 1993, at which point it began to influence narrow foreign policy circles. Once it appeared in book form, however, the book’s title (and hence its basic argument) became widely invoked in discussions of foreign policy. Critics dismissed the thesis for its simple-minded reduction of “civilizations” to areas of the world and for ignoring the diversity of viewpoints within those civilizations. But the argument seemed to capture certain crucial truths about the post-Communist world, especially the centrality of “identity” to the ways people thought of themselves when confronted with adversity. In that sense, Huntington stole the thunder of the post-Marxist, cultural-sociological left for an argument that was widely regarded as right-wing. And Huntington drew explicitly on the work of Max Weber in developing his own ideas. Make no mistake: this was a work more of sociology than of what had become an obsessively rationalistic political science, from which it departed in dramatic ways.</p>
<p>The other big sociological bestseller of the past generation was of course Robert Putnam’s <em><a title="Robert Putnam | Bowling Alone (2000)"  href="http://bowlingalone.com"  target="_blank" >Bowling Alone</a></em>—the argument of which also began life as an <a title="Robert Putnam | Bowling alone: America's declining social capital, Journal of Democracy, vol. 6, no. 1, 1995"  href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/summary/v006/6.1putnam.html"  target="_blank" >article</a>, published in 1995—which decried the decline of “social capital” and its consequences for the country. Because it was focused on domestic affairs, the book was of much greater interest to American sociologists, who tend not to pay much attention to matters beyond their own borders. Like the previous sociological bestseller (this time by card-carrying members of the tribe), Robert Bellah et al.’s <em><a title="Robert Bellah, Richard Madsen, William Sullivan, Ann Swidler &amp; Steven Tipton | Habits of the Heart (1985)"  href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5DQHmykT6u4C"  target="_blank" >Habits of the Heart</a></em>, the book fit into the long tradition of reflection on the pitfalls of American individualism that goes back at least to Tocqueville. Putnam worried that TV- and electronic gadget-addled Americans have retreated from the voluntary associations that impressed Tocqueville as the true life-blood of American democracy, weakening its civic fiber. Yet <em>Bowling Alone</em> soft-pedaled the rougher edges of American life and the growing dominance in its politics of a profligate financial elite. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, in the preface to <a title="Robert Bellah et al. | Habits of the Heart (rev. &amp; ext. ed., 2007)"  href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XsUojihVZQcC"  target="_blank" >a new edition</a> of <em>Habits </em>published in 2007, Bellah mused darkly about the runaway unaccountability of a wealthy “oligarchy” in American life. Nonetheless, Putnam’s ideas caught the attention of the nation and spawned a cottage industry of research on social capital—that is, more or less, on the role of trust, networks, and volunteerism in social life.</p>
<p>Robert Putnam and David E. Campbell’s <em><a title="Robert D. Putnam and David E. Campbell | American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (2010)"  href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/American-Grace/David-E-Campbell/9781416566717"  target="_blank" ><em>American Grace</em></a></em> follows up on these Tocquevillean themes, exploring the contemporary American religious landscape to understand, in the words of the subtitle, “how religion divides and unites us.” As in Putnam’s earlier work, the book mobilizes the full array of methods available to the social scientist—survey research, interviews, participant observation in relevant settings, historical comparisons. Vignettes drawn from qualitative research are interspersed with discussions of the quantitative data accessible to the uninitiated. The authors draw frequently on other pertinent studies to buttress their own findings, helping reassure us that the results of their research are reliable.</p>
<p>And what are those results? One main finding is that, as compared to thirty years ago (their baseline of comparison), religion and politics have tended to line up more consistently than they had previously, such that people who are more religious tend to be more conservative politically, whereas people who are less religious tend to be more liberal. One of the chief reasons is that younger people have been put off by the association of religion with conservative politics since the time of the Moral Majority. This was itself, according to Putnam and Campbell, a response to the upheavals of the 1960s, and especially to its challenges to gender and sexual norms. Religious-political polarization has been the consequence.</p>
<p>This partisan realignment represents an important shift from a time when churchgoers were more evenly divided between the conservative and the liberal. In those days, for example, many opponents of abortion were liberal on other measures; the reason is that they were devout Catholics who objected to the taking of unborn life but also supported measures to soften the blows of a capitalist economy, which was much less true of their white Protestant political allies. Now, opponents of abortion tend to be the more devout of all denominations (other than Jews), and those more devout people also tend to be more conservative across the board. The association of religiosity with conservatism has driven younger people out of religion, leading to a spike—into the 15-percent range—of the “religious nones,” those who claim no religious affiliation. Needless to say, these trends strongly parallel the contemporaneous emptying of moderates from the Republican Party and its transformation into a strongly ideological grouping lately driven by the sensibilities of the Tea Party.</p>
<p>Still, there remain important exceptions from the tendency for the more devout to be politically conservative. Black Protestants and Jews remain politically more liberal than white evangelical Protestants, while their religion is also much more deeply bound up with their ethnicity than is the case for other Protestants and Catholics. Yet their numbers are rather small. The authors also find that the white evangelical surge actually came to an end in the early 1990s; we have been shadow<del cite="mailto:Administrator"  datetime="2011-09-15T12:47" >-</del>boxing with it for the last two decades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in contrast to a waning mainline Protestantism (there is currently not a single Protestant on the Supreme Court!), Roman Catholicism remains vibrant in the country, but that is mainly because of the large-scale immigration of Latinos since the mid-1960s. The social cohesion of the WASP elite has declined in favor of a more religiously mixed top tier, and the general connection between ethnicity and religion has declined, with the exceptions noted. On the whole, in other words, religion is less strongly associated with other divisions in American social life, which tends to moderate the conflict deriving from the conservative political impulses of white evangelical Protestants.</p>
<p>Accordingly, despite the tendency toward polarization between religious conservatives and less religious liberals, Americans demonstrate a great deal of religious tolerance. Using an example reminiscent of the famously self-worshiping “<a title="Sheilaism | Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheilaism"  target="_blank" >Sheila</a>” in <em>Habits of the Heart</em>, Putnam and Campbell adduce every family’s “Aunt Susan” as the person who doesn’t fit the family religious tradition but sanctifies her particular faith for them by being such a good person anyway. She personifies the “religious bridging” that they regard as typical of the American experience and the key to its high levels of religious tolerance. Indeed, while acknowledging the country’s sometimes deadly anti-Catholicism in the mid-nineteenth century, the book concludes by gushing that “America has had religious toleration encoded in its national DNA.”</p>
<p>One might wonder here about the relative exclusion from the discussion of the newer religions on the American scene, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, and above all Islam. The stated reason for excluding these groups from the analysis is that their numbers remain so small that reliable statistical analysis is impossible. Fair enough. But the focus on the American mainstream is likely to encounter the same response from critics as it did when Bellah et al. wrote <em>Habits of the Heart</em>—that the book concentrates too much attention on the mainstream and obscures the margins. In view of the extensive mistreatment and opprobrium directed at Muslims in the post-9/11 period, one might ask, can the Putnam/Campbell approach be justified? One answer is that, in contrast to the European situation and to that surrounding such anomalous episodes as the so-called Ground Zero mosque, Putnam and Campbell’s marginalization of the Islam question gives it just the right amount of attention—namely, very little. Islamic extremism engages a vanishingly small proportion of Muslims, but overwhelms all other discussion of Islam (and, of course, drowns out other things that one might pay attention to, such as the approximately five million deaths in the god-forsaken Congo during roughly the same time period as the “war on terror”).</p>
<p>On the other hand, to await the day when newer religious groups achieve a statistical critical mass might keep us from saying anything about them for a long time to come. And whether they like it or not, Muslims in the United States are the subject of a great deal of attention at present and are adherents of the only faith associated with extensive anti-American violence. As even so liberal a publication as the <em>New York Review of Books</em> <a title="The Times Square Bomber: Homegrown Hatred? by Ahmed Rashid | NYRblog | The New York Review of Books"  href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/may/14/times-square-bomber-home-grown-hatred/"  target="_blank" >has pointed out</a>, there is also an increasingly homegrown dimension to anti-American Islamic attacks. Does the religious tolerance in Americans’ national DNA extend to Muslims? Given radical Islam’s targeting of the United States, chiefly if by no means exclusively, <em>should</em> Americans be tolerant of Muslims’ demands for accommodation of their faith when those demands seem at odds with liberal norms? Germany sought to be tolerant but eventually felt that it had to deport the so-called “caliph of Cologne” for his repeated and outspoken denunciations of the German political order. Putnam and Campbell say that the more Americans get to know people of other religions (or of no religion), the more they like them. But what of those—not always Muslims, to be sure—who denounce America as the Great Satan on religious grounds? Liberal societies reach the limits of tolerance when they have to deal with persons who reject the constitutional basis of those societies. This book cannot help us with that debate.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this quibble, Putnam and Campbell have produced a thoroughly researched, clearly written study of the state of American religion that reminds Americans of what we hold in common and offers the prospect that the polarization produced by the 1960s and its sequelae may be behind us. They do so on the basis of meticulous research using a broad variety of social scientific methods. The book comprises another valuable contribution to sociological efforts to make sense of American life—even if its principal author is not formally a member of the guild. Many sociologists will follow in his footsteps, as will many nonspecialist readers, because <em>American Grace </em>is an outstanding example of public sociology.</p>

Kahn"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/kahnp/" >Paul Kahn</a>, in his rereading of Carl Schmitt by way of the American context, seeks to “depersonalize the sovereign.” As he states, “there is no reason to think that such a power must be exercised by a natural person, as opposed to a collective agent or institution.” Indeed, Kahn identifies “the sovereign” with the univocal expression of collective agency—that is to say, with “popular sovereignty.” It is possible that such a significant revision of Schmitt’s concept of sovereignty might make some of what Kahn says unrecognizable to a Schmittian analysis. But Kahn is less interested in, as it were, what Schmitt would think (a lack of interest that I share) than in drawing on political theology to grapple with some problems that confound liberal analyses of political interest.</p>
<p>Importantly, Kahn does not conflate popular sovereignty with democracy. The will of the popular sovereign is not identical to the statistical majority of people who happen to participate in the electoral process; it is a more elusive force, which Kahn locates in what he calls “the American political imaginary.” It is “the people” that authorizes the revolutionary violence that founds the state, and that then speaks through a constitutional legal framework that ensures that democratic institutions function only within the parameters set by an original sovereign decision outside of all ordinary law. One example of this phenomenon would be judicial review: “While the Court likes to appeal the rule of law to legitimate its exceptional role, political theology suggests that we look in a different direction: to the Court’s capacity to speak in the voice of the popular sovereign.” Ironically, then, the sovereign voice of “We the People” limits what the demos can decide.</p>
<p>Part of what makes this “political theology” is that the Constitution was produced and adopted in a state of exception and thus depends upon no prior legal norms. According to Kahn, the self-referential authority draws support from an imaginary that worships “‘self-evident truths’ set forth in the name of ‘We the People.’” It is an open question, however, how much this theological analysis tells us about American history. Jason Stevens, for instance, raises some important objections to Kahn’s use of historical evidence. <a title="Paul Kahn's mis-prognosis of America's social imaginary << The Immanent Frame"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/08/22/paul-kahns-mis-prognosis-of-americas-social-imaginary/" >As Stevens argues</a>, “Kahn’s ‘genealogical’ technique yields no evidence persuading me that American political ideas <em>originate in</em> and are <em>indebted to</em> theological sources.” And I agree that, in his enthusiasm to explain so many aspects of the American political imaginary, Kahn occasionally lets slip historical claims that his methodology cannot support.</p>
<p>Genealogy, however, is not supposed to be a reliable method for getting to the facts of the matter of historical origins. Rather, a genealogical approach traces the selective reimaginings of the past that help to make self-evident the assumptions that pervade discursive or epistemic logics. For example, we know that the current vogue for Constitutionalism has little to do with reflection upon the actual historical circumstances that produced the document that is, perhaps, the quintessential text of bourgeois liberal democracy. For some reason, Tea Party revolutionary rhetoric has persuaded many Americans that it embodies a lost vitality that was present at the moment of foundational violence. One corollary of this view is that the ordinary political institutions established in the wake of the Revolution  have a diminished authenticity. The fact that such a sentiment continues to play a strong role in the imagination of sovereignty testifies to its persistence as a matter of belief and, in this sense, might be an example of the kind of secularized theology that Kahn draws on Schmitt to discuss.</p>
<p>My own quibble with Kahn is that, given his focus on the forces that compel obedience to the law, he underestimates the prominence of persistent hostility to the government in the way in which Americans imagine their revolutionary past. Take, for instance, the following statement:  “Americans―apart from the experience of the Confederacy―have not had to think much of capitulation, but they have never abandoned the idea of themselves as the inheritors of revolution. They intuitively understand that law is the product of revolution. Law and revolution together constitute the frame of our political imaginary.” Yes, though it may be that the experience of the Confederacy is more than just an aberration from the norm but, instead, a vigorous and persistent strain in American life that equates popular sovereignty with states’ rights, white supremacy, and the threat of armed insurrection against a tyrannical State. As Sanford Levinson <a title="Not for the squeamish << The Immanent Frame"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/09/23/not-for-the-squeamish/" >has also noted</a>, reserving the right to overthrow the government by force of arms draws on an implicit view of sovereignty whereby each householder decides on the state of exception. When Tea Party Patriots warn of “second amendment remedies” against an overreaching government, they insist that the final decision on when to suspend the law is made, not by the State, but by the armed American household. For this reason, threatening bloody violence against the State is seen, not as treasonous, but as a hyper-patriotic defense of popular sovereignty and a direct link to the authentic revolutionary violence that founded the nation. In this view, popular sovereignty refers, not to democratic policymaking, but to the right of the people—and not the government—to decide on the exception.</p>
<p>Asserting that the citizenry has the right to violently overthrow the government has nothing to do with any political or legal reality. As Kahn points out, “We no longer imagine violence among ourselves as a political possibility.” This is a fair point in that mere threats of violence would not necessarily be relevant to Kahn’s or Schmitt’s political theology, because rhetoric does not matter unless it has the genuine potential to become a decision that would then form the basis for real action. Following this logic, discussion of violent revolution absent the practical possibility of revolutionary violence might be interesting for some kinds of political analysis, but it would not extend to the question of sovereignty. And to the extent that it is hard to imagine an insurrection that could meaningfully threaten the armed forces of the United States, Tea Party rhetoric might simply be confused.</p>
<p>But it is nonetheless important not to underestimate the persistent preparation for armed insurrection in American life, inasmuch as it is deeply ingrained in the national narrative. For example, Kahn notes: “Popular history is shaped by a narrative of the successful use of violent force against enemies, within and without the nation. Much of this past remains vivid in our political imaginations, endlessly reinforced by both popular media and scholarly work. Americans take their families to Valley Forge and Gettysburg, and even to Omaha Beach.” Okay, but the message delivered at Gettysburg is decidedly different from that which one receives at Valley Forge and Omaha Beach. And Civil War battlefield memorials do not demonize the enemy so much as tell a story of “brother against brother.” In this narrative of an internally divided household, one army was defeated on the battlefield, but both sides nevertheless lay claim to the American heritage.</p>
<p>To take another example of how the legacy of the Confederacy participates in the national imaginary, D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film <em>Birth of a Nation</em> presents the period of Reconstruction after the Civil War as a crisis of democratic sovereignty in which a disenfranchised white minority struggles under the supposed tyranny of African American rule. In one scene, before avenging the death of a white woman who took her life rather than submitting to the amorous advances of a newly uniformed African American soldier, the film’s protagonist performs a sinister ritual involving a Confederate flag and a fiery cross. The title card that precedes the scene reads: “Brethren, this flag bears the red stain of a life of a southern woman, a priceless sacrifice on the altar of an outraged civilization.” After performing this ritual, Klansmen capture and lynch the African American soldier. In other words, extra-legal violence rectifies the crisis of sovereignty brought about by Reconstruction. Within the logic of the film, lynching, as the exemplary form of aestheticized racial violence that exists apart from the normal legal order, performs the signifying work of giving birth to a new nation. Seeking to recover democratic institutions tied to a white biopolitical subject, such violence drew its force from passions outside of the juridical legitimacy of the State. In a way, this relates to Kahn’s observation that: “The closest thing we have today to the sacral-monarch’s power to create the exception to law may not be the executive pardon but jury nullification, which is best seen as a localized expression of the popular sovereign willing the exception.” On this point, it is important to keep in mind that one of the most visible forms of jury nullification has been the refusal to find guilty perpetrators of extra-legal violence, which corroborates perpetrators’ own experience of lynching as the authentic exercise of popular sovereignty in the face of ineffectual legal due process.</p>
<p>As two examples of the willingness of white householders to “take the law into their own hands,” lynching and armed revolt both share in the belief that the suspension of ordinary legal institutions can be required for the sake of the direct exercise of popular sovereignty. This leads to a reading of the Second Amendment as a kind of self-destruct button that allows people guns as a check against tyranny. Of course, this interpretation is historically absurd in many ways. As Garry Wills points out, in his <a title="Gary Wills | A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government (2002)"  href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/Necessary-Evil/Garry-Wills/9780684870267"  target="_blank" ><em>A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government</em></a>, this interpretation ignores that in attempting to form a “more perfect union”the Constitution is a set of democratic guidelines and procedures that was adopted by an already existing polity in the interest of better governing itself.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the vision espoused by current Constitutional fundamentalists is far better articulated in the Articles of Confederation that the Constitution was meant to replace. One increasingly prominent method of resolving the problem is to read the Tenth Amendment in such a way as to make the Constitution an only slightly revised version of the Articles. Thus, Tea Party Constitutionalism notes the similarity between the Tenth Amendment and Article Two of the Articles of Confederation, which states: “Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this confederation, expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.” This reading essentially argues that, while the Constitution adopted a new set of procedures for democratic deliberation, it reaffirmed the same conception of sovereignty as enshrined in the Articles of Confederation. This then leads to the conclusion that any liberal jurisprudence that has ignored the Tenth Amendment has distorted the text of the Constitution. Following this reasoning, the Constitution prescribes the rules and framework for democratic institutions but restricts the decision-making scope of those same institutions to a narrow window of government action.</p>
<p>One obvious objection to what I’m saying is that many who strongly endorse Second Amendment rights also deify the American military and, in this way, show their loyalty to the State. One of the cornerstones of Kahn’s critique of liberal self-interest is his reminder that the State can demand the sacrifice of life. As he notes: “The popular sovereign can always demand a life; it can demand of all citizens that they kill and be killed for the state. The fundamental character of the relationship of citizen to sovereign is not contract&#8212;as in the social contract&#8212;but sacrifice.” But how are such sacrifices really understood?  To remind Americans that they sacrifice their lives for the State sounds like a provocation, a deliberate profanation of a cherished ideal of American citizenship. Americans do not die for the State; they die for their fellow soldiers, their families, their communities, and their nation.</p>
<p>So what accounts for unquestioning loyalty to the military among the same people who also entertain the possibility of armed insurrection?  One answer is that the rhetoric of the Confederacy that calls for cuts in government spending and ridicules the bureaucratic waste, inefficiency, and incompetence of public institutions does not direct this criticism at the defense budget <em>because</em> <em>the military is not a part of the government</em>. As odd as this might sound, it might be one of the few points of relative consensus in the current American political climate. While conservatives uncouple the military and the State in their calls to shrink the government, progressive liberals often see defense spending as a destructive and wasteful drain on resources that otherwise would be directed toward the public good.</p>
<p>To be clear, not all Americans who have defended the Second Amendment have understood it as a check against government tyranny. For that matter, I am not saying that the national imaginary of this country has historically been uniformly anti-government. At times, on the contrary, populist movements have sought to empower the people by expanding democratic institutions. However, such movements sometimes (although not always) imagine the people as an organically unified body politic and seek to shore up perceived sources of shared identity. Such populist sentiments, especially those that imagine America as a white, Christian nation, can quickly swell in the face of the perceived loss of national integrity perpetuated by liberal reform that extends the benefits of American citizenship beyond the scope of the white household. This in turn leads to nostalgia for a lost nation as the grounds for abandoning political loyalty to the State. The reason that the conceptual vocabulary of political theology might be helpful here is that such movements make extensive use of the language of popular sovereignty.</p>
<p>Within the narrative of American political decadence and lost revolutionary vitality, the 2008 election only confirmed for many what they felt to be decades of wresting government from the hands of the authentic American people in favor of a tyrannical welfare state that reappropriates resources and distributes them to parasitic others by way of inefficient and decadent bureaucrats who despise Christian freedom. What liberals see as differences over policy that can, so they hope, be resolved through discussion, reason, negotiation, and compromise are felt by many Americans to express a crisis of sovereignty that calls for resistance to all practical measures of federal governance in favor of states’ rights and a protection of the sanctity of the home as the ultimate source of national legitimacy.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/09/26/taking-theology-seriously/"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/american-grace/" ><img hspace="7"  vspace="2"  align="right"  class="alignright"  title="American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010)"  src="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/American-Grace2.jpg"  alt=""  width="164"  height="250"   style="float:right; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px;"/></a>American Grace</em> is the rare sort of book that gratifies and challenges the reader at the same time. Many scholars will be glad to confirm long-standing hunches in the results of the authors’ 2006 and 2007 Faith Matters surveys: women, African-Americans, rural Americans, and Southerners have more active religious lives than others; church attendance levels are gradually dropping, even among evangelicals; increasing numbers of Americans across all traditions are marrying outside their own religion. Robert Putnam and David Campbell have also turned up a few surprises that subvert conventional wisdom. Their data suggest that higher education levels track with higher religious observance, and slightly more evangelicals than mainline Protestants think that the government bears primary responsibility for the welfare of the poor. But <em>American Grace</em> is not just an intriguing collection of statistics. Putnam and Campbell synthesize this morass of bar graphs, factor scores, and “quintiles of religiosity” to argue that at the center of twenty-first-century American religion lies a paradox—one that should challenge scholars to rethink their assumptions. This may mean reconsidering the explanatory power of that embarrassing old crone of the religious studies family, the fading relation to whom we owe so much, but whom many of us would prefer to commit to the rest home for the balance of her natural life: Protestant theology.</p>
<p>To Putnam and Campbell, the grand irony of their data is this: in a time of unprecedented religious and political polarization, America is more pluralistic and tolerant than ever before. The authors build on Robert Wuthnow’s assessment of the “restructuring of American religion” along political rather than denominational lines in the decades after World War II, and their study pursues many of the familiar themes of the “culture wars” that James Davison Hunter began exploring twenty years ago. Their telling of post-war American cultural history will provoke quibbles from specialists, but the basic storyline of <em>American Grace </em>is sound: the social revolutions of the 1960s set in motion a series of cultural reactions and counter-reactions that have left Americans increasingly polarized over whether or not to impose the authority of holy scripture over one another’s lives, particularly in their bedrooms. That polarization accelerated in the 1980s, and since then frequent churchgoers across all traditions have been more and more likely to favor conservative politics. At the same time, the “moderate religious middle is shrinking,” and growing numbers of Americans are disavowing the rule of organized religion altogether. When pollsters ask these people to describe their religious affiliation, they answer “none”—and they tend to vote Democratic. Despite this widening chasm, the country is not perched on the precipice of religious war. On the contrary, Americans seem to be getting along rather well, and have more and better relationships with people of different faiths. How can this be the case?</p>
<p>This state of affairs suggests that the reality of religion in America may be outpacing the categories and assumptions of those who study it. What, for example, are scholars to make of the “nones” who fervently declare that they still believe in God? And what about all those Americans who not only host summer barbecues with neighbors of different faiths, but also nonchalantly shrug that those neighbors might very well end up in heaven too? The Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) takes the unequivocal position that a “horrible doom” awaits “all those who do not believe in Jesus.” Church leaders practically rent their garments upon hearing that 86 percent of Missouri Synod Lutherans told pollsters that “a good person who is not of their faith could indeed go to heaven.” When Martin Luther proclaimed the priesthood of all believers, this is not what he had in mind. It’s enough to make any scholar wonder if creeds, confessions, and statements of faith are obsolete.</p>
<p>What, in heaven’s name, is going on here? Is the country marching inexorably toward—dare I use that vexed word—secularization? Is America merely in a trough of unbelief something like the fallow period that American churches experienced in the late eighteenth century, soon to rebound in the fervor of revival? Or are human beings, since time immemorial, simply inconsistent creatures?</p>
<p>The answer might be none, or all, of the above—no survey can tell us for sure. What we need is a bird’s eye view, and that requires taking theology seriously, and considering a longer view of the history of Western civilization than any sociological survey can provide.</p>
<p><em>American Grace</em> adopts a position of respectful skepticism toward theology. The authors dutifully reproduce the questionnaire of “measures of theological belief and religious commitment” included in their survey, but they express surprise that many Americans “have stable views on such seemingly arcane theological issues” as whether a person is saved by faith or by their own good deeds. (Calling this fundamental question “arcane” is a bit like expressing confusion at that obscure rule in baseball that allows a player to score a run by crossing home plate.) Americans might be reluctant to condemn a non-believing friend to eternal hellfire, but this emotional ambivalence does not necessarily mean that they take theological matters lightly.</p>
<p>In fact, survey respondents overwhelmingly ranked theology as the most important reason for switching churches—liturgy or worship style was the second-most important, and political reasons were the least important. Yet Putnam and Campbell seem to conclude that this means theology has become a vessel for politics in disguise. To religious people of all faiths, issues like sexual morality and abortion are not simply, or even primarily, political questions. God has expressed an opinion—and that means that these are theological matters. By asserting that American evangelicals’ primary ambition is their “desire to convert sexual morality into public policy,” the authors obscure the bigger picture. The culture wars are not just about sex and social norms: they represent a contest between those Americans who locate ultimate authority in God and a traditional reading of scripture, and those who believe the freedom of individual choice trumps the dictates of some bearded old man in the clouds.</p>
<p>Putnam and Campbell are hardly alone in their doubts about theology’s role in elucidating American religious life. In their zeal for interdisciplinary breadth, today’s scholars of religion are so eager to pay due respect to political science, economics, gender and race theory, cognitive psychology, and other fields that they sometimes overlook theology as an explanatory factor in human affairs. The religious studies crowd is particularly sensitive about the Protestant bias that has saturated the discipline ever since its origins in missionaries’ efforts to study and convert the heathen. We have spent much energy flagellating ourselves for our semi-conscious Protestant frame of mind—our focus on belief at the expense of practice; our search for coherent intellectual systems defined by Enlightenment standards; our blinkered emphasis on the individual over the community. Our efforts to eradicate that prejudice have left theology all the more passé. Putnam and Campbell, for their part, worry about the possibility that their survey might have selected for religious attributes that are distinctly or predominantly Protestant. They point out that their polls diagnosed religiosity just as accurately in British Muslims as among American evangelicals (though it’s worth noting that British Muslims might not be the best control subjects, since they live and worship in a society still groggy with a Protestant hangover).</p>
<p>The trouble, however, is that it’s not just the ivory tower of religious studies that operates in a Protestant framework. As <a title="Posts by Tracy Fessenden"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/fessenden/" >Tracy Fessenden</a> and others have pointed out, a “Protestant consensus,” a civil religion based in the premises of the Reformation, still saturates American society. Despite the proliferation of Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and “nones” in modern America, I wonder whether <em>American Grace</em> is telling us that America, if not officially a Protestant nation by established church or creed, is still evolving along a historical trajectory that one can trace back to the <em>95 Theses</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>American Grace</em>, the internal contradictions of Protestantism are front and center. On one side of the cultural divide that the authors describe, conservative Americans’ views on sexual morality stem from their respect for traditional authority and a distrust of human nature rooted in the Protestant emphasis on humankind’s irreparable depravity. Yet that other fundamental principle of the Reformation—individual freedom of conscience—has found its most extreme expression in America’s free marketplace of religion, the country’s founding narrative of individual liberty, and a political culture that allows little deviation from the tenets of classical Enlightenment liberalism. Many religious Americans would say that they have no king save the Lord of scripture—but if the God of the Bible is king, then individual conscience is his formidable royal consort.</p>
<p>Pollsters’ growing tally of “nones”—those Americans who have thrown off the demands of organized religion but still believe in some kind of God—represent the palace coup, the triumph of individual conscience as ultimate authority. This is a conflict driven, not by doctrinal nitpicking, but by the basic question of intellectual authority in human society. The “nones” may not fit neatly into scholars’ preexisting categories, but one thing is certain: they are heirs of the Reformation who have taken Luther’s courageous stand to its logical conclusion. The nineteenth-century Presbyterian theologian B.B. Warfield once observed that “the Reformation, inwardly considered, was just the ultimate triumph of Augustine’s doctrine of grace over Augustine’s doctrine of the church.” The American experiment might just turn out to be the triumph of Luther’s doctrine of free conscience over his doctrine of human nature—though the battle is far from over.</p>

A truly adequate response would undoubtedly require a book at least as long as Kahn’s own. Instead, I want to offer some comments playing off of some of Kahn’s own observations. Indeed, as Kahn makes clear, his own book is meant to be, not a genuine exegesis of Schmitt’s (in)famous book, but rather his own reflections that have been stimulated by taking the concept of “political theology” seriously. I find Kahn convincing that the concept draws not only on the notion of “sovereignty,” insofar as it is transferred from God to those who claim “leadership” of the state, particularly when it is faced with existential threats, but also on the important reality of “sacrifice.” As he notes, the liberal tradition going back at least to Hobbes has literally no way of explaining why anyone would give his/her life “for the state,” given that the purpose of the state is to protect the individual’s security. Hobbes notably denied that a criminal sentenced to capital punishment has any obligation to accept his fate without attempting to escape. (The state, to be sure, has no duty to honor such an escape, but that is an assertion of state power rather than an argument that the prisoner is obliged to submit to his fate without challenge.) The Schmittian (and Kahnian) state, therefore, is not for the squeamish.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many ways of reading Schmitt, depending, I suspect, on the reasons that one is led to Schmitt in the first place (and the particular texts from Schmitt’s long and prolific career that one wishes to emphasize). Kahn treats Schmitt primarily as a jurisprude and political philosopher. Although he is well aware of Schmitt’s biography, including, obviously, his fateful alliance with Hitler and the Nazi Party in the 1930s, he focuses on the enduring importance of Schmitt’s ideas for those of us who, almost a century later, are struggling to think about the meaning of “law” and, more particularly, the degree to which law allows for human freedom. That freedom is captured, most expansively, in the idea of “sovereignty,” i.e., the ability to transcend or transgress legal commands when the situation warrants. One will find in Kahn’s book no discussion of the tortured politics of Weimar Germany, nor of Schmitt’s brilliant critique of parliamentary democracy. Anyone whose interest in Schmitt derives at least in part from worries about the “Weimarization” of American politics in the twenty-first century will find little in this book of interest. On the other hand, if one agrees, as I do, that Schmitt is one of the key jurisprudential thinkers of the twentieth century, Kahn’s meditations are catnip (or caviar). One can only hope that the book gets the wide readership—and, more to the point, discussion—that it deserves.</p>
<p>Very near to the beginning of his meditations, Kahn writes that “Rawls and his followers never took seriously the violence of the state.” The fact that for half a century we lived under the threat of “[m]utual assured destruction never appears within liberal political theory. . . . The defense policies of the United States are always seen as somehow exceptional—more transitional arrangements than expressions of national identity,” or, one might say, than an essential feature of the polity. Thus, he writes, “If we are to understand state violence as no less an expression of political identity than law, we must take a perspective upon ourselves other than that offered by liberal political theory. We must take up the perspective of political theology, for political violence has been and remains a form of sacrifice.” Indeed, writes Kahn in the conclusion to his book, “Not reason but decision describes that most characteristic of all political acts: killing and being killed for the state.”</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that Kahn has also written one of the most probing—and troublesome—meditations on torture (<em><a title="Paul W. Kahn | Sacred Violence: Torture, Terror, and Sovereignty (2008)"  href="http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=336363"  target="_blank" >Sacred Violence: Torture, Terror, and Sovereignty</a></em>), nor is it coincidental that one finds in that title the keywords of his new book. But note one important difference between torture and, say, “mutual assured destruction,” or the encouragement of citizens, whether through conscription or through a “volunteerism,” to join the armed forces. Torture is quintessentially directed against the other (and the Other). Indeed, I have <a title="Sanford Levinson | Slavery and the Phenomenology of Torture | Social Research (2007)"  href="http://socialresearch.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,8,11;journal,17,37;linkingpublicationresults,1:119739,1"  target="_blank" >elsewhere argued</a> that the essence of torture is ultimately less the infliction of any given technique of torture (e.g., waterboarding, sleep deprivation, etc.) than the creation of a phenomenology akin to that of slavery, in which, as in Chief Justice Taney’s notable claim in <em>Dred Scott, </em>the person tortured “has no rights that those doing the torture must respect.” It is the abject denial of the most basic claim of liberal political theory, that all individuals possess some ineluctable (and inalienable) body of rights that cannot legitimately be transgressed.</p>
<p>One can certainly speak of torture as a mode of sacrifice, but only as one comparable to the sacrifice of animals, rather than that which Kahn has in mind. (And, of course, one is free to evoke the <em>Akedah</em>—the submission by Abraham to God’s sovereign command to slay Isaac, which is prevented only by God’s arbitrary decision to substitute a helpless ram for the equally helpless son.) The sacrifice suggested by “mutual assured destruction” or by service in the armed forces, however, is the willingness, <em>contra </em>Hobbes, to give up one’s own life on behalf of the sacred cause. I am old enough to remember when it was accepted as a self-evident truth that one would rather be “dead than red,” which meant nothing less than that one accepted the legitimacy of the threat to obliterate the entire world rather than accept surrender to the Communist menace. It is <em>that </em>willingness that Kahn is at pains to explain through his explication of political theology. “For Americans,” Kahn writes, “the rule of law is not that which eliminates the need for the violent defense of the nation, but that for the sake of which violence is deployed.” He also refers to “our easy recourse to violence, and our willingness to sacrifice,” which includes, crucially, not only the lives of the victims of American violence, but also some number of those who inflict the violence in the first place.</p>
<p>These are fundamental questions, well worth the emphasis that Kahn places on them. I want to suggest, however, that one important facet of “American exceptionalism” is its denial that violence is the unique prerogative of the state. Here, we must confront the specter of Max Weber. The great German sociologist, who died just as Weimar was coming into being, for better or worse, appears in Kahn’s book, but only as the theorist of an ultimately freedom-killing notion of bureaucracy (notably described by Weber as an “iron cage”) that, if operating according to at least ideal-typical norms, would successfully suppress any notion of creativity and personal discretion in favor of rigid adherence to the norms of law. It should be clear that Kahn finds such a vision dystopian in the extreme, and there are many eloquent paragraphs celebrating the priority of existential self-creation over submission to generalized norms.</p>
<p>But Weber is also famous for defining the state as possessing a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence (which could, presumably, range from ordinary policing to torture to sending ICBMs across the skies to Moscow—or, perhaps, Tehran). It should be clear, however, that this is a highly controversial assertion, whether one treats it empirically or normatively. Quite obviously, as an empirical matter, any revolutionary (or “insurgent”) political movement rejects the state’s exclusive prerogative to decide when recourse to violence is legitimate; at the same time, such movements make normative arguments as to why their rejection of the state’s putative monopoly is itself legitimate. The United States itself owes its foundation to a violent revolution in which “patriots” defined themselves as “<a title="T. H. Breen | American Insurgents, American Patriots (2010)"  href="http://us.macmillan.com/book.aspx?isbn=9780809024797"  target="_blank" >insurgents</a>.” Moreover, the constitutional order established in 1787 professes to rest on the bedrock of popular sovereignty (“we the people”), a shared interest of Schmitt and Kahn alike inasmuch as it suggests the ability of “the people,” even if viewed normally as a sleeping giant, to awaken and exercise its sovereign capacity to transform the existing order. After all, many American state constitutions included explicit recognition of the right of the people to “alter or abolish” existing government whenever they thought it desirable to do so.</p>
<p>One might hope that alteration or abolition would be peaceful, but that is contingent, among other things, on the willingness of those in power to accept (and submit to) the “winds of change” instantiated in popular movements or uprisings. If they resist, and invoke the state’s purported “monopoly of violence,” they may discover that many of “the people” have something else in mind, including recourse to their own means of violence, however obtained.</p>
<p>The American approach to the means of violence is especially interesting, though, inasmuch as the Second Amendment to the Constitution, however one interprets it, appears to deny the Weberian monopoly at the very least to the <em>national </em>government and, if one has a latitudinarian interpretation, even to state governments as well. The Supreme Court, in its <a title="Supreme Court of the United States | McDonald v. Chicago (2009)"  href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf"  target="_blank" >recent</a> <a title="Supreme Court of the United States | District of Columbia v. Heller (2007)"  href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf"  target="_blank" >decisions</a> ostensibly concerning the Second Amendment, has made a complete hash of the Amendment’s <a title="H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel | The Militia and the Right to Arms (2002)"  href="http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=8118&amp;viewby=title"  target="_blank" >actual history</a>, inasmuch as the majority, including Justice Scalia, is clearly “<a title="Sanford Levinson | The Embarrasing Second Amendment | Yale Law Journal (1989)"  href="http://www.constitution.org/mil/embar2nd.htm"  target="_blank" >embarrassed</a>” by its civic-republican origins and its potential legitimization of an insurrectionary populace resisting what they believe to be political tyranny. Instead, the majority turns the Second Amendment into a protection of an individual right to protect oneself in one’s household against criminal depredations. I cannot help but wonder, then, whether Kahn agrees, not only that this is a colossal failure of intellectual nerve, but also that it represents a willful evasion of the violence and potential sacrifice—either of others or, ultimately, even of one’s self—that is suggested by any serious grappling with the notion of popular sovereignty and the “theology” underlying it.</p>

<em> &#8212;Paul Kahn, </em>Political Theology</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/political-theology-book-blog/" ><img hspace="7"  vspace="2"  align="right"  class="alignright"  title="Political Theology: Four New Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty (Columbia University Press, 2011)"  src="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kahn-cover2.jpg"  alt=""  width="218"  height="328"   style="float:right; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px;"/></a>At a moment when some of the theoretical gestures being inspired by old, new, or futuristic political theologies have become ineffective, Paul Kahn’s <em>Political Theology: Four New Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty</em> is a book of extraordinary significance. Or, perhaps I should say that I think it might be a book of extraordinary significance, inasmuch as it bears a potential to do something which has remained impossible, not only for Carl Schmitt, but also for some important contemporary critics of neo-liberal political economy. I want to reflect specifically about the way this impossibility might become possible, strangely, by way of a new migration of Abraham into the territory of philosophies of freedom and difference.</p>
<p>Throughout, Kahn constructs a stage on which is presented a complex encounter between a decidedly American revolutionary heritage, a deeply European critique of liberalism, and a repeated and self-conscious reflection on Jewish traditions. In this encounter, each figure appears bathed in mutually illuminating light, a situation which is much more difficult to stage than one might think. Just for a start, it would have been impossible for Schmitt himself to conjure a similar forcefulness for his ruminations on intractable questions of freedom with these three actors. A sporadic anti-Judaism and anti-Americanism endemic not only to Schmitt’s writings in the ‘20s but also to the larger conversation about legality, freedom, and authenticity in which his work participated saw to that.</p>
<p>Much more pressingly, however, Kahn’s inflection of questions about freedom and political constitution through Judaism, the American experiment, and classic European critiques of liberal political economy also seems to me something that recent brushes with political theology by Giorgio Agamben, Slavoj Žižek and Alain Badiou (to name three whose importance should not be denied) have not attained either.</p>
<p>In this first respect my hope is that Kahn’s constellation of figures could help to save for political thought something of an American revolutionary inheritance which seems otherwise to be very effectively disavowed by the dominance of liberal political philosophy in North America, namely, the ineluctable assertion of non-juridical forces which precede or exceed the forms of self-grounding imagined by representational politics. The redemption (so to speak) that Kahn’s work might afford occurs at one level by virtue of the fact that it remains faithful to this revolutionary heritage by likewise remaining faithful to thoughts also rooted in nineteenth-century European anti-capitalist movements. Here I note simply that convincing expositions of such mutually affecting fidelities are not forthcoming from thinkers who are never (or should never be) far from Kahn’s analysis of Schmitt, namely, Agamben, Žižek, and Badiou in their recent work. Kahn’s book is extraordinarily significant, therefore, because it signals—even incites—a certain need. Are there not too many students of the American revolutionary tradition stuck outside the particular rapprochement that Kahn’s work establishes so effectively with European critiques of liberalism?  Such students remain mired—just read the signs—in awkward jokes about Stalin (cf. Žižek), defensiveness about naming atrocities under Mao (cf. Badiou), or in a minimalist form of political speech burdened by neo-Heideggerian poetics (cf. Agamben). If there is a viable North American future for these critical theorists—and this is something we should struggle for—the ideas at work in their texts need to remain nourished by a singular fidelity to the American experiment. These three thinkers have all reflected more or less explicitly about what is “worth fighting for” in the Western theological inheritance. Kahn’s book also asks more pointedly, and to better effect: why is the American Revolution worth fighting for?</p>
<p>But these migrations of individuals and translations of political visions are all bound up with an equally interesting Auseinandersetzung with the figure of Abraham. Notice the call that Abraham receives within Kahn’s tableau. He is called not so much to leave his home among the nations. Nor is Abraham’s migratory passage through time and space (from inhabitant of the nations to sacrificial founder of a new community) of interest here as it was for the ancient Philo, obsessed as his text “on the migration of Abraham” was with a Platonic psychagogy from the sensuous to the ideal. On the contrary, the point of Abraham’s call in Kahn is much more focused, namely, to exemplify a founding principle, not only of a people but of all peoples. Recall Kahn’s Conclusion: no one (at least none of Us) escapes the Schmittian moment of Abraham’s sacrifice. And if, as the book argues throughout, phenomenological or existential attention to political constitution will effectively pierce the “states’s self-presentation as an efficient means of justly advancing welfare,&#8221; what Kahn’s analysis will glimpse through this phenomenological unveiling of the state form is, above all, a founding patriarch with a knife in his hand.</p>
<p>Kahn’s work exhorts that, “We should begin with a kind of phenomenology of the political, which is just what political theology must be today.&#8221; And, as mentioned above, in the Conclusion he suggests that, “We will not recover a theory adequate to the decision for and against life unless we turn from political theory to political theology. We must go back to the beginning and, for us, that is Abraham and Isaac.” Obviously, the We’s in question here are protreptic, open-ended, potentially otherwise. Of course, we might add, the We who must return to the figure of Abraham is plural, not one, certainly not already given in any factical sense. (This is not even to mention the multiple Abrahams we could discover back there at “the beginning.”) Kahn is certainly not unaware of any of this. He even pre-emptively responds to this pluralism throughout the book when he sometimes wonders at the multiplicity of founding irruptions of a force he nonetheless glosses under the one name of the “sacred.”</p>
<p>Against some of the other recent posts, however, I’d like to stir the pot by saying that the standard—even ideologically clichéd—issue of eliding difference is not really the pressing problem here. Rather, the problem for Kahn’s book is not that it will become a tyrannically limiting paradigm, eliding too many We’s who will not be interpellated by his repeated, invitational We. Nor is the issue that the Abraham to which We must return, the Abraham this We would call toward a migration into a new philosophical state, is also multiple. Is not the real issue, the real problem, precisely the opposite: whether there is—for a non-representational Us—an event which would enact a fidelity at once to the American Revolution, to European anti-capitalism, and to central figures of Jewish thought?  Is not the real issue, in other words, whether there is, for Us, something here—even a sacrifice—that We might believe in, and believe in as that which is in Us more than ourselves?</p>
<p>Kahn points out that Schmitt’s book had no conclusion and then appends one of his own, which asserts that contemporary political freedom cannot escape an encounter with Abraham. Fine. For the moment let’s accept what is only an invitation for thinking, after all. In reading the tale of Abraham in relation to Schmitt, Kahn even hints at the possibility of rendering God’s “I am that I am” as a kind of pressure immanent to existence rather than as a discretely transcendent substance. Good. In such a case, Abraham’s “Here am I” would be a kind of odd repetition of the biblical God’s “I am,” instead of an indication of a submission to or answer for an external other in any typical sense. Our return to Abraham could thus generate a new founding myth of repetition in which an obscurely excessive becoming emerges in Us as an affirmation that scrambles the usual calculations. This affirmation would more intimately unite what, in the biblical story, might otherwise be easily mistaken for discretely separate figures of God and Abraham, that exemplary cause-and-effect of revolution. Such an interpretive move would be comparable to <a title="Stanislas Breton | A Radical Philosophy of Saint Paul (2011)"  href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15104-7/a-radical-philosophy-of-saint-paul"  target="_blank" >Stanislas Breton’s efforts</a> to link a radicalized Althusserian interpellation to biblical accounts of calling.</p>
<p>But such a conclusion would only repeat a (democratized) Schmittian aporia, whereby a grounding sovereign exception emerges like a miracle to found a new community. The return to Abraham in this way serves only to repeat the essential thematic issue of the book in a new key. What I want is a conclusion in truth, and not from Schmitt but from Kahn—or, perhaps even better, from that still opaque site of freedom that is an Us yet to come. Is there a ‘belief’, an affirming Yes, which would construct a synthesis or found a communal space in which the faithful of the American Revolution, of European anti-capitalism, and of Judaism alike would recognize themselves, even if—necessarily—transfigured? Or, to return to the Abraham story, is there a viable transformation of the current state of the neo-liberal economic order which would be creative enough as to evoke this primal scene of violence?</p>
<p>In this respect, Kahn, like Schmitt—and perhaps more like the biblical text than he acknowledges—elides a conclusion. After all, Kahn’s conclusion is just a repetition of the book’s basic theoretical assertion, that (at least in this tradition) new political creations occur like the founding gesture of Abraham: before the law. But, detective that I am of religion’s past and future primal scenes, I am greedy to see filled out Kahn’s concluding, and perhaps prophetic, turn back toward the biblical tale. If revolutionary creation, for a protreptical or emerging Us, will bear an Abrahamic inflection, then what shall be that collective which an energetics of creation transformatively unites across readymade identitarian lines? And if this miracle of exception, or this fragile invention of possibility, begins to cut the umbilical links it bears in relation to old states and outmoded identity formations, then who or what might end up on our altar, the site through which creative affirmation will have been voiced?</p>
<p>In this sense, I find a productive—even protreptical—irony in the way Kahn’s book concludes with a repetition of the theoretical state of ideas about the ineluctable necessity of a founding sacrificial event (even if this thematic repetition is provocatively repeated by way of a biblical myth). And—pace the crazy and (therefore) perennially fecund tale of Abraham—in the conclusion we are still repeating theory rather than participating in the specifics of “existential and phenomenological” intensities Kahn earlier evoked as precisely the dagger with which to pierce through theoretical or merely representational discourses on political experience. To repeat Kahn’s premise against his own conclusion (and perhaps even against his own desire not to inhabit a normative discourse), if we are to pierce through the self-descriptions of the state and its current assemblage of identities with an actual experience of the political, we will do so only when we find ourselves naming the items missing from Kahn’s concluding repetition of the Abrahamic tableau, some of which I enumerated above. To name these otherwise elided or absent terms, and to affirm these names with a vibrancy which produces Us in their very affirmation, would of course be the transformation of Kahn’s exemplary political tract into a political experience. And here, fearing and trembling as usual over the specificities of the Abrahamic tale, is where our conclusion remains a merely thematic conclusion rather than the phenomenon of a new beginning. Reverberating throughout Kahn’s book, however, are the rustlings of a subterranean “here I am,” which might just yet expose Us to (and as) an occurrence of freedom from which our states, philosophies, and religions alike are currently constructed to shield us.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful book. I hope it yields more than is safe, and more than we hope for, we strange children of Abraham.</p>

Its 550 pages of text, plus 97 pages of appendices and notes, probe the range and complexity of contemporary American religiousness with remarkable patience and detail. No other book so thoroughly documents the polarization of religion (and politics) in America, from the irenic 1950s to the angry 1990s and 2000s, or charts the often complex and sometimes seemingly anomalous consequences that this transformation has had for contemporary American religion, politics, and culture.</p>
<p>Although <em>American Grace</em> doesn&#8217;t leave historians on the whirling dime, wondering &#8220;So what?&#8221; it does raise questions about historical context. In other words, how do the changes that Campbell and Putnam retrace fit three centuries of evolution in American religion, politics, and culture?</p>
<p><em>American Grace</em> is hardly without history. Its most sustained historical analysis occurs in the third chapter, &#8220;Religiosity in America: The Historical Backdrop.&#8221; A subheading outlines a principal point: &#8220;The 1950s: the high tide of civic religion.&#8221; Campbell and Putnam rightly caution against accepting some of the common enthusiasm about the purportedly ubiquitous religiosity of the 1950s, such as is suggested by Gallup polling data on church and synagogue attendance. But their main point is straightforward: &#8220;Virtually all experts agree, however, that the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s was one of exceptional religious observance in America&#8221;—the experts ranging from the historians Sydney Ahlstrom, Patrick Allitt, Maurice Isserman, Michael Kazin, and Uta Andrea Balbier to the ever-looming Will Herberg.</p>
<p>However, my sense is that &#8220;backdrop&#8221; well describes how history works in <em>American Grace</em>. The book isn&#8217;t historiography and wasn&#8217;t meant to be.  When it invokes history, often the point is to demonstrate religion&#8217;s continuing importance, as well as its new divisions, in America, the authors’ argument about religion&#8217;s contemporary centrality being supported by reference to patterns continuing from earlier decades. Consider the first pre-1950 historical reference, which concerns evangelicalism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evangelical Protestants comprise one of the most significant religious traditions in America—particularly for understanding change in American religion. Historian Mark Noll notes that evangelicalism dates as far back as the early eighteenth century, when a movement began within Protestantism to find a &#8216;true religion of the heart.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Campbell and Putnam describe evangelicalism as &#8220;the dominant strain within American Protestantism through most of the nineteenth century,&#8221; then raise the fundamentalist-modernist split that &#8220;spilled over into American society more generally.&#8221; But rather than illustrate change, my sense is that these references limn a comforting continuity, the &#8220;religion of the heart,&#8221; and even its divisions, remaining a primary mode of American religiosity.</p>
<p>Neither the concept of &#8220;religion&#8221; that informs <em>American Grace</em> nor longer-term historical patterns provoke much discussion. Campbell and Putnam shun theoretical issues: &#8220;One can quibble over just how religion, and religiosity, should be gauged.&#8221; They don&#8217;t. They seem, literally, to opt for Justice Potter Stewart&#8217;s &#8220;I know it when I see it&#8221; approach. &#8220;By any standard,&#8221; Campbell and Putnam write, &#8220;the United States (as a whole) is a religious nation.&#8221; So ends, or begins, their discussion; perhaps one might say that <em>American Grace</em> is itself a riff on the American meaning of &#8220;religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although history doesn&#8217;t operate by the &#8220;by any standard&#8221; approach here used for religion, the &#8220;backdrop&#8221; slant given it by Campbell and Putnam makes weak-kneed history. Their discussion of &#8220;civic religion&#8221; serves as an example. Unlike their operative concept of religion, they do define it, as the notion that &#8220;religion—or at least a belief in God—serves to bind the nation together,&#8221; and this stands at the center of their discussion of the 1950s. But the only discussion of civic religion before 1950 comes 400 pages later, on a single page that cites Robert Bellah citing Jefferson and Lincoln, along with some words on George W. Bush and Barack Obama, all essentially emphasizing a soothing continuity rather than a contested evolution.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s missing in <em>American Grace</em> is a sense of how the current polarization, or its development, from the seemingly peaceful 1950s to the antagonistic 1990s and 2000s, fits American historical patterns more generally. The references to both evangelicalism and civil religion implicitly stress continuity, with the authors’ emphasis on the &#8220;religion of the heart,&#8221; or on the importance of a broad commitment to a simple &#8220;belief in God,&#8221; both lasting from the eighteenth century into the twenty-first. Yet the history of American evangelicalism itself is as much one of anger, argument, schism, defeat, organization, dead-ends, and yes, triumph, which might well fit the diagnosis of polarization that Campbell and Putnam find alarming and claim to have developed mainly in the last twenty years. Yet, if we rethink the issue, American civil religion also wallowed in the anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Mormonism that created at least one American political party, deeply shaped others, and produced much violence, fire, murder directed against Catholics, Jews, and Mormons for many, many decades, even into the 1950s.</p>
<p>Because <em>American Grace</em> makes much of Campbell&#8217;s own Mormonism and contains ample discussions of contemporary Mormon belief and behavior, its approach to Mormon history is itself intriguing. Its account of Mormon origins bypasses the upheaval of the movement&#8217;s radical, polygamous, and harassed past. An acknowledgement that Mormons were &#8220;driven from place to place by persecutors&#8221; entices no detail, and a plain reference to &#8220;the death of Joseph Smith&#8221; raises no mention of his brutal assassination by a Missouri mob. Instead, this &#8220;backdrop&#8221; jumps to the triumphant present and Mormonism&#8217;s status as a &#8220;global church some 13.5 million strong,&#8221; whose &#8220;success at winning converts owes largely to its strongly evangelical spirit.&#8221; Lacking is an account of Mormonism&#8217;s truly extraordinary transformation from polygamous, sometimes communitarian radicalism into the epitome of twentieth- and twenty-first century American political and religious conservatism. Is the intensity of contemporary Mormon conservatism in any way related to consciousness of Mormonism’s radical past, as though Mormons still needed to prove their cultural and Christian orthodoxy?</p>
<p>Even the seemingly simple issue of heaven unravels in the face of both history and theology. Campbell&#8217;s and Putnam&#8217;s polling data shows that Mormons are far ahead of any other religious group in believing that even non-Christians can enter heaven; 98% of Mormons—but only 83% of Catholics, 79% of mainline Protestants, 62% of black Protestants, and 54% of evangelical Protestants—hold such views. But the Mormon heavens and means of getting to them are remarkably different than those of other Christian groups. Only Mormons have held, since the 1840s, that heaven is complex, with &#8220;three degrees or kingdoms of glory,&#8221; and that Mormons may baptize the dead by proxy to provide the foundation for their entrance into heaven. These views and this history shape modern Mormon behavior. Mormons have collected birth and death records worldwide for a century, now in microfilm and digital form, and are the originators of the fabulous <em>Ancestry.com</em>, which provides access to more than five billion birth records—a gold mine for historians (it&#8217;s by far the best route to fully digitized U.S. census returns up to 1930), genealogists of all kinds, and Mormons verifying records for proxy baptism.</p>
<p>This history and this theology upend one of the seemingly innocuous questions Campbell and Putnam pose in <em>American Grace</em>—can even non-Christians enter heaven?—because the respondents simply don&#8217;t share the same understanding of &#8220;heaven.&#8221;  Mormons pointedly understand heaven differently than do other Christians, and they have a mechanism for getting even the dead there, of which others disapprove, most notably Jewish leaders, who have sometimes bitterly protested Mormon proxy baptism, especially of Holocaust survivors. (Campbell and Putnam do refer to Mormon &#8220;posthumous baptism&#8221; in an endnote, but one limited to Mormon convictions that theirs is the only true faith.)</p>
<p>Similarly, Campbell and Putnam do not systematically engage Catholic, mainline Protestant, black Protestant, and evangelical Protestant theologies of heaven.  For them, one might wonder if the issue has less to do with heaven than with reluctance to believe in hell, which Campbell and Putnam do discuss, and whose historical decline for Protestants was charted a long time ago, in D. P. Walker&#8217;s <em><a title="D.P. Walker | The Decline of Hel: Seventeenth-Century Discussions of Eternal Torment (1964)"  href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_decline_of_hell.html?id=xcSRAAAACAAJ"  target="_blank" >The Decline of Hell: Seventeenth-Century Discussions of Eternal Torment</a></em>. Of course, that would also seem to include the &#8220;nones,&#8221; the non-religious who might feel that if people go anywhere, it must be &#8220;heaven,&#8221; which our broad popular culture seems to think is good.</p>
<p>I admire the complexity and fascinating ethnographic excursions <em>American Grace</em> offers. I wish I could write as cleanly as Campbell and Putnam do across more than 500 pages. I appreciate the effort at keeping the big picture constantly in focus. At the same time, for a historian, <em>American Grace</em>&#8216;s many and complex &#8220;beliefs&#8221; float too free from their historical moorings, and not just because I like history, but because history is embedded in contemporary behavior—as in contemporary Mormon views on heaven—even when it doesn&#8217;t seem to be.  Maybe part of the general problem is taking the irenic 1950s as the departure point of its historical backdrop. We could debate whether or not the religious peacefulness of the 1950s is itself over-rated, but that&#8217;s a different discussion.  Instead, I would suggest that, even if the 1950s weren&#8217;t entirely peaceful, they may still have been the most unusual, and indeed relatively irenic, years in American religious history.</p>
<p>But for three centuries, tumult, disputation, and anger— i.e., &#8220;polarization&#8221; —characterized much of American religion. It is hard for a historian not to remember the hangings of Quakers in Boston in the 1660s, the jailing even of Quaker dissidents by other Quakers in Philadelphia during the Keithian schism of the 1690s, the suppression of much traditional African religious practice among enslaved Africans, even after emancipation, plus virulent American anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism, anti-Mormonism, and both polite and impolite ridicule of evangelical fundamentalism, to highlight only some of the contentious, polarizing substance of America&#8217;s long spiritual history.</p>
<p>Campbell and Putnam acknowledge this historical religious polarization on the penultimate page of <em>American Grace</em>. Yet they not only trumpet its rarity but assert that &#8220;from its founding, America has had religious toleration encoded in its national DNA.&#8221; Our DNA?  Here, the episodic, conditional past is annihilated in a paroxysm of essentialist rhetoric. Most historians would say that religious toleration emerged fitfully in America but certainly wasn&#8217;t present at its founding; it&#8217;s the point of William R. Hutchison&#8217;s <em><a title="William R. Hutchinson | Religious Pluralism in America: The Contentious History of a Founding Ideal (2003)"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-admin/yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300105162"  target="_blank" >Religious Pluralism in America: The Contentious History of a Founding Ideal</a></em>. We might hope it&#8217;s present now. But religiously based homophobia, anti-Muslim tension, and even the quietly continuing evangelizing of Mormons by Wisconsin Synod Lutherans suggest that America&#8217;s genetically assured triumph of religious toleration hasn&#8217;t yet arrived.</p>
<p>The religious polarization of our own and recent times, which Campbell and Putnam chart in such chewy ethnographic detail, is not at all &#8220;the same&#8221; polarization that began when England&#8217;s dissident Puritans joined gold-seeking Virginians to contest the land as well as the divine with American Indians, who themselves had long fought their own battles over both.</p>
<p>Yet maybe, in some very broad and general way, <em>American Grace</em> really announces, without saying so, &#8220;Welcome Back.&#8221;</p>

By speaking of a <em>crisis</em> of secularism, I exaggerate the problem, he says.</p>
<p>Tariq Modood and I have been in dialogue on secularism for over a decade now. He was among the few who very early on recognized the main point of my <a title="Rajeev Bhargava (ed.) | Secularism and Its Critics (1998)"  href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Secularism_and_its_critics.html?id=uJSCQgAACAAJ"  target="_blank" >1998 book</a>: that we need not an alternative to but an alternative conception of secularism, one that is different from mainstream conceptions shaped by French laïcité<em> </em>and the American wall of separation variant. Since we agree on much, I begin with stating where and how much we agree.</p>
<p>I agree with him (1) that most European states follow neither the French nor the American model. Virtually all European states have a stable regime of individual rights that includes the right to religious liberty. None could have managed to install such a regime without in the past attacking the power and privilege of their churches, a stridency which could not have been possible without some degree of state-church separation. Yet, unlike the French, there is no lingering hostility towards religion in other European state-structures.</p>
<p>The case in America is different. Although American churches had a legacy of enormous power and privilege, they left it behind in Europe. This is part of what Americanization means. So, American self-understanding has rarely exhibited hostility to religion. Yet, denominational conflict compelled the state to withdraw substantial support of religion, forming another key ingredient of American self-understanding. In Europe, however, hostility was followed by active support. Virtually all of Europe developed an institutional arrangement that grants some privilege or public recognition to a given church. Indeed, some states still have an established church, a privileged arrangement that goes well beyond recognition. Like me, Modood finds the combination of separation of church and state and support for a given church compatible with secularism. He calls it moderate secularism. I am indifferent to the term, but I agree (2) that this is a form of secularism. States that run in accordance with such a regime are secular states. Modood is also quite right that (3) there is no effective challenge from the church or radical secularists to this moderate political secularism. This may not be the best of all possible worlds from their points of view, and currently it might even be tilted in favour of secularists, but it is an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>Such is the context in which non-Christian migrants, the majority of which are Muslims, have been arriving, settling, and making claims that “relate to the place of religious identity in the public sphere.” Modood says and adds (4) that “it is here, if anywhere, that a sense of crisis of secularism can be found.” Our fourth straight agreement. Elsewhere I have written: “It is clear that secularism has a precarious life in non-western societies. What is not always obvious …is that the secular states underpinned by secularism are coming under strain even in Europe where only some time back they were believed to be firmly entrenched and secure.” I added: “It is true that substantive secularization of European societies has also brought in its wake extensive secularization of European states. Regardless of their religious affiliation, citizens have a large basket of civil and political rights unheard of in religion-centered states, past or present.” But still, problems remain. The migration from former colonies and an intensified globalization has <a title="Bryan S. Turner | Cosmopolitan Virtue: On Religion in a Global Age | European Journal of Social Theory (2001)"  href="http://est.sagepub.com/content/4/2/131.abstract"  target="_blank" >thrown together in western public spaces</a> pre-Christian faiths, Christianity, and Islam. The cumulative result is unprecedented religious diversity, the weakening of the public monopoly of single religions, and the generation of mutual suspicion, distrust, hostility, and conflict. This is evident <a title="Christine R. Baker | Church and State: Lessons from Germany? | The Political Quarterly (2004)"  href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-923X.2004.00599.x/abstract"  target="_blank" >in Germany</a>, probably even in <a title="Tariq Modood et al. | Multiculturalism, Muslims and Citizenship: A European Approach (2006)"  href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415355155/"  target="_blank" >Modood&#8217;s Britain</a>, but was  dramatically highlighted by <a title="John R. Bowen | Why the French Don't Like Headscarves: Islam, the State, and Public Space (2008)"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-admin/ee%20John%20Bowen,%20Why%20the%20French%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Like%20Headscarves:%20Islam,%20the%20State%20and%20Public%20Space%20(Princeton:%20Princeton%20University%20Press,%202007"  target="_blank" >the headscarf issue in France</a> and <a title="Ian Buruma | Murder in Amsterdam: Liberal Europe, Islam, and the Limits of Tolerance (2007)"  href="http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143112365,00.html?Murder_in_Amsterdam_Ian_Buruma"  target="_blank" >the murder of filmmaker Theo Van Gogh</a> in the Netherlands shortly after the release of his controversial film about Islamic culture.</p>
<p>So we both agree that the crisis of secularism is directly related to the arrival, predominantly, of Muslim immigrants in Europe. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Political secularism has been destabilized, and in particular the historical flow from a moderate to radical secularism and the expectation of its continuation has been jolted. This is not because of any Christian desecularization or a ‘return of the repressed.’ Rather, the jolt is created by the triple contingency of the arrival and settlement of a significant number of Muslims.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the language here. Political secularism, Modood says, was “destablized&#8221; and “jolted,” words hardly any different from “crisis,” for crisis too refers only to a critical turning point, one that can go either way, to recovery or mortality. It does not mean imminent death, an impression falsely given by Modood&#8217;s essay.</p>
<p>But let me not quibble over words. For we have another, fifth agreement to report. It lies in our joint hope that European secularism will respond to these changes. Europe can’t just go on with the same “moderate secularism” and jettison the problem. As Modood puts it, this secularism needs to be multiculturalized. I take this to mean that the historical compromises between church and state have to be extended to other religions, particularly to Islam. (I don&#8217;t disagree on this point, our sixth agreement) So, for him, Moderate secularism is a perfect ideal. Conceptually and normatively, all is well. It simply needs to be extended to other religions, a feat that can be accomplished by comparatively easy institutional adjustments. So, I must stand corrected. For Modood, moderate secularism can and should go on more or less as it is, but, in order to accommodate Muslims, must undergo some institutional adjustments. How then can we speak of—that horrible term—a <em>crisis</em> of secularism in Europe? Surely, this is hyperbolic, a gross exaggeration!</p>
<p>Here is where we profoundly disagree. Moderate secularism, for me, is irretrievably flawed. The multiculturalization of this secularism is neither easy nor sufficient. It is not easy because it presupposes massive change in cultural background. Institutional adjustment is bound to be difficult because an internal link exists between the collective, secular self-understanding of European societies and deeply problematic institutional arrangements. Quite plainly, current European institutions are deeply biased. They have accommodated Christians but will not be able accommodate Muslims. They are not sufficient because simple accommodation without some accompanying “hostility” may not work for all Muslim citizens.</p>
<p>Why are institutional adjustments difficult to achieve? Here we must take recourse to something missing in Modood’s account, namely, history. Using a broad brush, we might say that European secularisms arose in predominantly single-religion societies. Issues of radical individual freedom and citizenship equality arose in European societies <em>after </em>religious homogenization. The birth of confessional states was accompanied by massive expulsion of subject-communities whose faith differed from the religion of the ruler. Such states eventually found some place for toleration in their moral space, but as is well known, toleration was consistent with deep inequalities and with humiliating, marginalized, and virtually invisible existence. For instance, church buildings of minority religious groups could not look like churches and had to be tucked away in bylanes far from the High Street where the church of the dominant group stood.</p>
<p>The liberal-democratization and the consequent secularization of many European states has helped citizens with non-Christian faiths acquire most formal rights. But such a scheme of rights neither embodies a regime of interreligious equality nor effectively prevents religion-based discrimination and exclusion. Indeed, it masks majoritarian, ethno-religious biases.</p>
<p>The <a title="Jytte Klausen | The Islamic Challenge: Politics and Religion in Western Europe"  href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/RaceEthnicity/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199231980"  target="_blank" >new reality of deepening religious diversity</a> has brought the religious biases of European states into increasingly sharper relief. Despite all changes, European states have continued to privilege Christianity in one form or another. They have publicly funded Christian schools, maintained church real estate and clerical salaries, facilitated the control by churches of cemeteries, and trained the clergy. In short, there has been no impartiality within the domain of religion, and despite formal equality, this continues to have a far-reaching impact on the rest of society.</p>
<p>Thus, these biases are evident in different kinds of difficulties faced by Muslims. For example, in Britain a third of all primary school children are educated by religious communities, yet applications for state funding by Muslims are frequently turned down. Currently there are, <a title="Veit Bader | Secularism or Democracy? Associational Governance of Religious Diversity (2007)"  href="http://www.aup.nl/do.php?a=show_visitor_book&amp;isbn=9789053569993"  target="_blank" >Veit Bader informs us</a>, only five Muslim schools, compared to 2,000 run by Roman Catholics and 4,700 by the Church of England. Similar problems persist in other European countries. In both France and Germany, not a single school run by Muslims is subsidized by the state. This is also manifest in the failure of many Western European states to deal with the issue of headscarves (France), in demands by Muslims to build mosques and therefore to properly practice their own faith (Germany, Italy), in discrimination against ritual slaughter (Germany) or against the right to have proper Muslim burial grounds (Denmark, to take just one example). In recent times, as Islamophobia grips the imagination of several Western societies (exemplified by the cartoon controversy in Denmark and the Minarets issue in Switzerland), it is very likely that their Muslim citizens will continue to face disadvantages only on account of membership in their religious community.</p>
<p>Removing these biases will not be easy because of resistance from the Right, institutional resilience and differences in the nature of Islam and Christianity, not to speak of non-Semitic religions such as Hinduism. Moderate secularism will be severely tested. Indeed, that test has already begun, which is why talk of strain or even crisis is justified.</p>
<p>I have so far been talking as if the initiative lies squarely with only one agent, the European state (and its supporters), and Muslims will respond enthusiastically to any  initiative from this reformed (multiculturalized) state. But this is being too sanguine about the self-understanding of Muslims or their current condition in Europe. It underestimates their alienation and ghettoization. Only after we attain a better, deeper understanding of Muslims in different parts of Europe, can we learn about what should and should not be and what currently can and cannot be accommodated. Indeed, only in a more relaxed atmosphere can a plurality of voices—the more vulnerable voices included—emerge and be better heard, a change that will have a huge bearing on our collective judgment on what should and should not be accommodated. (As of now we hear two dominant voices—the ultra-orthodox and the lapsed Muslim, the latter a convert to radical secularism.) Indeed, a hearing of these diverse voices may necessitate not just accommodation but more active fostering of some hitherto unnoticed Muslim beliefs and practices or more negative state-intervention in others; it is entirely possible that the state may not only have to support some religious practices but also inhibit others. Now, European states may be only too happy to abort some Muslim practices, but such intervention will entail a massive shift in their conception of secularism—from that of separation followed by support of religion to one of separation followed sometimes by support and sometimes by an inhibition of religion, what I call <em>principled distance</em>. In short, the state may have to set aside its moderate (accommodative, not hostile to religion) stance. Currently, the practice of most European states towards Muslims is: offer little official support, no accommodation, and, with few exceptions, stay indifferent to massive societal intolerance. What might be required is more support to some Muslim practices, less to others, and active interference in societal intolerance—in short, an attempt by the state to tackle both inter- and intra-religious domination.</p>
<p>In sum, extending moderate (accommodative) secularism to Muslims, under existing conditions, will be very difficult, for it presupposes massive shifts in background cultural conditions for which Europe may not yet be prepared. Europe has not seen deep religious diversity for a very long time. It would not be too off the mark to say that not appreciating deep religious and cultural diversity is one of the central failures of modern Europe. To my knowledge, overcoming this is a bigger challenge than any other issue. By now, even the conceptual resources for such a change appear to be missing. In any case, moderate secularism’s accommodation will not be sufficient because the modern (democratic) state must have the legitimacy to also negatively intervene in some socio-religious practices, if only to protect the interests of vulnerable internal minorities. This in part entails abandoning moderate secularism. To respond to the challenge of deep diversity, Europe might be better off with an altogether different conception of secularism.</p>
<p>What I have said above needs some qualification, for it ignores two facts. First, it neglects the informal politics of state and non-state actors, where interesting changes might be occurring. Second, it does not take into account the existence of the European Constitution, which is very different from the constitutions of individual European states. I acknowledge the importance of both. These factors could make a substantial difference. But difficulties block progress in these sites too. First, nothing prevents individual states from ignoring the European Constitution. Will France, Belgium, or Italy listen to the EU if it declared the banning of the burqa to be unconstitutional?  The second point is particularly noteworthy. To make it, we need to make distinctions between (a) norms of secularism embedded in the informal politics of states (and non-state actors); (b) norms embedded in formal, institutional politics and articulated in representations and reflections found in laws enacted by legislatures, executive decisions, judicial pronouncements, and constitutional articles; and finally, (c) normative ideals governing the relationship between the state and religion expressed in doctrines, ideologies, and political theories.</p>
<p>I believe that the doctrinal, ideological, and theoretical formulations of Western secularism are by now highly restricted and inadequate as are the formal politics and laws inspired by these doctrines and ideologies. The rehabilitation of secularism is virtually impossible unless we reduce our reliance on these formal practices and formulations. These doctrines and theories have become part of the problem, hurdles to properly examining the issues at stake. They include French <em>laicite</em> and the American wall of separation model, as well as the formal, institutional political practices of most European states. If we continue to remain in the grip of these formulations and practices, we would simply not notice other conceptions that have probably been pushed into the background. Once we have shifted away from these and start to focus on the normative, informal practices of a broader range of Western and non-Western states, we shall see that better forms of secular states and much more defensible versions of secularisms are available. This requires an anthropology of secular practices of Western and non-Western political actors, from which Modood’s moderate secularism is galaxies removed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" ><strong> *  *  *</strong></p>
<p><em>NS: Can you say a bit about what you’re hoping to tell us with</em> Religion in Human Evolution<em>?</em></p>
<p>RB: The purpose of the book is to show how deeply historical&#8212;beyond what we normally think of as history, or even prehistory&#8212;and how biological human religion is. We have to understand ourselves as a part of the narrative of evolution. And evolution never stops. The notion that human evolution at some point stopped and “history” took over is absurd, though it is widespread among various social scientists and humanists.</p>
<p><em>NS: Reaching so far back in time, how did you go about marking your story’s beginning?</em></p>
<p>RB: The advent of helpless infants who require intensive, long-term parental care as long as 200 million years ago is an absolutely critical first step. I don’t say that religion appears there, but without it the religious culture that appears much later just isn’t possible. Think about it. The central icon of Catholic Christianity is mother and child. That motif is so deep in not just our human experience but in our animal, biological past. For much of evolutionary history, the period of helplessness was very brief. Most animals become autonomous and able to fend for themselves very quickly. Reproduction comes in a matter of months for many mammals. In larger and more complex mammals, the period of parental care grew longer and longer. There was a quantum leap among the great apes, and with us it became really long. Imagine, an animal that can’t take care of itself until age 21! It’s a weird thing, biologically. But it allows for the development of what the ethologist<strong> </strong>Gordon Burghardt calls the “relaxed field”; relieving the more brutal pressures of the struggle for existence and opening the possibility for a great deal of experimentation, creativity, and innovation.</p>
<p><em>NS: And what about the story’s end?</em></p>
<p>RB: The book actually ends two thousand years ago, and some people may wonder why I would do that. Christianity and Islam aren’t even in it. Between you and me, I’m so glad they’re not, because I don’t have to fight any stupid battles of the culture wars. But the real reason it ends there is that life is finite. I just couldn&#8217;t get through the last two thousand years without writing two volumes, and that was more than I could imagine, but I hope to write a smaller book dealing with the recent past.</p>
<p><em>NS: Still, you insist, almost as a refrain, that “nothing is ever lost.” What does that mean about the connection between this distant past and the present?</em></p>
<p>RB: “Nothing is ever lost” means that what we are now goes all the way back through natural history. We are biological organisms and not simply computerized brains. By focusing totally on the present, thinking only about science and computers, and forgetting four billion years of life on this planet, we are losing perspective on who and what we are. We’re running great risks of doing things that will not be good for us. The cost can be very high indeed if we reach the point where we can’t adapt to our own increasingly rapid adaptations. We run the risk of early extinction. So this certainly isn’t a triumphalist story, but it is trying to get at what, in the very long run, leads to the amazing creatures that we are.</p>
<p><em>NS: How would you characterize the progress of your own thinking between the 1964 “<a title="Robert N. Bellah | Religious Evolution | American Sociological Review (1964)"  href="http://hirr.hartsem.edu/bellah/Religious%20Evolution%20by%20Robert%20N.%20Bellah%20--%20American%20Sociological%20Review%2029,%20no.%203,%20pp.%20358-374..pdf"  target="_blank" >Religious Evolution</a>” paper and </em>Religion in Human Evolution<em>?</em></p>
<p>RB: Well, that paper was one of the first things I ever wrote. Actually, the first draft of it was written when I was a postdoctoral student at McGill around 1955. In the back of my mind, religious evolution was the thing I cared about most. It always structured my most frequently-given and most well-received undergraduate course on the sociology of religion. I referred to evolution from time to time, but between that 1964 essay and this book, although I was thinking and learning about religious evolution, other things became more urgent. I finally retired at 70 in 1997, and for the first time in my life I could devote myself to this book as I have for the last thirteen years.</p>
<p><em>NS: How did those other more urgent concerns present themselves?</em></p>
<p>RB: I was pulled by external forces. The whole preoccupation with America was particularly ironic because it was the one society I <em>didn’t</em> want to study. I chose to be a Japan specialist in graduate school to get as far away as I could! But once the “Civil Religion in America” paper came out in 1967, all kinds of nonacademic groups wanted to hear from me. I thought, well, this crazy country is all mixed up, and if I can help clarify things I should respond. That led to <a title="Robert N. Bellah | The Broken Covenant: American Civil Religion in Time of Trial (1975)"  href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3633018.html"  target="_blank" ><em>The Broken Covenant</em></a>, and then the Ford Foundation asked to fund <a title="Robert N. Bellah, Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, Ann Swidler, Steven M. Tipton | Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life (1985)"  href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520254190"  target="_blank" ><em>Habits of the Heart</em></a>. They were worried about what was happening to the American middle class. I didn’t ask for money for <em>Habits</em>; they pushed it on me. I found four really amazing younger colleagues who did most of the fieldwork. In that way, I got distracted by various things that were intrinsically important&#8212;so important that I gave them high priority&#8212;but that kept me from doing what my life’s work was meant to be.</p>
<p><em>NS: What has occupied you most during the last thirteen years that you’ve been working on this book?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061439"  target="_blank" ><img hspace="7"  vspace="2"  align="right"  class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26077"  title="Harvard University Press, 2011"  src="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Religion-in-Human-Evolution-197x300.jpg"  alt=""  width="158"  height="240"   style="float:right; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px;"/></a>RB: I was learning an enormous amount. All my life I have been deeply interested in ancient Israel and ancient Greece, and my graduate degree was in sociology and Far Eastern languages, so I knew a lot about ancient China. Back then I read Confucius and Mencius in their original classical Chinese. Since, I’ve had to catch up with current research in each of those fields. India, though, was the one place where I really started almost from scratch, like an undergraduate. That turned out to be utterly fascinating. I knew a lot about Buddhism because Buddhism is important in East Asia, particularly in Japan, but I didn’t know early Buddhism, and I didn’t know much about what we call Hinduism. Then I discovered the cognitive neuroscientist Merlin Donald’s notion that human culture, in evolutionary terms, moves from episodic, to mimetic, to mythic, to theoretic&#8212;that made all kinds of sense. To some extent, ontogeny repeats phylogeny, because children go through something like the same thing. So it’s a deeply interdisciplinary study. I’m drawing on biologists, evolutionary psychologists, and child-development researchers all in order to understand the deep roots of what would ultimately become religion. I’ve learned so much. It has been a deep pleasure to write this book.</p>
<p><em>NS: What about Jaspers’ notion of the “axial age,” that crucial period in the first millennium BCE when each of these civilizations flowered? Has it been framing your thinking since the beginning?</em></p>
<p>RB: It’s already there in the 1964 article. Benjamin Schwartz, a leading scholar of ancient China, organized the first discussion of the axial age in American academic life, I think, in an issue of <em>Deadalus</em> quite early on. Ben was my teacher and my colleague, and I was very influenced by his reading of Jaspers. So Jaspers goes all the way back, but of course I never really applied his insights in detail until I wrote this book. More recently, there was a <a title="Conference in Erfurt: The Axial Age and its Consequences for Subsequent History and the Present"  href="http://www2.uni-erfurt.de/maxwe/axialage.html"  target="_blank" >conference in 2008</a> at the Max Weber Center at the University of Erfurt in Germany, for which my axial age chapters were provided as a base for discussion.</p>
<p><em>NS: Karen Armstrong’s</em> <a title="Karen Armstrong | The Great Transformation (2007)"  href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/4890/the-great-transformation-by-karen-armstrong"  target="_blank" >The Great Transformation</a><em> has recently helped renew public interest in the axial age concept too. What do you think of that book?</em></p>
<p>RB: I’ve been with her up on the platform, and I know she’s a very intelligent person. But she doesn’t know much about the axial age. For her, it’s all about compassion. Compassion is a great thing, but that just won’t do! When she ends up excluding Greece from the axial age because there was no compassion there, I thought I would pull my hair out. It’s so simple-minded. In terms of the big picture, I don’t see any other book that does anything like what I’m trying to do.</p>
<p><em>NS: Comparisons like axial theories can allow differences between cultures to be obscured by ostensible similarity. How do you address the danger of such universalism?</em></p>
<p>RB: The problem of the universal is difficult in every case. The universal and the particular can never be separated; they always go hand in hand. But if you read my four axial chapters you would never think that these cultures are all the same. They are very, very different. I never want to talk theory without giving really detailed ethnographic examples. Here, I learned from my friendship with Clifford Geertz. From our graduate school days on, I always admired Cliff as an ethnographer. Do you know <a title="Posts by Talal Asad"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/asad/" >Talal Asad</a>’s essay about Cliff?</p>
<p><em>NS: The one in the </em><a title="Talal Asad | Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam (1993)"  href="http://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/ecom/MasterServlet/GetItemDetailsHandler?iN=9780801846328&amp;qty=1&amp;source=2&amp;viewMode=3&amp;loggedIN=false&amp;JavaScript=y"  target="_blank" >Genealogies of Religion</a><em> volume?</em></p>
<p>RB: It’s full of things that are just plain false. It attacks Cliff as an Orientalist and cites Edward Said. I went back and looked carefully at <a title="Edward W. Said | Orientalism (1979)"  href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/159783/orientalism-by-edward-w-said"  target="_blank" ><em>Orientalism</em></a>. Cliff Geertz is one of the few people whom Said completely exonerates, but you wouldn’t dream that this was the case by reading Asad. I’ve actually been warned by former students not to make Geertz so important in my preface because Geertz is in the doghouse now. Well, I want to bring him out of the doghouse! Cliff always insisted on the really deep detail&#8212;the “thick description”&#8212;and there’s a hell of a lot of that in this book. I had to educate myself on every one of these societies, both theoretically and in terms of ethnographic details.</p>
<p><em>NS: </em>Religion in Human Evolution<em> is an incredibly broad and ambitious work, so unlike much of the scholarship being done right now. Do you think there is too much pressure to narrowly specialize in the academy today?</em></p>
<p>RB: Tell me about it. The pressure to have articles in the primary reviewed journals of your profession in order to get tenure is really awful. The economics of the academic world today makes it all the worse. Who can take thirteen years to write a book like this? Fortunately, I’ve been in good health. But Cliff died at 80. I was very angry at him for that&#8212;I wanted him to read this book!</p>
<p><em>NS: I wonder if you have an opinion of journalist Robert Wright’s </em><a title="Robert Wright | The Evolution of God (2009)"  href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316067447.htm"  target="_blank" >The Evolution of God</a><em>, which offers, in some ways, a comparable story about the development of religion in evolutionary perspective.</em></p>
<p>RB: I think Wright is a very bright guy, and he has some interesting things to say. But he’s very hung up on the notion of gods and, particularly, God. His book overwhelmingly focuses on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. You would hardly know that half the world is not there. Hinduism, Confucianism, and Buddhism are huge traditions of enormous importance, and they aren’t monotheistic. Again, this reflects the fact that our preconceptions about what religion is are so influenced by Protestantism&#8212;either real Protestantism or the secularized Protestantism that dominates our culture&#8212;and its assumption that beliefs are the most important thing. But it’s clear all the way through history that practices are primary and beliefs are secondary. I’m not saying that you can’t learn something from Wright and other journalists like him&#8212;Nicholas Wade, for instance.</p>
<p><em>NS: Yes, Wade’s latest book is </em><a title="Nicholas Wade | The Faith Instinct (2010)"  href="http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143118190,00.html?The_Faith_Instinct_Nicholas_Wade"  target="_blank" >The Faith Instinct</a><em>. You’ve read it?</em></p>
<p>RB: I read that in advance for Penguin. I told the editor that I admire a lot in the book, but there’s so much I can’t agree with. Wade says at some point that Christianity is the first universal religion. Yet Buddhism is four hundred years older than Christianity, and if it’s not a universal religion I don’t know what a universal religion is. There’s also a strong focus on selectionism and the notion that religion plays a functional role in the evolutionary process. But religion is dysfunctional all the time, as well as functional. It’s not so simple. One of the important things about religion is that it is a sphere which is partially protected from selection. Religious creativity occurs when people pull out of the whole selectivity issue. Becoming celibate&#8212;obviously you couldn’t be less selective that that. Yes, selection is always in the background. But it’s not always there in the foreground. If you don’t understand that, you’re missing a lot.</p>
<p><em>NS: As someone trained in the social sciences, how did you go about engaging with scientific material? How did you weed through the current research and find insights that could help your project?</em></p>
<p>RB: In part it goes back to the fact that I became a major in Harvard’s Department of Social Relations in the second year of its existence. My whole undergraduate and graduate training brought me into clinical and social psychology, and anthropology. I’ve never been one of these boundary-guarding sociologists who thinks that if something isn’t sociology I can ignore it. This is also very much the spirit of Talcott Parsons; he was the quintessential sociologist, but he never drew any boundaries. Jerome Bruner, a developmental psychologist, was an important early influence. More recently, I did it just by finding who the best people are and reading their books. I’ve had colleagues who helped steer me, but it has really been self-help all the way.</p>
<p><em>NS: It is rare to see someone lately so informed by both the humanities and scientific research. You seem to be doing very much what <a title="Posts by Barbara Herrnstein Smith"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/smithbh/" >Barbara Herrnstein Smith</a> is calling for in her </em><a title="Barbara Herrnstein Smith | Natural Reflections: Human Cognition at the Nexus of Science and Religion (2009)"  href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300140347"  target="_blank" >Natural Reflections</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>RB: It’s a wonderful book that came just at the right moment for me.</p>
<p><em>NS: Say more about how it impacted you.</em></p>
<p>RB: Well, she makes the strong case that an explanatory science and an interpretive science are not incompatible, that they’re working at different levels, that they are revealing different kinds of truths, and that we can learn a lot from each. I wouldn’t say that this was totally new to me. Again, this was very much a part of Cliff Geertz’s thinking too. He wrote an early essay on the evolution of culture and the brain in the 1960s, before most people were talking about it. But Smith writes so eloquently. It’s really more the way she said it. She isn’t interested in bitter diatribe or polemic, and of course neither am I.</p>
<p><em>NS: Over the course of your career you’ve been able to do a unique kind of public theology within social science. Do you think that that kind of role is still open to younger sociologists?</em></p>
<p>RB: <a title="Posts by Christian Smith"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2010/11/17/multiple-modernities/#Smith" >Christian Smith</a> is an example of a younger person doing that. At one point I very much wanted to bring him to Berkeley, but it was precisely that side of him that my colleagues didn’t like, and he wasn’t brought. Nonetheless, he’s certainly one of the two or three most influential sociologists of religion today, so he hasn’t been excluded from the discussion by any means. Even Bob Wuthnow&#8212;though you could hardly call him a public theologian&#8212;has a very sensitive ear for religious reality, and his writings are always full of sympathetic understanding of the things he’s writing about. I think it’s possible. But whether I should have included three sermons in <a title="Steven M. Tipton (ed.) | The Robert Bellah Reader (2006)"  href="http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=13074"  target="_blank" ><em>The Robert Bellah Reader</em></a> is still an open question, because I think it did foster a degree of prejudice against a book that has a lot of other things in it. I did that partly deliberately.</p>
<p><em>NS: To what do you attribute that prejudice?</em></p>
<p>RB: The academic world is one of the few places where prejudice is supposed to be totally banned, and we’re politically correct on everything, but it’s still a place where you can attack religion out of utter, complete, bottomless ignorance and not be considered to have done anything wrong. It’s astounding to me to hear what some people can say with the assumption that everyone would agree with them, based on nothing whatsoever.</p>
<p><em>NS: An important part of your message has been the famous concern expressed in </em>Habits of the Heart<em> about “Sheilaism”&#8212;the kind of individualistic spirituality that you and your colleagues saw at work in the United States. Some have suggested recently, including your former student <a title="Posts by Harvey Cox"  href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2009/12/23/christianity-and-the-crash/#Cox" >Harvey Cox</a>, that some of these nontraditional spiritualities are finding a place in social and political life in a way that wasn’t quite recognized before. Is the way you think about new kinds of spiritualities evolving?</em></p>
<p>RB: I certainly think that so-called spirituality can have social and even political consequences. I’ve seen this among environmental activists, who often have some kind of eco-spirituality and who are very organizationally loose. They switch from one group to another, and if one group isn’t pure enough they go to another. And yet they spend a long period of their lives doing good work in a cause. In the end what I feel is most problematic about “I’m spiritual but not religious” is: what the hell are you going to tell your children? I’m allergic to the notion that so-called institutional religion&#8212;by which people mean organizations such as churches and synagogues&#8212;is bad. Institutions are very important and if you think you can get along without them, you’re putting yourself on the wrong line; you can’t.</p>
<p><em>NS: So your conclusions in </em>Habits of the Heart<em> stand?</em></p>
<p>RB: If you think about what has happened in American society, or even just today with what is going on with the Tea Party movement, <em>Habits of the Heart</em> was so right on. Radical individualism is even more evident today than when <em>Habits</em> was published twenty-five years ago. It describes the default mode of this deeply misguided society beautifully&#8212;horribly, but beautifully.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/09/12/the-era-of-fosdicks-revenge/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/American-Grace/David-E-Campbell/9781416566717"  target="_blank" ><img hspace="7"  vspace="2"  align="right"  class="alignright size-full wp-image-25975"  title="American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010)"  src="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/American-Grace2.jpg"  alt=""  width="164"  height="250"   style="float:right; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px;"/></a>Is bland beautiful? Almost never, most of us would say. But when it comes to religion in a diverse society, the answer may be yes.</p>
<p>This is the chief, if probably unintended implication of <a title="Robert D. Putnam and David E. Campbell | American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (2010)"  href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/American-Grace/David-E-Campbell/9781416566717"  target="_blank" ><em>American Grace</em></a>, which I take to be the most successfully argued, comprehensive sociological study of American religion in more than half a century. Robert Putnam and David Campbell harvest a generation of research and mature reflection about how religious affiliations of all kinds divide and unite Americans of different generations, regions, sexes, educational levels, and ethno-racial groups. Will Herberg’s endlessly discussed <a title="Will Herberg | Protestant-Catholic-Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology, Herberg (1955)"  href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo3640906.html"  target="_blank" ><em>Protestant-Catholic-Jew</em></a>, a book of 1955, was not remotely as methodologically self-conscious and as empirically grounded as is <em>American Grace</em>, but one must go back to Herberg to find so striking a single volume purporting to explain the religion of an author’s contemporary Americans. If this coming generation of scholars and journalists allow Putnam and Campbell to define the terms of conversation to the extent that our predecessors allowed Herberg to perform this role, we will be in fine shape.</p>
<p>Why does this book prompt the suspicion that bland may be beautiful? Because Putnam and Campbell argue that the decline of intense, sectarian devotion to any particular faith enables religious believers to be more tolerant and appreciative of ideas and practices different from their own. Putnam and Campbell’s central, data-driven theme is the fluidity of American religion. Americans move in and out of religious affiliations with dizzying frequency. While in other societies religious identity is more often perceived “as a fixed characteristic,” they explain, in the United States “it seems perfectly natural” to refer to one’s religion as a mere “preference.”</p>
<p>All this mobility in an immigrant-receiving society with multiple ethno-religious groups creates, especially in recent years, high levels of religious diversity within families. One half of Americans today are married to someone who came from a religious tradition different from their own, and when you start counting cousins and in-laws you have extended families in which most people are intimately connected with several individuals from a variety of communities of faith. This reality leads Putnam and Campbell to their charming “Aunt Susan Principle.”</p>
<p>Just about everyone has an Aunt Susan, the kind of relative who is so saintly that you know she will get to heaven (if you believe there is such a place, but let’s put aside differences of opinion about that), even if she is an atheist or a Presbyterian or a Buddhist or something else that you are proud not to be. Familiarity and love conquer sectarianism and breed tolerance. The “My Friend Al Principle” encapsulates the same situation for non-family acquaintances. You greatly admire Al, your office co-worker. So, you have no doubt he’ll make it to heaven even though he happens to be a Jehovah’s Witness (horrors!) and you are an Episcopalian.</p>
<p>Putnam and Campbell well understand that American society is sharply polarized by religion, and that this polarization often parallels political polarization. They believe they have solved the paradox of how a religiously polarized society can also be a religiously tolerant society. The answer is that Americans do not get too deeply entrenched in any one, particular religious affiliation.</p>
<p>But some people do. “True believers” is <em>American Grace</em>’s term for those who are intensely religious, and as a result have little use for folks with beliefs different from their own. Putnam and Campbell insist that only about ten percent of Americans are true believers, but the true believers turn out, predictably, to be among the least tolerant of same-sex relationships, non-marital co-habitation, abortion, divorce, and of all kinds of pluralism. Even apart from these extremists, however, conservatism of this type is more prevalent within the most homogeneous and stable of religious groups, such as Mormons and evangelical Protestants, than among the most fluid, such as Jews, ecumenical Protestants, and agnostics. Here, <em>American Grace</em> is consistent with Robert Wuthnow’s findings concerning “exclusivist Christians” in <em><a title="Robert Wuthnow | America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity (2007)"  href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8037.html"  target="_blank" >America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity</a></em>.</p>
<p>This demonstrable tension between intensity of belief and pluralistic tolerance is where the beauty of blandness becomes visible. Putnam and Campbell are not as forthright as they might be about the implications of their work. Clearly, they understand religion as a fine thing, providing needed networks of belonging and systems of meaning. Indeed, <em>American Grace</em> is a relentlessly generous book, filled with hope that the intolerance and sectarianism found among the “true believers” can be contained. The authors warn that the future is far from certain, and that the current association of religion with conservative politics might well be reversed. Religion in this book is, by and large, warm and wonderful. But their research leads to the conclusion that the warmest and most wonderful kinds of religion&#8212;and the kinds most compatible with a diverse, democratic society&#8212;are the kinds of religion that adherents regard as disposable, as something one is willing to trade away.</p>
<p>I hasten to acknowledge that <em>American Grace</em> offers an imposing and altogether welcome array of detailed information and wise reflection about countless aspects of religious life in the United States today. This very rich work’s value should not be reduced, as I risk doing here, to its most obvious and most general implication for the sociology of religion.</p>
<p><em>American Grace</em> reminds me of one of the most striking findings in another recent sociological study, Christian Smith and Patricia Snell’s <em><a title="Christian Smith with Patricia Snell | Souls in Transition: Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging Adults (2009)"  href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195371796"  target="_blank" >Souls in Transition: Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging Adults</a></em>. Invoking H. Richard Niebuhr’s legendary put-down of liberal Protestantism’s drift away from doctrinal particularity, Smith and Snell remark that today’s younger Christian believers apparently feel no objection to &#8220;a God without wrath” who “brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a Cross.&#8221; <a title="Harry Emerson Fosdick | Christian History"  href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/131christians/pastorsandpreachers/fosdick.html"  target="_blank" >Harry Emerson Fosdick</a> “would be proud,” Smith and Snell allow mischievously, to listen in on the religious chatter of today’s young adults, including evangelicals whose grandparents hated Fosdick, because even if they’ve never heard of Fosdick they talk just like him.</p>
<p>Putnam and Campbell offer their own families as both normative and representative of life in our own time, which might be called “the era of Fosdick’s revenge.” Campbell is a Mormon with Protestant and Catholic ancestors. Putnam was raised a Methodist but converted to Judaism, while his sister married a Catholic and had three children all of whom are now evangelicals. Will all these Putnams and Campbells, like Aunt Susan and friend Al, get to heaven? Only if they remember the chief lesson of this book: don’t take your religion too seriously.</p>

W. Norton &amp; Company"  href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-32671-0/"  target="_blank" ><em>9/11 Commission Report</em></a>,<em> </em>begins with a narrative timeline. In the simple past, in a voice devoid of interiority but rich in temporal data, the <em>Report</em> tracks movement in time and space. Readers learn, for example, that “Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi … they spoke for three minutes.” A steady barrage of ticking clocks marks the intersecting plots of the four teams of hijackers, a stopwatch-driven succession that culminates in the instant when, “at 8:46:40, American 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.” The conspicuous precision of the <em>Report</em>’s time measurement—to within the hundredth of a second—should invite us to question why, when tasked with understanding the attacks and their causes, the <em>Report</em> begins by establishing exactly when events occurred; further, what might such chronometric narratives have to say about the legacy of September 11, 2001?</p>
<p>This post sketches out some of the ways the events of 9/11 altered time-consciousness and temporal rhetoric in the public sphere and follows how the attacks continue to frame the subjective experience of temporality. Beginning with the lexicon of the war on terror—with its temporally overdertemined rhetoric of “the homeland,” “preemption,” “fundamentalism,” and, of course, the name-date “9/11” itself—I consider a few cases of what I call <em>9/11 chronomania—</em>the obsession with time and temporal disruption that characterizes representations of 9/11 across a variety of media forms. In the case of the <em>9/11 Commission Report</em>, by refashioning disaster as chronology, the narrative aims to replace victims with knowers—first, by establishing an authorial subject in command of its perceptual, technological, and temporal fields, and second, by attempting to shape personal and collective understandings of 9/11 by securing events unfolding in multiple locations and witnessed in myriad ways on a single, immanent timeline. The goals of such a narrative are clear: the chronometric novella that begins the <em>9/11 Commission Report</em> is in part a hook designed to catch a national audience primed by thrillers like the television series <em>24</em>, but it is also an attempt to incrementalize and disaggregate horrific events into an easily understood linear plot as part of a self-professed attempt to salve the wounds of collective trauma.</p>
<p>From my perspective in literary studies, I am interested in the ways the seminal speeches and policy documents of the post-9/11 era—among them <a title="President Declares &quot;Freedom at War with Fear&quot;"  href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html"  target="_blank" >President George W. Bush’s address on September 20</a>, the <a title="Quadrennial Defense Review Report, 2001"  href="http://www.dod.gov/pubs/qdr2001.pdf"  target="_blank" >Quadrennial Defense Review of 2001</a> conducted by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the <a title="The National Security Strategy 2002"  href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2002/"  target="_blank" >National Security Strategy (NSS) of 2002</a>—frame September 11 as a temporal event and cast the problem of understanding or responding to the attacks in terms of the clash between multiple conceptions of time. Many of the early responses to September 11 in the Anglophone media compensated for the collapse of geographic distance that had long separated the United States from its enemies by emphasizing the temporal distance between the “medieval,” “barbarous,” and “fundamentalist” perpetrators of the attacks and the putative modernity of its victims. The dichotomies of the war on terror depend in large part on dualistic notions of cultural conflict between Western modernity and the archaic forces of a fundamentalist Islam, as cultural critics <a title="comment | World news | The Observer"  href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/16/september11.terrorism3"  target="_blank" >Edward Said</a>, <a title="Judith Butler - Sexual Politics, Torture, and Secular Time"  href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/judith-butler/articles/sexual-politics-torture-and-secular-time/"  target="_blank" >Judith Butler</a>, <a title="Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror, Holsinger"  href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html"  target="_blank" >Bruce Holisnger</a>, and many others have argued. Neomedievalist rhetoric dusts off old Orientalist tactics to police the boundaries between “us” and “them,” in part by denying what anthropologist <a title="Time and the Other"  href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-12577-2/"  target="_blank" >Johannes Fabian describes</a> as the “coevalness” of the two parties in question. The medievalization of Islam—or, for that matter, of American foreign policy, as with President Bush’s telling use of the term “crusade” as a synonym for the war on terror—is not, however, my subject here. Indeed, the denial of coevalness between “Islam”and “the West” serves in part to obscure the more complex temporal logic of the war on terror. Though a vast quantity of critical ink has been spilt on the laws and policies of the Bush era, much more can be gleaned by examining the temporal logic of the war on terror, in which time is not experienced and narrated as homogeneous, but rather as uneven, saturated, multiple, and neither as secular nor as hegemonic as has previously been maintained.</p>
<p>In his September 20 address to a joint session of Congress, the national public, and beyond it a global audience, President Bush set out to reassure a stricken nation, name its antagonists, and outline the parameters and goals of a militarized response. “Without a story,” Naomi Klein observes in <a title="The Shock Doctrine | Naomi Klein | Macmillan"  href="http://us.macmillan.com/theshockdoctrine"  target="_blank" ><em>The Shock Doctrine</em></a>, “we are intensely vulnerable to those people who are ready to take advantage of the chaos for their own ends. As soon as we have a narrative that offers a perspective on the shocking events, we become reoriented, and the world begins to make sense.” The narcissistic evasions of the rhetorical question at the heart of President Bush’s September 20 speech (“Why do they hate us? … They hate our freedoms”) and the broader Manichean drama between good and evil that would come to characterize the rhetoric of the war on terror tell a simple, easily weaponized story of precisely the kind Klein had in mind. But despite sustained attempts on September 20 and in other speeches to gloss the events of September 11 within the familiar nationalist topoi of freedom, heroism, and justice, the speeches and policy documents of the Bush-era constitute less of an orienting metafiction than a tangled web of analeptic and proleptic leaps that provoke and maintain a state of crisis rather than prepare the ground for its resolution. While this and other speeches attempt to channel the affective response of a wounded nation, they do so precisely by maximalizing and marshalling traumatic rupture to shatter any preexisting historical order, particularly one based on linear temporality.</p>
<p>Beginning with his <a title="Statement by the President in Address to the Nation"  href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010911-16.html"  target="_blank" >brief statement on September 11</a>, Bush-era speeches and policy documents enmeshed the terrorist attacks in a discourse of temporal rupture. As the President intoned on September 20, “All of this was brought upon us in a single day, and night fell on a different world.” The binary metaphor of day and night, established here with a keen emphasis on the “fall” that defines their separation, pervades Bush’s lexicon in the aftermath of the attacks. The elegant and formally complex September 20 speech, arguably the most important rhetorical moment in what would become the war on terror, deploys a series of catachrestic claims that underscore the way the attacks both constitute and trigger temporal dislocations: “<em>tonight</em> we are a country <em>awakened</em> to danger and called to defend freedom” because, he argues, “we face new and sudden national challenges” presaged by unprecedented acts of terrorism (my italics). Lending rhetorical force to these claims with a chiasmus that echoes the earlier crossing of day and night, the speech reaches its climax in the moment when Bush declares, “whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.”</p>
<p>For its victims and for the billions around the world who watched, paralyzed, as disaster unfolded on television, the coordinated strikes of September 11 came as a cataclysmic shock. Within hours on a beautiful but otherwise ordinary Tuesday morning, four commercial jetliners had been hijacked and the World Trade Center’s signature towers and a large section of the Pentagon, symbols of America’s economic and military might, had been reduced to smoking rubble. It is difficult to think critically about the rhetoric of surprise without seeming to lend support to the ranks of September 11 conspiracy theorists, but for national security experts and administration officials, the idioms of surprise must be weighed against the repeated warnings and public pronouncements of impending terrorist attacks in order to understand its ideological value. Beyond their obvious utility in denying culpability for failing to disrupt terrorist networks prior to the attacks of 2001, claims regarding the epochal nature of September 11, particularly those emphasizing suddenness and rupture, begin to translate the experience of surprise and shock into a politically mobile idea of the attacks as an atemporal event whose force severs the causal and epistemological relationship between the past that came before and the future yet to come. In a carefully argued analysis of the President’s September 20 address, literary critic <a title="Project MUSE - boundar 2 - The Global Homeland State: Bush's Biopolitical Settlement"  href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/boundary/v030/30.3pease.html"  target="_blank" >Donald Pease argues</a> that the speech was “designed to lessen the events’ traumatizing power through the provision of an imaginary response to a disaster that could not otherwise be assimilated to the preexisting order of things.”  It seems to me, however, that something of the opposite is the case; while this and other speeches attempt to channel the affective response of a wounded nation, they do so precisely by maximalizing and marshalling traumatic rupture to shatter any preexisting historical order. A better trope than assimilation would be peripeteia: the sudden reversal from mourning to violence enacted in Bush’s September 20 address (“our grief has turned to anger, our anger to resolution”), which embodies the temporal instabilities of the war on terror.</p>
<p>The Quadrennial Defense Review, the primary public document that outlines national military strategy, published on September 30, 2001, is unsurprisingly devoted to the “new era” of national security inducted on September 11, and it is here that the emergent Bush Doctrine fully articulates the ontology of temporal rupture. By tradition a highly narrative genre, the QDR of 2001 attempts to tell the story of 9/11 and its implications for national security in such a way as to forge consensus, if not actually to blunt the edge of defense policy. One of the most striking aspects of the 2001 QDR conducted by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is the way the surprise attacks precipitate uncertainty: “A fundamental condition of our circumstances,” Rumsfeld maintains, is that “the United States cannot predict with a high degree of confidence the identity of the countries or the actors that may threaten its interests and security.” If the past can no longer be used to predict the future, the military must “establish a new strategy for America&#8217;s defense that would embrace uncertainty and contend with surprise.” In other words, the disappearance of history at the heart of chronomania denies the narratives that would consider the role played by American policies in creating the material conditions out of which 9/11 arose and substitutes for them dystopian imaginings of greater violence yet to come.</p>
<p>As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld argued in <a title="Defense.gov"  href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=105"  target="_blank" >prepared testimony for the 9/11 Commission</a>, “on September 11th, our world changed … we cannot go back. The world of September 10th is past … we cannot go back to thinking as we did on September 10th. For if we do—if we look at the problems of the 21st century through a 20th century prism—we will come to wrong conclusions and fail the American people.” For Rumsfeld, pre-9/11 epistemologies—forensic evidentiary paradigms based on retrospective analysis—have little place in the altered world of the twenty-first century, a world in which analyzing the past to predict the future will generate, as he opined, the “wrong conclusions.” If the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment operate with a fundamentally reactive logic, the war on terror claims the necessity of preemption. The National Security Strategy (NSS) of 2002, the first such document prepared by the White House after September 11 and a radical departure from its predecessors, aggressively consolidates the imperatives of preventative war. The seminal characteristic of the “new thinking” advocated by the White House and Department of Defense in the National Security Strategy and elsewhere is the proleptic temporality that emerges to govern the War on Terror. Because the goal of anticipatory action is to prevent the very terrorist strikes whose execution would have substantiated the need to strike in the first place, the proleptic futurity of the war on terror depends, paradoxically, on the public’s ability to maintain the violence of September 11 in the continuous present. “The hour is coming when America will act,” President Bush avowed messianically on September 20, confident in America’s redemptive agency.</p>
<p>At the same time as the logic of preemption and the temporality of trauma were deployed to sever the continuity of cause and effect, the rhetoric of temporal rupture within halts calendrical flow, and in the resultant temporal rift opens new connections between the nation’s mythic past and its present. In his major post-September 11 speeches, the President forged a series of opportunistic contiguities between America’s two great twentieth-century foes, communism and fascism, and its new enemies in the twenty-first<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size: 11px;" > </span>century. Bush described al Qaeda on September 20 as “the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century,” insisting that “they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism, and totalitarianism.” In his <a title="Transcript of President Bush’s Prayer Service Remarks on September 14, 2001"  href="http://www.opm.gov/guidance/09-14-01gwb.htm"  target="_blank" >prayer service remarks at the National Cathedral on September 14</a>, a day consecrated to prayer and remembrance, crisis connects the present with a cyclical pattern of heroism: “In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom’s home and defender, and the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time.” In the Bush administration’s telling of “history,” one strikingly similar to <a title="End of History and the Last Man | Book by Francis Fukuyama - Simon &amp; Schuster"  href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/END-OF-HISTORY-AND-THE-LAST-MAN/Francis-Fukuyama/9780743284554"  target="_blank" >Francis Fukuyama’s</a>, “the great struggles of the twentieth century ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom—and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise.” With time itself torn asunder by the attacks, temporal instability facilitates analeptic leaps into the nation’s mythic past that conjoin 9/11 with an unlikely array of historical moments in public and political discourse.</p>
<p>By examining narratives of state power, we can begin to see how the war on terror, far from being disabled by chronomania, integrates nonlinear time into the very fabric of the national imaginary and the seminal legislation of the post-9/11 period. In the dominant academic account, modernity conceives of history as unfolding in what <a title="Illuminations by Walter Benjamin - Book - Random House"  href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/11363/illuminations-by-walter-benjamin"  target="_blank" >Walter Benjamin influentially called</a> homogeneous empty time. Indeed, the idea of modernity is constitutively rooted, as literary critic <a title="Welcome to Duke University Press"  href="http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=1240"  target="_blank" >Matei Călinescu argues</a>, “within the framework of a specific time awareness, namely, that of <em>historical time</em>, linear and irreversible, flowing irresistibly onwards.” In <a title="VersoBooks.com"  href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/60-imagined-communities"  target="_blank" >Benedict Anderson’s influential account</a>, “the idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous, empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which is also conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history.” In this way, modern states can be understood as fundamentally chronopolitical entities. But, as I have been arguing here, after 9/11 we no longer live in this time, if “we” ever did.</p>
<p>I began this essay with a series of observations about how the <em>9/11</em> <em>Report</em> asserts temporal mastery over unpredicted events by constructing a timeline, a chronometric form that attempts to move readers away from affective responses surrounding victimhood toward those of agency. At a very basic level, such a process deactivates the kairotic rupture triggered by the war on terror by drawing readers through the time of catastrophe and, figuratively, out the other side. While such a narrative form might seem inherently aligned with state power and the homogeneous empty time of modernity—and thus easily summoned to the service of militarized patriotism—in the context of kairotic governmentality, the stopwatch-driven narrative of the <em>Report</em> can be seen in a different light. When I asked Philip Zelikow, the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission and the person most responsible for the <em>Report</em>’s form and tone, about this chronometric approach to history, he described how the cultivation of what he called the <em>Report</em>’s “House Style,” a voice free of polemic and, to the extent possible, of interpretation, was one of the primary goals for the final document he established during his first meeting with Commission chairman Thomas Kean and vice-chair Lee Hamilton. With a “dry, unadorned style designed around a rigorous substructure of time and narrative,” Zelikow aimed to focalize what people knew at particular moments in history and clarify how individuals understood their choices in the moment, rather than succumb to what he termed “the blinding force of hindsight.” The precise temporal measurements characteristic of the <em>Report</em> find their analogue in the operational complexity of al Qaeda’s attacks, which depended on similar, distinctly “modern” temporal logics. In other words, the <em>Report</em>’s chronometric narrative restores the coevalness of terrorism’s victims and perpetrators.</p>
<p>Before championing some kind of return to the secular, however, one must acknowledge the empty formalism of the <em>9/11 Commission Report</em>’s approach: after all, one gains little useful knowledge in the confidence that the first plane struck at 8:46:40. On a pragmatic level, identifying the kairotic power of September 11 reflects an astute recognition within the Bush administration that the terrorist attacks afforded a unique opportunity for political action—not only in its immediate aftermath but in any of its citational presents. In the new, multidimensional temporality of the war on terror it is not, as Benjamin feared, time deployed as chronos that presages oppression, nor does time’s messianic cessation necessarily constitute the hallmark of revolutionary praxis; instead, in the proleptic and analeptic constellations of September 11, technocapital and state power have subsumed what Charles Taylor—following the apostle Paul, who used the term to denote messianic time—<a title="A Secular Age - Charles Taylor - Harvard University Press"  href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674026766"  target="_blank" >calls the kairotic time of the religious imaginary</a>.</p>
<p>Ten years after the attacks, the multiple temporalities of the war on terror pose something of a conundrum, particularly for thinkers on the left who believe that to effectively contend with state power and its dominant ideologies, one must begin with a critique of its chronopolitical underpinnings: namely its hegemonic secular temporality. When “destabilization” has long served the critical community as a synonym for subversion, what happens when rupture becomes the status quo?</p>
