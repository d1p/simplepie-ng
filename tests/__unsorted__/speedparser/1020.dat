			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are currently experiencing severe drought conditions in South Florida. Certain areas of the Everglades have almost dried out. </p>
<p>Our park is open to visitors, however due to low water conditions we are limited to certain areas in which the boats can pass through.  Due to this, boat tours are running a little longer than usual.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are lots more gators basking in the sun &#8211; so if you want to see gators, now is a good time to come down.</p>
<p>If you’re schedule is flexible we advise you to come to the park after </br>12 noon, by this time most of the tour buses have left our park. The park closes at 5PM.</p>
<p>We hope the summer rains come early this year <img src='http://www.evergladessafaripark.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Everglades fish species are found in lakes, brackish rivers, backcountries, bays, springs, clear rivers, etc. At the mushy areas, most of the fish are aggressive. You will need heavy rods, correct lures and lines to battle the feisty creatures.</p>
<p>The aggressive bass use battling strategies to evade hooks and the bass will swiftly escape fishing lines if you are not prepared.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that might help you on your fishing trip at the Everglades:</p>
<p>There is no magic bait for the bass; they will take shiners, top waters, spinners and plastic worms, just like in any other Florida waters. Double digit bass is the norm as you get pretty big fish out there! Use a float or free-line them near a structure (lily pads, logs, sunken trees, etc.) and hold on tight.</p>
<p>Try to use Attractor Beads, Luminous Tube, and flashy things on your rig near the hook to help attract fish to your bait. Large shiners are worth the money spent on them, as you are sure to have an adventure of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Your basic freshwater lures will work for both salt &amp; fresh fish. Make sure to “juice” your lures up with aerosol spray or YUM, Bang, or your favorite scent.</p>
<p>When going out on your fishing trip, take a variety of bait with you. Usually pilchards, bonito, and mackerel work well.</p>
<p>The best way to have a productive and memorable fishing adventure in the Everglades would probably be to take one of the many fishing charters provided all around the park. Using guides will provide you the tools you need to catch Everglades’ largest bass. The guides offer several benefits: these licensed men and women are trained to handle fishing needs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cruises on board luxury ships</strong><br />
Tropical breezes, breathtaking sunsets, moonlit nights, fantastic food and much more of Florida’s enthralling escapades come to mind as you think of Florida cruises. They can be wonderful indeed.</p>
<p>From magnificent Caribbean cruises on board a luxury ship, to an exciting cruise to “no where”, Florida cruises come in many shapes and forms, including sunset cruises, dinner cruises, day cruises and the like. And they have surely become one of Florida’s main tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Florida has five main cruise ports and they are located in these cities &#8211; Jacksonville, Cape Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.</p>
<p>There is more to Florida cruises and cruising than what meets the eye! Here is a look at what’s available.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Cruises to the Caribbean </strong><br />
Most cruises offer tours of the area either before or after the cruise itself! One popular trip is a tour of the Florida Everglades in an airboat ride! So not only can you take a wonderful cruise to the Caribbean, but you can see some of Florida’s main tourist attractions on your vacation!</p>
<p>There is a city in Florida that is a popular cruise destination itself &#8212; Key West. It&#8217;s a fun stop, with plenty to see and to do. It’s a wonderful family-friendly vacation destination.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Cruises to the Bahamas</strong><br />
There are quite a few day cruises to the Bahamas from West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. You&#8217;ll go over to Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, just 40 miles offshore. You can spend some time shopping, taking tours or visiting. Spend the day in the Bahamas! Go shopping and enjoy the thrill of the hunt and haggling a bit over the price.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Cruises to Nowhere?</strong><br />
These cruises to nowhere are the infamous gambling cruises. You&#8217;ll take a ship out beyond the US territorial waters and the gambling begins.</p>
<p>Casinos are illegal in Florida, except for on Indian reservations, so this is as close to one as you will find on your Florida vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Sunset Cruises</strong><br />
These are perhaps the nicest of the Florida cruises. Anywhere there is water, a cruise is waiting to happen! Rivers, oceans, lakes &#8212; there are all kinds of possibilities! Key West (and the Florida Keys in general) is famous for its glorious endings of the day. But really, anywhere in Florida is excellent! Sunset cruises are at their best in the winter, because the colors in the sky seem to glow so bright.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Dinner Cruises</strong><br />
Many sunset cruises are also dinner cruises. These especially are held on calm bodies of water, so they are great for those who get seasick from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Alligator watching</strong><br />
Alligators are considered as a key stone species of the everglades. Scientists say that the species are nearly 150 million years old and there&#8217;s nothing like the thrill of being just a few feet away from a live alligator! At Everglades Safari Park you&#8217;ll get close to nature&#8217;s ancestral dinosaur, the Florida alligator, out in the heart of the Everglades.  Whether you like your gators roaming free or safely behind bars, there are plenty for you to see.</p>
<p><strong>Where to Find Alligators</strong><br />
Just about any place that offers swamp buggy or airboat rides probably knows where the gators are. Everglades National Park would surely be on top of the list to watch these amazing creatures in their natural habitat. You might find them basking in the sun by the road side, or simply gliding along the water’s edge looking for a meal! Do not miss the chance to see an alligator show; it is truly a unique and exciting experience! You will probably get the chance to pet an alligator and take home some fantastic pictures for remembrance!</p>
<p><strong>Disney Orlando</strong><br />
Your great Florida vacation wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a trip to Walt Disney World Orlando! It’s the best place for both grown-ups and kids to have a good time!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about a Disney vacation, you have several options.  First, Walt Disney World is very diverse.  It&#8217;s primarily composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The      Magic Kingdom</li>
<li>EPCOT</li>
<li>Disney      Hollywood Studios</li>
<li>Animal      Kingdom</li>
<li>Blizzard      Beach</li>
<li>Typhoon      Lagoon</li>
</ul>
<p>And more to see, in this greatest of all the Florida tourist attractions!</p>
<p><strong>Planning your visit to Disney World</strong><br />
Crowds, weather and choice are probably going to be the three main things of consideration when planning your visit to Disney World Orlando.</p>
<p>Although it’s easy to say you must visit every park when you go to Walt Disney World, it might not be that easy. For example, first-time visitors to the Mouse have a tendency to try and visit every park. That’s fine if you have a two week vacation, but a little more difficult on a five day visit.</p>
<p>You also need to take into account the members of your party. Some rides have restrictions in how tall you need to be to ride an attraction, or your general health. Pregnancy, a back problem or motion sickness are all fairly typical reasons for not visiting a particular ride.</p>
<p>Although Disney World attracts visitors from all walks of life, there is no denying that it’s a huge draw for families. It goes without saying that school and public holidays play a big part in crowd levels, so it stands to reason that if you can avoid visiting during Christmas, Easter or the Summer Holiday’s then do it. The other major factor is the weather. The weather between June and September is the warmest and most humid, this is met with the highest rainfall. If you can’t stand the heat, December and January is definitely for you.</p>
<p><strong>Where should I stay during my Disney World Vacation?</strong><br />
The choice of accommodation available around Orlando varies from the budget motel types, to upscale suite hotels. There is also a thriving vacation rental market in Orlando, so you could spend your whole Disney World vacation in a private vacation villa with its own private pool.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Disney World has many of its own resorts that offer perks above and beyond staying in a standard hotel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.evergladessafaripark.com">Everglades national Park</a> is probably one of the best places you can fish in the entire world.  It has many great fighting species of fish and year-round light tackle fishing like Snook, Tarpon, Trout, and Redfish that can be caught by all skill levels.</p>
<p>The Everglades National Park is one of the country’s most extraordinary natural formations set ideal for fishing. Thousands of kinds of fish and land forms unlike anywhere else in the United States can be found almost everywhere in the Everglades. These surroundings also provide some of the best largemouth bass waters in the country; however, anyone who spends time bass fishing in the Everglades will discover more than just an angling adventure.</p>
<p>At the Everglades you can expect to see many different kinds of birds, plants, crocodiles, alligators, apart from the exotic abundance of many different species of fish.  You can experience this amazing wild life found in an endless maze of creeks leading to ponds throughout the South Western coast of Florida.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the best fishing destinations in Everglades</span></strong></p>
<p>The Everglades boasts as a destination where the world’s largest bass swim. If you want to catch bluegill or crappie visit Lake Okeechobee. If you enjoy fly-fishing, you may also want to scan the areas around Kissimmee Chain, where many of Florida&#8217;s largest bass hide beneath the rocky reefs and weed beds.</p>
<p>Over at the Stick Marsh near Florida Everglades you will enjoy the latest productions of bass fishing. In fact, bass swim high and low in these waters, often in schools.</p>
<p>Another popular area to fish is along US 41, east of US 29 and west of Krome Ave; there is a canal on the north side where you can catch all fresh water fish and also several exotic species! The cichlids and Oscars are pretty easy to catch.</p>
<p>The saltwater fish migrate into the Everglades via the Tamiami Canal that parallels US 41. If you do end up fishing along US 41, remember not to feed the alligators, you will find them in abundance during your fishing trip! It’s against the law to feed the Alligators as it causes them to lose their fear of people.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the most famous fishing areas in and around Everglades National Park and a list of fish you might be able to catch there!</p>
<p><strong>Everglades Fishing</strong> – you might catch Snook, Tarpon, Redfish, Trout, Grouper, Snapper, Triple Tail, Jacks, Lady Fish, and Sharks. In the freshwater parts of the Everglades you can catch Peacock Bass, Large Mouth Bass, and Alligator Garr.</p>
<p><strong>Flamingo Fishing</strong> &#8211; most targeted saltwater species are Snook, Tarpon, Redfish, Trout, Grouper, Snapper, Triple Tail, Jacks, Lady Fish, and Sharks.  Flamingo can be accessed by car from the Miami and Homestead area or by boat from Key Largo and Islamorada.</p>
<p><strong>Biscayne Bay Fishing</strong> &#8211; The most sought out species caught here would be Bonefish, Permit, and Tarpon.  However, there are times when Snook, Redfish, Snapper, Trout, Grouper, Jacks, Lady Fish and Sharks are also caught.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Keys Fishing</strong> &#8211; Here the most prized game fish hunted on the flats would be Bonefish, Permit, and Tarpon.</p>
<p>In many areas of the Everglades it will be difficult to fish without a boat. You may consider hiring a guide as local knowledge can be the key to a fisherman’s success.</p>
<p>Anglers must also remember that Florida has fresh and salt water fishing licenses. You are required to have a license if fishing from a bridge or pier but are part of the fee if hiring a boat. Stop at Wal-Mart and check on fishing license requirements in the sporting goods department.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fish are an integral part of the Florida Everglades Ecosystem. The aquatic life of south Florida is inextricably entwined with the natural and cultural history of the landscape. Fish, in particular, are an integral link in the Everglades food web. They feed on algae, crustaceans, and aquatic insects, and provide a source of food for larger predators such as wading birds, larger fish, and the infamous alligators of the Everglades.</p>
<p>To the recreational angler, the Everglades have become a world-class destination for the pursuit of immense sport fish. The productive estuaries of the area continue to drive commercial harvesting operations outside the Everglades National park to this day, and have become one of Florida’s main tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Fishing would definitely top the list of fun things to do in Florida. Many travel from all over of the world to Everglades National Park to take part in this amazing experience. Prospective anglers should be aware that licenses are required and applicable regulations are enforced.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 different species of fish are known to inhabit the freshwater marshes and marine coastline of Everglades National Park. There are also some species of fish that are endangered or becoming sparse that reside within the safe haven of the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the most renowned fish are:</strong></p>
<p><em>The Bluegill</em><br />
The Bluegill is a species of freshwater fish. It is a member of the sunfish family. It is native to a wide area of North America, and has been widely transplanted to stock game fish for anglers. It is renowned as an excellent tasting fish. It is relatively common and easy to catch.</p>
<p>Of tropical sunfish body shape, the bluegill&#8217;s most notable feature is the blue or black &#8220;ear&#8221;. Its name, however, comes from the bright blue edging visible on its gill rakers. It can be distinguished from similar species by the (not always pronounced) vertical bars along its flanks. The bluegill grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 40 cm (16 in).</p>
<p><em> Brown Bullhead</em><br />
The brown bullhead is a fish of the Ictaluridae family that is widely distributed in North America. It is a species of bullhead catfish. The brown bullhead is also widely known as the &#8220;mud cat”. The brown bullhead thrives in a variety of habitats, including lakes and ponds with low oxygen and/or muddy conditions. Brown Bullheads are opportunistic bottom feeders. They eat insects, leeches, snails, fish, clams, and many plants. They are also known to eat corn, which can be used as bait.</p>
<p><em> Channel Catfish</em><br />
The Channel Catfish is North America&#8217;s most numerous catfish species. It is informally referred to as a &#8220;channel cat&#8221;. In the United States they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid growth of aquaculture of this species in the United States.</p>
<p><em> Great Barracuda</em><br />
The great barracuda is a curious, fearsome-looking, usually solitary predator common to reefs and shallows of Florida and the Caribbean. Distinguished by a torpedo-shaped body, large eyes and mouth, formidable teeth, a double emarginated (notched) tail fin with pale tips on each lobe the Barracuda grows up to 2meters in length. A fully grown fish would weigh nearly 50 kg!</p>
<p><em> Everglades Pygmy Sunfish</em><br />
The pygmy sunfishes grow to a maximum overall length of 3 to 4 cm. They occur mostly in temperate and subtropical swamps, marshes, and other shallow, slow-moving, and heavily-vegetated waters. The blue barred, Carolina, and spring pygmy sunfishes have small localized populations and are considered Vulnerable.</p>
<p>The pygmy sunfishes are too small to be game fish, but are popular as aquarium fish because of the males&#8217; iridescent colors and fascinating breeding behaviors.</p>
<p><em> The Gulf killifish</em><br />
The Gulf Killifish is one of the largest killifish species (to 18 cm), with a blunt head and short snout. Gulf killifish are bronze-gray in color, although spawning males will be darker with glittering specks of color. It has only one dorsal fin and no spines in any of its fins.</p>
<p>The gulf killifish can tolerate low oxygen and variable salinity ranging from fresh water to salt concentrations several times that of seawater. They also have high tolerance for temperature variability. They feed primarily on crustaceans and other smaller fish species.</p>
<p><em> Blue fin Killifish</em><br />
The bluefin killifish is a handsome species. Adult males have a bright blue, black-edged dorsal fin, the base of which is green at the front and deep orange to red at the rear. This species has a slender, compressed body and a strongly upturned mouth adapted for life at the water surface. The bluefin killifish is frequently associated with spring habitats. It occurs in shallow, vegetated margins in association with extensive organic debris and cypress knees. The bluefin killifish feeds on small insects, crustaceans, and plant material.</p>
<p><em> Rainwater Killifish</em><br />
The rainwater killifish has a slightly compressed body, a small, upturned mouth, and a strongly compressed caudal peduncle. Most scales are edged in black, giving them a diamond-shaped appearance.It can be found in freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats. It usually prefers quiet, vegetated waters, away from the surface area. Maximum length is approximately 7 cm, but it usually grows to about 5 cm.</p>
<p><em>The Mosquito fish</em><br />
The Mosquito fish is a species of freshwater fish that is native to the eastern and southern United States, and grows to 3.5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The mosquito fish is found in the southeastern United States and has become an invasive species in Australia, where they were released as a method to decrease mosquito populations This species thrives in water that is shallow. It has been shown that the mosquito fish can survive in water with pH and chemical levels known to kill other fish.</p>
<p><em> Sailfin Molly</em><br />
Sailfin mollies are most commonly observed as the shallow surface waters along the edges of marshes, lowland streams, ponds, swamps, estuaries and even ephemeral water bodies such as roadside ditches. Small to large aggregations of the species are most commonly found under floating vegetation or near structures in the water. The sailfin molly is a tolerant species, as it can exploit the thin film of oxygen rich surface water with its upturned mouth and so is able to survive oxygen depleted habitats.</p>
<p>Here is a list of fish commonly found in the Everglades for quick reference:<br />
•	Florida gar (<em>Lepisosteus platyrhincus</em>)<br />
•	bowfin (<em>Amia calva</em>)<br />
•	tarpon (<em>Megalops atlantica</em>)<br />

<p><strong>Weather conditions that affect fish</strong><br />
During the drought seasons, these fish are all threatened by low water levels and unable to inhabit certain areas of the Everglades region. During this season water fish become limited to deeper water habitats and gator holes. The lower water levels in marshes often leave the fish vulnerable to predators because they have nowhere to hide.  But during the rainy season they are in abundance. Flooding scatters fish across the everglades. Changes in water level and dissolved oxygen concentrations require fish to be specially adapted to this ever-changing environment. Some fish are able burrow into the sediments and aestivate (live in a dormant state) during the dry season.</p>
<p><strong>Threats for Everglades Fish</strong><br />
Unfortunately, today, the Everglades are an ecosystem in danger of extinction. Canals and levees capture and divert its water for human use, disrupting the natural cycles of feeding and nesting which depend on these waters. Much of the time the water is contaminated by pollutants.</p>
<p>Faced with loss of habitat, disruption of water flow, and the invasion of nonnative species, many animals have declined dramatically in number. Some have virtually disappeared.<br />
For fish and other creatures who call this subtropical wetland home, it might only be a matter of time before they have to seek new homes because the Everglades can no longer accommodate the needs of their species.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the number of people visiting this amazing wilderness keeps increasing, modes of travel and other various services seem to be improving day by day. If you are planning to visit the Everglades during your vacation, you need not be worried about being stranded in no man’s land as many modes of transportation are available to and around the Everglades.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation TO and FROM <a href="http://www.evergladessafaripark.com">Everglades National Park</a></strong><br />
You can take a relaxing drive in a car and get used to the climate, or even take a plane if you are in a hurry to catch the next flight! Transportation is available by car, plane, bus, and boat. You can decide on your mode of travel depending on your convenience.</p>
<p>Those arriving to Florida by air can choose to arrive into Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport, Miami International Airport, or even hop a charter to the Everglades Airport, which is a smaller airport located right in Everglades, Florida.</p>
<p>Once you have arrived at the airport, you can rent a car to drive the rest of the way, or hop on one of the many shuttle bus services that are offered in and around the Everglades. Airports and hotels in the area have various shuttle services taking visitors to and from Everglades National Park.</p>
<p>Shark River is a popular route for boat rides. Buses can be found all over, offering guided tours, rides to or from the park, and even all-inclusive tours and trips around the Everglades.</p>
<p>Everglades National Park, the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, boasts rare and endangered species. It has been designated a World Heritage Site, International Biosphere Reserve, and Wetland of International Importance. So, make sure to save some time to visit this amazing wilderness. There is only one Everglades in the world and no matter how you get here or how you choose to get around, seeing the Everglades is something that you’re sure to enjoy and remember for a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation In and Around the Everglades</strong><br />
Once you arrive in the Everglades National Park area, you can choose to walk, ride or drive through most areas of the park. If you are more interested in exploring this amazing eco-system and get a firsthand experience of the adventures on offer, get off the path and into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Walking and canoe trails, boat tours and biking trails are excellent for viewing wildlife.</p>
<p>However, there are also tram services that operate throughout the park on a daily basis. You can combine tram services with a walking or biking tour, depending on what is best for you.</p>
<p><strong> Everglades Transportation Tips and Suggestions;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When people drive to and through the Everglades, they are always going to be more interested on the scenery and the beauty of the area. You might drive off the road trying to get a closer look at an alligator basking in the sun!!Therefore, drivers need to exercise EXTREME caution so that they don’t get involved in accidents because they were not paying attention.</li>
<li>Biking and walking is not for everyone. If you are not an experienced rider it would be better to take a tram tour.</li>
<li>The weather can be very hot during the summer months. So, don’t forget to take plenty of water.</li>
<li>Plan ahead, and have alternate options. Nothing is worse than missing your bus or misreading the tram schedules, so make sure that you are prepared when it comes to getting to the park, as well as getting around the area.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journey deep into nature’s mysterious wilderness at <a href="http://http://www.evergladessafaripark.com">Everglades Safari Park</a> and come face to face with the exotic wildlife that calls this place home.</p>
<p>The never ceasing chirping of birds as you walk along the trails, or the silent ripples on the waters surface created by a shy manatee, constantly remind you of the inhabitants of this amazing wilderness. As you take a trip on a <a href="http://www.evergladessafaripark.com/eco-tours-and-boat-tours-in-everglades.htm">safari air boat</a>, or bike ride through shark valley you are sure to spot many of the Everglades’ famous inhabitants. Keep your cameras ready as you are sure to spot the king of the Everglades- the American alligator basking in the sun or enjoying a meal!</p>
<p>The Everglades acts as a safe haven for a variety of plant and animal species. No other place combines a subtropical climate, a broad, shallow river, and a stunning diversity of plants and animals into such a complex and fragile ecosystem. Everglades National Park is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the United States. The Everglades are a truly unique habitat; there are no other Eco-system similar to it in the world.</p>
<p>The Florida Everglades contains one of the highest concentrations of species vulnerable to extinction in the United States. The 5,000-square-kilometre wetland in southern Florida is home to at least 60 endangered species, such as the American crocodile, Florida panther, and West Indian manatee.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commonly seen species</span></strong><br />
Alligators, are an important part of this ecosystem, and are regarded as a “keystone” species of the Everglades. The Florida Everglades ecosystem is also the only place in the world where alligators and crocodiles exist side by side.</p>
<p>Many animals live in the Everglades including the raccoon, skunk, opossum, Eastern Cottontail bobcat, Red Fox and white-tail deer. But the symbol of this wild, vast ecosystem is the Florida panther. It is the most endangered species in the Everglades, with only about 100 remaining in the wild. Take a rip to Everglades Safari Park and be one of the lucky few to spot this amazing creature in its own habitat.</p>
<p>Two other well-known animals in the ecosystem include the friendly West Indian manatee and bottlenose dolphin, both of which live in saltwater bays and coastal areas.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everglades’s birds</span></strong><br />
In addition to rare and endangered species, the Everglades are rightly famous for the profusion of bird species found there, with 347 species recorded within the Park boundaries. Some are year-round residents; other just visit for the winter; and still others stop by on their journey to more southern destinations.</p>
<p>The most notable of the wading birds includes the Wood Stork; White and Glossy Ibises; Roseate Spoonbill; Great Blue, Great White and Tricolored Herons; and Snowy and Great Egrets. The endangered Snail Kite is an unusual bird in that it survives exclusively on the apple snail. The Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow also is in the news today, as scientists and government regulators strive to preserve its quickly dwindling habitat.</p>
<p>The mangrove estuaries of Florida Bay, in particular, are a breeding habitat for Roseate Spoonbills, Wood Stork, White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, and eleven species of egrets and herons.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Snakes at the Everglades</span></strong><br />
There are 26 types of snakes found in Everglades National Park, ranging in size from the poisonous pygmy rattler, seldom no more than two feet long, to the threatened indigo snake, which can grow to be over eight feet long. Many of the snakes found in the park are adapted to survive in the water.</p>
<p>Faced with loss of habitat, disruption of water flow, and the invasion of nonnative species, many animals have declined dramatically in number. Some have virtually disappeared.<br />
Here is a list species found at Everglades for quick reference:</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity of the Everglades National Park</strong></p>
<p>Everglades National Park, the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, boasts rare and endangered species. It has been designated a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance. The Everglades has been a habitat for many different species of birds, animals, and plant life of all types. However, it is slowly diminishing as the result of many modifications that have been made to the wilderness as the result of population growth in the southern Florida area.</p>
<p><strong>Things to do</strong><br />
A vast expanse of roughly 1.5 million acres, there seems no end to the adventures that can be found in Everglades National Park for individuals, couples, or families. The diverse habitats allow for enjoyable activities ranging from hiking, canoe and kayaking, biking, fresh and saltwater fishing and camping in the ultimate wilderness.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to spend your day at Everglades National Park, Our experienced tour guides will describe you the wonders of this unique ecosystem and the native and exotic wildlife that inhabit it. All tours will include an airboat ride, alligator wildlife show, and a walking trail filled with crocodilian exhibits.</p>
<p>Walking and canoe trails, boat tours and tram tours are excellent for viewing wildlife, including alligators and a multitude of tropical and temperate birds. With over 350 species of birds thriving, the Everglades National Park is one of the best spots in Florida for bird watching and bird photography.</p>
<p>Camping, whether in the backcountry or at established campgrounds, offers the opportunity to enjoy what the park offers firsthand.</p>
<p>Ranger-Led Activities in various areas of the park may help you to enjoy your visit even more. At least half of these are accessible by wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>When to visit the Everglades National Park</strong><br />
The Everglades is mild and pleasant from December through April, though rare cold fronts may create near freezing conditions. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures around 90° F / 32°C and humidity over 90%. Afternoon thunderstorms are common and mosquitoes are abundant. The Everglades are a vast area of wilderness set amidst the climactic extremes of the subtropics.</p>
<p>During the busy, dry season (winter), most facilities are open and a full range of tours and programs are available to enjoy.  During the slow, wet season (summer), facilities may have restricted hours or close altogether, and recreational opportunities may be at a minimum. The Everglades National Park is also known for its many visitor centers which will help guide you to additional interesting attractions.</p>

<p>Are you eager not just to see, but to experience first-hand the amazing everglades attractions? Well then, a quick look from a tour van window might not quench your thirst! Get off the road and into the 1.5 million-acre wilderness.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.evergladessafaripark.com">Everglades National Park</a>, the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, boasts rare and endangered species. It has been designated a World Heritage Site, International Biosphere Reserve, and Wetland of International Importance. The Everglades has been a habitat for many different species of birds, animals, and plant life of all types, which are on top of the list of the Everglades attractions.</p>
<p>Here are some of Everglades Attractions that you must not miss on your visit:</p>
<p><strong>Royal Palm Hammock</strong><br />
The first stop after the main entrance is Royal Palm Hammock. It is one of the most popular of the Everglades attractions. This area features spectacular views of wildlife and vegetation, and a visitor center.</p>
<p><strong>Explore the trails</strong><br />
The list of trails is endless and you can choose as many as you like, just don’t forget to try at least one! They are excellent for viewing wildlife, including alligators and a multitude of tropical and temperate birds. The Royal Palm area features two popular trails:</p>
<p>The 0.3 mile Anhinga Trail leads through a man-made canal, providing spectacular access to wildlife, especially in the winter, dry season when wildlife tends to congregate around the few remaining watering holes.</p>
<p>The Gumbo Limbo Trail is another everglades attraction. This half-mile paved footpath loop makes its way through beautiful Royal Palm hammock. There&#8217;s so much to see here. This place is nature&#8217;s equivalent of a museum.</p>
