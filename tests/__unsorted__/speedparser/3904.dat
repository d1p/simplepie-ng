This is why I seek out anything lay-friendly I can get my hands on. Lately, I&#8217;ve been collecting notes on some of the most basic elements of immunology; in this case, it&#8217;s been all about <em>blood</em>.</p><p>In advance of my attempt to explain it to non-scientists, I offer a quickie introduction to the dreaded <em>Prion</em>. Why is it dreaded?</p><blockquote><p>A <strong>prion</strong> is a misshapen protein that acts like an infectious agent (hence the name, which comes from the words protein and infection).</p><p>Prions cause a number of fatal diseases such as mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. There is no cure and potential treatments are highly speculative.</p><p>In recent years, however, biologists have discovered several animals that are immune to prion diseases. These include horses, dogs and rabbits. Nobody knows why.</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s from <a title="&quot;Rabbits are immune to prion diseases. Now one molecular biologist thinks he knows why and says the secret could help in developing a treatment&quot;" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26934/" target="_blank">a recent piece</a> in MIT&#8217;s Technology Review.</p><p>Basically, <a title="Who'da thunk proper protein folding was so important?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding" target="_blank">proteins fold themselves</a>. Sometimes, they fold themselves poorly, like when I get fancy with paper-airplanes. When this happens, they can become prions, and those things are bad news. A creature infected with such a disease experiences nervous system degeneration.</p><p>The University of Ballarat&#8217;s Jiapu Zhang thinks he&#8217;s on to something:</p><blockquote><p>Zhang has simulated how these proteins change shape as their temperature and pH changes.</p><p>His conclusion is that the immune proteins are more stable than the others because of a salt bridge that connects two parts of the immune proteins &#8220;like a taught bow string&#8221;. This prevents them from misfolding into an infectious form.</p></blockquote><p>So salt could be the answer? All I can say is follow the data. I&#8217;d love to learn that someone has duplicated his findings. All kinds of potential problems with our nervous system could be addressed. So, there.</p> <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~4/o9p1mlXQxlg" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/07/those-insidious-prions/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <feedburner:origLink>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/07/those-insidious-prions/</feedburner:origLink></item> <item><title>Another Tufte Class in the Can</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~3/Q1LokV2gDgw/</link> <comments>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/06/another-tufte-class-in-the-can/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 17:59:15 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Matt Warren</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Admin Hacking]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Tips & Tools]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Visualization]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://admintoolbox.org/?p=2614</guid> <description><![CDATA[Last Monday, I attended my third Tufte class.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Monday, I attended my third <a title="Presenting Data and Information : The One-Day Courses" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses" target="_blank">Tufte class</a>. You get the whole collection of his books with each class, so I&#8217;ve accumulated a mini-library, now. Last time I attended, I put together <a title="&quot;Charts, Figures, and Presentations&quot; - download and print it, front to back, on a single 11x17 piece of paper." href="http://admintoolbox.org/2009/08/charts-figures-and-presentations/" target="_blank">a supergraphic</a>, a distillation of all my notes.</p><p>This time, though, I took my new <a title="Learn more about this truly awesome piece of technology." href="http://www.livescribe.com/" target="_blank">LiveScribe Echo Smartpen</a> and recorded the whole damned thing. You can view the result below:</p><div class="pencast"><a href="http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/MLSOverviewPage?sid=qRJCmZz07T8w" target="_blank">Notes from a Tufte Class</a><br /> <object width="228" height="316"><param name="movie" value="http://www.livescribe.com/media/swf/embedPlayer.swf" /><param name="FlashVars" value="path=http%3A//www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/flashXML%3Fxml%3D0000C0A8011500003A9A200900000130A7ED34B8635AFE73&amp;embedversion=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="228" height="316" src="http://www.livescribe.com/media/swf/embedPlayer.swf?path=http%3A//www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/flashXML%3Fxml%3D0000C0A8011500003A9A200900000130A7ED34B8635AFE73&amp;embedversion=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><p>Don&#8217;t think for one second that this replaces the experience of personal attendance. Among the reasons:</p><ol><li>The audio is of varying quality (this was my first major outing with the smartpen).</li><li>You can&#8217;t appreciate the visual display elements, which feature prominently in these sessions.</li><li>You can pose your own questions to Edward (he&#8217;s quite friendly).</li><li>An additional book will probably be out by the time by the next time training rolls around again, which will expand the subjects covered.</li></ol><p>By the third class, it&#8217;s easy to appreciate how the course contents have been refined. New angles find their way into the seminar. Groups of people can have pow-wows and hammer out ideas around the day&#8217;s class. Not that I&#8217;ve, you know, <em>done</em> that (I always fly solo at these things), but I do have ears. Plenty of other attendees do this in the spaces outside the main hall.</p><h3>Most Important Takeaways</h3><p>Please take a moment to appreciate the irony of a bullet-list of cool information from a class where purveyors of bullet-lists should be hung from the rafters.</p><ul><li>The symmetry between producing and consuming is strong. Both should involve the same questions.</li><li>The map is the metaphor to shoot for. They are dense with data but quite understandable.</li><li>To clarify points, <em>add </em>data. Don&#8217;t dumb it down.</li><li>Al Gore&#8217;s iPad application includes&#8230; instructions on how to use an iPad? Uh, what?</li><li>Graphics are not for special occasions. They belong in the narrative with the words.</li><li>Don&#8217;t re-invent things; find and copy. Find and copy.</li><li>Keep multivariate information together in the viewing space.</li><li>Ditch PowerPoint. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has.</li></ul><p>That last point was the most precious moment. We are certainly computer <strong>users</strong> when the CEO of <em>The PowerPoint Company </em>ditches it. Good dealers never use the product. <a href="../wp-content/uploads/Tufte-Excerpt.mp3">Give that moment a listen</a> (and apologies for the quality of the audio and edit).</p><h3>Fly on the Wall Moments</h3><p>As with the last time, I always seem to overhear one consistent complaint: That the class isn&#8217;t hands-on. There are hundreds of us in attendance, and the point isn&#8217;t to <em>make the programs go </em>or to <em>fix my particular chart</em>.</p><p>The class is about glossing lightly over the books, highlighting the general approach, getting focused on the essentials, then leaving us to apply these ideas to our own particular circumstances. These aren&#8217;t classes about software.</p><p>The class is meant to get us to think about design one level higher than we&#8217;re accustomed. When I learn about the importance of removing excess lines, we aren&#8217;t in Excel territory. Striving to see the data and a narrative, together, and undivided by the means of production, means we won&#8217;t be covering <em>Office</em>, either.</p><p>If you are interested in the application of these concepts to the particular problems you face, then it&#8217;s time to get our in-house education departments involved or DIY. Hell, pay me some money. I&#8217;ll whip something up.</p><p>Seriously, though. <a title="Presenting Data and Information : The One-Day Courses" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses" target="_blank">Attend a class</a> when it comes near your area.</p> <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~4/Q1LokV2gDgw" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/06/another-tufte-class-in-the-can/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <feedburner:origLink>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/06/another-tufte-class-in-the-can/</feedburner:origLink></item> <item><title>Where the Bin Belongs</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~3/tM495t7tg_s/</link> <comments>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/06/where-the-bin-belongs/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2011 20:55:07 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Matt Warren</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Admin Hacking]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Tips & Tools]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://admintoolbox.org/?p=2610</guid> <description><![CDATA[Thanks to Lifehacker for making me aware of a cool tool that puts your Recycling Bin in the taskbar.

These standard  visualization formats are indisputably elegant solutions, but  information-graphics professionals should not rest on their haunches and  rely too heavily on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Playfair">form established in the late 1700s</a>.  Instead, we should push the boundaries and explore new ways of  presenting the data in an effort to better engage the reader. Perhaps it  was in this spirit that the proportional circle chart was born.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s quick and breezy.

The obvious use is to make a single button activate a tool or function in a program that can be done with a keystroke combination, ie: &#8220;ctrl+P&#8221; which in most programs will activate the Print command. However, it can be much more elaborate than that.</p></blockquote><p>Looks pretty cool.</p> <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~4/qWKFJFZ-zu4" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/programmable-keys/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <feedburner:origLink>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/programmable-keys/</feedburner:origLink></item> <item><title>Bad Patient Experiences</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~3/WW676sxofZQ/</link> <comments>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/bad-patient-experiences/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 19:00:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Matt Warren</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Lay Science]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Miscellaneous]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://admintoolbox.org/?p=2566</guid> <description><![CDATA[Mark Hurst kicked off the first Gel Health conference with an talk that should be interesting to anyone who&#8217;s had a frustrating experience at their doctor&#8217;s office.

Within the embedded video below, the relevant span of time is between 3:00 and 7:00.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><p><a href="http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/bad-patient-experiences/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p></p><p style="text-align: left;">Simply put, it&#8217;s about Mark&#8217;s awful experience with a few facets of his health provider. They are, in order of gripe:</p><ol><li>Called to schedule a flu shot, was told that he could not pass a note to his doctor.</li><li>Waited thirty minutes to see his doctor.</li><li>His doctor didn&#8217;t actually see him; the attending nurse handled flu shots.</li><li>The attending nurse is curt and impolite; tells him he can&#8217;t see the doctor.</li><li>Can&#8217;t even say &#8220;Please come to my conference on improving patient experience&#8221; because his soul has been crushed.</li><li>Has to wait an extra ten minutes to check out/pay his co-pay.</li></ol><p>The questions that any of us would, right, have are: <em>Do you feel listened to? Do you feel cared for? Was it efficient?</em></p><h3>A Contrast</h3><p>My primary physician is part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and though BRI is affiliated with VMMC, that doesn&#8217;t mean I wouldn&#8217;t call them on their lousy service. But, my experience has routinely been far more pleasant. Contrast the above list with what <em>I</em> have experienced:</p><ol><li>Am always permitted to pass notes to my doctor. In fact, I can directly email him at any time. He, or any other designated person, always get back to me in a matter of hours (at most).</li><li>I rarely wait more than 5 minutes for my appointment.</li><li>Even if a nurse were administering something as routine as a flu shot, I am always permitted to ask to see my &#8211; or any &#8211; doctor.</li><li>The attending nurses are very kind and pleasant, and don&#8217;t treat me like a file to be stuffed in a cabinet.</li><li>I would have <em>easily</em> been able to invite my doctor to attend something like this. In fact, I think he&#8217;d be <em>likely</em> to attend.</li><li>I never have to wait after an appointment. You pay your co-pay upon check-in (which is a blisteringly fast funnel at the entrance to the hospital).</li></ol><p>Now, true, I&#8217;m seeing my doctor in a large campus. Also true is the fact that VMMC has spent the better part of the last decade completely reworking their administrative back-end. But, is there any reason that a smaller, more agile office couldn&#8217;t incorporate, say, basic human niceties into the equation?</p><p>There&#8217;s some data that suggests that <a title="&quot;A small number of physicians generate a disproportionate share of complaints from patients and of malpractice lawsuits. If these grievances relate to patients' dissatisfaction with care, it might be possible to use commonly distributed patient satisfaction surveys to identify physicians at high risk of complaints from patients and of malpractice lawsuits. We sought to examine associations among patients' satisfaction survey ratings of physicians' performance and complaints from patients, risk management episodes, and rates of malpractice lawsuits.&quot;" href="http://www.studergroup.com/dotCMS/knowledgeAssetDetail?inode=236712" target="_blank">instances of malpractice correlate with the user-experience</a>. In this light, improving processes can be seen as a kind of insurance policy. There&#8217;s a whiff of plain-spoken wisdom that I read into all this: people are less likely to sue their doctors if they don&#8217;t come off as distant, pompous, jerks.</p> <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/admin-toolbox/~4/WW676sxofZQ" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/bad-patient-experiences/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <feedburner:origLink>http://admintoolbox.org/2011/02/bad-patient-experiences/</feedburner:origLink></item> </channel> </rss><!-- Performance optimized by W3 Total Cache.
