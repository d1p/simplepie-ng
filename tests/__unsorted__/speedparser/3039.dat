Bradbury&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/?s=J.C.+Bradbury"&gt;a long-time friend and contributor&lt;/a&gt; to the Freakonomics blog. An associate professor of economics at Kennesaw State University, Bradbury is the author of two books on baseball: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525949933/sr=8-1/qid=1152705683/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-3138289-4044941?redirect=true&amp;amp;ie=UTF8"&gt;The Baseball Economist: The Real Game Exposed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sabernomics.com/sabernomics/index.php/hot-stove-economics-understanding-baseballs-second-season/"&gt;Hot Stove Economics: Understanding Baseball’s Second Season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For years, he covered the intersection of baseball and economics on his Sabernomics blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with the new movie &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; out, we wanted to get J.C.’s thoughts on how well the book translates onto the big screen, and whether it does justice to the wonky, sabermetrics approach to baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Economist’s Thoughts on &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; By J.C. Bradbury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was published in 2003, the book &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; generated a buzz in the field of economics because it covered several topics economists like, such as constrained maximization, market efficiency, entrepreneurship, and statistical analysis. To most people, economics is boring: it’s a class they took because they had to. Author &lt;strong&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/strong&gt; introduced important economic concepts through a venue that millions of Americans pay to watch. As a book, it succeeded, but I was skeptical that it could work as a movie. I was wrong.  Even my wife, who only reluctantly agreed to see the movie with me, enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie doesn’t disappoint in covering any of the book’s economic themes, and as with most movies it’s best not to let divergences from reality (&lt;strong&gt;Scott Hatteberg&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chad Bradford&lt;/strong&gt; were regulars on opening day) or exaggerations (the acrimonious tension between general manager and manager) distract from the main point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2002 Oakland A’s should have been doomed. The A’s had a $40 million budget to compete not only with the $125 million payroll of the Yankees, but against 28 other teams with average payrolls approaching $70 million. As A’s General Manager &lt;strong&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/strong&gt;) puts it in the movie (and I’m paraphrasing from memory), “There’s rich teams, there’s poor teams, there’s 50 feet of crap, and then there’s us.” It was an unfair game. Beane informed his staff that if they were going to play like the Yankees off the field when finding talent, then they would be losing to them on the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way the A’s could win in a world like this was to innovate by finding new knowledge about how to win.  Beane turns to &lt;strong&gt;Peter Brand&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Jonah Hill&lt;/strong&gt;), an economics major from Yale who was not entrenched in old-school baseball mentality. (The fictional character Brand is based on &lt;strong&gt;Paul DePodesta&lt;/strong&gt;, a Harvard economics major.)  According to Brand, current baseball thinking was medieval; beliefs about player value were shaped by biases that caused players to be mis-valued. This market inefficiency would allow the A’s to field a competitive team within their budget by buying wins for less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using statistical analysis and ideas popularized by &lt;a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/?s=Sabermetrics"&gt;sabermetrician &lt;strong&gt;Bill James&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but largely ignored by baseball insiders, the A’s found good players they could afford. They turned to three seemingly flawed players—Scott Hatteberg (bad arm), &lt;strong&gt;David Justice&lt;/strong&gt; (old), and &lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Giambi&lt;/strong&gt; (unathletic with off-field issues)—who had one important skill that the market undervalued: getting on base. The A’s found relief pitcher &lt;strong&gt;Chad Bradford&lt;/strong&gt;, who was unwanted because he threw the ball in an unconventional way and not very fast. But Bradford stopped opposing players from getting on base, it didn’t matter to the A’s how he went about doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have criticized &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; because of the A’s focus on sabermetrics, which challenges many tenets of baseball’s hallowed conventional wisdom. They argue its focus on numbers dehumanizes the game and ignores the intangibles that only trained scouts can see. Though sabermetrics is an element in the story, it’s not really what &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; is a story of innovating to succeed, or as Beane puts it in the movie, “adapt or die.” Beane was an entrepreneur who was innovating out of necessity. What he did in Oakland was no different from what other great innovators have done before him.  Famed General Manager &lt;strong&gt;Branch Rickey&lt;/strong&gt; couldn’t afford to stock his club with top players when he took over the inept St. Louis Cardinals, so he started his own minor-league farm system where he could grow his own talent that he could use or sell to his big-league competitors at a premium. Rickey would later move on to the Brooklyn Dodgers where he would lead another flailing franchise to success by exploiting an underpriced input—African American players, who were barred from the major leagues by a “gentlemen’s agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rickey explained why he signed Negro League players like Jackie Robinson he sounded more like a pragmatist than a civil rights pioneer (which he was). “I signed them because of my interest in winning a pennant.  If an elephant could play center field better than any man I have I would play the elephant,” he famously said.  Using sabermetrics as their guide, Beane and Brand found their elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as critics of &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; have been quick to point out, Beane’s A’s have never reached the World Series. In the past five seasons, the A’s have been downright awful, averaging only 76 wins per season. If the A’s had such a good idea, then what happened? The answer is the same thing that follows every great innovation: imitation. The A’s frugal success didn’t go unnoticed or unappreciated despite how much baseball insiders may have protested. Just as Branch Rickey saw his farm system become the industry standard, and other teams hired Negro League stars to bolster their rosters—thereby eroding the financial gains from these innovations—Beane saw his ideas spill over and spread to other teams.  Economists &lt;strong&gt;Skip Sauer&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Jahn Hakes&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.173"&gt;verified&lt;/a&gt; the observation that getting on-base was undervalued in the baseball labor market at the time &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; was written, but they also found that the underpricing had disappeared within a year of the book’s publication. Established sabermetric principles were low-hanging fruit that have been quickly harvested, and now the A’s, along with every other team in baseball, have to find new ways to gain an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; offers a snapshot in the life-cycle of what economist &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Schumpeter&lt;/strong&gt; called “creative destruction,” where innovations replace existing methods with superior and cheaper methods. For example, as the music industry progressed from records to cassette tapes to CDs to MP3s, makers of vinyl, magnetic tape, polycarbonate plastic saw their fortunes rise and fall, while society ultimately benefited from access to higher quality and cheaper music. The &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; innovation was just a step in the process that is ongoing, and we are lucky that Hollywood was able to capture this lesson for us in such an enjoyable way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Freakonomics</name></author><gr:likingUser>16440249485046858414</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17332560357318450333</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17988244417986012539</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>02130055216753335663</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1316890706317"><id gr:original-id="http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike/?p=5923">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92c60dfebff81f43</id><category term="Guest Post"/><category term="guest posts"/><title type="html">The Self-Deprecating Faux Pas</title><published>2011-09-23T12:29:28Z</published><updated>2011-09-23T12:29:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/stuffchristianslikeblog/~3/FOIfEieo5io/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It’s guest post Friday!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Self-Deprecating Faux Pas – By John Ortberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staple for people who speak regularly on the evangelical circuit is the self-deprecating faux pas (SDFP) designed to show the speaker is normal like everyone else. It has to be vulnerable enough to be embarrassing, but not so vulnerable as to get you kicked out of ministry employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is being able to derive spiritual object lessons from such a story, to justify telling it as a ministry experience (much like justifying an expense as a tax write-off for the IRS). With a little practice, you too can excel at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will give you a (true) example from a good friend who shall remain nameless, but who teaches at highly-regarded Christian institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his wife have a cat that regularly captures small creatures and brings them under their bed to put them in a shoe or hat or purse to paw at. On a recent occasion my friend hauled himself out of bed and ‘muttering curses at the cat’ (an important Christian phrase, we’ll come back to that) spent a half hour trying unsuccessfully to find whatever the cat dragged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning he got dressed, put on his shoes that were under the bed and checked once more while down there for the creature—nothing. He spent a normal day doing normal Christian teacher things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, when he took of his right shoe, he thought to himself: ‘that smells much worse than usual.’ Careful examination revealed an odd smear at the heel near the “PowerStep” insole. When he pulled out the insole and grabbed at the smear, he peeled an entire mouse from the bowels of his shoe, completely intact except that, over the course of 15 hours, it had been squashed flat as a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, he said his other shoes do not smell that bad by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you turn this into a useable SDFP? A few critical guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Any story involving death, rot, rodents, or nausea-induction should be immediately tied to sin. Just remember the connecting phrase “in a similar way…” (“In a similar way, we can end up carting around our ego/greed/lust/pride/failure-to-journal/tolerance-for-quasi-universalism/etc. without ever noticing an offense that reeks to the world around us”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Note the use of ‘muttering curses’ at the cat. This is a great example of the ‘embarrassing but not too revealing’ standard. By using the word ‘curses’ you let people know that you are human, but by not specifying which curse in particular you remain above reproach. Knowing how much vulnerability is ‘too much’ requires discretion. For instance, even if you are a pastor you can reveal which curse words you used if you are Tony Campolo or if you work at a large edgy latte church in the Seattle area. But you can’t refer to a specific curse word if you bill yourself as a Christian comedian. It is an oddity of our times that Christian pastors can now use swear words that Christian comedians can’t. Theologically, this is known as the mysterium tremendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. If you are speaking to an older audience, you can tie this story to a commonly-shared piece of folk-wisdom that sounds vaguely Proverbial: ‘Never criticize someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes. Unless they have a mouse in their shoes; then it’s every man for himself.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. You may need to tailor this to your particular audience. If you are speaking to a Christian environmental group, you will want to say that you prayed a prayer of forgiveness for what you did to the mouse. If you are speaking to a Pentecostal group, it may add humor to say that you prayed in tongues when you found the mouse. If you are speaking to a Pentecostal environmental group, you may want to say you prayed in tongues for the mouse to be brought back to life. For bonus points, produce the resurrected rodent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Always be prepared to give appropriate attribution. I think this story was actually used by Charles Spurgeon in a sermon in the 1880’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. A good death tie-in is never fails to touch the heart. You might hold up the Visa-Mouse-Carcass by the tail and say, “You know, you may not reach the end of your life by getting walked on for fifteen hours straight, but one day you too will die. Are you ready for that day? What does eternity hold for you on ‘the other side of the shoe?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Look for tie-ins to some of your other ‘ministry resources’. (You can find more examples of this in my book: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031027592X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=stufchrilik05-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=031027592X"&gt;The Me I Want to Be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=stufchrilik05-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=031027592X&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"&gt;, featuring the &lt;a href="http://monvee.com/"&gt;Monvee spiritual formation tool&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Above all, make sure you have an unforgettable ending for your story. I wish I had one right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Kara Powell and the team at the Fuller Youth Institute have been working hard for the last six years to try to figure out how to help kids have long-term faith, or “Sticky Faith”.  We asked Kara to share a few excerpts from her brand new book to help  parents wanting to intentionally set their kids on a lifetime trajectory of faith and service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a second excerpt from  &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/qF4gX8"&gt;Sticky Faith: Everyday Ideas to Build Lasting Faith in Your Kids&lt;/a&gt;.  If you missed the first, read it &lt;a href="http://www.orangeparents.org/sticky-faith-find-compromise/"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Kids Do Not Feel Prepared for College&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only one in seven graduating seniors feels “very prepared” for what college brings their way. According to students themselves, most don’t feel set up for success in the transition to college. This is especially tragic given our research showing that feeling prepared matters. The more students feel prepared — whether it be to find a church, engage in a ministry, make friends, or handle new choices about alcohol, sex, and parties — the more likely their faith is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Two Weeks of College Set the Trajectory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over, students have told us that the first two weeks at college are when they make key decisions about drinking and other high-risk behaviors, right along with choosing whether to go to church or to a campus ministry. Many of these decisions are influenced by the new friends freshmen surround themselves with and the situations in which they put themselves. Most kids are unprepared for the intensity of those first days and weeks and have no strategy for how to make decisions during that critical time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding and Connecting to a Church Is Difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a church or campus group during the freshman year makes a big difference, but most students don’t know how to find a church in college. Though nearly every parent hopes their kids will get involved with a church during college, fewer than 40 percent of students feel prepared to find a new church. Not surprisingly, finding a church was one of the top three most difficult parts of the transition. For kids living away from home, getting connected in either an off-campus church or on-campus Christian fellowship is linked with Sticky Faith in their freshman year. Yet during the fall of freshman year, only 40 percent of youth group alum were attending an on-campus fellowship once a week or more and 57 percent were attending church once a week or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Daily Life Is a Major Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing daily life is overwhelming for most college students, leaving no time or energy to think about faith. In his study of college freshmen, sociologist Tim Clydesdale found that students become all-consumed with the game he calls “daily life management.” Facing the sudden instability of their new environment, schedule, and virtually limitless boundaries, operating from day to day becomes a practice of sheer survival. Clydesdale describes college students’ new juggling act this way: “[T]hey manage their personal relationships— with romantic partners, friends, and authority figures; they manage personal gratifications — including substance use and sexual activity; and they manage their economic lives — with its expanding necessities and rising lifestyle expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research seems to confirm this. During their freshman year, nearly half of students in our study felt anxious that so much was suddenly up to them to decide. We also found that students struggle most to integrate their faith with their handling of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet both tend to be big hang-ups in college. Given that the average credit-card debt of a college student is more than $3,000 and half of undergraduates own four or more credit cards, these are areas where our kids need help thinking harder about reality. As one college student shared with us, “In high school, everything was scheduled. In college, I was finished with classes by noon, and had all day to do whatever I wanted. And no one asks you if you went to class.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Compared to high school, I now know more about myself and less about what I believe than I used to. I hope this will resolve at some point in my life . . . at this point it’s on hold because I don’t have the time or the tools. It’s hard to find time to think about religion or God, and college feels more like living from one day to the next and losing focus on big-picture things.&lt;/p&gt;

Theological Seminary, was given the title “Professor of Didactic and Polemic
Theology.” That seems a bit startling to
us, because the term “polemical” in our day has an almost purely negative
connotation. However, in the original plan of Princeton seminary, Polemical
theology was seen as a discipline separate from the positive exposition of
systematic theology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander taught this as a distinct course that
distinguished orthodoxy from all opposing views. If you look at the &lt;a href="http://digital.library.ptsem.edu/ead/collection/219"&gt;list of the subjects he
covers&lt;/a&gt;,
it is striking how much effort was given to help students discern and refute
theological error. It is also striking that Alexander included in his course a
lecture on “The evils of theological controversy.” In other words, he was concerned about two
opposite errors—either refraining from polemics altogether or conducting it in
an ungodly manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Gillespie was a Scottish minister, a member of the
Westminster Assembly, and a prominent controversialist, contending for
Presbyterianism as the Biblical model for church government. And yet in the
forward to “The Presbyterian’s Armoury” he wrote, “I have often and heartily
wished that I might not be engaged into polemic writings, of which the world is
too full already…” Again we see neither a shrinking from polemics nor any
relish in it. Indeed, Alexander and Gillespie indicated that anyone who enjoys
theological controversy, who makes it their main purpose and who feels virtuous
as they do it, is in a bad spiritual state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.M. Lloyd-Jones once had a memorable encounter with T.T. Shields,
the pastor of Jarvis Street Baptist Church in Toronto, and a leading defender
of orthodoxy against the growing liberal theology of the churches in Canada.
Shields regularly attacked other church leaders in both his preaching and his
writings. Lloyd-Jones shared virtually the identical theological positions with
Shields, but he believed “that the Baptist leader was sometimes too
controversial, too denunciatory and too censorious. Rather than helping young
Christians by the strength of his polemics against liberal Protestants and
Roman Catholics, Lloyd-Jones believed that Shields was losing the opportunity
to influence those whose first need is positive teaching.” (I. Murray, &lt;em&gt;D.M. Lloyd-Jones: The First Forty Years, &lt;/em&gt;p.271).
We should recall that Lloyd-Jones was quite willing to engage in polemics
himself. He and John Stott clashed publicly over whether evangelicals should
remain in the Church of England. (Lloyd-Jones said they should not.) And yet
Lloyd-Jones opposed making polemics a major part of one’s ministry, and
challenged Shields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their meeting, Shields asked Lloyd-Jones if he enjoyed
reading the works of another contemporary defender of orthodoxy. Lloyd-Jones
said that he seldom read the author, because, “he doesn’t help me spiritually.”
Shields responded: “Surely you are helped by the way he makes mincemeat of the
liberals?” Lloyd-Jones responded: “You can make mincemeat of the liberals and
still be in trouble in your own soul.” This touched off an extended debate. At
one point Shields said that he was only doing what Paul did to
Peter—contradicting and opposing him. Lloyd-Jones responded “The effect of what
Paul did was to &lt;em&gt;win &lt;/em&gt;Peter round to
his position and make him call him ‘our beloved brother Paul’ [2 Peter 3:15].
Can you say the same about the people whom you attack?” For this Shields had no
answer. The simple fact was that his polemics were really designed simply to
stigmatize and marginalize his opponents, not persuade them. Suddenly the
younger Lloyd-Jones appealed to Shields in a bold way. In the 1920s, Shields
had expected an appointment to McMaster University, but theological liberals
blocked it. Lloyd-Jones pointed out that from that time it had changed the tone
of his ministry. “Dr Shields, you used to be known as the Canadian Spurgeon,
and you were…but over this McMaster University business in the early twenties
you suddenly changed and became negative and denunciatory. I feel it has ruined
your ministry. Why don’t you come back! Drop all this, preach the gospel to
people positively and win them!” (Murray, p.273)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the lips of someone else, this could be seen as an appeal
to “just preach Jesus” and not care about sound doctrine. But it is hard to
accuse Lloyd-Jones of that. Rather, Lloyd-Jones was standing in the tradition
of Gillespie and Alexander. Polemics is medicine, not food. Without medicine we
will surely die—we can’t live without it. This is why “polemical theology’ must
be a required part of every theological curriculum. Yet we cannot live on
medicine. If you engage in polemics with relish and joy—if polemics takes up a
significant percentage or even a majority of your time and energy—it is like trying
to live on medicine alone. It won’t work, for the church or for you. That was
Lloyd-Jones’s message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fear that we are in a period in which many in the
Christian church are dividing into extreme positions over the very conduct of
polemics. On the one side there are seemingly more people than ever, especially
through the Internet, engaging in polemics, and yet it looks to me like there
is a large number of younger Christians leaders who are reacting to this as if
polemics is a pure evil. We want “conversation”,
never argument or apologetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next post I'll give some ideas for a way that I hope could help some avoid the polarization that is occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://redeemercitytocity.com:80//content/com.redeemer.blogs.Blog/383/105x64_6108994730_5924b6093d_b.jpg"&gt;</summary><author><name>Tim Keller</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://redeemercitytocity.com/feed/full_feed.jsp"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://redeemercitytocity.com/feed/full_feed.jsp</id><title type="html">Redeemer Content</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.rcpc.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1316474233364"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3512573454578163038.post-8147128954528129927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8abd836126b8f148</id><category term="welfare" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="spending" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Couple stole millions from preschools but who are the real crooks?</title><published>2011-09-19T18:47:00Z</published><updated>2011-09-19T18:47:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WolfFiles12PureHope/~3/Wu2amES11oM/couple-stole-millions-from-preschools.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xfEBk_LKla0/TndP0F8U4CI/AAAAAAAAAy0/3KzYHzHrgXQ/s1600/Money+Hole.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xfEBk_LKla0/TndP0F8U4CI/AAAAAAAAAy0/3KzYHzHrgXQ/s320/Money+Hole.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Drudge links this interesting article: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/nyregion/couple-accused-of-stealing-food-money-from-red-apple-preschools.html?_r=2&amp;amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;amp;ei=5065"&gt;Couple Accused of Stealing Millions Intended for Preschoolers’ Meals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A Staten Island couple stole at least $2.5 million in federal funds meant for nutritious meals for preschoolers, prosecutors asserted in a criminal complaint unsealed on Friday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bad. Throw the book at 'em, but don't stop there. Later in the article we learn this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Red Apple Child Development Center runs six preschools in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island. Between 2002 and 2010, the preschools received $13.5 million from the Agriculture Department through a program intended to help institutions provide healthy meals and snacks to children and adults.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Do the math: $13.5 million in welfare tax dollars for 6 schools over 9 years is $250,000 per school per year to purchase food. Assuming a 50-week calendar, that&amp;#39;s a $5,000 per week per preschool grocery bill. Are these kids being fed steak and lobster?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What's the one thing worse than illegal plunder? Legalized plunder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the sad irony. The predictable liberals will cry Sally Struthers&amp;#39; tears and wail &amp;quot;what about the children?&amp;quot; to justify this outrageous spending. But these kids won&amp;#39;t always be kids. And in a kick-the-can-down-the-road nation with a $14.5 trillion federal debt, the liberals are satisfied to drop this massive bill on these same kids in the coming decades. That&amp;#39;s not compassionate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Time to rethink the Money Hole...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kara Powell and the team at the Fuller Youth Institute have been working hard for the last six years to try to figure out how to help kids have long-term faith, or “Sticky Faith”.  We asked Kara to share a few excerpts from her brand new book that would be most helpful to parents wanting to intentionally set their kids on a lifetime trajectory of faith and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from Chapter 5 of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/qF4gX8"&gt;Sticky Faith: Everyday Ideas to Build Lasting Faith in Your Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Compromise If Your Kid Doesn’t Want to Go to Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of the time I share the importance of intergenerational worship with parents, I get asked,“Should I make my kid go to church?” Believe me, as much as I am an advocate for intergenerational worship, I’m not naïve about how teenagers feel about sitting through church. I felt that way a fair amount myself as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tough question, one I wish we could discuss over coffee so I could ask more questions about your kids and family. But not knowing your specific family, let me say this: while your long-term goal is intergenerational connection primarily in and with a church family, the first hurdle is to help your kid to feel like they are part of something they are choosing and enjoy. Forced friendships do not work very well for adolescents. Depending on the issues your child is dealing with and why they do not want to go, perhaps you could consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Make sure your kids know that, as important as church is to you as the parent, you respect their desire not to go. At the same time, let them know that being a part of God’s family is an important part of your family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Find ways to connect your child to Christian friends in casual or organic settings. As these intentional relationships develop and deepen, your child will have a greater internal incentive to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Find out what, if any, faith activities they would like or are willing to be part of. (I would do all you can to steer away from “making” them attend.) Perhaps a parachurch group, or a different church’s worship service, or a Bible study would help them feel more connected and involved. Sometimes a friend’s church or youth group will become a place where they can connect with a faith community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. In the end, do your best to seek a compromise. Depending on their age and your family’s circumstance, ask your child to attend with you once a month, especially if they are plugged in somewhere else, and to do it out of love and respect for you and your faith. If they are attending a different church, you should probably offer to attend that church with them monthly also.&lt;/p&gt;

And here's why: &lt;blockquote&gt;If we would stop treating Sunday as a second Saturday, one more day to run to Home Depot, one more day for the kids’ soccer games, another day for getting ready for Monday, if we would rediscover Sunday as The Lord’s Day, focusing on him for just one day each week, what would be the immediate impact between today and one year from today?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By one year from today, we will have spent 52 whole days given over to Jesus.  Seven and a half weeks of paid vacation with Jesus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s a good King.  Maybe we should put him first in our weekly schedules.  Not fit him into the margins of our busy weekends, but build our whole weekly routine around him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2287530218309494021-4502697252876312250?l=desperatepastor.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Hoss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://desperatepastor.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://desperatepastor.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Desperate Pastor Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://desperatepastor.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1315949712951"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3512573454578163038.post-7465559157198606582">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6dfc4ec2e1684a14</id><category term="big government" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Obama speech irony alert...</title><published>2011-09-09T11:07:00Z</published><updated>2011-09-09T11:40:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WolfFiles12PureHope/~3/Bw9nm_vfK4o/irony-alert.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/654*368/SGO-power-p111.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="225" src="http://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/654*368/SGO-power-p111.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millions of Southern Californians could not watch the President deliver his government jobs program speech because &lt;a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/San-Diego-Communities-Experience-Blackout-129493378.html"&gt;the government could not keep their electricity on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure the government will do much better at creating jobs though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3512573454578163038-7465559157198606582?l=wolffiles.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WolfFiles12PureHope/~4/Bw9nm_vfK4o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>Milton Wolf</name></author><gr:likingUser>03775952501192645812</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Wolf Files: 12% Pure Hope</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1315949708565"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3512573454578163038.post-5668716587177320993">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72938e3bde969cd7</id><category term="washington times" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="free market" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="iphone" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="big government" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">My Wash Times latest: Obama more telegraph than iPhone</title><published>2011-09-12T11:29:00Z</published><updated>2011-09-12T11:29:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WolfFiles12PureHope/~3/20IFf9e4_c8/my-wash-times-latest-obama-more.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/" type="html">Here&amp;#39;s a simple concept. Why don&amp;#39;t we replace the practices that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; work well with the practices that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work well?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2011/09/09/b1-obama-phone-gg_s160x270.jpg?5d4323c7a5b9a8fed5463b1e7099688c1929b63d" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2011/09/09/b1-obama-phone-gg_s160x270.jpg?5d4323c7a5b9a8fed5463b1e7099688c1929b63d"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;Illustration: Obama’s iPhone by Greg Groesch for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/9/obama-more-telegraph-than-iphone/"&gt;Obama more telegraph than iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Smartphones, dumb laws, failed policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Steve Jobs, chairman of Apple Inc., became a billionaire not by force or manipulation but instead by understanding the central tenet of free-market capitalism: He served other people. Millions the world over have voluntarily handed over their hard-earned money in return for his high-tech smartphone, which ushered in a new age in communication. In some ways, the iPhone is, in fact, emblematic of America itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Compare the electronics sector to any of the most highly-government controlled sectors like health care, education, energy supply or food supply and ask yourself which is doing things right.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The word fascism, before it became a hyperbolic insult, actually had a meaning. The founding father of economic fascism, Benito Mussolini, described it as the merger of state and corporate power. Sound familiar? Read&lt;a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/9/obama-more-telegraph-than-iphone/"&gt; the piece&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think. As always, thanks for sharing it on your blog, Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When confronted with a new idea, do you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the cost of switching before you consider the benefits?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight the pain to a few instead of the benefits for the many?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggerate how good things are now in order to reduce your fear of change?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Undercut the credibility, authority or experience of people behind the change?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Grab onto the rare thing that could go wrong instead of amplifying the likely thing that will go right?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on short-term costs instead of long-term benefits, because the short-term is more vivid for you?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Fight to retain benefits and status earned only through tenure and longevity?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace an instinct to accept consistent ongoing costs instead of swallowing a one-time expense?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Slow implementation and decision making down instead of speeding it up?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace sunk costs?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine that your competition is going to be as afraid of change as you are? Even the competition that hasn't entered the market yet and has nothing to lose...&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasize emergency preparation at the expense of a chronic and degenerative condition?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the best of what you have now with the possible worst of what a change might bring?&lt;/li&gt;&#xd;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Calling it out when you see it might give your team the strength to make a leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
