You can pre-order his new album at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005PTYPBG/thefeedingfrenzy">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://www.macmcanallystore.com/product/MCM-CD4/Mac-McAnally---Live-in-Muscle-Shoals-CD.html">MacMcAnallyStore.com</a>.</p>
<p>Grammy nominated, award-winning, prolific hit songwriter, singer, musician and producer Mac McAnally will release his first live recording Live in Muscle Shoals on October 11th on Mailboat Records.</p>
<p>Recorded live from the Norton Auditorium at the University of North Alabama during the W.C. Handy Music Festival, Mac put together an incredible band of musicians consisting of fellow Coral Reefers (Mac is a member of Buffett’s band) and Muscle Shoals/Nashville session friends in which they captivated the audience.</p>
<p>“Last summer the fine folks in charge of the W.C. Handy Music Festival asked me to play a show that ran the gamut of everything I’ve done,” Mac said.<br />
“In live performance you don’t have to look far for imperfections. I look at the imperfections as blessings too,” he added. “W.C. Handy made a career out of mixing influences from his surroundings and expressing them musically. I share that aspiration and hope to merit having shared the bill with his legacy on July 31, 2010 in his hometown of Florence, Alabama,” he added.</p>
<p>The CD includes his hits “Back Where I Come,” (Kenny Chesney), “All These Years” (Sawyer Brown), and “Down the Road,” (Kenny Chesney), as well as a cover of the ‘60s hit “I Heard It through the Grapevine.” A master storyteller, Mac set up each song with an anecdote and those bites of observation and humor which are included on the disc.</p>
<p>As reigning three time winner, Mac is once again nominated for a CMA Award for Musician of the Year; the awards will be handed out November 9th on ABC-TV.</p>
<p>To watch new videos of Mac performing songs from his new album &#8220;Live In Muscle Shoals&#8221; click <a href="http://www.margaritaville.com/videos.html?ma_id=5&#038;mc_id=512">here</a>.</p>

<p>A wide range of performers — from Clint Eastwood to Jimmy Buffett to Emmylou Harris — are part of a new tribute to the favorite son of Hannibal, Mo.</p>
<p>The CD, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005MR4P6Q/thefeedingfrenzy">Mark Twain: Words &#038; Music</a>&#8221; will be released Wednesday. It tells the story of Twain in spoken word and song, and features narration by Garrison Keillor. Eastwood is the voice of Twain. Buffett is the voice of Huckleberry Finn.</p>
<p>Buffett is a Twain lover — he has paid homage in several books and songs. He eagerly signed onto the project, and his Mailboat Records made and is distributing the CD. Lovell said worldwide release is planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time has not eroded the spirit, force, character and humor of Huck and Mr. Twain&#8217;s words,&#8221; Buffett said in a statement.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.buffettnews.com/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_buffett2.jpg" align=right>From the New York Observer (article by Nitasha Tiku): &#8220;<a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/16/spotify-meatpacking-jimmybuffett/">Jimmy Buffett Stopped by Spotify’s Offices in the Meatpacking District to Meet Some Devs</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you who did pop by last week and wanted to spend a couple of hours there–a very famous American performer, Jimmy Buffett,” Spotify investor Shakil Khan told Betabeat. Mr. Khan, known as “Shak” to his friends, was on the phone from London, but discussing Spotify’s new base in New York (in a charmingly posh British accent, we might add). ”Being based in the UK, I didn’t know who Jimmy Buffett was, but everyone was telling me margaritas and Hawaiian shirts and stuff” </p>
<p>Betabeat was still curious about how Jimmy Buffett had even heard of Spotify, all the way from Margaritaville. “I think one of his people in LA had been using it and said to him, ‘Hey Jimmy, you need to check this out.’ The first time you try it, you go, it can’’t be possible: How can you play music quicker on the internet than music on the hard drive? Obviously Jimmy is very savvy and business-minded and said this is where it’s headed, ‘I really want to know who uses this, what the ecosystem’s like.’ We had a great  conversation. He embraces technology. He’s really into the future.”</p>
