			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><div id="attachment_67803" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heroin-addict-paul.jpg"><img src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heroin-addict-paul-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Paul, 22, heroin addict" title="Paul, 22, heroin addict" width="640" height="640" class="size-large wp-image-67803" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul, 22, heroin addict</p></div>
<p>For reasons far too complicated to explain, I spent part of my afternoon yesterday standing on a sun-beaten, splintered ocean walkway with Paul, a 22-year old heroin addict.  The crook of his elbow was an angry pulsing red, still reacting from where he had shot up only moments before.  He would nod off in mid-conversation, pitching forward until an instinctual state of self-preservation woke him up before he lost his balance completely.</p>
<p>Paul tried to maintain a conversation during his stupor, and I kept up with him to the best of my ability.  We talked about stand-up comedy and his dream to be a tattoo artist.  He talked about music and his best friend, who was stabbed the night before.  Half of his sentences trailed off into the ether as his head dropped, eyes closed, mouth agape.</p>
<p>We shook hands upon parting company, and it took every ounce of willpower to avoid wiping my hand on my clothes.  I knew I could wait until I was out of sight before using hand sanitizer and finding somewhere to wash away that dirty, sick feeling.  Even after scrubbing my hands with soap and scalding water, I couldn&#8217;t shake that need for a shower, even though my rational side knew that there wasn&#8217;t anything to wash away.</p>
<p>On the drive home, I made light of the situation.  &#8220;You know, if you play connect the dots with the track marks, it makes a unicorn.&#8221;  &#8220;Boy, some people take heroin chic way too seriously.&#8221;  My friend said that she never wanted to go back there and that she would make excuses and deal with the fact the he would think she was an asshole for the rest of her life.  I looked at her and said, &#8220;No, just for the rest of his.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul is on his way out of this world.  He hasn&#8217;t hit rock bottom yet, but it&#8217;s coming up fast.  And while I looked at him and thought &#8220;This is his fault. He deserves whatever happens because he&#8217;s the one who injects that shit into his body,&#8221; I felt shame.  Not at my thoughts, because the responsibility is indeed his, but shame at the fact that for every paragon of virtue and human achievement, there is someone like Paul.  Our society advances in leaps and bounds, but we still leave so many people behind. Every time someone like Paul loses his fight with addiction, we all fail as human beings.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>On Thursday, September 22nd, I (along with a partner, Tom Ferme), under the umbrella of our newly formed <a href="http://www.laughfl.com" target="_blank">LaughFL</a> (give us a &#8220;Like&#8221; on Facebook?), created, produced, promoted, and hosted a comedy show at a venue called The Abbey in downtown Orlando.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/facebook_flyer.jpg"><img src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/facebook_flyer.jpg" alt="LaughFL Comedy Showcase in Orlando at The Abbey" title="LaughFL Comedy Showcase in Orlando at The Abbey" width="600" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67145" /></a></p>
<p>In order to showcase the type of audience and talent that existed in the Orlando area, we put on the show for free.  Attendance was free, all the comedians were paid out of our own pocket, and we viewed all marketing, insurance, and other incidentals as an investment into promoting local comedy.  The Friday before the show, almost a thousand tickets were passed out throughout downtown Orlando.  And we were fortunate enough to have Jersey, the Haitian Sensation, one of our headlining comedians, appear on Fox 35 to talk about the show:</p>

<p>The turnout was fantastic &#8211; I think that the final tally was almost 90 people.  It was a success for The Abbey just on the sheer amount of alcohol sales they made.  It was a success for the comedians (I think).  And I know it was a success for me.  I learned a few things for the next time, but I&#8217;m excited to do it again.</p>
<p>Thank you to the following comedians, who are the reason for the success of the <a href="http://www.laughfl.com" target="_blank">LaughFL</a> show, and if you don&#8217;t follow them on Twitter, you should:</p>

<p>My name is Adam Heath Avitable, and I am the world’s funniest person named Adam Heath Avitable that I know of. I’m writing this post today because I know that most of you look at people like me and think to yourself, “I’m pretty, smart, and happy. I’d much rather be funny like that guy.” Funniness is not always inherent &#8211; it can be learned, and with these few steps, hopefully you too will find yourself on the path to mediocre recognition as that “funny [looking] person who was on the local news for public drunkenness and public nudity.”</p>
<p><strong>1. Know your audience.</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re being funny in writing or in person, it is fundamental to know and understand your audience. This doesn’t mean that you have to rely on stereotypes, although it’s completely true that old people like jokes about Matlock and the good old days and prisoners like jokes about dropping the soap. If you are trying to write a funny post, and you know that 90% of your readers are women, topics that appeal to women will be better received. This is why I mainly write about periods, dieting, and hating Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p><strong>2. Find your strength.</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re good at writing biting satire so subtle that it’s almost impossible to tell that it’s satire, or you draw great cartoons of anthropomorphized political candidates, or even if you just like to talk about pooping a lot, you have a strength that you should play to. You may like to act out funny situations on video or in person, or wordplay and puns may be your thing, but stick to it and hone that before you venture into uncharted waters. For example, don’t try to do impressions if every single one sounds like a Chinese man being strangled by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s gay brother. Actually, strike that. If your impressions sound like that, please call me. I will pay to see that.</p>
<p><strong>3. Practice selective word choice.</strong></p>
<p>Some words can be funnier than their synonyms, and you’ll never know unless you try. Boxers is not funny. Briefs is kind of funny. Underpants is even funnier. Manties is the funniest. After you’ve written something, let it sit for a little while, and then go back and give it a fresh look and see if any words make the content drag, and don’t be ashamed to grab the thesaurus if you’re not as smart as me and have a not good word knowledge thingy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write what you know.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a Chinese man who was strangled by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s gay brother, write or talk about that. But if you’re not, you’ll just sound like someone who is pretending to be in someone else’s shoes. The best type of comedy is that which is deeply personal. Observations about ficus plants are great, but a personal story about how a ficus plant stole your innocence could be hilarious. Mine your own life deeply for material.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes. Four steps that will put you on the right path to being funny. Well, funny-ish, at least. And if all else fails, just have something really depressing happen to you and choose to find humor in it in lieu of suicide. I hear that works too.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Yesterday, for the first time, I saw <a href="http://www.themompledge.com" target="_blank">The Mom Pledge</a>, which you can read in its entirety below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I am</strong> a proud to be a mom. I will conduct myself with integrity in all my online activities. I can lead by example.</p>
<p><strong>I pledge</strong> to treat my fellow moms with respect. I will acknowledge that there is no one, &#8220;right&#8221; way to be a good Mom. Each woman makes the choices best for her family.</p>
<p><strong>I believe</strong> a healthy dialogue on important issues is a good thing. I will welcome differing opinions when offered in a respectful, non-judgmental manner. And will treat those who do so in kind.</p>
<p><strong>I stand</strong> up against cyber bullying. My online space reflects who I am and what I believe in. I will not tolerate comments that are rude, condescending or disrespectful.</p>
<p><strong>I refuse</strong> to give those who attack a platform. I will remove their remarks with no mention or response. I can take control.</p>
<p><strong>I want</strong> to see moms work together to build one another up, not tear each other down. Words can be used as weapons. I will not engage in that behavior.</p>
<p><strong>I affirm</strong> that we are a community. As a member, I will strive to foster goodwill among moms. Together, we can make a difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was intrigued by the idea of this pledge because, while I agree with the sentiment behind it, I think it&#8217;s shortsighted to make it exclusive to moms. What about women bloggers who don&#8217;t have children, or dad bloggers? What about asking for civility from everyone, not just the ones with Graco ads in their sidebars?</p>
<p>So I decided to take it a step further. I&#8217;d like each and every one of you to leave a comment signing this, the Avitable Pledge. By doing so, you become an honorary Avitable, whether you&#8217;re male, female, or something in between, with child or without, or any type of blogger or writer or person who interacts socially with other human beings.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Avitable Pledge</span></strong></span></h1>
<p><em><strong>I am</strong> proud to have higher brain functions.  I will apply critical thinking and react with clear thought when I am faced with unknown, stressful or difficult situations.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I pledge</strong> to view ignorance and anonymity as weaknesses.  Those who wield those traits as weapons are to be pitied but they have earned whatever punishment occurs. They do not deserve our sympathy or respect.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I believe</strong> that there is no situation that cannot be approached with a sense of humor. That said, each person has at least one thing that they will never find funny or appreciate, and that&#8217;s okay.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I stand</strong> up against bullying and harassment in all its forms.  I will not shy away from calling out bullies and harassers in public forums, and I will not tacitly support their actions by remaining silent.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I refuse</strong> to apply any standards to others that I will not apply to myself.  Only by striving to be the best can I expect that from any other person.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I want</strong> to see your point of view.  Putting myself in your shoes can be difficult, but I will try my hardest to realize that my perspective is rarely objective.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I affirm</strong> that I will be honest with you and trust you at your word.  If at all possible I will avoid lying and omitting truths.  There is never a good reason to lie and there are hundreds of reasons not to.  If you lie to me and betray that trust, that&#8217;s not my fault.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m an elitist condescending intellectual perverted asshole, but I manage to follow this pledge to the best of my ability.  What about you?  Will you take the Avitable pledge?</p>
<p><em>P.S.  This post originally started as a parody of the Mom Pledge, but then as I started writing it, I realized I wanted to write a sincere post.  For those of you who are getting sick of my serious posts, here is a joke for you:</em></p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ve got to hand it to midgets.  No, literally.  They usually can&#8217;t reach.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Today is the 10-year anniversary of the date that Osama bin Laden, operating independently from the directives and guidelines of his purported religion, attacked the United States by hijacking planes and flying them into the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Virginia.  I&#8217;m explaining it this specifically because for any children who were born in 2000 or later, 9/11 is just a day to them when politicians seem to be more full of shit and when good old ignorant red-blooded Americans seem even more anti-Muslim than the other 364 days of the year.</p>
<p>A decade has passed, and I think that it&#8217;s time for us to do what Americans do best: condense our pain into meaningless symbolic gestures!  What better way to make ourselves feel like we&#8217;re actually doing something worthwhile than to wear a pin or hold a sign or have a moment of silence?</p>
<p>Here are my suggestions for improving upon 9/11 for future anniversaries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parades!</strong>  Parades bring the family together as they sit on a cold sidewalk for hours or gather in front of the television to watch brightly colored balloons representing corporate brands, Rudy Giuliani, and cartoons go down a street in tune to poorly played music by a local high school band.</li>
<li><strong>Extravagant sales!</strong>  Can&#8217;t you just picture it?  &#8221;Our prices are crashing down! We&#8217;re hijacking our dealer and demanding lower prices just for you!&#8221;  It could be the new Black Friday, except we&#8217;d have to call it Nine Elevenganza or something like that.</li>
<li><strong>No school or work!</strong>  I mean, what the hell, America?  There&#8217;s a day off for Veterans and for dead soldiers and dead Presidents and dead black leaders, but what about dead everyday regular Americans?  They deserve a day where our mail doesn&#8217;t get delivered and our bank doesn&#8217;t deposit checks.</li>
<li><strong>Greeting cards!</strong>  Hallmark came out with an entire division devoted exclusively to <a title="The black section?" href="http://www.avitable.com/2009/01/29/the-black-section/" target="_blank">African American relationships</a>, so why not a 9/11 division?  You could have humorous cards depicting the actions of that wacky Osama, and then serious cards with flowers on them that offer condolences or some other type of treacle that is mass produced by people in China.</li>
<li><strong>A song!</strong>  One idiot princess crashes into a tunnel and Elton John crafts an ode to her.  Where&#8217;s the song that makes us remember 9/11?  It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard &#8211; you can rhyme &#8220;eleven&#8221; with &#8220;heaven&#8221; and &#8220;seven&#8221; and &#8220;leavened&#8221;, kind of.  I think that Green Day, Lady Gaga, and the White Stripes should get to work and make us proud.  10% of all profit from sales could go to charity, too.  90% of all profit from sales could go into the artists&#8217; and studios&#8217; wallets.</li>
</ul>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 24px;">Get on it, America.  I&#8217;m waiting with bated breath.</span></span></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Some of you may have seen <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/avitable/status/108512894349611008" target="_blank">this tweet</a> from me on August 30th:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tweet_screenshot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61423" title="OkCupid Tweet" src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tweet_screenshot.jpg" alt="OkCupid Tweet" width="524" height="227" /></a><a href="http://www.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>, the self-proclaimed &#8220;best dating site on Earth&#8221;, is a mostly free dating site that, while completely legitimate for people who are seriously interested in dating, is also filled with people looking for threesomes, married browsers looking for sex on the side, or, occasionally, Nigerian princes who want to give you money.  I had a profile on there at one point and ended up going out with a few people as a result of it.  As far as free dating sites go, OkCupid made me pretty happy, until August 30th.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 30th, I awoke to several emails from OkCupid, all sent to the email address I have associated with this site (my first name at my last name dot com). The first email, sent at 12:55 AM, welcomed me to OkCupid and thanked me for creating an OkCupid dating profile.  Needless to say, I was a bit alarmed, since unless I was sleep dating, there was no way for me to have created any type of profile at 12:55 AM that night.  And I most likely wouldn&#8217;t have chosen this username, either:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_welcome_email.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61432" title="Welcome email from OkCupid" src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_welcome_email.jpg" alt="Welcome email from OkCupid" width="514" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>I clicked the &#8220;Sign in Now&#8221; button, which allowed me to sign in to OkCupid without entering any password whatsoever.  Apparently, the link in this email could be forwarded to anyone, and they would be able to sign in.  I viewed my OkCupid profile that I had apparently created at 12:55 AM, and this is what I saw (click the thumbnail to view the full version):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_profile.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-61435" title="Fake OkCupid Profile" src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_profile-150x150.jpg" alt="Fake OkCupid Profile" width="150" height="150" /></a>My first inclination was annoyance, followed by disappointment.  I get emails constantly from people who just have an overreaching need to tell me that I am absolutely not funny and then they present a treatise supporting their viewpoint.  While I&#8217;m usually flattered that someone would be so obsessed with my unfunniness that they would do nothing but think about me all the time, I usually just feel pity.  Is this the best that they could do?  I expect more from my stalkers.</p>
<p>The malicious intent behind this fake OkCupid profile, however, was palpable, as evidenced from the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for love, just someone to live out my rape fantasies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I really am a freak. I hope that&#8217;s okay with you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Those two on their own are a little disturbing, but pale compare to what was provided for the answer to &#8220;You should message me if . . .&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just looking for something physical and happen to be close by. I&#8217;m looking for someone to fulfill my rape fantasy. I want an aggressive man to just break into my house and go at it. . . Address is: 407 Silver Oak Ln; Altamonte Springs, FL 32701&#8243;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s my real address.  Unlike my previous address, which I posted publicly as part of my Halloween party invitation, this one was not public.  If you were a friend on Facebook, it was available to you, but that&#8217;s it.  It&#8217;s public now, though, thanks to OkCupid.</p>
<p><strong>Someone put my real address, with my photo, in a dating profile on OkCupid, using my real email address, and invited people to come rape me.</strong>  Oh, and they actually sent out messages to 24 different men as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_messages.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-61436" title="Fake OkCupid messages" src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/okcupid_messages-150x150.jpg" alt="Fake OkCupid messages" width="150" height="150" /></a>Realistically, I&#8217;m not worried in any way about someone breaking into my home to rape me.  But what if this was done to someone other than me?  What if someone had done this exact same thing to a <strong>female</strong> friend?  To your sister?  To your wife or mother?</p>
<p>I contacted OkCupid twice through their contact form, asking for the IP address of the person who created this fake profile, and requesting someone from OkCupid to contact me immediately.  That was a week ago.</p>
<p>I sent out the tweet mentioned above, asking OkCupid how it&#8217;s possible that they have it set up so that anyone can make a profile for an email address WITHOUT VERIFICATION! (Go ahead, try it.  I made a test OkCupid profile using a throwaway email account I had, and other than confirming my email address on the form, there was no verification required.)  That tweet was re-tweeted 40-50 times at least.</p>
<p>I have gotten no reply from OkCupid.  Not an apology, not even an acknowledgment.  Not a word.</p>
<p>OkCupid, I expect a response.  I want the IP address of the person who did this.  I would also like to know why you can create profiles without email verification, <strong>why you allow profiles to be published sharing private information such as someone&#8217;s address without any oversight,</strong> and what part of your business plan supports rape.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that I have an extremely actionable case right here, and unless I get a response that I consider, at my own discretion, to be acceptable, this could get extremely ugly. Ball&#8217;s in your court.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re NOT from OkCupid and you&#8217;re reading this post, please share it.  Stumble it, post it on Twitter, mentioning @okcupid (or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/avitable/status/110570589156159488" target="_blank">RT this tweet</a>), share it on FB, Digg it.  I want this post to catch the eye of the company that has decided that it has no problem with what transpired on August 30th.</p>
<p><strong>Edited (9/5/11 9:14 AM EST):</strong></p>
<p>A few points of clarification, based on emails and comments I&#8217;ve received:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email verification would not have prevented this from happening.  I&#8217;m fully aware of this, but this is another issue that should be addressed.  Would you want someone creating a profile using your email address, even if it gave you control over it?  It&#8217;s just another invasion of privacy and poor management on the part of OkCupid.</li>
<li>Every dating site I&#8217;ve used over the last two years does a profile check before they allow publishing of information to ensure that private information is not posted.  Even if OkCupid set up a good search string through their profiles, they could flag profiles for a human to review.</li>
<li>Anything that sheds light on issues like this, that could be a serious and legitimate threat to the well-being of someone else, is a good thing.  I&#8217;m fine, and I&#8217;m not worried about getting raped in the middle of the night, but I&#8217;m not everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UPDATED: 9/5/11 2:41 PM EST</strong></p>
<p>When I returned from lunch, I had this reply from OkCupid:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>My name is Alice, and I&#8217;m the customer service rep for OkCupid. I&#8217;m so sorry that you have not gotten a reply about your issue before now, and I hope I can help.</p>
<p>First- the account in question, gayasssfuck, was completely removed today, and the IP it was created from has been blocked from OkCupid. We can&#8217;t give you the specific IP address, but if you do decide to file a police report, we would be happy to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>
<p>Second- we absolutely do not condone sharing any private information on a profile, including addresses or email addresses. We do remove any profiles that share this information, as well as profiles that are obviously fakes as this one was, especially when they contain references to rape. That is absolutely unacceptable for OkCupid. However, our company is a lot smaller than you may realize, and we do not have the resources to hand-check every profile before it goes live. We rely on a flagging system, where users flag an inappropriate photo or profile, and then it gets reviewed by us for removal. It appears that this profile was not flagged by anyone, and we missed your emails, so it unfortunately flew under our radar. I sincerely apologize for this.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m sorry we didn&#8217;t catch this sooner, and please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Alice</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it would be a safe assumption that the sole reason for this reply, a week after the fact, was the overwhelming response on Twitter and other locations.  I&#8217;m not sure what my reply will be to this email, yet, because it&#8217;s still a poor response that doesn&#8217;t really address anything, but I think that filing a police report may be the next step, if only to get the IP address of the person who did it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Every day I write over 30,000 words, which makes me a <em>de facto</em> expert author. Granted, most of those words are in emails, blog posts, comments, tweets, and instant message conversations, but nitpicking is for children and people who are not expert authors.</p>
<p>I am besieged by requests for tutelage. Aspiring authors contact me almost hourly searching for tips and tricks to being me. As much as it has pained me, I have had to ignore their pleas, until now.</p>
<p>In seven simple steps, I have encompassed all there is to know about writing.  If you can do each step successfully, yet you&#8217;re still not an expert author capable of using phrases like &#8220;<em>de facto</em>&#8221; properly, you should probably become a teacher instead.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Use words.  </strong>Years of research have resulted in findings that while readers do like to look at pictures, you will never amount to being anything more than a cartoonist if you don&#8217;t use actual words.</p>
<p><strong>2. Wear glasses.</strong>  It may surprise you to discover that not only do glasses make you look and feel smarter, they make others around you act less intelligently which makes you smarter in comparison.  And intelligence is directly correlated to proper word usage and better writing.</p>
<div id="attachment_57690" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/adam_glasses_smarter.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-57690 " title="Adam Avitable wears glasses to look smarter" src="http://www.avitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/adam_glasses_smarter.jpg" alt="Adam Avitable wears glasses to look smarter" width="350" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not only am I smarter than you, but I&#39;m more condescending, too, thanks to my glasses.</p></div>
<p><strong>3. Avoid unnecessary words.</strong>  Don&#8217;t use extra words to pad your content when fewer words will still convey your meaning.  There are plenty of superfluous words and phrases like &#8220;regardless&#8221;, &#8220;very&#8221;, &#8220;in all honesty&#8221;, &#8220;pretty much&#8221;, &#8220;apparently&#8221;, &#8220;actually&#8221;, &#8220;literally&#8221;, &#8220;just saying&#8221;,  and &#8220;at the end of the day&#8221;, to name a few.  Also, &#8220;the&#8221;.  It&#8217;s completely unnecessary and you should refrain from using &#8220;the&#8221; if at all possible, just like I have throughout this entire post.  And for a real challenge, try to write without using vowels. T&#8217;s hrdr thn t lks.</p>
<p><strong>4. Punctuation is essential.</strong>  Would you rather help your uncle, Jack, off a horse or help your uncle jack off a horse?  If Jesus makes a sarcastic joke, would you rather say &#8220;Nice, asshole Jesus&#8221; or &#8220;Nice asshole, Jesus&#8221;?  Proper punctuation is key.  Without it, there would be chaos. CHAOS.</p>
<p><strong>5. Blame your audience.</strong>  If you&#8217;ve created a rich tapestry of verbiage with deep symbolism and themes of justice and true love, but nobody gets it?  It&#8217;s not your fault. Take every opportunity to blame your audience for not getting your message rather than making efforts to self-edit.</p>
<p><strong>6. Increase your vocabulary</strong>.  It&#8217;s important and not douchey at all to have a broad-reaching and rich vocabulary.  Why say when you can elucidate? Don&#8217;t shout at someone, ejaculate loudly!  Once you&#8217;ve written your first draft, your next step should be to sit down with a thesaurus and change 95% of your words into their more obscure, multi-syllabic counterparts.  And if you can&#8217;t find a suitable replacement, make one up!  Your readers will find that to be quite fangrubioutastic.</p>
<p><strong>7. Listen to input from specific sources.</strong>  You may think that input and feedback are useful, but don&#8217;t let yourself get side-tracked by listening to inappropriate people.  Your editor, your best friend, your successful author pal &#8211; don&#8217;t send them a single word.  Give your writing to your work&#8217;s elderly black janitor.  He&#8217;s sure to have some wise advice for you.  That homeless person who plays an old violin every day? His input will be worth its weight in gold. A psychic that you called after seeing one of those TV ads?  Perfect!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all it takes. My words should become your Bible. Memorize them, live by them, eat, sleep, and drink them. Before too long, you will be just as successful as I.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>After over 7 years and almost 2,500 posts, I think it&#8217;s likely that I have told you pretty much everything about me.  So, seeing this challenge done by <a href="http://www.redlotusmama.com/2011/08/25things/" target="_blank">Nic </a>and <a href="http://www.justonemiss.com/2011/08/17/25-things" target="_blank">Miss </a>as they participated in some ridiculously titled &#8220;Blog Hop&#8221;, I decided to challenge myself to come up with 25 really obscure things that I&#8217;ve never mentioned before.</p>
<p>25.  I got my very first CD when I was 13 in 1990, and it was a Christmas present from my parents, along with a Sony Discman.  That CD was Wilson Phillips&#8217;s self-titled album.</p>
<p>24.  When I was in high school, for my friend Gjerome&#8217;s birthday, we went to Jungle Jim&#8217;s, a theme restaurant.  For his present, he wanted to see me consume the Headhunter burger, which was a pound of beef, covered in every possible topping, accompanied by a pound of french fries.  I remember the olives and pickles being the worst part of the entire meal, but I ate it all in less than an hour (winning a certificate for a free one on my next visit).  I was so full that I think all of the blood rushed to my stomach to help digest the food, causing me to feel drunk.  I couldn&#8217;t see straight, I slurred my words, and once I got home, I passed out.</p>
<p>23.  Unless I&#8217;m in a rush, I will stop and offer assistance to anyone who is stranded on the side of the road.</p>
<p>22.  I hate closing my blinds.  This was a problem in college when my dorm looked out onto the main campus.  After numerous naked Avitable sightings, the Dean of Students made me see the school therapist to make sure that this wasn&#8217;t indicative of some larger psychological problem.  Obviously, I fooled him.</p>
<p>21.  When I was a camp counselor for a summer, there was a little shithead who was trying to tie my shoelaces together on the bus.  After stopping him twice, the third time I caught him, I gripped him by the arm and brought him up to another part of the bus and made him sit with someone else.  We went to a water park all day where he was rough-housing with his friends and had to sit out numerous times.  The next day, his parents complained that he was bruised on his arms and legs (from the rough-housing) and he told them that I did it to him.  They called Child Protective Services, and I had to leave my job while they investigated me.  By the time the investigation was over, and, of course, I was found completely clear of any suspicion whatsoever, the summer was over.  Those parents also rented movies from the video store that I worked at, and as revenge, I would constantly add a $50 balance due to their account and check all of their movies in late.  It was either that or burn their house down with them inside.  I really liked that camp job.</p>
<p>20.  I used to love black olives until I was around 5.  From that point on, I hated them.</p>
<p>19.  I was 4 the first time I fell in love, and it was with a red-headed girl named Julie Wallace.</p>
<p>18.  There are times that I worry that I&#8217;m borderline sociopathic given my ability to analyze situations and manipulate people, but then I know that the fact that I worry about it means that I&#8217;m not.  Also, I really like <em>Dexter</em>.</p>
<p>17.  I married the first person I had sex with.</p>
<p>16.  When I was in first grade, I went to see a speech therapist because my teachers and parents were worried that I had a speech impediment.  Turns out that I was just trying to talk too fast because I had so much to say.  I think I&#8217;m still like that.</p>
<p>15.  If they made Superman underoos for fat men, I would wear them.</p>
<p>14.  I&#8217;m actually quite a good cook, but I&#8217;m too lazy to plan a meal, buy ingredients, prepare them, cook it, eat it, and then clean up after it, especially for just one person.  Or even two.  That&#8217;s why I limit my cooking to preparing Christmas dinner for the entire family.</p>
<p>13.  I would never do any hard drug unless it tasted like chocolate.  Then I&#8217;d be giving handies on the corner for money to get more choco-heroin.</p>
<p>12.  If I thought I could start my own cult without it ending in mass suicide or an FBI siege, I would do it in a heartbeat. I have a lot of respect for what L. Ron Hubbard did, even if I hate Scientology.</p>
<p>11.  I haven&#8217;t eaten a piece of fruit in three or four years.</p>
<p>10.  As a teenager, I had acne so bad that I took Tetracycline and used Retin-A, and my mother was worried about scarring, but now I have damn near perfect skin with only the occasional blemish.</p>
<p>9.  I&#8217;m surprisingly susceptible to other people&#8217;s opinions.</p>
<p>8.  One of my goals is to be thanked in someone&#8217;s Oscar- or Emmy-winning speech someday.</p>
<p>7.  I would never, and will never, join the military in any capacity.  I don&#8217;t do well following orders, and I am not nationalistic in any way.  Besides, I could learn to live a life with poutine and no Target.</p>
<p>6.  Gore in movies doesn&#8217;t bother me at all unless it has to do with mutilation to eyeballs or removing teeth.  That freaks me out and I don&#8217;t like watching that.</p>
<p>5.  There are times that I regret the fact that the lap-band prevents me from sitting down and enjoying a burger and fries, instead of 4-6 ounces of the burger patty and one or two fries.  Those times are rare, but they do exist.</p>
<p>4.  I have always wanted to be like Data from Goonies.</p>
<p>3.  I believe in soulmates and I think that each of us has more than one out there.</p>
<p>2.  When I like a song, I will listen to it on replay for hours and hours.  I won&#8217;t get sick of it and it becomes almost hypnotic.</p>
<p>1.  I will never be satisfied with making most people laugh or cry or applaud or react in whatever way I want them to.  I will always worry and nitpick about the ones who didn&#8217;t.  If it&#8217;s not 100%, I&#8217;m not doing it right.</p>
