&lt;p&gt;I said your argument implied that people were omniscient because you said reason was sufficient to distinguish between aggression and retaliation. So why did I say that, you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirical knowledge requires some level of induction, as I am sure you would agree. As you failed to acknowledge that a mechanism (or method) would be needed to ensure that relevant input data were accounted for and applied by reason, I inferred that your theory takes for granted that everyone already possesses the relevant data needed to acquire knowledge. That inference about your theory could only be true if a person distinguishing between aggression and retaliation without a means of collecting and confirming relevant data were all-knowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It enables us to acquire knowledge. To say that "reason gets us nowhere if there is no knowledge" is like saying reason doesn't enable us to acquire knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are right. I misspoke. I meant to say data, not knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;long-ass reply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that force used in self-defense is moral. My point has to do with the consequences of when a particular act of force is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, I believe that someone using force against another person is imposing a monopoly, with regard to one another, on the provision of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your definition of monopoly, the logic behind it, would mean that everything every individual does on the planet, are monopolists, because everything that you do, nobody else does that exact same thing as you at that exact same place, and that exact same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bicyclist in your example could only prevent someone else from acting in the same manner by using force, confirming that force is inherently monopolistic, just as someone could only prevent the bicyclist from acting in that particular manner by using force. I keep harping on this point to demonstrate why the state's monopoly on the legal use of retaliatory force is not incidental, but inherent to the nature of force itself. If people are going to organize a common defense, which I believe they have a right to do, they have good reason to ensure that it be able to withstand challenges from aggressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any other economic good, its improper use is not a threat to others. The improper use of force is a threat to others, so it must be placed under objective controls (i.e., outside the market).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will gladly read any response you might give, but I must leave this discussion for now. Take care.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.reddit.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/" type="text/html" /></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317181813228"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/332b571906f80d4b</id><title type="html">Why objectivism, contrary to Ayn Rand&amp;#39;s position, invariably leads to a society with private production of defense, i.e. anarcho-capitalism, and not minarchism...</title><published>2011-09-28T03:50:13Z</published><updated>2011-09-28T03:50:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2n524a?context=3" type="text/html" /><link rel="related" href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="www.reddit.com" /><content xml:base="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2n524a?context=3" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason doesn't give us omniscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn't say it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize you were that bad at understanding arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only because you mischaracterized my remark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pointing out that you seem to be assuming that everyone already knows the facts of the matter on which to base their conclusion. If that is not your assumption, I am asking you for the third time to please provide an account under anarcho-capitalism for the ideal mechanism (or method, if you prefer) by which the facts of the matter in any alleged instance of a rights violation are to be confirmed. I am also curious if you think it would be just to impose by force this mechanism (or method) on those who refused to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are BY NATURE a rational species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by the economic sense of rational you mean that people make purposeful decisions, then I agree. But rationality in the ethical sense is a virtue, in part, because it is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, if people were naturally rational in the goals they seek, why would they have a need for agencies to defend their rights by force from other naturally rational people? I suppose you might agree that rational people can still have honest disagreements. In which case, would you not be impelled to concede that reason alone is not sufficient to distinguish aggression from retaliation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective preference and rationality are not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed. But I don't see how that rebuts my point. Subjective preferences has to do with the goals that are being sought; rationality has to do with means why which those goals are sought. It is always the ends that direct action, not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable part is that you believe that someone using retaliatory force is looking to coexist with the aggression taking place against him or her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, that is all I have to share, and I await your responses to my questions. Thanks for the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.reddit.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/" type="text/html" /></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317093380502"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b6c3670a98876fe9</id><title type="html">Why objectivism, contrary to Ayn Rand&amp;#39;s position, invariably leads to a society with private production of defense, i.e. anarcho-capitalism, and not minarchism...</title><published>2011-09-27T03:16:20Z</published><updated>2011-09-27T03:16:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2mukjy?context=3" type="text/html" /><link rel="related" href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="www.reddit.com" /><content xml:base="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2mukjy?context=3" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "mechanism" that enables us to distinguish rights-respecting institutions from rights-violating institutions is the exact same "mechanism" that enables us to identify a government as a rights-violating institution, namely, human reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that omniscience would be commonplace in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, under a system of competing force providers, rationality will have nothing to do with it. Force will be placed on the market, which is governed by subjective preferences, not rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just force is not monopolistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you saying that someone justly using force is not attempting to impose a monopoly of force against an aggressor (at least for the time being while the aggressor is a threat)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just force can be used by anyone who is initiated with force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed, which returns me to my original question. What mechanism, ideally under anarcho-capitalism, would exist to distinguish rights-respecting agencies from rights-infracting agencies? &lt;strong&gt;For the bonus&lt;/strong&gt;, what mechanism would exist that would not impose by force its legal standards, like a state does, on other providers of force within a given territory?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.reddit.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/" type="text/html" /></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1316966975652"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08e7bc3f1856b398</id><title type="html">The Difference Between A Statist and An Anarcho-Capitalist Society</title><published>2011-09-25T16:09:35Z</published><updated>2011-09-25T16:09:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dailyanarchist.com/2011/08/15/the-difference-between-a-statist-and-an-anarcho-capitalist-society/comment-page-1/#comment-44509" type="text/html" /><link rel="related" href="http://dailyanarchist.com/" title="dailyanarchist.com" /><content xml:base="http://dailyanarchist.com/2011/08/15/the-difference-between-a-statist-and-an-anarcho-capitalist-society/comment-page-1/#comment-44509" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also raised is the looming threat that should such an agency or group of agencies violate their contracts, monthly premiums will stop being paid by their former customers resulting in financial ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me, ideally in anarcho-capitalism what mechanism exists to distinguish rights-respecting agencies from right-infracting agencies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you agree that the intent of using force (whether justly or unjustly) is inherently monopolizing (at least for the time being) and is made with the purpose of putting an end to the provision of force (at least for the time being) by the other party? If so, it seems to me that the state's claim to a monopoly on determining the legal use of force is perfectly consistent with the monopolistic nature of force and what makes it different from any other economic good. So long as that monopoly is used to defend individual rights, the state is acting justly, as far as I can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does not exclude the possibility of private police forces and private investigators, which of course I could see a need for. The role of the state, using objective legal principles, would be to scrutinize alleged instances of rights violations and use retaliatory force against those who have been found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.reddit.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/" type="text/html" /></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1316955608795"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/54fec0223d9d887f</id><title type="html">Why objectivism, contrary to Ayn Rand&amp;#39;s position, invariably leads to a society with private production of defense, i.e. anarcho-capitalism, and not minarchism...</title><published>2011-09-25T13:00:08Z</published><updated>2011-09-25T13:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2lxb6g?context=30#" type="text/html" /><link rel="related" href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="www.reddit.com" /><content xml:base="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/kmydy/why_objectivism_contrary_to_ayn_rands_position/c2lxb6g?context=30#" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would think such interactions would be pretty rare since it would have to take place on someone's property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What I am contesting is the conceptual framework that leads one to conclude that a worker's income in a self-managed firm is a wage. I'm saying the income a worker in a self-managed firm receives is the profit, the surplus receipts from the sale of products over their money costs of production. The article acknowledges the definition I use, but insists on calling that form of income a wage when referring to a self-managed firm. But that does not make sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The income workers in a self-managed shop receive is derived form the sale of products. A wage is the income derived from the exchange of labor. A self-managed firm does not sell labor, but the &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; of that labor, making their income a form of profit even in a non-capitalist economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-profit is unique in that its profits are exhausted by the end of the accounting period. Except for charities, a non-profit's income is still derived from the sale of products and thus is profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think socialist writer have a lot to offer, and I have benefited from their ideas, particularly their critiques of capitalism. I also understand that I share a great number of values with socialists. Nevertheless, I just think fundamental intellectual errors lead them astray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respectfully, I have already addressed the elemental error I believe this conceptual framework of exploitation makes. Are there any postings that address my contention that profit, chronologically speaking, is the primary source of income, not wages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the AFAQ said, "So profits exist because the worker sells themselves to the capitalist, who then owns their activity and, therefore, controls them (or, more accurately, tries to control them) like a machine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply mistaken. In a non-capitalist economy (one in which there are no money costs of production since no goods are bought for the purpose of selling later), all income is profit by definition. Wages — not profits — and other money costs of production are the phenomenon of a capitalist economy. Thus, wages — not profits — are a deduction from the income of capitalists. In other words, profits make wages possible. In fact, the interest of wage earners and capitalists are harmonious since higher profits makes higher wages possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Please note, none of this is meant to excuse the existing economic system, which I agree is highly exploitative.

&lt;p&gt;Agreed, and property is yielded from the purposeful combination of many factors of production, including — but not limited to — labor. What I would emphasize is that a wage is paid in exchange for performance of labor since there are many factors that contributed to the product itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief contention I have with Marx's theory of exploitation, which is what I presume you are using to analyze wage labor, is that he take wages to the be the primary form of income. My take is that profit (the surplus receipt from the sale of a product over its &lt;strong&gt;money costs of production&lt;/strong&gt;) is chronologically the primary form of income, including in a pre-capitalist economy where there are no money costs of production. In a pre-capitalist economy, all income would be more accurately considered profit. It is the existence of profit that makes wage labor — a money cost of production — possible, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anarchism’s goal is a society free of hierarchy, how can you then set up an economic system that thrives on class-based oppression? In capitalism, there will always be an upper class and a lower class, and therefore it defeats the point of anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anarchists don’t oppose hierarchy, only coercive hierarchy. A society in which people were free to compete would no doubt have an unequal share in the distribution of wealth (though it would be far less unequal than it is today under statism), just as there is an unequal distribution of talents and desires, but that does not necessarily make such a hierarchy coercive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12721099979334437031/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">ijustino.whoplanswhom.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://ijustino.whoplanswhom.com/" type="text/html" /></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1313941390510"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1506964b45409007</id><title type="html">Question on Property &amp;amp; Production</title><published>2011-08-21T15:43:10Z</published><updated>2011-08-21T15:43:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/jpkw6/question_on_property_production/c2e3mgf?context=3#" type="text/html" /><link rel="related" href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="www.reddit.com" /><content xml:base="http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/jpkw6/question_on_property_production/c2e3mgf?context=3#" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a capitalist arrangement, it requires the exploitation of another person's labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In defense of my communist anarchist friends, I would point out that the costs of social programs are greatly exacerbated by the state. So in the absence of a state and/or private property, we can conclude that there would be far fewer public goods problems to confront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a democratic government faces a few public goods problems of its own: an informed electorate and just laws. It is not in the interest of voters on average to know much about the issues at hand or the candidates running for office, because his or her vote has almost no significance in the outcome of an election, and even if a single vote could turn an election, a voter has no method of holding a politician to his or her campaign pledges. If we elected the right people and put the right people in charge, each positive regulatory change means that voters on average save just a few pennies or dollars per year.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interpret animal behavior on the assumption that the animal yields to the impulse which prevails at the moment. As we observe that the animal feeds, cohabits, and attacks other animals or men, we speak of its instincts of nourishment, of reproduction, and of aggression. We assume that such instincts are innate and peremptorily ask for satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is different with man. Man is not a being who cannot help yielding to the impulse that most urgently asks for satisfaction. Man is a being capable of subduing his instincts, emotions, and impulses; he can rationalize his behavior. He renounces the satisfaction of a burning impulse in order to satisfy other desires. He is not a puppet of his appetites. A man does not ravish every female that stirs his senses; he does not devour every piece of food that entices him; he does not knock down every fellow he would like to kill. He arranges his wishes and desires into a scale, he chooses; in short, he acts. What distinguishes man from beasts is precisely that he adjusts his behavior deliberatively. Man is the being that has inhibitions, that can master his impulses and desires, that has the power to suppress instinctive desires and impulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may happen that an impulse emerges with such vehemence that no disadvantage which its satisfaction may cause appears great enough to prevent the individual from satisfying it. In this case too there is choosing. Man decides in favor of yielding to the desire concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
