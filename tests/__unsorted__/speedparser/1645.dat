			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a beautiful day and the idea of spending one more summer day locked inside, staring at my computer screen, was making me more than a little unhappy, so we got in the car and started to drive. While the weather is nice, you&#8217;ll see tons of open house signs on every street corner, so I pulled out my trusty iPhone and Realtor.ca app, and mapped out a plan of houses to check out.</p>
<p>Not that we&#8217;re looking to buy a new house any time soon &#8211; first, our house is definitely not in a place where we could even think about selling, and second, I still need that lottery win to get my lake-view manor with indoor pool.</p>
<p>But I always love poking around other people&#8217;s houses for decorating ideas and to get a feel for the market in our area in case we do decide to sell.</p>
<p>So, following the map, we popped into a few houses. (I&#8217;m kind of astounded that a newer house that&#8217;s smaller than ours, with about a quarter of the backyard, but with a garage, which we don&#8217;t have, is going for a good $200K more than what I paid two years ago. ouch.)</p>
<p>Until we got to the one I was really looking forward to seeing. We pull up, check that there&#8217;s a for sale sign out front, and walk in. Yep, lock box on the door, ubiquitous &#8216;please remove your shows&#8217; sign in the front hall, we&#8217;re good. Until we stepped inside. And an almost completely naked man comes running down the stairs.</p>
<p>(Sadly, this was not our first encounter with a naked man while house hunting &#8211; the last time the guy went into the room beside the room we were in and started stripping, knowing we were about to walk in. But he was a renter trying to discourage people from buying the house and evicting him from his home&#8230;)</p>
<p>But this time, they&#8217;d cancelled the open house, but hadn&#8217;t updated the website, so they were still showing as an active open house&#8230; which is why we were there. But seriously, if you&#8217;re going to be sitting around in your tightey whiteys at the time you&#8217;re supposed to be having an open house, maybe you want to lock your doors?</p>
<p>So, we apologized about a thousand times and booted the heck out of there, but I&#8217;m still embarrassed about the whole thing&#8230;. though we can&#8217;t completely be held to blame. I mean&#8230; this is the Toronto area, you don&#8217;t exactly expect people to leave their doors unlocked.</p>
<p>In the end, I really didn&#8217;t see anything I was in love with. We really like the neighbourhood we&#8217;re in,  and the house works for us &#8211; despite all the problems we&#8217;re having (hey, at least we have electricity again&#8230; <img src='http://www.therauchmotel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ). But I did get my chance to see what&#8217;s out there, which is always fun.</p>
<p>So, am I the only one who wanders open houses for no other reason than curiosity?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided, <a href="http://www.getelle.com">being a web designer and all</a>, that having a hosted blog over on wordpress.com was really not the best showcase of my abilities. (What&#8217;s that saying? The shoemaker&#8217;s kids go barefoot, and the web designers have boring pre-fabbed blogs that aren&#8217;t even on their own domain?) And, while I love being known as grammar geek, there&#8217;s more to me than just grammar. </p>
<p>So, welcome to The Rauch Motel.</p>
<p>The name started as a joke&#8230; I used to answer the phone with it when I lived with the parents. Most family members got a kick out of it (yes, you pronounce the name kinda like the bug&#8230; yes, I&#8217;m just that lame. <img src='http://www.therauchmotel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  ), &#8217;til my grandmother made reservations for  herself and her bird, Joey. Two days later, she fell at work, dislocated her shoulder, and came to stay with us for a few months while she got better. My mom forbade me from answering the phone like that ever again. But she never said anything about blogs&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not completely sure about the decor around here&#8230; it&#8217;s a free template that I tweaked a bit, but eventually I&#8217;ll have something new and all me. But it&#8217;ll do for now. And, I&#8217;ve pulled all of the posts and comments from <a href="http://grammargeek.wordpress.com">my old blog</a> and another blog I started and pooped out on, so that&#8217;s how you may have managed to comment on a blog you&#8217;ve never been to before.</p>
<p>But, here we are&#8230; there will be posts about <a href="http://www.therauchmotel.com/2008/03/16/my-hot-dog-has-a-first-name/">our mini dashchund Oscar</a>, who oddly enough is the biggest search term that brings visitors here, about the fixing up T and I are doing in our new move in ready house (the one with no electricity in the top-half of the house, and the kitchen cupboards still in boxes in the dining room), about all things web design, and some grammar/editing posts. </p>
<p>Reservations not required&#8230; </p>
