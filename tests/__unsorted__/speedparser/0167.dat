<p>I realized this week that not having a menu planned really had put my nutrition on the back burner (not that it was that great in the first place).</p>
<p>So this week I&#8217;m looking at some other menus and trying to put together something that&#8217;s easy and has enough leftover&#8217;s for lunch the next day. I&#8217;ve come to realize that there are too many days that my kids aren&#8217;t eating enough at school, and come home starving. I think I can do better with taste and nutrition when it comes to lunch that the school does, by far.</p>
<p>So in no particular order these are some meals I&#8217;ll be cooking this week. I don&#8217;t have a particular day, because here it always gets changed anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li> A large batch of grilled chicken to be used for salads, fajitas and much more.</li>
<li>Homemade Pizza and Calzones</li>
<li>Pot Roast with carrots and potatoes</li>
<li><a href="http://onceamonthmom.com/cheeseburger-boat-recipe-kid-friendly/">Cheeseburger Boat </a>with homemade bread</li>
<li>Potato Soup with crusty homemade bread</li>
<li>Vegetarian Night with roasted Brussels sprouts, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and anything else the kids may choose that&#8217;s a veggie (or fruit)</li>
<li>Spaghetti with homemade cheesy garlic bread</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to get all of these recipes into my iPhone so that I don&#8217;t forget anything when I&#8217;m shopping. (LOVE this app btw!) <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=nrdCmoICCiA&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fmealboard-meal-grocery-planner%252Fid333425918%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">MealBoard &#8211; Meal and Grocery Planner &#8211; Ray Bernardo</a> <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=nrdCmoICCiA&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fmealboard-meal-grocery-planner%252Fid333425918%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store"><img style="border: 0;" src="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-sm.gif" alt="MealBoard - Meal and Grocery Planner - Ray Bernardo" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>I know that I&#8217;ve heard that there are seasons of life. Mother&#8217;s with young children know this more than anyone. I&#8217;m not a mom of young children, I&#8217;m a mom of tweens. That gives me a little more freedom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a WAHM, or work at home mom for those not used to the lingo. I started <a href="http://lifeessentialoils.com">Life Essential Oils</a> a few weeks ago, but its slow moving of course. We thought that things would be settled by now with my husband&#8217;s job, but alas they are not. The question now is what to do next?</p>
<p>We had a huge plan for what we were doing, but with one change in his job I realize that it may not be our season in life to do what really want to do. It kinda sucks. But, we do know that God has the ultimate plan. Sometimes its just hard to swallow.</p>
<p>I made a commitment to myself and a few others last night, and I&#8217;m going to keep that commitment. However there are other things that I may have to change. It&#8217;s so hard for me to commit to anything lately. My plans always get changed before I get started. I&#8217;m in a &#8220;its not fair&#8221; mood. It will change.</p>
<p>So what season are you in?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>This past week had one wall after another. I pushed, and pushed. But I took this long weekend off for a lot of reasons. Lee sent us a LOT of rain. NO outdoor activities or really even trips away from my house. I read most of the weekend.</p>
<p>I did try to change my diet a little. I have had at least 2 salads a day. I missed my salads. I even made my own salad dressing. Yay!</p>
<p>My video still hasn&#8217;t been shot. Rain, kids, dogs, cats&#8230;its been an interesting weekend. We still have a dog that won&#8217;t come home who&#8217;s hurt. Poor thing.</p>
<p>Did I mention that my computer was hacked and we had to wipe the hard drive&#8230;</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s Mamavation Monday is sponsored by a great company that we love. Mabel&#8217;s Labels in a wonderful company and offer an amazing product. Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s sponsored question:</p>
<p><strong>Question: How is your routine changing now that summer is winding down? Any go-to tips to stay organized?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing my goals down for the year, for the week and for tomorrow. I&#8221;m gonna get through this week much better than last week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna work, right?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>I&#8217;ve been praying over this event that&#8217;s coming up. Its an event that officially last 7 weeks, but unofficially lasts more like a life time. This event changes lives.</p>
<p>My husband even agreed to this event before I did. Funny, because he never agrees to anything before I do. We both know how important it could be for us, but I was the one that was just scared to commit to this very, very long term event.</p>
<p>Why? Well because it changes the way I eat. For the 7 weeks I can&#8217;t drink a Coke. (I&#8217;ve done that before, it was hard but its doable). For 7 weeks I have to work out (I&#8217;ve done that before too, maybe not to this intensity, but I have.) For 7 weeks I have to blog (okay, well consistency isn&#8217;t my strongest point there, but I have certainly done this before too). for 7 weeks or more, I have to be on TV (What?! TV?! ok, well not nationally broadcast or anything, just online.)</p>
<p>You see what happened? I talked myself into it. Over and over. I couldn&#8217;t talk myself into NOT doing this. The time it takes to do all of these things is certainly not an issue. I don&#8217;t work away from home and my home based business takes only about 10 hours a week, and a lot of that I can do on the go.</p>
<p>So does anyone know what my big secret is yet? Some of you have guessed, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<h2>My husband and I are applying for Mamavation Campaign #10!</h2>
<p>What I love about this, is that it gives us time to work on something together. Right now he has his thing, I have mine, but we don&#8217;t enjoy each other&#8217;s things a whole lot. Mamavation gives us a common goal. I&#8217;m so thankful that Leah decided to do this for mom and dad teams! I get to do this right beside my best friend! I&#8217;m so excited to share this with you.</p>
<p>So this post has a second purpose. I have to start blogging weekly for the Sistahood.</p>
<p>One of the other concerns that my  husband and I have had over applying for this campaign, is that we are on a strict budget. So when I found out that  Jennifer from <a href="http://www.healthylifedeals.com/">Healthy Life Deals</a> will be on Mamavation TV tonight, I decided that its a must see episode.  She&#8217;s an expert with couponing for whole foods. Isn&#8217;t that awesome?!</p>
<p>For this blogging carnival we are asked to answer this question:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What safety precautions do you take with your workouts?  Any special equipment when working out outdoors?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The only precautions I&#8217;ve ever taken is my cell phone. BUT&#8230;The next precaution that I will be taking this week is my .40 Glock handgun. My husband&#8217;s workboot was hit by a very bad snake this past week, so I don&#8217;t want to have that happen to me while I&#8217;m hiking our trail here on the farm. I need one of those fanny packs from the 90&#8242;s now! lol!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that this isn&#8217;t a problem for most of our Sistahood, but hey its Alabama!</p>
<p>BTW to all of my fellow Sista&#8217;s I missed you guys. I&#8217;ve been lurking, but missed you soo, sooo much! I&#8217;m so happy to be back!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>There&#8217;s been some trouble on the home front. Without getting into a ton of personal details here, the stress level of my house is through the roof. A change in job has us financially stretched to the limits. Dealing with a blended family the first weeks of school is beyond hard. The stress is making us physically and emotionally sick.</p>
<p>I started a new venture to help with our financial problems, but it takes time to get things off the ground. I have great mentors, and an amazing support system in this part of my life.</p>
<p>I think that the problem that I have is that my support system in person has really taken a beating over the years. There are a LOT of reasons behind this, but it doesn&#8217;t help that I&#8217;m sort of a homebody. This morning I asked my nearly 600 friends on Facebook if anyone would like to start walking with me a couple times a week. The only answer that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, was from a cousin in Texas. At nearly 9 hours away, that&#8217;s not possible.</p>
<p>I have a gym membership, I know people that work out there. The problem there is that it costs money that we don&#8217;t have right now for me to get to the gym.</p>
<p>Bottom line, I need money and socialization&#8230;.and to get my sweat on. <a title="Aaahhh!!!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29333334@N06/3796279865/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2444/3796279865_1162a07906_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Aaahhh!!!" /></a><br />

<p>With the stress in my household right now, my husband and I could both use a lot of the same thing.  We&#8217;ve argued so much in the last week that we are fighting to stay in the same house together. I know, all couples do this from time to time. Its just hard to deal with at the moment.</p>
<p>So I came across a tweet about the new Mamavation campaign that&#8217;s coming up. I dropped out of the Sistahood, not on purpose but just from being lazy and overwhelmed by life. To tell you the truth, I miss it. I miss it soooo much that I lurk around the group on Twitter a day or two a week.</p>
<p>So it was just announced that this next campaign is going to be couple&#8217;s only. Yep, husband and wife teams. And I&#8217;m thinking. And talking to my husband. And I mention it to my friends. And I think some more.</p>
<p>I loved trying out for campaign 7. I thought it was a good number. I felt so much better than I had in a long time because I was being consistently active. I was sore from a lot of the things I was doing, but I was also building endurance and strength. But I&#8217;ll say this, I don&#8217;t know if my body was ready for it. I had a hard time, and I know that it only gets worse once you are voted in.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m thinking about signing up again. Not by myself, but with my husband of course. He&#8217;s agreed. But only if I really want to do it. Do I really want to do this? um yeah! Who wouldn&#8217;t?! Having personalized meal plans, personal trainer, motivational coach and more&#8230;its gotta be a lot of help instead of doing it all on my own right?!</p>
<p>The one thing that that&#8217;s holding me back is support. My support system here locally is lacking. I know with my husband doing the workouts and meal plan too, it will help a lot, but still I need someone to help me out while he&#8217;s at work. I have the sistahood that will push me from online. I want someone local too. I really, really do!</p>
<p>I want to ask you something to. Will you help me? Will you support me? Online or offline. I don&#8217;t care. I don&#8217;t want to push myself to a point that in a few weeks I feel like I failed because I didn&#8217;t get enough votes to win this. I can only do so much really. I can eat right, and do my workouts, and walk until I&#8217;m blue in the face (lets hope that doesn&#8217;t happen). What I can&#8217;t do is vote for myself more that once.</p>
<p>I have to campaign. I need people to help with that. people to tweet for me, post on Facebook and even on their blogs. I know that I have a friend or two that&#8217;s already told me that if I do want to do this, they will help.</p>
<p>With the power of social media behind both me and my husband we can do this, right?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>We started back to school last week, and ever since the kids have wanted new after school snacks. Every day the kids ask &#8220;What do we have to eat?!&#8221; Well today  my husband and I took the kids to <a title="MurphyUSA" href="(http://murphyusa.com/">MurphyUSA</a>.</p>
<p>My daughter LOVES <a title="Smart Water" href="http://glaceau.com/">Smart Water</a>, and she was so happy that they had it today.  She loves to take it to cheer practice, or just have it any time. Daddy was glad that it wasn&#8217;t expensive, but that&#8217;s why he said &#8220;Ok&#8221; to the trip to MurphyUSA for our after school snacks.</p>
<p>Daddy even picked up a bottle of <a href="(http://www.facebook.com/vitaminwater)">Vitamin Water</a> for his before night shift tonight. He loves getting something like this before working outside in the Alabama heat.</p>
<p>The happiest of all was Austin, who did a video interview with me about <a href="http://www.conagrafoods.com/consumer/brands/getBrand.do?page=slim_jim">Slim Jim.</a> This kid had a blast, and really is a Slim Jim lover, as is everyone else in our family.</p>

<p>I was asked what my values are about a week ago, and well I knew but how do you put something like that on paper.  Of course the first thing I thought of  was my Faith. Then I started panicking. I&#8217;m so bad at this type of thing, I needed ideas.</p>
<p>So I asked around and 2 others were kinda in my same boat. LaDonna from Just Our Thoughts sent me some links that talked about finding your values. I later did some research on my own and let me just say, there are a lot of long lists out there.</p>
<p>So I know when you finish this you are gonna do the same thing. Google list of values and see what you come up with. Just remember that you don&#8217;t want to get real specific. Think about it like this. You want your list of values to have &#8220;Family&#8221; not &#8220;spending one on one time with my children&#8221;. Clear as mud?</p>
<p>One of the things you can do is make a huge list of what you value. Then think of what things go together. If you have 5 things that all go under &#8220;Family&#8221; then make a new list that&#8217;s more Macro than Micro.</p>
<p>My list of values may or may not be the same as yours, but what I do suggest is to take your final list and pick out what the top few are. I picked 3. This isn&#8217;t written in stone, but its really not something that you can goof up that bad. You can always change this later if you feel like something doesn&#8217;t belong there or something else you didn&#8217;t think you valued enough to make your Top Values List.</p>
<h2>My Top 3 Values</h2>
<h3>
<ol>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Achievement</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>The driving force in my life, no matter if I have tried to put it on the back burner or not is my faith. My family is second only because I cannot appreciate or love my family without my faith in God. My 3rd value is achievement. As much as I&#8217;d like to say it isn&#8217;t, that does have some financial undertones, but I do not only want to have financial achievements. I value achieving anything for the first time whether its getting a new plugin to work for my blog or a new recipe that my family loves. I value achievement in a lot of areas of my life.</p>
<p>Please share your values with us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>This is a Sponsored post written by me on behalf of <a href="http://app.socialspark.com/disclosure_clicks?oid=4562302" rel="nofollow">UPromise</a> for <a href="http://izea.in/rJC2" rel="nofollow">SocialSpark</a>. All opinions are 100% mine.</p>
<p>
	Upromise is celebrating their 10th anniversary! Yep, I was in college before they even started, but you know what, I still use Upromise!</p>
<p>
	For their anniversary, Upromise&nbsp;is giving away $20,000! Wowzer! That&#8217;s a lot of money when it comes to a college education.</p>
<p>
	Ten winners will receive $1,000 and 1 grand prize winner will win $10,000. Yep, I&#8217;d love to put that on my student loans about now!</p>
<p>
	I know that most of you are parents and/or have student loans that you&#8217;re paying off yourself, right? That&#8217;s where I am, I have to student loan and I have kids that will be in college in a few years. Boy, winning this contest would help our family so much!</p>
<p>
	Yep, its a contest. Wanna know more? Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://app.socialspark.com/clicks?lid=14102&amp;oid=4562302" rel="nofollow">www.upromisetodream.com</a>&nbsp; and submit your dream to win one of the above prizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What is your dream? I know that my dream is to finish those few (4) classes to finish my degree and walk onto that state to get my diploma. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve never done, due to being a pregnant teen and not being allowed to walk across that stage. At 32, it is still my dream! One day its gonna&nbsp;happen! My kids will be so proud of me. <img src='http://www.polkaspotfarm.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>
	Don&#8217;t hesitate! Run write down your dreams. Share them with Upromise&nbsp;and maybe you will win. So what dreams do you have right now? Do you want to go back to school? Do you have dreams of your child graduating from Harvard? Let me know, I know you will!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>This is a Sponsored post written by me on behalf of <a href="http://app.socialspark.com/disclosure_clicks?oid=4205292" rel="nofollow">Zenni Optical</a> for <a href="http://izea.in/rJC2" rel="nofollow">SocialSpark</a>. All opinions are 100% mine.</p>
<p>
	In today&#8217;s economy we are all trying to save money on everything. This is why I find it outrageous that Time editor Bill Saporito&nbsp;spent one THOUSAND DOLLARS on a pair of eyeglasses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Check out this article in&nbsp;<a href="http://app.socialspark.com/clicks?lid=12312&amp;oid=4205292" rel="nofollow">Time magazine</a>&nbsp;that shows the rebuttal of one of Time&#8217;s readers reccomending&nbsp;<a href="http://app.socialspark.com/clicks?lid=12302&amp;oid=4205292" rel="nofollow">Zenni Optical</a>. This reader talks about his glasses that cost him 20.00 with shipping included, and they were deliverd to his door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">So in essence I&#8217;m thinking that we will be saving <span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space: nowrap;">$980.00!!!</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
	Why would anyone turn down this offer? Seriously, this deal is withing my budget, even with the new tweaks we&#8217;ve been having to make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Personally, I know that glasses have ran me around 200.00 a pair in the past, at 90% savings, I can&#8217;t ever see myself getting glasses in a bricks and mortar store again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So let me see. We have 4 in my family that need glasses before Fall. At the savings of up to 980.00 a person that totals up to&#8230;..</p>
<h2>
	<strong>$3,920.00 in savings on a family of 4.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>
	Well, maybe. I&#8217;d guess it would be around $720 in a normal family with normal spending habits!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What I really like about&nbsp;<a href="http://app.socialspark.com/clicks?lid=12302&amp;oid=4205292" rel="nofollow">Zenni Optical</a>, is that we can afford to have different styles and extras in case someone left their glasses at their other parent&#8217;s house or at school. This really pays off in my book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had a huge offer given to us several days ago, but before we chose to take this offer it was taken away. The decision was certainly a life changer. We are now a little disappointed that we have to settle for what we have.</p>
<p>Do you ever think that you are just settling for the hand that was dealt? Do you want to keep the same lifestyle that you have now? Would you rather upgrade your car, or be able to stay home with your kids?  Would you like to feed your family grass fed beef and organic veggies? Vacation every year at Disney and a week or two at the beach? All these things take a little extra money, right?</p>
<p>I know that if I settle, those things are possible for my family in the near future. I know that I want more for my family than we have right now.</p>
<h2>How do you change your future?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asking this for a few weeks now. My friend <a href="http://themilesbacktoyou.com/">Amber</a> has had her entire life turned upside down. Loosing her husband really devastated her and her family. I&#8217;m so proud of her for pulling herself up by her bootstraps and taking charge of her future. She has a new home and a new career. She&#8217;s now the proud new small business owner. Amber didn&#8217;t settle for the hand that was dealt her. She took the bull by the horns and is fighting for her future. And you know what, she seems so happy to be working all the hours God sends her for what she wants. Its really awesome to see how far she has come, I can&#8217;t wait to see how her future adds up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting on a plan for our life. I&#8217;m working on documenting my personal goals, financial goals and family goals. This is something I&#8217;ve never done before. I know that may sound crazy, but goals have never been my thing. I&#8217;ve never liked goals because they were so far-fetched. There was never a plan put in place to reach my goals. I never realized that before now.</p>
<h2>I can&#8217;t have goals without a plan to reach those goals!</h2>
<p>So while I work on my goals, and my plan to reach them I urge you to do the same thing. Write down your goals! Make a plan on how you can reach your goals! Your family&#8217;s future is in your hands. I truly believe this, and I&#8217;m going to be right here beside you doing the same thing.</p>
