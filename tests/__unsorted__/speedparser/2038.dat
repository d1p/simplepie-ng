			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I chose to create a billboard series for the Toledo Zoo. There are several audiences that the Toledo Zoo could reach out to through these billboards, such as families, children, adults, or schools. The billboard series I am creating will be targeted to parents of young children. The Toledo Zoo currently has two new &#8220;children&#8221; at their zoo, so the goal is to attract the attention of parents and bring their kids to the zoo to see the new zoo babies. I am going to use the phrase &#8220;Our kids are wild too&#8221; on all three billboards with large images of exotic animals doing something funny or looking goofy. I imagine that a lot of parents will be driving around town or on the highway with their kids in the car. If you have ever been in a car with children you know that it can create a pretty wild ride. I think these billboards will attract parents and their children.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a lot of contemplation I decided to focus on coffee displays for this project. I started off by going around to a bunch of different coffee shops and checking out how the industry was displaying their products. The first place I visited was a Starbucks inside of Target. This Starbucks had their bags of coffee on a circular, rotating display. I thought this was an effective display for this small Starbucks location.  It does not take up too much space and it is interactive, which adds to the experience of finding the “perfect” coffee.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Starbucks1_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Starbucks1_web.jpg" alt="Starbucks Display 1" width="290" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>I also went to a rather large, 2-story Starbucks to see how they displayed their products. This location had much more room to work with and used a wooden bookshelf to display their coffee, mugs, and other products. While this display is rather simple, it is attractive, informative, and keeps the focus on the products. It is easy to see the different sections of products and learn more about the different types of coffee.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Starbucks2_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Starbucks2_web.jpg" alt="Starbucks Display 2" width="432" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>Another place I visited was Caribou Coffee and they had a display similar to Starbucks. Their display was much more fun and colorful. I think this display did a much better job of catching my eye. It made me interested in looking at their products and learning more about them.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Caribou2_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Caribou2_web.jpg" alt="Caribou Display 1" width="290" height="432" /></a><a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Caribou1_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Caribou1_web.jpg" alt="Caribou Display 2" width="290" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I checked out Dunkin Donut’s coffee display. Theirs was similar to the smaller Starbucks display, but larger and cheaper looking. I don’t think the coffee is displayed horribly, but it could definitely be better. It looks like the stand was just ordered out of a catalogue and wasn’t made to attract consumers. It does not rotate like the Starbucks display did, so it was placed awkwardly in a random spot.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/DunkinDonut1_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/DunkinDonut1_web.jpg" alt="Dunkin Donut Display" width="290" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>The last place I visited was a local coffee shop in Cleveland called The Root Café. After checking out their coffee display I decided I would do my project for this place. They had a rather creative and fun display but it was cluttered and unorganized. The huge white tags were overpowering and took away from the nice display of jars.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Root1_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2010/08/Root1_web.jpg" alt="Root Cafe Display" width="432" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>The Root Café is a unique local business that sells fair-trade and local coffee. It has a very relaxed and natural vibe that makes you feel like you could hang out there all day. There are a lot of art installations and all of the counters and furniture are made of wood. For the display I wanted to design something that went along with the current style of the café. I want to use something made of wood or looks like a tree because of the natural products they use and to go along with the name, The Root Café. Below are some of the ideas I had:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2011/09/thumbnails.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2011/09/thumbnails-744x1024.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="737" /></a>After sketching out my ideas, I decided to elaborate on the two that I thought would be most effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2011/09/comps.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16" src="http://blogs.bgsu.edu/samstep/files/2011/09/comps-790x1024.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="717" /></a>I&#8217;m not sure which one I want to go with yet, but I think they would both fit well at The Root Café. The first sketch is more fun and outdoorsy and the second one is more simple and organized. I think they both would catch customers attention and make them want to buy coffee grounds rather than just one cup.</p>
