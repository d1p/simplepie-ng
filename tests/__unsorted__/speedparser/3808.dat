			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An hour ago, <a href="http://redfin.com">Redfin</a> released a massively disruptive enhancement to its website.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.redfin.com/real-estate-agents/search-scouting-report">Agent Scouting report</a> and it allows users to view complete sales and performance histories for every agent in the markets in which Redfin operates.</p>
<p><em>Every agent</em>.</p>
<p>While others have done a bit of this (<a href="http://neighborcity.com">Neighborcity</a>, most notably), Redfin goes for the Full Monty, exposing not only recent sales histories, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>A map of active listings</li>
<li>A map with buyer deals over the past 12 months</li>
<li>A map with seller deals over the past 12 months</li>
<li>The agent&#8217;s average sales price</li>
<li>The agent&#8217;s average price reduction on his or her listings</li>
<li>Transactions on which the agent practiced dual agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone, not just Redfin clients, can access this data.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago the team at <a href="http://www.diversesolutions.com/">Diverse Solutions</a>, an IDX vendor, demoed something they called, interestingly, &#8220;<a href="http://www.diversesolutions.com/announcements/agent-scouting-report-an-experiment-in-transparancy-460">Agent Scouting Report</a>&#8221; at a hack-a-thon I moderated during the Inman show. It was similar, and it never saw the light of day. Houston Association of Realtors CEO Bob Hale, inspired in part by this, <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2010/04/bob-hale-is-sticking-his-neck-out-whos-got-his-back.html">released an association-controlled attempt</a> a year later. It lasted all of a week before backlash brought it down.</p>
<p>It was coming anyway. It was just a matter of where. As Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman writes in the blog post announcing Scouting Report:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;as brokers we can’t pretend that refusing to provide this information won’t just leave it for other websites, with pay-to-play business models, to create only a partial directory, with less reliable data.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So they did it. And did it well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to debate here. Whether or not MLS data should be used this way. The merits of the Redfin business model. The fine line between transparency and stupidity.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be clear: this is a big deal. In fact, I can&#8217;t think of another online real estate development in the past three years that is quite this disruptive. Selling ads around listings and getting a gazillion uniques is not inherently disruptive. It simply moves marketing dollars and rattles the value chain a bit.</p>
<p>This is something of a different order.</p>
<p>You might wonder, too: doesn&#8217;t this hurt Redfin? Their agents are going to come up short against agents at other companies in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Kelman&#8217;s answer:</p>
<p><em>In some cases, what you’ll see is that an agent at another brokerage is a better fit for that neighborhood, an inevitability that has been a source of great controversy within Redfin. Why would we ever help anyone realize that a Coldwell Banker agent is her best choice?</em></p>
<p><em>But once you ask that question, you’ve already framed the debate in terms of short-term consequences rather than <a href="http://blog.redfin.com/blog/2009/10/do_the_right_thing.html">long-term principles</a>. It leads you down a path where every market analysis concludes that it’s a good time to buy, and every review of a Redfin agent is five-stars.</em></p>
<p><em>The world doesn’t need more brokers like that. It needs a broker who will just tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. We’ll win more clients that way than we’ll lose — and we’ll win everyone’s trust.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I’m thinking about MLS these days, A.) Because I am speaking at the <a href="http://www.cmls2011.com/">CMLS conference</a> next week, and B.) To my mind, there is little that is more important to the future of real estate than the improvement of the MLS system.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Below, I lay out a complaint. If you’ve read this blog for a while, it will be familiar. Bear with me. I’ll follow this with a second post that lays out a concrete idea addressing part of that complaint. Look for it in the next few days.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-6799"></span></p>
<p><strong>Part I: You don’t get it</strong></p>
<p>When I speak to people in and around the MLS industry I hear a lot of this:</p>
<p><em>Great idea, but it’ll never happen.</em></p>
<p><em>______________________ is already working on that. He’s got [tired-ass vendor] and [out-of-their-depth guy] together and it’s gonna be cool.</em></p>
<p><em>You don’t know what you’re talking about. You just don’t get it.</em></p>
<p><em>[MLS CEO X] would never give [MLS CEO Y] an edge by working together on that.</em></p>
<p><em>Settle down. If the market wanted something different, we’d see something different.</em></p>
<p><em>You wanna grab a drink?</em></p>
<p><strong>Call me clueless</strong></p>
<p>I dunno. Maybe I <em>am </em>out to lunch. But I believe in my bones that the MLS system of today is broken. Worse than broken, really. It’s a little dangerous. Like a leaky boat in rough seas.</p>
<p>How is it broken?</p>
<p>Data stuffed into 900 cubbyholes is broken.</p>
<p>A Kafkaesque compliance process is broken.</p>
<p>A governance structure demanding deep study of Kremlinology to navigate is broken.</p>
<p>A piece of killer software like <a href="http://cloudcma.com">Cloud CMA</a> getting into Realtors&#8217; hands one MLS policy gauntlet at a time is broken.</p>
<p>A system that requires, anywhere, <a href="http://bit.ly/oAhPNY">12 MLS tabs on one search results page</a> is, for the love of god, broken.</p>
<p>I spend my working life side-by-side with real estate brands, brokerages and technology innovators getting killed by this stuff. I’m not making it up for the sake of a blog post. It’s real.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>some</em> <a href="http://www.inman.com/news/2011/08/8/arizona-moving-forward-with-statewide-mls">visionaries</a> are laying <a href="http://www.inman.com/news/2011/08/19/2-california-mlss-merge-become-largest-in-nation">new foundations</a> or advancing the technology standard <a href="http://www.flexmls.com/news/05-02-2011-fbs-releases-idx-wordpress-plugin-and-api/">past</a> 1995. Most of the MLS leaders I talk to are smart, dedicated people. But the fix-up job isn’t happening fast enough.</p>
<p>What’s going to happen if the thing finally breaks down?</p>
<p>People will get hurt. The practitioner. The broker. An industry struggling to get back on its feet.</p>
<p>We can’t have that.</p>
<p>A few times in my life, coming or going somewhere, I’ve seen the charred frame of an RV along the side of the highway. I think about the family or the retired couple that was comfortably transported for years in this shelter, confident in its worthiness to get them where they wanted to go.</p>
<p>But maintenance was deferred. And a valve ruptures. The propane leaks. A wire is frayed. And the son of a bitch explodes.</p>
<p>It’s terribly sad.</p>
<p>No matter how many times people tell me I don’t get it, or I am naïve, I still can’t settle in my mind how this system<em> isn’t</em> headed down the same road.</p>
<p><strong>Get real</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>So enough complaining. What I want to do is put an idea out there. Something that’s been kicking around my head for about a year. I’ve heard variations of it from others, and part of it has already been productized. I can’t lay claim to it, but I want to air it out.</p>
<p>Please tell me if it makes sense. Or if you think it makes no sense. If I’m missing, yet again, some reality that lies beyond my understanding.</p>
<p>But either way, would you humor me and tell my how, possibly, in my fantasy world, this <em>could</em> come about?</p>
<p>I’ll try and be clear. And I will miss some things. Because I don’t know all the details. And I certainly don’t have all the answers.</p>
<p>But I do trust my eyes, my ears and my gut.</p>
<p>We need to do <em>something</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something Brian wrote yesterday really resonated with me:</p>
<p><em>This also begs the question: why doesn’t a major real estate brand have a Chief Economist?</em></p>
<p>No brainer really. They should. But it also got me thinking&#8230; who else is missing?</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-6788"></span>Web/Rails developer</strong></p>
<p>Brokerage IT operations seem woefully out-of-date these days. Typically, they’ve been structured to handle basic network administration and PC support duties. In today’s world, where “the Cloud” reigns and the devices agents use get simpler and more user friendly (think smartphones and tablets) who needs this all this infrastructure and headache anymore?</p>
<p>Instead, hire a kick-ass developer &#8212; someone familiar with the new frameworks powering the web (Rails, HTML5, etc). I’d listen to my agents’ needs and have this person start churning out great tools for them. Heck, I’d even start listening to consumers and start banging out great apps for them too.</p>
<p><a href="http://mportlandhomes.com/">mRealty</a> is doing this. I find it staggering so few others are.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, this person should be part of the <em>marketing department</em>. All of this needs to be driven by the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Online video producer</strong></p>
<p>Video. Another hot buzzword right now. So far, it seems, the discussion has revolved around agents arming themselves with a Flip camera and taking to the streets. But I’m gonna come right out and say it&#8230;</p>
<p>Most of this is garbage.</p>
<p>Your agents shouldn’t be shooting video. You need one guy or gal with a film school degree, a HD camera, a (legit) copy of Final Cut, a Macbook Pro, some chops and an imagination. Set them free and have them start shooting every angle of the community you live and work in. Demand a video a week from them.</p>
<p>Flood your Vimeo channel.</p>
<p>Take a look at what Houlihan Lawrence has done with their <a href="http://houlihanlawrence.com/hltv.aspx">community video series</a>. Rinse. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Social media producer</strong></p>
<p>Ooh boy. Tough one here. The mere mention of these words is enough to send any sane broker into synaptic paroxysms. So much snake oil has been tossed so flagrantly across this space that it’s doused sensible strategy.</p>
<p>But it can be done. Even a century old brand like Ford, parked in the middle of the rust belt, can summon some social media mojo. First, you need someone who can <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/08/writing.html">write</a>. Then they need to come up with a content strategy and find a voice that fits with your brand.</p>
<p>Start by mining the depths of real estate for content. Look what Zillow does with their <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/">blog</a>. Or Realtor.com does with <a href="http://www.realtor.com/blogs/">theirs</a>. This isn’t rocket science, folks.</p>
<p>If you can tough it out, you can begin to build an audience and start to imbue some deeper meaning to your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Art director/graphic designer</strong></p>
<p>Hire someone who truly <em>gets</em> great design. Require they have a gorgeous portfolio before they even step through the door. Reign in the Wild West of agent-produced marketing materials and start enforcing fanatical brand standards. Make sure everything gets run through this individual.</p>
<p>When I worked in the design department at Nike, there was one individual whose <em>sole</em> responsibility was ensuring that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoosh">Swoosh</a> size and placement was correct. On everything. Hanger tags, Powerpoint presentations, t-shirt and apparel designs. Everything had to have his sign-off.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy. But there is a very real reason that the Nike mark has so much brand value.</p>
<p><strong>Email marketing specialist</strong></p>
<p>Take all the content your new Chief Economist and marketing team are developing and tell the world. Don’t be shy.</p>
<p>Hire someone who knows what list segmentation, A/B split testing and open rates <em>really</em> mean. Set up a coordinated schedule of email blasts to different types of readers. Run a mix of content and seasonal promotional emails. Obsess over the results. Never stop fiddling and testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redfin.com/home">Redfin</a> does this probably better than anyone else in the space with their Sweet Digs newsletter. <a href="http://www.redfin.com/stingray/do/sweet-digs?src=homepage">Sign up yourself</a> and see what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>- &#8211; -</p>
<p>Five people. And hey, if you’re really lucky, you might fight someone who straddles a couple of these roles.</p>
<p>Five people. People who could make an immediate difference in your organization and set you on a path where real brand value begins to get communicated to the real estate consumers in your market.</p>
<p>Five people.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://marketleader.com">Market Leader</a> has <a href="http://investor.marketleader.com/file.aspx?IID=4133830&amp;FID=11766434">acquired</a> the <a href="http://www.realestate.com/">realestate.com</a> domain from <a href="http://www.iac.com/">IAC</a> spin-off <a href="http://tree.com">Tree.com</a>. This, I think, is a good move in the context of their stated objective – a “click to close” software platform.</p>
<p>The realestate.com domain is like one of those 18 year-old minor league phenoms who for whatever reason – injuries, attitude, bad luck – never quite fulfills his promise in the bigs. The history of this domain is too long to lay out here, but it’s a woulda-coulda-shoulda story.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I don’t expect to see Market Leader develop a full search/portal site on the domain. That’s brutally expensive and there’s plenty of that already. I suspect they’ll dust it off, polish it a bit and throw the traffic to customer sites they host. Something like <a href="http://homegain.com">HomeGain’s</a> BuyerLink product back in the day.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Trulia <a href="http://www.truliablog.com/2011/09/20/trulia-chief-economist-jed-kolko/">hired a Chief Economist</a>. I know: “<a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/">me too</a>,” right? Sure it is. But that doesn’t make it stupid. What Zillow demonstrated by hiring <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/category/about-us/">Stan Humphries and team</a> and churning out a ton of research is that content, expertise and authority is a better and cheaper brand and marketing strategy than pitching press releases or buying Super Bowl ads.</p>
<p>I’m surprised it took Trulia so long. They lag trail both Realtor.com and Zillow in terms of consumer brand awareness, focusing (and doing quite well) on SEO instead. It’s time to play catch-up.</p>
<p>This also begs the question: why doesn’t a major real estate brand have a Chief Economist?</p>
<p>Well, you might say “It wouldn’t work. Consumers don’t trust them like they trust an independent media company.”</p>
<p>To which I would ask, “<em>Must it be that way?”</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zillow <a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=159&amp;item=234">cut a search deal with Curbed</a>. A while back I suggested that there weren’t many more big real estate audiences out there for Zillow, Realtor.com and Trulia to partner with. Curbed was one of the last. It’s no AOL or Yahoo!, but they’ve managed to go both wide and deep with their network of local sites. A good move.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>You know about this deal by now, but I want to comment on the <a href="http://www.inman.com/news/2011/09/14/real-estate-digital-forms-in-spinoff-lps-real-estate-group">LPS Real Estate Group management buyout</a>, which produced <a href="http://www.realestatedigital.com/">Real Estate Digital</a>. As a matter of disclosure, I will tell you that they are a <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com">1000watt Consulting</a> client. As a matter of opinion wholly independent of that fact, I will tell you the team that made this happen is very smart. We like them. And we like their vision.</p>
<p>The break-off from LPS released a bit of energy into the online real estate world. More energy, more innovation, more action … it’s all good stuff!</p>

<p>I discovered a secret over the weekend worth sharing. It came by way of a complete&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Surprise</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-6766"></span>People love surprises. They make life glow a little brighter.</p>
<p>We carry surprises in our minds forever. They become threaded into the connections we have with one another. Years later, we’ll flush with emotion when something triggers our memory of a surprise.</p>
<p>Surprise is also an element of great branding.</p>
<p>Take a moment and recall your last surprise. There’s a good chance it gave you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Goose bumps</strong></p>
<p>Branding is the process of creating positive associations between your company and the human beings your company touches.</p>
<p>These associations begin with simple things, like a positive reaction to a logo. Or a pleasing Website experience. They continue through personal interactions with you, your products and your employees. A hundred things in a hundred places.</p>
<p>They solidify over time.</p>
<p>But in reality, they very often do not. That’s because each of the things I just mentioned aren’t special. They are expected. Your logo <em>should</em> be attractive. Your site <em>should</em> be easy to use. Your product <em>should</em> work and your service <em>should</em> be professional.</p>
<p>While meeting expectations has long been a staple of sound branding, brands aiming for merely this can come to look, sound and feel like others &#8211; even the “best of breed.”</p>
<p>And that’s good, but it’s not great.</p>
<p>Of course, this is strongly evidenced in our real estate world. There’s a lot of bad branding, some good branding, and precious little great branding.</p>
<p>There’s not a lot of surprise out there.</p>
<p>While you pound your marketing team to come up with new ways to differentiate, consider instead a different, more enduring, path to brand greatness.</p>
<p>It will require your business to behave differently, <em>to think like a human being.</em></p>
<p><strong>The first supper club</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/porter.wincuinas">Porter Wincuinas</a>, like many young chefs, is trying to build his brand. His brand strategy was to eradicate the things he believes detract from even the best dinning experiences and focus on the parts that can be magical.</p>
<p>Me and 13 other people experienced the Porter Wincuinas brand last Saturday night. And we’ll never forget it.</p>
<p>It started with an invitation to a mysterious home secured for one evening. The dishes would not be revealed until served.</p>
<p>The evening itself was rich with surprise. From the Fellini-esque decor of the home, to the unfamiliar aromas escaping the kitchen, to the assumption-breaking presentations, to the uncommon ease with which people unencumbered by “restaurant manners” managed to mesh. It was all new.</p>
<p>And of course the food. The food was outstanding.</p>
<p>One rush after another.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meal, Porter, his partner Judith and their team thanked us for our attendance. We stood in ovation. Judith handed each of us a hand written note of thanks for participating in this experimental event, their first supper club.</p>
<p><strong>Unforgettable</strong></p>
<p>A Facebook alert woke me Sunday morning. Instead of springing out of bed as usual, my wife and I laid next to each going through the gallery of images Lynn, one of our fellow guests, had <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1954469264438.2096421.1323886874&amp;type=1">posted</a>.</p>
<p>Our skin tingled with goose bumps.</p>
<p>By jostling the sensibilities of people <em>expecting</em> certain things when dining out, a young chef created a unforgettable experience and began the process of building what may in time become a great brand.</p>
<p>Meeting expectations is a noble act. It’s a part of the branding process. People will always react kindly to it.</p>
<p>But today, tomorrow or soon, consider doing more. Strip something out of your process. Or <em>the </em>process. And delight a customer with something completely different.</p>
<p><em>Surprise</em> them.</p>
<p>Give them goose bumps.</p>
<p>And see what happens next.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve had many discussions with clients over the last 18 months about the impact mobile computing is making on their digital marketing.</p>
<p>We’ve covered it in-depth on this blog too: <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2010/01/winds-on-the-horizon-why-mobile-matters.html">here</a> and <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/04/it%E2%80%99s-a-trifecta-top-3-online-real-estate-sites-are-all-in-on-the-tablet.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Computing as we know it is undergoing a radical transformation. The PC is increasingly sitting tethered to a desk at work, and most of us consume information everywhere else on smaller, perpetually connected devices.</p>
<p><span id="more-6739"></span>Real estate is clearly <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/06/heads-up-mobile-is-rocking-your-world.html">responding this shift</a>. As more and more people experience online real estate on mobile devices, the challenge is how to present an experience to these visitors that is <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/05/to-app-or-not-to-app%E2%80%A6.html">truly optimized for <em>them</em></a>?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re bullish on the mobile web for many reasons. App stores are cacophonous, while the browser remains ubiquitous. And new frameworks allow us to approximate the rich interactions we love in native apps.</p>
<p>This week, the Boston Globe showed us just how far you can take this idea.</p>
<p>Take a moment and visit <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/">www.bostonglobe.com</a> - we&#8217;ll wait for you. Oh, and while you&#8217;re there, make sure you resize your browser window.</p>
<p>(The site is free for September &#8211; thanks to Coldwell Banker. Kudos!)</p>
<p><strong>See what I&#8217;m talking about?</strong></p>
<p><object id="flashObj" width="440" height="356" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashVars" value="videoId=1141008083001&amp;playerID=16977198001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAA6piHY~,DqRT40XOAr8wI0s0AlLx8-XNKKxaCNBM&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" /><param name="base" value="http://admin.brightcove.com" /><param name="seamlesstabbing" value="false" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="swLiveConnect" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1" /><param name="flashvars" value="videoId=1141008083001&amp;playerID=16977198001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAA6piHY~,DqRT40XOAr8wI0s0AlLx8-XNKKxaCNBM&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="swliveconnect" value="true" /><param name="pluginspage" value="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" /><embed id="flashObj" width="440" height="356" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1" flashVars="videoId=1141008083001&amp;playerID=16977198001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAA6piHY~,DqRT40XOAr8wI0s0AlLx8-XNKKxaCNBM&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" base="http://admin.brightcove.com" seamlesstabbing="false" allowFullScreen="true" swLiveConnect="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="videoId=1141008083001&amp;playerID=16977198001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAA6piHY~,DqRT40XOAr8wI0s0AlLx8-XNKKxaCNBM&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" swliveconnect="true" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" /></object></p>
<p>As your window is resized, the Globe&#8217;s content gets automatically refitted into three layouts, immediately giving you discrete yet optimized PC, tablet and mobile views.</p>
<p>This type of responsive web design really demonstrates the future of content display on the web.</p>
<p>Here, there is no need for a “mobile” version of your site (one that&#8217;s usually hosted on a separate subdomain). There&#8217;s also no need for iPhone or Android apps, either.</p>
<p>The site is clean and user-friendly no matter what device is being used to access it.</p>
<p>How many real estate websites can make that claim right now?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marc IM’ed me a link to a photo an agent friend of his posted to <a href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>A nice shot.</p>
<p>Marc’s question: “<em>How would anyone find this – and if they did, what would they do with it?”</em></p>
<p>It got us talking.</p>
<p>We work with a lot of big brokers. Organizations with hundreds or even thousands of agents. Some of those agents are comfortable online and inclined to create content as part of their marketing mix.</p>
<p><span id="more-6726"></span>The trouble is, most of them are scattering this content hither and yon like bits of bread thrown to pigeons across a playground.</p>
<p>A sprinkle on Twitter. Strips of crust on Facebook. A stale chunk on a personal blog no one reads. And a odds and ends flicked into newer spaces like Instagram.</p>
<p>None of this is organized. Little is consumed. ROI is dubious.</p>
<p>The brokers, for their part, struggle to offer a website experience that is meaningfully different from their competitors&#8217;. Something that goes beyond the listings every other broker has.</p>
<p>So… agents need a well-trafficked place to distribute their content in a coherent fashion; Brokers need content that takes them beyond the commodity IDX feed.</p>
<p>Seems like there’s a fit here.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>In reality – and we run into this <em>all the time</em> – agents are wary of contributing content to their company’s site for fear of some sort of competition. Or forfeiture of ownership. But many of these agents willingly cough up the goods on places like Trulia or Zillow, which leverage that content to whoop-ass on the content-poor broker’s site.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>And the brokers? They often balk at the idea of aggregating and curating agent content. Too many legal issues. No staff to handle it. Too many politics involved.</p>
<p>Everyone loses.</p>
<p>Brokers can’t exploit the potential inherent in their sales force. Agents send their content into lonely corners of the web to float in suspended animation.</p>
<p>Agents, meet your broker. Online, she is your friend. Brokers, meet your agents. They are your content partners.</p>
<p>Make something beautiful together before it’s too late.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trulia has jumped into the home value game.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is called “Trulia Estimates” (<em>Testimates </em>doesn’t really work, does it?).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Estimates are available only in the SF Bay Area for now, but the plan is to expand nationally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Initially, estimates are available only on sold properties, but actives will be included in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The algorithm behind the estimates was created in-house.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A key differentiator, as stated by the company, is that Trulia users – both consumers and agents – will be able to provide feedback on individual estimates (see the screen shot below).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This feedback will be used for internal purposes only for now. The company would not state if the feedback will be displayed publicly at some point, but would not rule it out either. You be the judge.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-6717"></span>Some quick thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>This could be viewed as something of a snoozer – a simple parity move &#8211; given the Zestimate’s established success with consumers and the fact that both Realtor.com (only on sold properties) and Homes.com have had value estimates for some time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, one could look at this as a significant enhancement that places Trulia on a more even footing with Zillow &#8211; something that’s very important in the run-up to their anticipated IPO. To date I’ve thought of Trulia as stronger than Zillow as a pure home search application, but Zillow as a more complete consumer offering. One could say that gap is now narrower.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The notion of value estimates directly conditioned by user feedback – including Realtors – edges up against the “RVM” concept that is part of RPR. The more that’s available outside the RPR wall, the less unique their value prop becomes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The use of an automated value as a lead-gen lever is executed well here. Note the “get a professional estimate” call to action next to the automated number. I’ve always thought the Zestimate was God’s gift to the Realtor value proposition, so I like how Trulia plays this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is the latest in a series of UI and feature improvements Trulia has made over the past 6-8 months. The site has become significantly better. They are executing well. I’m looking forward to seeing the S-1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the screen cap:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a lot of big news this week. Late summer doldrums I suppose.</p>
<p>A few things that caught my eye…</p>
<p>Citi <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zillow-stock-rises-citi-analyst-rating-181411408.html">initiated its analyst coverage of Zillow</a>, rating it a “buy.” Sure, you could point out Citi’s involvement in the Zillow IPO, or take issue with the strongly positive opinion. I don’t really have an problem with any of that. Call me jaded.</p>
<p>But one part of the report <em>did </em>bother me: a poorly constructed, recklessly small survey of Realtor sentiment about technology products and providers. Zillow came out good on some questions, Trulia won on others, and “social media” seemed to kick everybody’s butt. Whatever.</p>
<p>Several people emailed me with tidbits from this survey as evidence of something meaningful. I don’t have an problem with that either. But the survey was garbage.</p>
<p>I’d like to see more <em>serious </em>research on real estate technology, media and marketing. NAR does some good work here, but it’s not enough. And it’s NAR.  <a href="http://realtrends.com">RealTrends</a> is a respected source, but they seem to be focused on brokerage operations. I’m looking for a <a href="http://www.borrellassociates.com/">Borrell</a> or <a href="http://www.biakelsey.com/">Kelsey</a>-type effort in real estate.</p>
<p>It’s not our bag. And we’re busy. But I think there’s a nice little business here for someone willing to raise the bar.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Apparently, the “daily deals” phenomenon <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/30/one-too-many-daily-deals/">no longer has the potential</a> to transform our economy, change the future of commerce, or add existential significance to the act of buying appetizers.</p>
<p><a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/04/friday-flash-a-home-is-not-an-egg-roll-ipad-goodness-and-the-cost-of-paranoia.html">Thank god</a>. I <a href="http://1000wattconsulting.com/blog/2011/04/friday-flash-a-home-is-not-an-egg-roll-ipad-goodness-and-the-cost-of-paranoia.html">never got</a> how turning economies of scale and the basest consumer impulses against small businesses made any sense.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/01/airbnb-launches-sublets-tempts-early-adopters-with-200-off-each-months-rent">announced</a> that it has begun offering sublets. Until now, the site was focused on short, hotel-length stays.</p>
<p>Keep watching them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Content curation and a more personal real estate search. These are two topics that have been talked about a lot the past few months.</p>
<p>These two things, in combination, popped into my head when I read about the launch of <a href="http://jig.com">Jig</a> – a social site that “meets unmet needs.”</p>
<p>You see what I mean?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><a href="http://jux.com">Jux</a> is a new company that offers an immersive, beautiful way to publish words, photos and videos. It literally frees content to reach its fullest expression on our screens.</p>
<p>I found it a bit confusing at first. But I think this could be used quite effectively to tell a story about a home or a neighborhood.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why don’t brokers <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/22/stipple-debuts-new-self-serve-adsense-for-images-ad-platform-for-publishers-and-brands">sell ads in the listing photos they own</a>? Seriously &#8211; let&#8217;s think big!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A while ago, I shared some photos that had been messed with to create amazing and haunting animated gifs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664907/animated-gifs-capture-stanley-kubricks-most-immortal-shots">These</a> are even better.</p>
<p>Enjoy the long weekend!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.futureofrealestatemarketing.com/">Future of Real Estate Marketing</a> was the first blog I ever read.</p>
<p>It was useful, well-written, and free from the pay-for-play stench that marked so much of real estate’s old trade media.</p>
<p>And in reading FOREM, I got to know Joel. I could see that he was smart. That he was level-headed.</p>
<p>That he could write &#8211; and <em>think</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-6693"></span></p>
<p><strong>Keeping the faith</strong></p>
<p>This week, I learned that FOREM had been shut down, quietly folded into Inman’s excellent group blog, <a href="http://next.inman.com/">NEXT</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I just turned 40, but this made me more than a little wistful. Like something that seemed new just a few years ago had run its course &#8211; and that I, now middle aged, was on the far end of that same arc.</p>
<p>I got over it. Inman is doing good things and I can still call someone “dude” without sounding completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>So what I’ve really taken away from this is a renewed commitment to writing. FOREM’s gone, but the notion upon which it was formed is still quite valuable. So we’ll keep working it.</p>
<p>Because good writing &#8211; as an implement of marketing or an expression of a brand &#8211; always wins.</p>
<p>Photos are emotionally potent. Video engages. Good visual design is useful and seductive.</p>
<p>But writing gives us an opportunity to do more.</p>
<p>Think about it: when you die, who will remember your Twitter stream?</p>
<p>How much can a potential customer <em>really</em> learn about the depth of your real estate knowledge or real brain power from your Facebook activity?</p>
<p>But we can, for damn sure, tell that Kris Berg is smart and knows real estate cold. Because the proof is there, <a href="http://sandiegocastles.com/">spelled out with skill and style</a>.</p>
<p>My impression of Redfin has been shaped as much by <a href="http://blog.redfin.com/">Glenn’s writing</a> as it has by this or that new feature.</p>
<p>And how about us? Our clients know us by our work. But how do you know 1000watt?</p>
<p>Writing is hard for most of us. The 200 or so words you’ve just read are like beads of sweat. I worked for them. And sometimes, for all the effort, they just stink.</p>
<p>But sometimes you get a point across. Or create a perspective that’s different. You lay a piece of yourself out on the table for inspection and come out OK.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s been worth it. So I’ll continue. Marc will continue.</p>
<p>And Joel continues, here, even as FOREM disappears.</p>
