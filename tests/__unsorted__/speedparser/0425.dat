<p>I just realized that I didn&#8217;t introduce Hope on the blog! Sorry. Well, meet Hope, the newest addition and the very much long awaited addition to the garden. Here she is sitting at her pond and being quite happy and content.</p>
<p>I had my eye on her for months, but unfortunately the seller and I couldn&#8217;t agree on a price. Now that they&#8217;re going out of business, they have met my stipulated price and I brought her over about 3 weeks or so ago, and yesterday afternoon was an opportune moment for to me clean up around her and spruce up her throne a bit. Now with the cable and various pipes hidden, I&#8217;m quite happy too.</p>

<p>Just a <a title="Nature’s Christmas gift to me…" href="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/2010/12/25/natures-christmas-gift/">few weeks ago</a>, this lovely hydrangea was doing well enough &#8211; considering it&#8217;s not supposed to survive at all in Bahrain&#8217;s climate. Alas, this is what it&#8217;s been reduced to in its first ever Bahraini summer. I&#8217;ve not lost complete hope yet though, you will notice that against all odds, it&#8217;s got some new growth showing.</p>
<p>I do fervently hope that it&#8217;ll survive the next few weeks and come back growing stronger come November.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s for hoping for the best.</p>

<p>What helped this year with the produce is that we regularly gave a large part of it away to friends and family. On second thoughts, I think I&#8217;ll double the plants so we can share more!</p>

	If you&#8217;ve been following my gardening blog at mahmoodsgarden.com you already know my trials and tribulations with our lawn. From a lush, thick, <a href="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/2010/12/31/lawn-problems-sorry-gaia-i-had-to-give-up/">carpet-like heaven, to a mud field</a> just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I took matters into my own hands and seeded the lawn with Ryegrass. Now, three weeks later and after cutting it for the second time yesterday, fertilising it with NPK and Urea, rolling over the freshly cut and fertilized lawn to firm the ground up, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree with me that it at least appears to be recovering.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pleasure now to sit in the garden, have a Turkish coffee and just while away the time, without having to scrape your shoes afterwards from the mud that would have caked them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the lawn was a disaster, looking like almost a desolate <a href="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/2010/12/31/lawn-problems-sorry-gaia-i-had-to-give-up/">muddy lunar landscape</a> than a proper lawn and I resolved to do something about it. I did. But although that the ants are still around (the bastards!) at least with the spreading of five kilograms of ryegrass seed, the results are already astounding. Just over the last couple of days, the new fresh gorgeous green shoots have started to appear, and this morning, well, see for yourself:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve succumbed. But before I go on, have a look at the state of my lawn now:</p>
<p><a href="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/files/2010/12/bad-grass.jpg"><img src="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/files/2010/12/bad-grass-s.jpg" alt="" title="bad grass ugly lawn" width="500" height="267" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554" /></a></p>
<p>and this is how is <i>used</i> to look like just 3 years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/files/2010/12/orig-lawn.jpg"><img src="http://mahmoodsgarden.com/files/2010/12/orig-lawn-s-e1293791317433.jpg" alt="" title="orig-lawn-s" width="500" height="165" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556" /></a></p>
<p>Can you imagine my distress every time I walk into the garden now with the images of how it used to look like firmly in my mind?</p>
<p>For three years I&#8217;ve been battling ants with every natural product I can lay my hands on to no avail. I tried Neem Tree Oil and a variety of other &#8220;solutions&#8221; which were anything but. So this week, the last of the year, I declare that I am beaten. Well and truly beaten by bastard ants. Ants that have dug into every single square inch of the garden and are now seriously threatening the trees too. So, I decided that it is now high time to employ science at its worst. Yes, my friends, I have succumbed and bought a few products from the local vendors in the hope that I would reduce the ant&#8217;s effects &#8211; there is no hope of ever annihilating them of course &#8211; but if I can limit their effect enough to have a semblance of the loan at the hight of its glory, I shall be happy indeed.</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;ve done all through the morning is spread <a href="http://www.goodguide.com/ingredients/37561-diazinon?category_id=176872-pest-control" target=_blank>Diazinon</a> pellets all over the garden. This was the product which has been recommended to me by the garden centres I&#8217;ve visited and the agricultural engineer at the government&#8217;s experimental farm. I hope to Gaia that it works!</p>
<p>I know that this is not the season for the grass anyway and that planted South African grass goes into semi-dormancy, but even with that it never looked as bad as it does this year. So to aid it a bit, along with the Diazinon, I spread copious amounts of Ryegrass which I hope will start filling in the ugly gaps until summer arrives.</p>
<p>Once that is done, I had to compress the spongy earth a bit. So out comes the roller and I went all over the garden with it. Now instead of the puffy ugly surface, it&#8217;s actually looking somewhat level and compact. Now if the poison does its job, I should see those ugly puffs any more. Whether the lawn will ever look like its former self, I won&#8217;t be able to venture a guess, but I can promise you this: if what I&#8217;ve done today doesn&#8217;t fix it, I&#8217;m fully prepared to rip the whole bloody thing off and start all over again. A good lawn is worth it.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful New Year! </p>

I brought this hydrangea as a cutting from Canada last summer. I never thought that it would actually survive, it actually almost died when I planted it in a test-tube planter and almost gave up on it. I thought I won&#8217;t lose much if I plant it in the garden. It was so poor looking that the gardner thought to pluck it out and throw it! I rescued it from the bucket and once again planted it under the Plumiera. Checking on it this morning (a mere 3 months since it began its journey) it is flourishing with new shoots coming out from the roots, new leaflets appearing from the main stem and new small leaves at the crown.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I am absolutely chuffed!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>This is a Variegated Lacecap Hydrangea, Hydrangea macrophylla &#8216;Mariesii Variegata&#8217;</p>
