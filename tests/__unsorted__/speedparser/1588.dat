			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night was the last show for White Rabbit&#8217;s Fringe production of So You Think You Can be a Music Theatre Idol and while all of us (cast, crew and White Rabbit) are a little sad to see it go we can all agree that we had a blast before and during the run.  Rehearsals and filming began long ago so there really was the feeling of living in a compound for these performers &#8211; they have spent so much time together that the emotions of the last show came to the surface for everyone.  What fun we had, what spirit this show had and what energy everyone gave to see this show towards success.</p>
<p>Roi, Claw and Vespa, congrats on your Idol wins.  Suki, Penelope, Carlos and Jose, congrats on commanding the stage and putting your heart into it all.  Rip, Serge, Portia and Geordie, thanks for being there for the Idols, they couldn&#8217;t have made it to the finals without you.</p>
<p>And thank you to everyone involved, not only did we have so much fun but we can honestly say we were just so in love with this show.  Thank you performers and crew for filling it with SPARKLE!</p>
<p>Before we go, lets take a look at the performers behind these loveable and diverse characters.  Check them out on the <a href="http://whiterabbitproductions.ca/events/so-you-think-you-can-be-a-music-theatre-idol/know-your-idols/" target="_blank">Know Your Idols</a> page.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day four of the Winnipeg Fringe Festival and the energy and passion surrounding everyone is at an all time high.  We are having fun, meeting new friends, seeing great shows and super excited about our own show.</p>
<p>CBC has a review in already, they came to our opening night show and we couldn&#8217;t be happier with the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/fringe/2011/07/15/so-you-think-you-can-be-a-music-theatre-idol-all-stars/" target="_blank">review</a> and the reviewer, Kaj Hasselriis.  Kaj seemed to really see the diversity and fun we had with this show and we appreciate that greatly.</p>
<p>Tonight is our second show and we are like 5 year olds on Christmas morning, barely containing our excitement.  10:45 pm tonight!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, our rummage sale was an awesome success!  So many people to thank for helping out that day.  Not only did people come by and get some great stuff but we spread the word about White Rabbit and our Rummage Sale partner, Kiss the Giraffe &#8211; people certainly love independent and local theatre &#8211; the support for theatre in Winnipeg is amazing.  The Kiss the Giraffe team and the White Rabbit Team kicked ass and were a tight, well oiled rummage sale machine.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we were lucky enough to have Big Brothers and Sisters of Winnipeg come by with a big truck and load up all the books, clothes and household items that didn&#8217;t get bought up.  Their pick up program is called <a href="http://www.bigwinnipeg.com/en/Home/bigsmilescollectioncrew/default.aspx">Big Smiles Collection Crew</a> and they are a great bunch of people &#8211; especially Dave.  Anything that helps out our youth is important to us so we are glad to have connected with Dave and help out in the funding of their own programs.</p>
<p>And finally, a compassion spotlight on our rummage teammate Kami Desilets who saved three dogs from extremely hot and suffocating cars in the parking lot (the windows were barely opened).  Kami sprang to action calling in help and quick to respond was the Humane Society and the Police.  As animal lovers we are so happy Kami was there to help those sweet dogs and thanks to the Humane Society and the Police for quick response and concern for the animals as well.</p>
<p>Just a reminder folks, do NOT leave your dogs in poorly ventilated cars for longer than 10 minutes &#8211; it literally becomes an oven.  If you do, Kami will find you.</p>
<p>So an action filled day that was fun for everyone with some memorable moments for sure.  Be rest assured we are doing this again!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday, June 26th is our <a href="http://whiterabbitproductions.ca/2011/want-to-get-rid-of-some-stuff/">Rummage Sale</a> and we would like to stop and take a moment to thank all the people who have donated items and who are putting in some hours of their own weekend time to see this through.</p>
<p>White Rabbit and KTG would like to thank Kami Desilets, Joseph Aragon, Kelly Schultz, Kathryn Ball, Jenna Hill and LaDawn Sherrington for the hours you are giving us.</p>
<p>As for those who donated, well so many and some from anonymous sources so if you find yourself on this site one day, big kisses to you and much thanks.</p>
<p>Lastly, anything that doesn&#8217;t get sold at our sale is going to Big Brothers and Sisters of Winnipeg.  They resell these items for funds that support their own programs and we are huge supporters of organizations that are there for our youth.  Its a win win!</p>
<p>Okay, so see you Sunday!</p>
