			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;ve got some underground, early-90s, Atlanta hip-hop for you. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little information, provided by Martay himself:</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://www.normalbias.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ect-jcard.jpg" alt="" title="ect - jcard" width="200" height="259" class="alignright size-full wp-image-285" style="padding-left: 10px;" />The East Coast Tribe was formed like most other collectives… pure happenstance.</p>
<p>Here’s a chronology…1st there was Reign of Terror: Legendary, Rhythmlord and Martay who were doing shows with the likes of MC Hammer and Rob Base just out of high-school.</p>
<p>Martay went on to ATL to college at Georgia Tech. He did solo shows with Success-N-Effect and other local groups in the area. One Tech Student, Transcribe (Clock Master K at that time) came to the show with his P.E. button and t-shirt on (for the record, Mike Luttrell predicted that Martay would end up hanging out with that guy when he saw him come to the show clearly different than the crowd that came to see “Roll it Up”). Transcribe had an emcee buddy named Dave a.k.a. MC Prophet (together White Noise) who had a buddy from Texas named Barry Winkler. Well, Martay did begin hanging out with Transcribe and the guys in ATL.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rhythmlord met B-Right through a friend name DA… B-Right was looking to “get on” with some cats that did music. Well, Rhythmlord did music and Martay happened to come out one day to meet B-Right too.</p>
<p>Things kept brewing and soon after DJ K-ski fresh from service in the 1st Iraq conflict joined B-Right and it was on. Transcribe did music for Martay and B-Right who along with K-Ski formed a group called Tribal Science.</p>
<p>They decided to form a collective that included Martay, The Hip-Hop Wiz, Reign of Terror, B-Right, Transcribe and DJ K-Ski. The collective would be dubbed the East Coast Tribe and they’d later grow into a management company representing nine talented artists, all told.</p>
<p>To officially christen the East Coast Tribe, Barry Winkler, ever the entrepreneur started Bahari Records and their first release was an EP that included songs from Tribal Science and Martay…knowing they had a lot to learn about the biz (what an understatement) they dubbed the EP <em>33 1/3: First Day of School</em>… it was released on Vinyl and cassette in 1993.</p>
<p>After the release of <em>First Day of School</em>, Martay and B-Right formally joined forces with Barry Winkler on both Bahari Records (later the home to J. Bond &#038; DJ Goldfinger and The Wamdue Project among others) as well as ECT, Inc. (the aforementioned management company).</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked Martay about the photo on the cover.  He told me, &#8220;It&#8217;s Barry Winkler, the original founder of Bahari Records.  We thought it appropriate as the 1st release&#8230; the 1st day of our school in the industry&#8230; to pay homage to the man who had the guts to finance a record company.&#8221;  Good stuff.</p>
<p>After listening to this tape for the first time in many years, I was reminded how good it is.  While it&#8217;s indicative of the time it was made, it&#8217;s not really like anything else of the era.  There are influences, but it&#8217;s very much original.  I think fans of early 90s hip-hop will dig it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rip of the cassette release of <em>33 1/3: First Day of School</em>, an album I enjoy to this day.  There are no mentions of it anywhere else on the web aside from two links from my site and a mention by Flash from an old issue of <em>HardC.O.R.E.</em>.  Enjoy&#8230; I&#8217;ve got some more Bahari goodness coming your way.</p>

<p>&#8230; and, just for a fun, a bonus track that I produced for Martay for a compilation I released back in 1995 titled <em>The People Under the Stairs</em>.  It was my first long-distance collaboration and involved sending my 4-track cassette to Martay through the US mail, waiting for him to record his verse and then send it back.  You kids these days have it so easy with your crazy Internet bandwidth.  (This track is also in the zip file.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yet another unlabeled tape (should I make &#8220;YAUT&#8221; an official acronym?).  This one is from Q102 (WIOQ) Hip-Hop Review on a Sunday night in 1993, sometime before September.  The hosts are &#8220;The Funky President&#8221; Mike Elliott (heard earlier <a href="http://www.normalbias.org/2007/08/10/krush-radio-january-28-1990/">here</a>) and Shelly Shel and DJ Jay-Ski is on the wheels.</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you about Jay-Ski?</p>
<p>He was the first hip-hop DJ I ever knew (somewhat) personally.  Way back in the late 1980s, I was in 7th grade and would call around to Bulletin Board Systems (don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about?  <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">You better ask somebody!</a>) from my middle school&#8217;s computer lab.  There was one I called into that was run by a metalhead, but I bumped into one other user on there named Gemini that was into hip-hop.  That was Jay-Ski.  We talked once about trying to work together (this was back when I was just starting to write lyrics), but that never came to be.  Probably for the best since I was completely wack at the time.</p>
<p>I only met Jay in person once, when he was working at Sound Express (Jersey&#8217;s answer to Funk-O-Mart/Sounds of Market) in Willingboro.  Then Jay got famous showing up all over Philly radio.  We&#8217;ve caught up online a few times in recent years.  He&#8217;s good dude.  And crazy talented.  Check Jay out these days over at <a href="http://www.pureelementz.net/">PureElementz.net</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>On this episode, they do a giveaway for an Erick Sermon/Def Jam show in New York.  The winner gets to ride in a &#8220;a phat stretch limo with a television, VCR, and all that&#8221; and hang with Mike Elliott and Shelly Shel.  This results in a pretty hilarious call-in section where people call in telling why they should be the ones to win the tickets.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some outstanding music here, especially for fans of that 93 sound.  Lords of the Underground, The Mexakinz, Original Flavor, PRT, post-Large Pro Main Source&#8230; it goes on and on.  Some tasty remixes and lots of heavy signature Jay-Ski cuts.  There&#8217;s one track called &#8220;That&#8217;s Life&#8221; from a Philadelphia group that seems to like to reference Sweden (I couldn&#8217;t make out their name when Mike Elliott said it&#8230; something Soul).</p>
<p>Fat Joe shows up in studio, but for some reason, I cut that part out.  The real treat comes on side B when Souls of Mischief roll through to hype their upcoming <em>&#8217;93 Til Infinity</em>.</p>
<p>Definitely worth checking out.  Total runtime is a little over an hour.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Yet another unlabeled tape (should I make "YAUT" an official acronym?).  This one is from Q102 (WIOQ) Hip-Hop Review on a Sunday night in 1993, sometime before September.  The hosts are "The Funky President" Mike Elliott (heard earlier here) and Shelly Shel and DJ Jay-Ski is on the wheels.

Did I ever tell you about Jay-Ski?

He was the first hip-hop DJ I ever knew (somewhat) personally.  Way back in the late 1980s, I was in 7th grade and would call around to Bulletin Board Systems (don't know what I'm talking about?

Anyway.

On this episode, they do a giveaway for an Erick Sermon/Def Jam show in New York.  The winner gets to ride in a "a phat stretch limo with a television, VCR, and all that" and hang with Mike Elliott and Shelly Shel.  This results in a pretty hilarious call-in section where people call in telling why they should be the ones to win the tickets.

There's some outstanding music here, especially for fans of that 93 sound.  Lords of the Underground, The Mexakinz, Original Flavor, PRT, post-Large Pro Main Source... it goes on and on.  Some tasty remixes and lots of heavy signature Jay-Ski cuts.  There's one track called "That's Life" from a Philadelphia group that seems to like to reference Sweden (I couldn't make out their name when Mike Elliott said it... something Soul).

Fat Joe shows up in studio, but for some reason, I cut that part out.  The real treat comes on side B when Souls of Mischief roll through to hype their upcoming '93 Til Infinity.

Definitely worth checking out.  Total runtime is a little over an hour.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another unlabeled PRB gem today.  This one comes from December 3rd or 10th, 1992 (they advertise an upcoming event called TalentFest 92 (brought to you by Up and Up Studios) and later on, there are holiday ads) and features a lot of goodness.  The tape starts at about 11:30pm.</p>
<p>The studio was packed full of guests, including DJ Kam, Courageous Chief (aka &#8220;Horrendous Teeth&#8221; according to G), Awol, a boisterous Tony D (fresh from the studio having recording some new tracks with the Poor Righteous Teachers), the Hillbillies (&#8220;straight out of Muck Holly&#8221;&#8230; and seriously, does <em>no one</em> remember &#8220;Bottom of the Hamper Jam&#8221;?), and others.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main reason to check this one out is the primary in-studio guest: a 23-year-old Apache (RIP).  &#8220;Gangsta Bitch&#8221; had just hit and the album (<em>Apache Ain&#8217;t Shit</em>) was on the way.  It&#8217;s kind of strange to come across this particular unlabeled tape so shortly after Apache&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>In addition to the typical &#8220;what&#8217;s up with your album&#8221;-type questions, we find out important things like Apache&#8217;s favorite ice cream flavor and how he knows &#8220;this thing ain&#8217;t gonna last&#8221; because he doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;industry people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Side B features a great Thursday Night Live session with DJ Kam on the wheels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awol</li>
<li>Tony D (RIP)</li>
<li>Courageous Chief</li>
<li>Baby Chill (RIP)</li>
<li>Almighty Poppa S-Man (from the Dungeon Lords)</li>
<li>The Coup Man (?) (from the Dungeon Lords)</li>
<li>EP (from The Hillbillies) (sounds like the only one that comes off the top)</li>
<li>B-Struck (from The Hillbillies)</li>
<li>EP</li>
<li>Tony D</li>
</ul>
<p>The show features music from Cutty Ranks, Show and AG, Positive K, Heather B, Main Source, Chubb Rock, Das EFX, Grand Puba, Ice Cube, Diamond D, and The Funk Family.</p>
<p>The show closes out with G discussing some upcoming extended-length shows.  He also pimps one of the early episodes of <a href="http://vibesandvapors.com/">Vibes and Vapors</a>.</p>
<p>This is a great 90 minutes.  I hope I come across the earlier part of the show at some point.</p>

The studio was packed full of guests, including DJ Kam, Courageous Chief (aka "Horrendous Teeth" according to G), Awol, a boisterous Tony D (fresh from the studio having recording some new tracks with the Poor Righteous Teachers), the Hillbillies ("straight out of Muck Holly"... and seriously, does no one remember "Bottom of the Hamper Jam"?), and others.

Perhaps the main reason to check this one out is the primary in-studio guest: a 23-year-old Apache (RIP).  "Gangsta Bitch" had just hit and the album (Apache Ain't Shit) was on the way.  It's kind of strange to come across this particular unlabeled tape so shortly after Apache's death.

In addition to the typical "what's up with your album"-type questions, we find out important things like Apache's favorite ice cream flavor and how he knows "this thing ain't gonna last" because he doesn't like "industry people."

Side B features a great Thursday Night Live session with DJ Kam on the wheels:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a random unlabeled tape from the PRB vaults.  There was only about 30 seconds of music on side B, so here&#8217;s what was on side A.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m dating this one at early July 1992.  For those OCD nerds that are interested in how I came to that&#8230; all of the newer tracks they played were released in 1992 and there&#8217;s a very short snippet of a commercial from the episode discussing Greek Picnic Weekend in Philadelphia, which in 1992, <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&#038;s_site=philly&#038;p_multi=PI&#038;p_theme=realcities&#038;p_action=search&#038;p_maxdocs=200&#038;p_topdoc=1&#038;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A3A05992F133&#038;p_field_direct-0=document_id&#038;p_perpage=10&#038;p_sort=YMD_date:D&#038;s_trackval=GooglePM">was on July 11 or 18</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little back and forth between Easy M and G on here as we join them partway into the show.  They do a ticket giveaway for an Arrested Development/Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy/Me Phi Me show at Mahorn&#8217;s.  They also mention an upcoming Pete Rock and CL Smooth show at the same joint.  Mahorn&#8217;s was a club in NJ owned by former 76er <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Mahorn">Rick Mahorn</a>.  The club shut down <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKNiAlIggvg">a year-and-a-half later</a> due to an issue related to gun violence, if I remember correctly.  The segment in the linked video starting at 5 minutes shows the club&#8217;s final night ended in fights, captured on camera by Philly&#8217;s DJ Ran:</p>
<p align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hKNiAlIggvg&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;start=300"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hKNiAlIggvg&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;start=300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>Kam and Chief are headed up to the studio but are late, apparently because they &#8220;took a wrong exit off the warpath.&#8221;  The Crusaders for Real Hip-Hop are also on their way.  The only guest in the studio is Harold from Up and Up Productions, a local recording studio that I think was in Willingboro (or maybe Trenton) and used to air ads on PRB featuring local talent.  G also mentions the &#8220;phat package,&#8221; a giveaway batch of CDs and promo materials.</p>
<p>Tracks of note include the &#8220;brand new&#8221; &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Da One&#8221; from Brothers Uv da Blakmarket, a Paterson, NJ-based crew associated with the Flavor Unit that put out one album on Select.  Also work checking, the Little Bastards&#8217; &#8220;Stunt, Get a Job&#8221; (the clean version of the A-side &#8220;<a href="http://www.philaflava.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=101911#1658889">Bitch, Get a Job</a>&#8221; single).</p>
<p>The side ends with a &#8220;Time Vault&#8221; segment of old school cuts from Busy Bee and the Masters of Ceremony.</p>

<p>Among the random stuff I got to review when I was in high school was a cassette single by a crew named Forbidden Fruit.  They were on the no-name &#8220;Big Boss Records&#8221; (located at 202 St. Nicholas Ave in New York, now the home of 21st Century Urology, which is probably not a hip-hop label) and the cassette single was so cheap that the O-card was literally scotch-taped together.  Forbidden Fruit was a two-man crew that bore a striking resemblance, in terms of sound, to Naughty By Nature.  It was 1993, so it&#8217;s got the piano-heavy production and Treach Lite-like flows.  Obvious NBN derivation aside, I really like these tracks.  The horns that drop in on &#8220;Keep It In Mind&#8221; sound awkward and out of place, but how can you not love that Tony D-style piano loop.  Production is credited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vada_Nobles">Vada Nobles</a> (who co-produced Lauryn Hill&#8217;s solo album) and Forbidden Fruit.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen this one floating around anywhere else, so I&#8217;m guessing this particular single is pretty rare.  Both vocals and instrumentals are included from the original cassette single.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
