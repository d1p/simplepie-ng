			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first met Mr. Sugawara when he invited me to join them for a family dinner at Kikufuji. His daughter and I had been good friends by then and while our brand of fun seemed to have finished early (and they had room for one more) I would assume that he thought it was possibly nice to join them for dinner. What happened afterwards was a mouth-opening experience as he showed me a whole new flavor palette for Japanese food. Fresh fish, a great balance of rice, wasabi and vinegar makes amazing sushi. Of course, there was also balance in terms of textures, colors, and flavors that by the end of the evening, I could never imagine myself eating at any other Japanese joint.</p>
<p>Of course, that was the start of many dinners with Mr. Sugawara and his family. Next thing I know, I was hopping from one Little Tokyo restaurant to another, watching sports games with him when we can, talking about how lovely and how fresh the food is. Not long after, he opened his home to me and from there I saw the love and care that his wife place on their food and why he was a man of good taste. It is in this good taste that he and his family inherited the restaurant Hana and it became a home away from home where we get to sample some of their family favorites without wreaking havoc in their living room. The meals in Hana have his seal of approval and I suppose the endless sports broadcasts from Japan also adds a bit of his touch. My favorite memory in Hana was his late night World Cup games where we would go to Hana at such a late time just to catch a Japan game.</p>
<p>Mr. Sugawara ate well. He lived well. And I owe it to him and his family for showing what Japanese food is all about while in Manila.</p>
<p>I’m quite sure that we all had our Mr. Sugawaras in our lives and I’m quite sure that they have taught us so much about their own culture and their lives with just a plate of food. I write this with a heavy heart knowing that I will no longer share a meal Mr. Sugawara. But even if he’s no longer here, I will definitely remember him for every chahan, sushi, tempura, udon, and every bite of Japanese food that I will get from Hana. He opened my world to Japanese food with just a bite and I owe my Japanese father a big thank you for teaching the soul in Japanese food.</p>
<p>In memory of Mr. Sugawara who just recently passed away, I’d like to invite my readers to have a bite in Hana at Little Tokyo this month. If you haven’t tried Hana yet, I think it’s about time you do so. It’s a lovely little restaurant in Little Tokyo and they’re known for selling the best takoyaki in Metro Manila. Apart from their takoyaki though, their menu shows a wide array of simple yet lovely Japanese food. Mr. Sugawara always suggests to me to have their shouyu ramen and their chahan. Their shouyu ramen has a rich deep broth while their fried rice is fluffy and heartwarming and if you don’t have crab allergies, it’s a lovely match to shouyu ramen (yes! Even Japanese love double carbs!) Another favorite of his is the grilled fish served in Hana. Currently they serve grilled sanma (pacific saury), grilled saba (mackerel), and sakazuke akauo (grilled sake-marinated akauo). I personally love their sanma with a squeeze of lemon and some radish on top. I know he enjoyed the grilled saba with steaming hot rice.</p>
<p>I hope you guys would get a chance to see the world of Mr. Sugawara through Hana. I’m quite sure you won’t forget and maybe just like me, you’ll have the chance to enjoy the soul of Japanese food.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not a beef person.</p>
<p>Yes. I&#8217;m not a beef person.</p>
<p>The hierarchy of my love for meat goes like this: pork, lamb, chicken, fish, seafood, then beef.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I hate beef. It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s some stringy bits which I always hate among other things that I completely do not enjoy. I&#8217;ve had my share of well done beef steak and I always just ending up chewing more than I should be eating. Needless to say, beef&#8217;s one meat I couldn&#8217;t cook well either. I don&#8217;t know which parts are tender and which ones would work.</p>
<p>Hence, when I saw those kids in Junior Masterchef (yes! I&#8217;m still watching!) cook up some amazing dishes like steak&#8230; I just had to cook steak.</p>
<p>Of course, they didn&#8217;t give me the lowdown. I had to turn elsewhere. I went you tube hunting and checked various recipes and videos for steak only to find the cutthroat technique of Gordon Ramsey really gave me the best opportunity to cook and eat steak the way I want it. No fancy marinades and all that. Just some simple tips done in a few minutes.</p>
<p>After this, I got to say, I love steak and I&#8217;ve officially raised my love for beef.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.punkednoodle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/zucchini-006.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270" title="kalabasa tuscan fry" src="http://www.punkednoodle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/zucchini-006.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="667" /></a></p>
<p>For the longest time, I had seen Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson, Mario Batali, and them likes fry up zucchini flowers like it was nothing. It was nice and orange but I never could imagine how it tasted. I hardly ate flowers. I see a rose petal on my soup from a wedding &#8212; I take it off.</p>
<p>That said, it took a trip to Italy two years ago to find out that there&#8217;s something nice and lovely about this zucchini flower dish. I fell in love with the balance of the herbs, the nice gooey cheesy ricotta, and the crunch of the flowers. As soon as I got home, I was wondering how can I do it&#8230; can I even do it?</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been trying to chance upon some zucchini flowers but never really managed to find anything close to it until last week when my uncle cooked pinakbet with some squash (kalabasa) flowers. It looked like the zucchini flowers but I wasn&#8217;t quite sure it would work. So I gave it a shot today and the experiment was a success.</p>
<p><strong>Fried Kalabasa flowers ala Tuscano</strong></p>
<p>I took after this <a href="http://www.italianfoodforever.com/iff2008/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1785:friedzucchiniflowers&amp;catid=43:cantipasti&amp;Itemid=65">recipe</a> and modified it a little to my tastes. Rather than using ricotta cheese, I mixed parmesan and quickmelt cheese. Herb choices were slim in the market but they had lovely leeks which I just minced and put it in the cheese concoction. The flowers were also smaller so I had to use lesser batter.</p>
<p>We had no egg this morning but I figured that if I just make a tempura-consistency for my batter, it might just work. Mix cold water with the flour, season with some salt and pepper, and voila!</p>
<p>This dish turned out to be a really nice, even better and crispier treat compared to what I had in Tuscany. Blame it on the tempura batter or something but in the end, it was a sublime gooey snack. It wasn&#8217;t as laborious as I had imagine either. Needless to say, my first shot at localizing something I had abroad with supplementary local ingredients worked wonders.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been seeing the advertisements of Junior Master Chef Australia in Star World and while I had an impression that it was just kids dishing out kiddie experiments, the final product of their dishes were not short of amazing.</p>
<p>Wow. These kids just know their stuff. And I&#8217;ve only seen the advertisements! I mean lamb wellingtons and nicely cooked fishes are just possibly part and parcel of what they&#8217;re capable of cooking. And they&#8217;re just half my age!</p>
<p>The show will start on January 16 at Star World and I was just thinking on what I possibly cook if I was 12.</p>
<p>At that time, the only thing that I was cooking was spaghetti and some lamb. I love lamb but I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve perfected lamb. At that time, my family would buy the &#8220;Buy 1 take 1&#8243; lamb chops from Rustan&#8217;s and I would cook it up either as a stew, ragout, or just beautifully seared. Of course, these pieces of lamb is pale in comparison to the lambs seen abroad. More so, our family is just in love with overcooked lamb. No moist, sweet, pinkish parts. I think I&#8217;m the only one who liked my lamb pinkish.</p>
<p>But I think at 12, I would have cooked up a wicked spaghetti. The spaghetti was the first thing I cooked on my own and I think, since I was 10, the spaghetti has always been assigned to me as my Christmas duty. Every year the tastes changes because I experiment with the flavors. I think at 12, they would have tasted a spaghetti with an asian flair of soy sauce. It ain&#8217;t much. It ain&#8217;t even spectacular. But I knew for a fact that at 12, it tasted awesome. At least my family loved it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to watch the start of Junior Master Chef Australia. I know it&#8217;s long gone finished, but I think the show might just help me think of what I would have done if I was 12.</p>
<p>That sounds like a series of posts there&#8230;</p>
