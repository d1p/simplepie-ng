It was a super fast read (I finished it in a couple of hours) because I couldn't put it down. Near the end of the book I was really worried that there wasn't anyway everything was going to be wrapped up in time -- but somehow Lancaster managed it. I don't think this is a series, but even if it is, I was completely satisfied by the ending (unlike some other books I've read recently). I thought that the story was both interesting and fit well with the short format of the book (again, unlike some other dystopian books I've read recently). The characters grew, which I found fascinating in the short span of the novel. One of the things I liked best were the little editorials that were sprinkled throughout the book and the concept of the book itself as a format instead of just what we're reading. I hope Lancaster writes more and experiments with format as he did in this novel."&lt;br&gt;EgmontUSA (2011), Hardcover, 240 pages</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2011 15:37:26 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The Hypnotist: A Novel by Lars Kepler</title><link>http://www.librarything.com/work/book/78508659</link><description>&lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1441789758.01._SX90_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; clear: left;"/&gt; callmecayce's review: "I devoured this book in a matter of days (I think just two). I was meant to be reading something else, but I took this book with me to the doctor's office and had trouble putting it down. The cover says that it's like the Stieg Larsson series and they're right in some ways -- I loved that series and I didn't like it at all. It was violent and troubling and there were a few parts of the book that probably could have (should've?) been edited out, just like the Millennium trilogy. But overall, I liked the book and I really quite liked the main characters. The plot is quite involved and the bad guys don't show themselves until near the end -- but there's a moment when, after you've read everything, you suddenly realize exactly what happens -- and then you find out it's worse. Yes, as I said before, there's violence  and it definitely borders on graphic (and again, I draw comparisons to the Millennium trilogy). Which is partly why I both love and hate this book. 

It's about a hypnotist, but it's more than that. It's about murder and the brain, about solving a crime and about getting inside the heads of everyone involved (from the cop, who I liked quite a bit, to the wife of the hypnotist, to his son to the bad guys themselves). Fans of Scandinavian mysteries will like this book, as well fans of Larsson's Millennium trilogy. But even if their of those things types of books grip you, pick up The Hypnotist, because it's definitely a thrilling read.

Apparently (according to the LT reviews) I'm one of the few people who liked it. Maybe it's because I read a lot of Scandinavian fiction, but if you think this book is slow and meandering, you've never read Between Summer's Longing and Winter's End, because compared to that book, The Hypnotist is a first rate super fast thriller! Though I will confess to liking both books more than Larsson's."&lt;br&gt;Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2011), Edition: First Edition, Hardcover, 512 pages</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 19:11:58 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Enclave by Ann Aguirre</title><link>http://www.librarything.com/work/book/78508626</link><description>&lt;img src="http://pics.librarything.com/picsizes/db/0f/db0fc206b00bced593034545967426141414141.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; clear: left;"/&gt; callmecayce's review: "I listened to this book and at first I didn't think I was going to like it. The reader was quite young sounding and I was really sure that it worked -- and the way she voiced the male characters in the novel was somewhat distracting. But it was Aguirre's story that kept me going and eventually allowed me to just ignore whatever it was about the narrator that bothered me. While I've read a lot of series books that ended with cliffhangers and left me never wanting to read another book in the series again, Aguirre's novel did not do that. Instead, even when I finished the book I didn't realize there was going to be another. The story is self-contained and while there are plenty of unanswered questions, I didn't need to have them to feel satisfied at the ending. I am, of course, curious as to find out what happens next, but I probably won't pick up the audio book unless there's a different reader."&lt;br&gt;Not Avail (2011), Edition: Unabridged, Audio CD</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 19:10:04 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Until Thy Wrath Be Past by Asa Larsson</title><link>http://www.librarything.com/work/book/78452135</link><description>&lt;img src="http://pics.librarything.com/picsizes/e2/5f/e25f98d9050c24759344f4f5a51426141414141.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; clear: left;"/&gt; callmecayce's review: "I was really excited to get this book. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew I was going to like it and I was right. Larsson is a wonderful story teller. I really like her characters, even the bad guys are intriguing. There's a tiny twist of paranormal involving a ghost (but not the way you think) as a character, who proves to be one of the most moving of the novel. I enjoyed the mystery, even though as it progressed, we were fed more and more clues as to who the murderer was. But the story behind (and around) the murders was interesting enough to hold the book together. In fact, there were so many details that the story was far more complicated than I originally suspected. My only complaint is that the end of the book made me cry. It was such a bittersweet ending. I really cannot wait to find out what happens next, not because of a cliffhanger, but because I find I care about our main character, the prosecutor Rebecka Martinsson,"&lt;br&gt;SilverOak (2011), Edition: Tra, Hardcover, 256 pages</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 08:53:22 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Ashes by Ilsa J.

At times, I felt like like I was listening to a great fantasy epic that I never wanted to end (which was odd, because I don't like fantasy epics, though maybe I should start listening to them instead of trying to read them). In fact, even as I sat in the car this afternoon, waiting for Fire to end -- I didn't want it to end. I wanted to just keep on listening and listening to it forever. I loved all the characters in the novel and I especially loved how Cashore made them all into 3 dimensional characters, even those that only appears for a few scenes. I liked Fire. She was strong and wonderful and everything a good heroine should be, while at the same time she was mixed with a heavy does of how hard life truly is. I almost wanted to put the first disc back in and listen to the whole book again."&lt;br&gt;Penguin Audio (2009), Edition: Unabridged, Audio CD, 1 pages</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 13:06:07 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Planet of the Apes (Cinema Classics) by Pierre Boulle</title><link>http://www.librarything.com/work/book/77076091</link><description>&lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0517209489.01._SX90_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; clear: left;"/&gt; callmecayce's review: "I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, especially being a fan of the original movie and the current film, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. What I didn't expect was the book to be so good. While I heard the main character's voice in that of Heston's, that was one of only a few ways the movie stuck to the book (aside from the obvious). I enjoyed the change, especially the ending (they're both shocking in their own way, even when you know what's coming). I loved the apes, especially Zira. When I finished, I did wish that there had been a French movie version of Planet of the Apes, because I'd like to have seen it. Otherwise, this was very good, if very different from the very familiar movies. I'm glad I read it."&lt;br&gt;Gramercy Books (2000), Hardcover, 191 pages</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2011 15:00:29 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Forgotten by Cat Patrick</title><link>http://www.librarything.com/work/book/76945417</link><description>&lt;img src="http://pics.librarything.com/picsizes/02/78/0278cd6222ea66b597a2b315a41426141414141.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; clear: left;"/&gt; callmecayce's review: "I really enjoyed this book. The story telling was a bit predictable in some places, the pace was fast and I liked the reasoning why she might have lost her memories, though the pseudo-science was sometimes annoying (unless I just focused on the fantasy part of it). I did have a few issues with the way Luke was written, but that sort of sorted itself out by the end of the book. Overall, I enjoyed it and while it seemed like nothing was solved at the end of the book -- I felt totally satisfied, oddly enough."&lt;br&gt;Little, Brown Books for Young Readers (2011), Edition: 1, Hardcover, 304 pages</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2011 16:20:14 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
