 <title>SHFWire - Rebecca Koenig - Summer 2011</title>
 <link>http://shfwire.com/taxonomy/term/341/0</link>
 <description>
People make sense of the world through stories, and by conveying truths in ways that inspire others to reflect and discuss and act, journalists are among the most essential storytellers. I would like to contribute to the important work of forging intimate connections between witness, writer and reader, and am excited to do so this summer through the Scripps Howard Foundation Wire.
     
I am a senior at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Va., studying history and English. My areas of interest include creative nonfiction writing, early American history and public history. I serve as the managing editor of W&amp;M’s student newspaper, The Flat Hat, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.  

My other journalism experiences include a reporting internship with the Connection Newspapers of Northern Virginia and as a high school theater critic with the National Capital Area Critics and Awards Program (Cappies), in which I was named one of the top five critics of the year and published in The Washington Post.  My independent research on slave life interpretation at historic house museums has been published in The James Blair Historical Review.  I have also been published by Winged Nation literary magazine and the annual W&amp;M Literary Awards review.

When not in The Flat Hat office, I play clarinet in the W&amp;M Wind Symphony and chair a committee in the Student Environmental Action Coalition.

I grew up just outside of Washington in Springfield, Va., and am looking forward to gaining a new perspective on the city as a resident and reporter.**
