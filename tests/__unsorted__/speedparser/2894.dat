&lt;p&gt;Lynn  Hershman Leeson’s follows up her 2007 hybrid-documentary/narrative &lt;em&gt; Strange Culture&lt;/em&gt; with a hybrid-documentary/autobiography. &lt;em&gt;!WAR Women Art  Revolution&lt;/em&gt; marries her experiences as an artist at the cutting edge of  the second wave women’s movement with an intensive history lesson about  the use of art as a tool for social change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using  interviews with artists recorded in her home over the course of 40+  years, Hershman weaves archival footage of performances, protests and  consciousness-raising groups to celebrate and draw lessons from the  movement. While paying direct tribute to their work, she articulates the  angst they experienced at the hands of condescending art teachers and  the indifferent (when not outright hostile) gatekeepers of the  mainstream art scene. At the time, the leading trend for contemporary  art was hyper-minimal painting and not the loud, brash work that  occassionally involved body fluids that the women were doing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hershman  also highlights the difficulty in forming collectives on the basis of  identity politics because once the common enemy is lost the group can  lose its focus. But for the time being, many of the women thrived  existing with both outsider status and a community to come back to. They  created new forums and channels for artists to present to, publicize  and educate the public and Hershman has access to an exhaustive  collection of photographs, video footage and handmade zines to re-create  the heady experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;!WAR &lt;/em&gt;follows a similar trajectory as many band documentaries -- the  excitement of being weirdos having fun and doing something new, the  delight in shocking the establishment and the incremental successes that  were managed with varying degrees of certainty. Eventually in-fighting  led to resentments, splintering and even the possible murder of one  artist. In a music documentary this would serve as the low-point of the  story and anything that came after would need to be framed as a  comeback. But art critic B. Ruby Rich is quick to point out that the  culture only benefits from a chaotic marketplace of ideas and that it’s  the constant dialogue about feminist art that continues to make it one  of the most vital arenas of expression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hershman’s  own professional life as a performance, visual and film artist is  framed as a similar three-act success story. She was rasied a nice  Jewish girl in the suburbs, radicalized by her experiences at Berkeley  in the 1960s and moved to New York. For over 20 years she received very  little recognition from the art world until when in the late 90s she  found a gallery owner who believed in her and sold her entire collection  for a massive (undisclosed) sum of money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly  &lt;em&gt;!WAR&lt;/em&gt; treats younger artists like Miranda July (whose second feature  film also screens at Sundance this year) and MacArthur Genius Janine  Antoni as existing on a continuum rather than the people for who ‘the  torch was passed down’. The music for the film is entirely made up of  post-1990’s indie rock mainstays like Le Tigre and The Gossip with an  original score by an early iteration of the Carrie Brownstein/Mary  Timony supergroup Wild Flag -- creating a historical document that  continues to live and breathe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At  the heart of &lt;em&gt;!WAR &lt;/em&gt;is the desire to see feminist artists included in the  broader institutions (many of the artists included are now professors  and historians at major universities). The film ends with the bold  message that there are no outtakes, only archives -- available in full  as part of the &lt;a href="http://lib.stanford.edu/node/6011/videos" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Digital Collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There  are films that take on a mythic levels of importance in their  community, the gravity of their reception often owes more to timing and  necessity than merit. Some stories reflect so much pain, regret or shame  that any mention of the subject in a public way immediately transforms  the casual film-going experience into a cathartic purge that in all  likelihood has little to do even with filmmakers' intentions. These  works still serve a purpose: they give voice to those under-represented  in mainstream culture, they open people up to human experiences they may  not have even known existed and they spread that much ballyhooed  disinfectant -- sunlight -- into places that desperately need it. But  they don't typically reflect a great deal of craft and rarely hold up to  repeat viewings (anyone revisit &lt;em&gt;Torch Song Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; recently? Yeesh.) They are films that serve an important function, but are largely disposable.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But co-directors David Weissman and Bill Weber (&lt;em&gt;The Cockettes&lt;/em&gt;)  have made a thoughtful, firsthand account of what it was like to be at  ground zero during a widely misunderstood epidemic and the beautiful,  ugly and ultimately mundane human impulses that natural disasters lay  bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Were Here&lt;/em&gt; paints life San Francisco in the late 1970s as what probably wasn't, but will still be thought of as a  utopic paradise. Far from the violent, hard-edged legacy of the  Stonewall riots in New York City, San Francisco, bathed in the golden  California sun, with all precepts of the 1950s WASP-y perfection already  demolished by the Haight-Ashbury hippies and diverse immigrant  populace, was the Promise Land to queer kids escaping hateful or  hate-inducingly dull Midwestern burgs looking for a taste of the  hedonistic, good life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  story relies solely on five interview subjects strategically placed to  cover much of the breadth of the crisis: a hospice nurse, an artist who  dated a clinical biologist, a budding politician, a flower shop owner  based in the Castro and a young journalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There  are some harrowing images drawn by the film, a stubborn lover arguing  about whether to be taken to the emergency room over a low temperature  then dying during the short car ride to the hospital, a room full of  doctors at a national conference to discuss AIDS drug trials breaking  down sobbing over how badly they were failing their patients and the  dread every person faced having to choose between which sick friends to  attend to and which to shut out as a matter of self-preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  film deftly avoids too much blame-shifting or rearview mirror  grandstanding in lieu of underscoring the personal experiences in total  chaos and uncertainty. At the apex of anxiety President Ronald Reagan  appears. The oft invoked Republican icon of kinder, gentler (whiter,  straighter, wealthier) days -- is typically portrayed in documentaries  about this time as having been at best a clueless dolt and at worse a  cruel dilletante who laughed off a genocide as it was happening on  American soil. Here he's given a pass for being insulated by closeted gay staff members before focus is quickly shifted back to a young, overwhelmed  community organizer who is trying to deal with the  sudden upsurge of people starving to death in their apartments because  they became too sick too quickly to feed themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weissman  and Weber understand that cruelty and destruction hardens some,  vulcanizes others but leaves most simply baffled. There's nothing  extraordinary about the people who survived the early years of AIDS. And  a lucky combination of chance, privilege and clear-headed thinking in  times of pandemonium does not make for a happy ending to any cognizant  human being. Still, it's a cliche for a reason, out of the wreckage and  despair came real medical breakthroughs, a new respect between gay men  and lesbian women and a generation of queers who had too much to be  proud of (and too much to lose) to consider a life in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Most of the kids are biracial, their parents were African  immigrants who have disappeared, been deported or lost their custody  rights within the cruel bureacracies of a post-Soviet burg. Many of them  were put into the system at an old enough age to dimly recall their  biological parents and for the most part seem to have adjusted to their  new family structure. <br /><br />The  film opens depicting the multi-culti clan like a bucolic Bennetton ad  -- children playing with goats, harvesting fresh vegetables and always  smiling all the while being effusive and adorable. A town magistrate  even presents an award to the group for Olga’s Promethean efforts  towards improving the lives of disadvantaged children. <br /><br />But  quickly something more sinister is revealed. Olga's need for control  and her personal racial biases, filtered through lingering affections  for the old Soviet culture of discipline and conformity -- is slamming  hard against some of the adolescents’ ideas and expectations for their  own future. Instead of seeing her rundown home (purchased with money  from a British charity which years later still has no hot water or  indoor plumbing) as a launching point, she views her it as a means for  rebuilding a new society. In Olga’s vision they live simply, celebrating  cooperative work and diversity. But from the children’s more modern  take on things, this life represents constant menial labor and arbitrary  governance which renders many of them fundamentally joyless and unable  to imagine an autonomous life outside of Olga’s strict control. <br /><br />Using  the lack of oversight in the foster care system and the virulent racism  of smalltown Ukraine as a shield from criticism, Olga blocks potential  adoptions for three of the children, constantly belittles anyone who  exerts a sense of independence, openly chooses favorites and even  institutionalizes one boy who requires too much discipline, telling him  he’s too slow a reader to live at home.<br /><br />Filmed  over the course of three years, first-time filmmaker Julia Ivanova  deftly creates and subverts expectations for the viewer while drawing  out complicated emotional processes from Olga’s children as they sit at  the crossroad between a (truncated) childhood and limited adulthood. <br /><br /><br /> <a href="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20148c7f44fd2970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GreenWave" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451e03769e20148c7f44fd2970c" height="228" src="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20148c7f44fd2970c-500wi" title="GreenWave" width="446" /></a> <br /><em>The Green Wave</em><br /> Ali Samadi Ahadi / Iran<br /><br />In  Iran’s 2009 election for prime minister reformist candidate (and former  president) Mir-Hossein Mousavi squared off against the five-term  incumbent Mamoud Ahmadinejad. The internationally reviled Ahmadinejad  has long been criticized for political corruption and cow-towing to arch  conservative religious clerics within Iran paving the way for Mousavi  to run on a simple platform of “respect for different cultural groups,  equal rights for women and more democracy”. <br /><br />Subjects  in two different Sundance selections this year, <em>The Green Wave</em> and <em>An  African Election </em>cite the international wave of optimism created by the  election of Barack Obama in the United States. In the days leading up to  the election, people who describe themselves as apolitical or  completely disenchanted with the democratic process talk about the  joyful reinvigoration they felt for the future of their country. And  even elderly people began to feel rays of hope break though years of  well-earned cycnicism about a fair and open democratic process. <br /><br />Despite  a state-controlled press and heavily censored internet acccess, the  enthusiasm gap began to swell as the election drew closer. In the days  leading up to voting there was an unprecedented outpouring of support  for Mousavi. Thousands of young people turned perfunctory public  endorsement exercises into massive rallies, volunteered at polling  locations and adorned themselves with the green armbands that would come  to name their movement “the green wave”. This identification with the  color green (which represents vitality and progress in the Iranian flag)  also become an internet meme when non-Iranians tinted their Twitter  avatars to show support for the heinous fallout of the election.<br /> <br />Immediately  the election returns didn’t pass the smell test for Mousavi supporters.  The official results were far off from what exit polls had indicated  and in some cases didn't even accurately reflect basic population data  about certain districts. Young people once again took to the streets,  this time with shock, grief and rage. And as they did Foreign reporters  were forcibly removed (including <em>Iraq in Fragments</em> director and  MacArthur Genius fellow James Longley), cell phone communications were  shut down and private militia groups (commonly used as auxilliary police  forces)  were dispatched to beat, apprehend and eventually gun down  protestors.<br /><br />A  recent United Nations Development Programme study reported that over  60% of Iran's population is under the age of thirty and reflective of  its youth and vigor their street protests are massive, energetic and  immediate. It's fitting that  depictions of their struggle would be told  with a mix of old and new techniques. <em>The Green Wave</em> uses standard  interviews with journalists, diplomats, clerics and lawyers and  intercuts it with animated footage of the surreptitious blog and Twitter  posts made during the protests. There is also a patchwork of cell phone  video footage that had to be physically smuggled out of the country  after all internet communication had been shut down.   <br /><br />Most  people have grown somewhat inured to massive human rights violations as  a matter of being able to function in our current reality. There are  more conflicts than ever and our ability to quickly transmit images,  video and raw data worldwide hasn't had the antiseptic impact we'd like  to believe it's capable of. Animation is so strongly associated with  children's entertainment, there's a sense in watching the footage that  nothing too terrible could happen and it helps the viewers resist the  urge to look away. <br /><br />The  haphazard cell phone footage (which appears to have been often shot  from neighboring apartment windows but often also from a groundview) of  police beating (badges removed) beating unarmed protestors is  reminiscent of the 1991 Rodney King beatings that led to violent riots  in Los Angeles and has remained a touchstone of racial animosity in  America ever since. Many of the heinous acts committed by the Iranian  government now exist in the permamenent record of the internet, <em>The  Green Wave</em> (and hopefully many more like it to come) weave together  personal narratives that provide more understanding of both the tumult  and the stakes for people living under a repressive regime.</p></div>

&lt;p&gt;Government property seizure is a tough cinematic sell. If the rules  of society have broken down to the point where thugs, corrupt political  officials and/or armed militias are forcibly removing people from their  homes there are usually even more viscerally terrifying crimes  happening in the foreground that are likely to capture public attention.  But when the peace treaties have been signed, the news cameras have  left and the garbage is getting picked up each week there are still deep  wounds that can leave generations of disenfranchised and embittered  people whose ancestors have been stripped of their homes, livelihoods  and cultural legacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mugabe and the White African&lt;/em&gt; centers on Mike Campbell, an Australian-born naturalized citizen of  Zimbabwe (and the filmmaker's father-in-law) who has been a farmer in  his adopted country since the late 1960s. But for the better part of a  decade, Campbell has been embroiled in a legal fight against dictator Robert Mugabe's  land reform policies that seized redistributed property from white  residents who purchased the land while the last dictator was in power  and give it to poor black residents who were long-discriminated against  by white politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

Critics say a reporter’s chief  concern should be objectivity which would (understandably) be comprised  when sharing life and death situations on a daily basis. Proponents say  it provides an invaluable view of war from the ground-eye perspective of  the troops. I tend to fall in the latter category, and feel it’s a far  more damning statement about the predicament of journalism that any one  reporters’ work is expected (by editors or readers) to be all things to  all people.</p>
<p><em>Restrepo</em>, the collaborative effort between author Sebastian Junger (who also penned the bestseller "<em>The Perfect Storm"</em>)  and photographer Tim Hetherington, depicts five months (over the course  of a year) spent at an outpost in the Korengal Valley, the most violent  front in the Afghanistan war. The film -- which opened the Sundance  film festival earlier this year and picked up the Grand Jury Prize  --builds its story with on-the-ground footage as the soldiers inch along  the valley, picking off Taliban members and trying to convince locals  not to accept the $5/day payment to fight the United States on the  Taliban’s behalf.</p>
<p><em>Restrepo</em>’s press materials doggedly identify the film as both  apolitical and being absolute reality. It presents the horrors and the  boredoms of war, but the nature of filmmaking does not allow for  straight across “truth”. What we see in <em>Restrepo</em> is more along the lines of what Werner Herzog has referred to as “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI3f5-Vdi7g" target="_blank">the ecstatic truth</a>”  of these soldiers’ experiences. The film contains no interviews with  diplomats or generals and what little context the filmmakers provide is  presented via interviews with the surviving soldiers filmed months after  the fact.</p>

<p>Emily Hagins had been a cinephile since age 7 and at the age of 12  was determined to make the leap to feature-length director with <em>Pathogen</em>,  an original zombie film she penned herself. Growing up in Austin, TX, a  hotbed for DIY film-making, she has aww-inspiring parents who, with  some mild amusement and exhaustive determination to help her succeed,  support her creative endeavors.</p>
<p>As with most film-making ventures, the real antagonist in Emily's story, told in the documentary <em>Zombie Girl</em>,  is life itself. The bevy of adult mentors who have advised and tutored  her along the way are quick to point out not that she presents any great  level of innate talent for film-making but that her determination and  enthusiasm (and preternatural gift to network) is hard not to cheer for.  But emphasizing the need for organization and preparation and the  danger of getting caught up in frustrations is a difficult message to  convey to film-makers twice Emily's age. As the obstacles begin to pile  up (stars being grounded, falling behind on homework and ceaseless  technical problems), we see that the greatest barrier to filmmaking may  be finding the wherewithall to finish a project at all.</p>

<p>Long-time  political media consultant David Soll’s documentary debut, presents a  brief history of and insight into the renaissance of the puppet arts.  Following a vaunted puppeteer as he brings his latest full-scale  production together, Soll builds a larger narrative about the trials  faced by artists whose work exists on the fringes of acceptable art.<br /><br />Similar  to what Amir Bar Lev’s <em>My Kid Could Paint That</em> did for modern art,  Puppet provides an excellent primer on the history of puppetry, its key  players and the pushes and pulls within their peculiar community. <em> Puppet</em> attempts to understand what it is about expressing  themselves through intricate blocks of wood that puppeteers find so  appealing. <br /><br />Around  the world and throughout history, puppet theater has been revered as  high art (allegedly, in Indonesia puppeteers are considered prophets).  But in the United States, the grind of capitalism and the insularity of  professional art has banished it to the realm of children’s  entertainment. As a result of never being taken seriously, struggling  puppet artists can have trouble differentiating between when to stay  true to their vision and when to absorb valid criticism.  <br /><br /><em>Puppet</em> follows Dan Hurlin, a leader in the field of puppetry, over the course  of two years as he produces his new show “Disfarmer”. For Hurlin the  stakes are high; his last effort, “Hiroshima Maiden,” told the story of  two young women who survived the bombings and were later  pressured into appearing on an American talk show in exchange for corrective plastic surgery. At the live taping they were presented with the "surprise guests" -- two pilots  of Enola Gay who had dropped the atomic bomb on their country. Hurlin spent years adapting the story for stage and  opening ticket sales were strong. But when an extremely negative review  ran in the New York Times, the production was shuttered within a week  and the blow to Hurlin’s pride is one that clearly still haunts him. <br /><br />Hurlin’s  latest work is based on another true story about Mike Disfarmer, an  eccentric portrait artist who documented rural communities in Arkansas  in the 1950s. The play takes place the last week of Disfarmer’s life, as  he wastes away from old age alone, reflecting upon his life and work.</p>
<p><a href="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20133f5961f34970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Puppet" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451e03769e20133f5961f34970b" height="234" src="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20133f5961f34970b-500wi" title="Puppet" width="415" /></a></p>
<p>The  vitriolic (and utterly delightful) theater critic David Sefton makes  the diagnosis that many fringe artforms are dominated by craftsmen and  lack enough storytellers. He goes on to explain that if artists are too  in love with the process of their chosen field, then the results are  inevitably something esoteric and/or precious. <br /><br />Soll  clearly agrees with this description for what’s missing in Hurlin’s  work; he shows us a lot of moments of Hurlin  hemming and hawing over minor details while joking about how threadbare the actual content of the story is. The puppeteer desperately trys to force ill-defined  ‘collaboration’ out of his puppet operators who would clearly prefer  simpler, stronger direction. If Hurlin is, as one of his key funders  suggests, the most vital voice in puppeteering today, he probably should  be able to better express his emotional connection to the work he’s  doing. But instead he cocoons himself in details. No “spoilers” here  about how the show goes or how it’s received, but it probably provides a good  learning experience for participants and viewers alike.<br /><br />As  a whole, <em>Puppet</em> is a thoughtful exploration about the the artistic  process that also captures some of the nuances about how we relate (and  react) to human experiences being conveyed in unfamiliar ways.<br /><br /><br /><em>Puppet</em> makes its world premiere at <a href="http://www.docnyc.net" target="_self">DOC NYC</a> November 6th and 9th.</p></div>

As an ally to the United  States in Afghanistan, their missions focus on traveling around the  hardened countryside and appealing to farmers to inform on Taliban  members who may be hiding in the region. Their limited interaction with  the local population is not heartening, as locals express fear they will  be killed if they are known to be assisting the soldiers. And the  constant shell campaigns and forced clearing of their poppy fields do  nothing to endear the soldiers to them. <br /><br />It’s intriguing to see what motivates young people from a country without a  long or romanticized military history to join the forces. In a  fantastic opening scene, the commanding field officer gives newly  arrived soldiers their first debriefing. “You might be asking yourself,  why do I belong here?” he begins, and goes on to elaborate that they  must continue the work their countrymen have started and try not to get  too caught up in the details. In later conversation, soldiers mention  that prior to enlisting they thought (hoped) they’d be stationed in the  Balkans and simply oversee a mostly peaceful situation. They’re not  optimistic about intangible victories in a warzone furhter mired by a  hopeless political situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20133f564a207970b-popup" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Armadillo" height="228" src="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e03769e20133f564a207970b-500wi" title="Armadillo" width="417" /></a><br />There’s  an interesting comparison to be made here with Sebastian Junger’s and  Tim Heatherington’s film <em>Restrepo</em> (review to come). On the surface, they exist at  opposite ends of the filmmaking spectrum. <em>Armadillo</em> is beautifully shot  (the film was apparently a test campaign for a new model of HD cameras  to see how they handled in the worst possible field conditions),  cinema-verite style with no talking head interviews or voiceover. <em> Restrepo</em> has a much gritter look and relies on Junger’s direct  conversations with soldiers on the ground and after the fact. Despite  differences in technique, both films rely on a strong, three act  narrative thrust and recognizable tropes from the war film canon. <br /><br />Additionally, <em> Armadillo</em> and <em>Restrepo</em> were both released this year with extremely  prestigious festival runs. Armadillo opened in the Critics Week section  of Cannes (a rare honor for a documentary, also bestowed this year on  Charles Ferguson’s <em>Inside Job</em>). <em>Restrepo</em> premiered in January at the  Sundance film festival. <br /><br />Both  films show soldiers playfully wrestling with each another to substitute  for the physical comfort of home. Each film takes care to highlight the  extreme Otherness of the soldiers’ situation; dressed like camouflaged  spacemen, they try to negotiate agreements with extremely poor Afghan  farmers. The two films’ final act hinges on an unfortunate  miscommunication that causes things to get very bloody. <em>Restrepo</em> builds  towards a particularly gruesome and chaotic gunfight that stemmed from a  double-dealing village elder. In <em>Armadillo</em>, a misconstrued phone call  home leads to an internal investigation, making everyone in the unit  suspicious of one another and revealing a great deal of rancor between  the commanding field officers and generals back home. <br /><br />This  past year, Scandinavian documentary filmmakers have created intense  work pluming their sense of national and masculine identity. But where  films like <em>Steam of Life, The Regretters </em>and<em> Freetime Machos</em> drew men  out about their very intimate experiences and connected them with more  universal truths. Despite the Afghanistan war being an American-led  enterprise with spotty international support, Metz has clearly made a  film for the homeland. The bloodshed he captures is gruesome, but fairly  standard practice for wartime conflict and will be of little shock to  an American audience. In fact, most American reviews have focused mainly  on how beautiful <em>Armadillo</em> is to look at. But the civilian casualties  in particular have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jun/03/armadillo-danish-documentary-afghanistan" target="_blank">captured the Danish imagination</a>. <em>Armadillo</em> has  dwarfed Hollywood fare at the box office, received reams of press  coverage and evoked so much public outcry that every elected official  has been forced to comment. <br /><br />Even  <a href="http://steadydietoffilm.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/review-the-tillman-story.html" target="_self"><em>The Tillman Story</em></a>, which unearthed a deliberate campaign of lies and  misdirection that traces all the way to Donald Rumsfeld (and also benefitted from an extremely prestigious festival push), barely made a  dent in the box office or public discourse about the war. I write this  on voting day of a heated mid-term election where candidates have made  serious hay on issues like taxes, healthcare, deficits and the media  while Afghanistan has gone wholly unmentioned. <em>Armadillo</em> is a thoughtful  reflection on how the Afghan war has impacted the young lives of  soldiers from our allied countries and could represent a tipping point  in where those allies will stand as we move forward in a war that has  all but left our collective conscience. <br /><br /><br /><em>Armadillo</em> makes its US debut at the inaugural <a href="http://www.docnyc.net/" target="_blank">DOC NYC</a> film festival November 4th.</p></div>

The  former governor of New York turned national joke turned CNN talk show host Eliot Spitzer. <br /><br />Gibney  is a fascinating filmmaker, with a bewildering output in terms of both  mass quantity and startlingly inconsistent quality. After working for  two decades as a television producer, he exploded on the documentary  scene in 2005 with <em>Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room</em>, a detailed and  affable account of what would apparently be the tip of the iceberg for  complex financial scandals. In 2007 he won an Academy Award for <em>Taxi to  the Dark Side</em>, an impassioned examination of interrogation techniques  inspired by the life and work of his father, a former military  interrogator. That same year he released the terminally dull <em>Gonzo: The  Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson</em>, in which Gibney seemed to be at  a 118-minute loss for how to depict someone who has already been  endlessly mythologized. <br /><br />This  year he released <em>Casino Jack and The United States of Money</em>, a turgid, lifeless attempt to further  takedown lobbyist/convicted felon Jack Abramoff. Yet Gibney also  contributed one of those most artful and thoughtful short pieces to the  omnibus documentary <em>Freakonomics</em> in which he took the absurdly  unfilmable subject of an economist’s study of cheating in Sumo wrestling  and created a haunting and tragic snapshot of integrity ceding to  avarice. He’s also directed a film version of Lawrence Wright’s one-man  play "My Trip to Al-Qaeda".<em> Client #9</em> continues to demonstrate that Gibney  is far more comfortable with subjects who 1. participate on-camera  and 2. perceive themselves as some kind of victim. <br /><br />In Spitzer’s retelling of his own life, he’s victim of both of his  own hubris and a dark cabal of powerful enemies. When he was elected New  York State Attorney General, he transformed an office that had  previously been used to reprimand unscrupulous car salesmen into a  ruthless crime-fighting machine. They went after mobsters and high-level  white collar criminals, often undercutting Federal investigations and  always grabbing as many headlines  along the way. Spitzer also did very  little to discourage the whisper campaign that he would someday be  president of the United States.</p>
<p>But  in 2008 then-Governor Spitzer was linked with a high-class prostitution  ring and overnight went from being a populist hero to a national joke.  Never charged with a crime or named in any of the leaked affidavits, his  inevitable resignation took out a visible enemy of many powerful  people. And in the wake of several high-level Republican officials being  linked with prostitutes and infidelity (with little to no repercussions  to their political careers) tongues began wagging about the unfairness  of it all.</p>
<p>Spitzer  trots out some well-rehearsed statements about regret and  accepting accountability that couldn’t be any less  sincere. It’s clear he  believes as long as his ideological opponents  are also doing bad things  that the world has treated him unfairly and  there’s nothing weird about  staying angry about it forever.</p>
<p>Gibney  has always had a knack for bloating 90 minutes worth of content into two-hour films. If there is some personal life quota that needs to be  met to justify the subtitle “The Rise and the Fall of” there are better  choices than the nauseating sentimentality in reinacted scenes of an  overbearing immigrant father who withheld affection (and didn’t let a 10  year old Eliot win at Monopoly) or unctuous lines like “Spitzer  approached his work with the same veracity he did his tennis game”. And  for as much time as we’re made to ponder the personal lives of his  political enemies, there’s a glaring void in the confessional record when Spitzer summarizes how his decline has affected his wife Silda (or their three  daughters) in the statement “this experience has made me realize the  depth of her forgiveness.”</p>

<p>Still,  when Gibney is at his best there’s no better investigative provocateur  working in documentary film. He untangles the threads of an elaborate  conspiracy that involves scorned financial industry tycoons, the former  head of the New York Stock Exchange, professional political hitman Roger  Stone and the former Republican leader of the New York State Senate --  then gleefully confronts each of them with his findings. It’s a  wonderful (and awful) illustration of the sick culture from which they  all derive that they can each just smirk and crack wise about taking  down Spitzer. Watching <em>Client #9</em>, it’s striking that the 2008 financial  meltdown has become the anti-Woodstock for Baby Boomers with God  complexes. Over the course of this film, no fewer than three people  insist that if not for that pesky firing, being voted out by the board or  resigning in disgrace then they alone could have prevented the collapse of  this complicated system. <br /><br />Gibney  is much less effective in his handling of how much paying for sex actually brought about Spitzer’s downfall. He delights in depicting Ashley Dupre, the  $2,000/hour call girl and the former Governor’s go-to gal, as a vacuous  self-promoter. The film whirls through dozens of images of her partying  in skimpy clothing and sneers when she goes on Fox News and lip syncs to  Christmas carols. Simply to reveal that Dupre <strong>only</strong> one “date” with Spitzer. <br /><br />Is  it supposed to be a startling revelation that a New Jersey high school  dropout turned call girl has made bad decisions in her life? Or perhaps  the audience is supposed to draw a meaningful comparison to Spitzer’s  life of luxury and privilege also leading to bad choices. At any rate,  the film trots out a law professor who works himself into some serious  pearl-clutching histrionics about the arcane law used to justify the  investigation of Spitzer “never being used to prosecute Johns.” Good  heavens! Conversely, the film showers respect and soft-lit adoration for  “Angelina”, another (apparently, more favored) former call girl who is now working as a day trader (oh, the Circle of  Life). She left New York when the scandal broke and is now going public via a  private interview with Gibney that was transcribed and performed in the film by an  actress. <br /><br />These  women are both victims of a bizarro chess game being played by men who  take pleasure in crushing anyone who endangers the many zeros on their  paychecks, political accolades or television appearances. And while a filmmaker's affinity towards the one who would give an  interview is understandable, the lengths gone to make a joke out of  Dupre seem more than a little redundant. <br /><br />Still, <em>Client  #9</em> is easily counted in Gibney’s "win" column, the film is a fascinating, prismatic view into a culture where political power, moral integrity and  privacy intersect in ways that impact the rest of the world.<br /><br /><br /><em>Client #9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer </em>opens November 5th in New York.</p></div>
