			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve been all over the place lately and haven&#8217;t had opinions to share like I normally do. Also, the blogging community has slowed down a lot so for myself and for anyone who reads it here is an update on my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>My coworker of the last 7 years nearly (that&#8217;s how long I&#8217;ve worked at my current job) retired so all the stuff she did I now do, including kind of being in charge. We also have a new coworker, whom is so great so far and am so happy, I really needed someone who could pick up the slack and keep me sane.</li>
<li>Photography has slowed down so much for me. I haven&#8217;t been trying to get jobs or work and I barely use my camera at all. It makes me sad but I just have been out of my head lately and just haven&#8217;t had it in me. I plan to pick it up again in the near future when things calm down.</li>
<li>My hypothyroidism has gotten worse, as it seems, and I really want to get control of it. I don&#8217;t really know how to do this yet but I&#8217;m going to figure it out. I&#8217;m sick of being tired all the time and depressed. I want energy again. I want to feel human again. There is so much conflicting information out there I feel lost and don&#8217;t know where to go.</li>
<li>I have personal stuff I want to deal with but I don&#8217;t want to either, I just don&#8217;t have the energy. For now, I&#8217;m just going to try to attempt to relax.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Brothers &amp; Sisters lately (thanks to <a href="http://strangecondition.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Amanda</a>), which I&#8217;ve gotten sucked into but the characters also drive me kind of crazy. We finished season 1 of Game of Thrones, which we&#8217;re pretty into even if I can&#8217;t remember <em>anyone&#8217;s</em> names, what the fuck is my problem with names and period stuff?</li>
<li>Manly Man is still out of work, which is hard, so hard but he&#8217;s been cooking a lot and finding passion in that. I keep saying though, he has to find someone to hire him eventually but I&#8217;ve been saying that for almost 3 years. 3. Fucking. Years.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; width: 600px; margin-right: auto; height: 249px; text-align: center;" src="http://www.lifeisnotamovie.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/an_education_trailer_gawker.flv.jpg" alt="an_education_trailer_gawker.flv.jpg" width="600" height="249" /></p>
<p>I offered to make a movie list for some family members when we were on vacation and I thought I might as well share the same list with all of you. I stand by every single one of these movies, especially the ones that seem not all that interesting&#8230;those are the ones in particular I recommend. You can also see my lists, etc. on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur24835627/lists" target="_blank"><strong>Imdb.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HORROR</span></strong></p>
<p><em>note: so most of these horror movies are either the kind to give you a heart attack from the suspense or just plain terrify you to the point you sleep with the lights on. You&#8217;ve been warned.</em></p>
<p><strong>Funny Games</strong> [There is a 90s German version and a current American version. Both were done by the same director shot for shot so I approve of the American version even though I haven't seen it. I mostly recommend the newer version because it has Tim Roth and Michael Pitt in it.]</p>
<p><strong>Martyrs</strong> [This foreign horror film actually caused Manly Man to storm out at the end of it saying "I can't believe you made me watch that." Now they are in the process of making an American version but I'm fairly certain there is no way we can pull of that kind of insanity but who knows. This one gets a real serious warning, don't watch this if you get too squeamish.]</p>
<p><strong>Audition</strong> [This is an Asian horror film and one of the best of it's kind. So creepy and there are memories from it I will never ever forget.]</p>
<p><strong>The Orphanage</strong> [Super creepy and awesome.]</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOCUMENTARIES</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>King of Kong</strong> [The only reason I watched this was because Gwen recommended it and for the most part I trust her recommendations. I did not think I'd get into a documentary about Donkey Kong but I was on the edge of my fucking seat the entire time. If anything you need to watch this to meet the most vile man on the planet, Billy, if I ever see him in person I hope to knee him in the nuts.]</p>
<p><strong>Man on Wire</strong> [Beautfiul (true) story and I loved how the film was put together. About a man who decided to walk a tight rope between the Twin Towers.]</p>
<p><strong>Lord Save Us From Your Followers</strong> [You might think this was about how much I hate religion (which I do) and how all the followers are a bunch of knobs but it's not, it moved me to tears and is something every single person needs to see.]</p>
<p><strong>The Thin Blue Line</strong> [A man is put in prison for a crime he did not committ and this documentary set him free.]</p>
<p><strong>Wasteland</strong> [About a man who visits the largest landfill on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro and the journey he takes is an emotional one.]</p>
<p><strong>Capturing the Friedmans</strong> [I can almost guarantee you'll come out of this movie with no answers and that's the best part of it. Also it's a fascinating case.]</p>
<p><strong>Hot Coffee</strong> [This only just came out but wow, I had a totally different opinion when I went into this than what I came out with. It's about our litigious society (we are sue happy) and it starts with the woman who sued McDonalds for being burned by her coffee. I had always thought this woman was nuts but turns out, I didn't know the whole story.]</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAMAS</span></strong></p>
<p><em>note: I&#8217;m not going to explain these, watch them or not, I don&#8217;t care. They are good, that&#8217;s all that matters.</em></p>
<p><strong>One Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Somers Town</strong></p>
<p><strong>An Education</strong></p>

<p>Is it too much to ask for people to just be mature enough to accept responsibility for their own actions and to take enough time to understand where other people are coming from? I don’t care if you laugh at dick jokes or if you show some cleavage at an “inappropriate” time. I don’t give a crap if you like to watch 90210 or if you like to go out sometimes to get drunk.</p>
<p>All I care about is being a responsible adult when you are in a professional setting. That means respecting your co-workers, being on time and doing your job. What is doing your job? Well it’s not about just getting your work done but it is also being available when something needs to be done and leaving your attitude at home. If you are lucky enough to have a job in this day and age then appreciate the fuck out of it because there are at least 50 people who would be glad to have it.</p>
<p>I also care about being a decent human being, especially when it comes to the people in your life. Keep in mind that when you are being selfish that just maybe it is hurting other people. The world does not revolve around you, you are not the center of the universe. It just so happens that when you don’t give a shit someone else may have to pick up the slack. Just maybe someone else is carrying the burden and the stress and the bullshit.</p>
<p>In this world we don’t get everything just the way we want without working for it. We have to put up with crap and learn to do things that we don’t want to do. In this world, attitude will only hold you back and ignorance will be the chains that bind you.</p>
<p>So my suggestion is to take some time and see the world beyond yourself. That the choices we make effect other people. That karma is only bitch if you are.</p>

<li>I&#8217;m thinking about how I&#8217;m kind of shaky but I think this time it&#8217;s the coffee and not the anxiety.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking I need to learn how to just keep my mouth shut and just ignore the bad feelings I get. Whenever I speak up I regret it and wish I&#8217;d just kept it to myself.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking that these new bras I desperately needed are beyond awesome, must review them online so others can know the joy of my breasts.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking I have so many notes and stickies everywhere lateley (including an app to yell at me to remind me to do shit) that I feel a bit altzheimers lately.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m excited to have next week off but stressed because there is so much going on at work and I&#8217;m going to be completely overwhelmed when I come back.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking despite the shit at work I need a week off for my insanity and the fact I may not have any real time off for a long time to come.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking I need some time off social media, it can do bizarre things to you.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking I really just think way too much, must find a way to stop this.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am easily moved to tears. I’m an emotional person who will cry over a tragedy, a celebrity death and just the passing of a person I’d never heard of before. I read articles online of an unfortunate death and I tear up. I don’t cry over everyone but I have no idea what loss will effect me and when. </p>
<p>It seems many look down on anyone mourning Amy Winehouse’s death because she deserved it. She had a drug problem and most likely that is what killed her. Because she was a drug addict did she deserve to die? No, every death is sad and unfortunate. She was someone’s daughter and friend. If a good friend of mine had a drug problem, even if I lost touch, I’d be devastated. When this happens, that’s what I always think about. I think about those who loved that person and how much it had to hurt to lose them. I can’t even imagine.</p>
<p>What happened in Norway was also devastating and something that should never have happened. I would never compare this to Amy Winehouse or any other person who died. Why must we compare?</p>
<p>Do you know what is happening in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/20/somalia-famine-refugee-camp?intcmp=122" target="_blank">Somalia</a>? This too is tragic and incredibly painful to think about. There is so much pain in the world right now, more than it seems is even possible. Our country falling apart is beyond comprehension to me, even though to me it seems we caused it. So many people (such as my husband) are suffering because of our country’s problems who are completely shut out of the work force. He can’t even get a job as a pizza delivery person and he’s a skilled tradesman.</p>
<p>There are also beautiful things in this world like 2 grandmothers being the <a href="http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/9760267-two-grandmothers-the-first-gay-marriage-in-new-york" target="_blank">first gay marriage in New York</a>. So there is something good still happening in this world among all the sadness. I just am so bothered that with everything happening people seem to be arguing over which is worse or trashing people that died. What is wrong with us? How did we get to a place of such judgment and such anger over something we should all come together over?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; width: 602px; margin-right: auto; height: 330px; text-align: center;" src="http://www.lifeisnotamovie.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cache1.jpg" alt="cache.jpg" width="602" height="330" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if there is a point in reviewing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387898/" target="_blank">Cache</a> because I don&#8217;t think many people could sit through a very slow, fairly long, foreign film with subtitles. I could be wrong though, so I&#8217;ll share what little I even comprehend after seeing this.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> A family starts getting videotapes that show someone filming their flat. The tapes come along with a picture drawn like a child of blood coming out of someone&#8217;s mouth. As the film goes on the paranoia of the father increases as the tapes lead him to parts of his childhood he had tried to forget.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong> It keeps your attention, even at the very slow/quiet shots of just video of their flat. As the film went on I was more and more curious about where this was going. Who was sending them these tapes? What wasn&#8217;t the father telling us? What the fuck is really going on here? I was annoyed and frustrated at times but I desperately wanted to know what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong> I should have known that with the director Michael Haneke, who also did Funny Games, that he was going to mind fuck me and mind fuck me good. Not everything in it is obvious and you have to pay really close attention, many have watched this several times afterward to try to figure this out. It&#8217;s frustrating how slow and drawn out some scenes are and how little any of it makes sense. I will admit I came to realize I missed a huge part of the end scene but now that I realize what the end scene was I&#8217;m still just as confused.</p>
<p>If you like mind fuck movies, watch any of Michael Haneke&#8217;s films but particularly this one. At least with Funny Games I was left with some answers as to what I just watched. It sounds like I hated this film but I didn&#8217;t, I really liked it, I just get frustrated when I&#8217;m left guessing, which is what I believe was the intention.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; width: 500px; margin-right: auto; height: 375px; text-align: center;" src="http://www.lifeisnotamovie.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/51u3IUwWPbL._SX500_.jpg" alt="51u3IUwWPbL._SX500_.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>I think when I&#8217;m really stressed and desperately want relief from adulthood I tend to look for teenage tv shows to watch. For me, I think that is how I escape sometimes because I can pretend like my biggest problems are breaking out and the cute guy I like not liking me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my explanation from why I&#8217;ve been watching Degrassing Junior High lately and it&#8217;s the only way this makes sense. Feeling the need to watch a cheesy, badly made show from the eighties with valuable lessons to be learned every episode such as teen pregnancy, the &#8220;kissing disease&#8221; and that dressing slutty doesn&#8217;t necessarily get you the guy you want. This is a show that instead of calling someone a &#8220;dumbass&#8221; they call them a &#8220;broomhead.&#8221; Canadians, I love em but they&#8217;re a bit weird.</p>
<p>What can I say? It&#8217;s better than thinking about my husband&#8217;s lyme disease or our mortgage company who are a bunch of asshats or my job that is driving me to my early demise. Something about it brings me back to my youth and in my head it feels peaceful even though I know if I did go back to being 13 years old there would be nothing peaceful about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not proud of it but I suppose this what extreme stress does to a person. It makes you a bit of a broomhead.</p>

<p>Is it weird that I&#8217;ve never wanted to look like this? I&#8217;ve never wanted to be buff or ripped. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be toned but I&#8217;m not interested in being head to toe muscle. To me, it&#8217;s just not sexy but that&#8217;s a personal thing. I want to have curves and to be a little soft (not pudgy). I want to have breasts and a butt. Would I love a relatively flat stomach? Yes but I don&#8217;t want a six pack and never have&#8230;I also don&#8217;t want that in a guy. I think overly muscular is kind of creepy and weird looking. I think it&#8217;s great they are so motivated and so healthy but to me, it doesn&#8217;t look normal.</p>

<p>So back when tumblr was still very new I decided one day there needed to be a tumblr just for Kevin Spacey. So at that point I started <a href="http://fuckyeahspacey.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Fuck Yeah Kevin Spacey</a>, I didn&#8217;t think much of it except I could post all about Kevin there without annoying my non-Kevin-obsessed friends. I honestly didn&#8217;t think it would make much of an impression because let&#8217;s face it, most of Tumblr is teenagers who tend to care about Justin Timberlake and Hannah Montana.</p>

<p>To my surprise it took off pretty quickly, people starting to follow it right off the bat. Of all my Tumblrs, and I have a few I must admit because they addictive like tattoos, this one has gotten the most attention. There are a lot more die-hard Spacey fans than I ever imagined. For as long as I can remember my friends have made fun of me for my love of Kevin and the fact that I call him Kevin. I&#8217;ve been asked many times why I love him and there are so many reasons it&#8217;s kind of pointless to even get into it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not entirely surprising that <a href="http://latefines.tumblr.com/">Gwen</a> helps me manage it because we initially bonded several years ago over our love for Kevin. Someday we plan to move to London and follow him around (stalking sounds so evil) as a hobby. Hell, she even came out to visit me, 2,000 miles away, so we could watch him in a movie he didn&#8217;t even have a lead role in.</p>
<p>So basically I just wanted to say &#8220;I rule!&#8221;</p>
