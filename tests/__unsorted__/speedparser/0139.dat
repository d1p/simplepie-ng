&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto stock market surged more than 200 points Monday in its first trading after a wild week that saw global markets plummet on dismal predictions for the U.S. economy and a growing mess in debt-laden European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P/TSX composite index closed up 244.32 points to 11,707.19 following a 7.5 per cent drop last week, as financials recovered on hopes that European finance ministers would take action soon to deal decisively with the government debt crisis that has put banks on the continent under immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Does This Mean For You?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney says that our banks have only modest exposure to the Eurozone and is well protected by it&amp;#8217;s capital and liquidity. Our bigger concern is certainly the US and the lack of trade that may occur if things continue to deteriorate there, leading to possible job loss here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortgage News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Stats Canada posted the Consumer Price Index ( &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;) data for August 2011. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; rose 3.1%, up from 2.7% in July and core inflation rose 1.9%, which was higher than the 1.6% we saw in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Does This Mean For You?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is clearly on the rise and we are drawing ever closer to the Bank of Canada&amp;#8217;s magic 2% core inflation target that had been touted to be the catalyst for an increase to the key lending rate at long last, however Mark Carney&amp;#8217;s comments last week alluded to a different, immediate outcome;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The (U.S.) housing market remains a mess, the consumer is weak, and government actions can be expected to reduce growth…The U.S. economy is close to stall speed…&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Carney would like to give the impression that we operate our monetary policies based on what is happening within our borders rather than without, it&amp;#8217;s obvious that an aggressive push to the key lending rate, regardless of our own economic health, would stall the overall global recovery. In short, even though inflation in Canada seems to be ticking along nicely, mortgage rates are not likely to move upward anytime soon in reaction, mainly due to a lack of growth in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

Nice to see you all in your places with bright shiny faces! Last week we took a look at the fascinating and slightly macabre origins of the word “mortgage”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll take a look at the term &lt;strong&gt;“downpayment”&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; what it means and why you need one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of home-buying, the downpayment is essentially your contribution to the purchasing of the property. The rest of the funds come in the form of the mortgage loan from a lender, whether it be the bank or your rich uncle &amp;#8211; unless of course you are in the very enviable position of being able to purchase a home with out a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/mortgage-glossary/down-payment/" title="Down Payment"&gt;down payment&lt;/a&gt; not only gives you a bit of ownership of the property from the get-go, it also gives the lender a measure of comfort that you too, are invested in the property and have something to lose by not making good on your mortgage paying commitments. That’s because if you don’t make your agreed mortgage payments, the lender may have to foreclose on the property and take it from you in lieu of the money that is owed. In that case, along with your property, you would lose your cash investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, it is still possible to obtain “‘zero down” mortgages of sorts but an applicant must be stellar in all aspects of their application to be seen as a worthwhile risk for this very risky mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating A Downpayment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, if you qualify, the minimum downpayment to purchase a home is 5% of the purchase price. You could, however, be required to put down more should the lender see you or the property you are buying as a risk in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in mathematical terms, if you were purchasing a home that is costing you $250,000, the equation would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$250,000 (Purchase Price) x .05 (.05 is the equivalents of 5%) =  $12,500 (Downpayment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Do  I Have To Provide My Downpayment Funds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you did go ahead and purchase this particular home for $250,000. To make the offer to your seller, you will have to put a certain amount of money on deposit with your Realtor to show that you are a serious buyer, Let’s say the initial deposit is $5000. That deposit amount is taken out of the total amount of downpayment that you must provide so in this case, you still need to come up with $7500 ( $12,500 &amp;#8211; $7,500).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are building a brand new home, you will most likely have to provide &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of the $12,500 upon acceptance of your offer and approval of your mortgage. In fact a builder may even require you to put down as much as 10% of the purchase price so be sure to check with each lender before you fall in love with a showhome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are purchasing a pre-owned home, you will need to prove that you have the downpayment funds in your bank account  ( via 90 days of bank statements) during the mortgage approval process but you won’t need to actually provide them to your lawyer until approximately a week before possession of your property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining a Downpayment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders have a few rules when it comes to downpayements to guard against fraud and to protect borrowers from not being able to pay their mortgage due to a debt related to obtaining a downpayement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this previous &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/blog/Can-My-Uncles-Best-Friends-Second-Cousins-Boss/" title="My Downpayment"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for more information about where a downpayment is allowed to originate from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my credit card bill came in the mail and below the balance due was a little blurb that advised me that if I continued to pay only the minimum payment, I’d pay off my card in exactly 26 years and 11 months. Alternatively, it pointed out, if I paid an extra $80 a month, I would reduce that time down to 3 years and 3 months and save my self, wait for it&amp;#8230;$10,100 in interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you but I’m no Richie Rich. However, I can spend $80 fairly easily on a nice dinner with friends or a therapeutic shopping trip to Winners or even a few, accumulated “non-essentials” trips to Safeway over the month. In fact, I decided that I didn’t even have to give up any of those things if I just took more time to plan my grocery list and stuck to a budget that shaved off just $20 a week in groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been three months since I called my credit card company and had them increase my monthly payment and I can honestly say, I don’t miss the $80 at all but I will certainly feel the effects of having paid that credit card off by 2014 instead of 2038. It also means that I will pay off a relatively modest credit card balance while I’m in my early forties instead of my late 60’s, when I’m a grandmother. Yeah. Pretty compelling and totally worth the Oreos, chips &amp;amp; dip and fancy pesto I leave on the grocery shelf to make my extra $80 a month payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your credit card company may not be so gracious as to point these things out to you so here’s a cool financial tool I’ve come across to help you calculate just how much you can save by changing your monthly payments and how long it will take you to become debt free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out &lt;a href="http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/debtplanner/debtplanner.jsp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; I guarantee you’ll find this calculator from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; Money very educational and you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised how little it takes to put a huge dent in your debts. Don&amp;#8217;t forget to give First Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/mortgage-calculators/mortgage-prepayment/" title="Mortgage Calculators"&gt;mortgage pre-payment calculator&lt;/a&gt; a whirl to watch the same magic happen in regards to your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Stock Exchange&amp;#8217;s S&amp;amp;P/TSX composite index ended Monday&amp;#8217;s session down 91.67 points, or 0.75 percent, at 12,172.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eyes are on Greece at the opening of this week as fears that the country is heading into a chaotic default situation  — and the idea that it should potentially leave the euro and return to its own currency — have roiled the markets, both across the 17-nation eurozone and globally. The market seems to be preparing for Greece to default on its debts as soon as October but most investors are hoping for for the best &amp;#8211; that the default may unfold in a structured manner rather than in an uncontrolled, chaotic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a good overview of the impact a default by Greece would have on Canada, have a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/ask-an-adviser/why-canadian-investors-should-care-about-greece/article2073026/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; to be sure, we should prepare for a lot of volatility in the market and loss of momentum in our economic recovery here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortgage News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&amp;#8217;s major lenders moved together again last week to cut the the discount offered on five-year variable-rate mortgages (VRMs), and market variable rates are now in the prime minus .40% range, which is 2.60% using today’s prime rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four year rate at 2.99% continues to be the sweet spot as far as fixed mortgage rates go, with the five year at 3.29% right on it&amp;#8217;s heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What for this mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions about whether to choose fixed or &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/mortgage-glossary/variable-rate-mortgage/" title="Variable Rate Mortgage"&gt;variable rates&lt;/a&gt; are all over the map right now and it&amp;#8217;s certainly a conundrum. I did come across an interesting opinion however that is worth consideration and that is that although the variable rate discounts have been reduced, making them appear less attractive compared to the rock bottom, available fixed rates &amp;#8211; the variable may still be a good choice  (given that a variable is the right mortgage strategy for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our economic future is clouding again with so much uncertainty about the eurozone and the U.S. and chances are, prime will stay at 3.00% or perhaps even lower indefinitely. Although 3.29% is a fantastically low rate to ride out the next five years with, that fact is 2.55% is lower and that rate may hold for longer than anyone has foretasted up to this point. This means mortgage borrowers could be overpaying by as much as .75% for the security a &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/mortgage-glossary/fixed-rate-mortgage/" title="Fixed Rate Mortgage"&gt;fixed rate&lt;/a&gt; will bring you when there may be no real risk at all, thanks to Greece and the European Union and our beleaguered neighbors south of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, rate isn&amp;#8217;t the only thing you need to be aware of, which is why the advice of a professional &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/meet-team/" title="Mortgage Team"&gt;Licensed Mortgage Associate&lt;/a&gt; is so critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an independent mortgage brokerage, one of the advantages we have here at First Foundation is being able to access lenders that most Canadians don&amp;#8217;t have access to, and on top of that, we&amp;#8217;re able to pick and choose from the best offers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, right now we have the following rate specials* from a variety of lender partners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 year fixed at 2.49%&lt;br /&gt;
3 year fixed at 2.89% &lt;br /&gt;
4 year fixed at 2.99%&lt;br /&gt;
5 year fixed at 3.29%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*These rates are subject to change at any time, without notice.  Subject to qualification and lender policies, E&amp;amp;OE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any rate special, there are terms and conditions that apply.  Not everyone will qualify for these rates based on the lender policies, and they won&amp;#8217;t necessarily be the right product for everyone.  That said, if we can find a way to save you money, we will.  It&amp;#8217;s one of the things we take most seriously here.  We truly are on your side and we want you to save money every time you get a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we have variable and adjustable rate specials as well, so if you&amp;#8217;re interested in something like that just &lt;a href="http://www.firstfoundation.ca/contact/" title="Call Mortgage Broker"&gt;give your friendly mortgage associate a call.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
