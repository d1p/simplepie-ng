      <title>More seed planting, a bit of a harvest</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/101327?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/101327</guid>
      <description>I planted a mess of seeds today.  I was inspired by Cristyn to try a less structured approach to planting.
First, I noticed a few &amp;#8220;volunteer&amp;#8221; carrots (not really volunteer, they&amp;#8217;ve likely sprouted from seeds I scattered last fall), so I sprinkled three kinds of carrots around the North bed.
Next, I sprinkled cress seeds willy-nilly around the North bed and in the tray that the pea shoots are in.  Cress will sprout fast.  While I was at it, I tossed a few of those into the South bed too.
Next, I planted seeds for a bunch more brassica greens.  I put out markers for most of ...</description>

      <description>I just realized that I forgot to enter the greens I hurriedly planted 2 weeks ago, just before I left for vacation.  I&amp;#8217;ve entered them all now, and some are sprouting.
A few days ago, I even harvested some orach microgreens and corn salad for a sammich.  Yay spring!</description>

      <description>I have two African Violets that are blooming like crazy today.  All my AVs have suddenly perked up a bit &amp;#8212; maybe they know it&amp;#8217;s spring?
I&amp;#8217;ve always love the doubled flowers on the pink one.  The blue and white one seems to be getting more blue on the flowers as it ages.
I don&amp;#8217;t know the variety of either of these.</description>

      <title>Microgreens, compost, mulch</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/98696?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/98696</guid>
      <description>A busy couple of hours out in the garden today.
First, I emptied my covert compost bin into my Southwest extension bed.  It was good stuff.  I dug a hole in the Northeast bed and set up the bin there &amp;#8212; it will get lots of sun.  I&amp;#8217;ll keep it there for the season and then empty it again in the fall.  I picked the uncomposted bits out of the Southwest bed and put them in the bin.  My theory on cold composting is that the bin improves the bed it&amp;#8217;s sitting on, and I put the compost in a second bed.  Since I have four beds total and I empty/move the bin twice a year, that means ...</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/98575</guid>
      <description>My chives have broken dormancy (both regular and garlic &amp;#8212; looks like the regular have been up for a few weeks and I just never noticed.
Mache is doing well, miner&amp;#8217;s lettuce has emerged, and I saw some volunteer orach sprouts.  No volunteer mustards yet, but it might be time to plant those seeds.
The ground is still very wet, but when I pushed aside the leaves I saw a million billion worms.
The ground needs a bit more time before I do any serious digging, but spring is here!*</description>

      <title>Solution? Microgreens</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/97836?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/97836</guid>
      <description>I have too many seeds.  WAY too many seeds.  They are a problem to store, and more importantly, a problem to use.  I get overwhelmed when I try to find something.
So I&amp;#8217;ve decided this spring that I&amp;#8217;m going to grow microgreens, which I&amp;#8217;ve never done before.  It will give me a way to use these seeds without feeling like I&amp;#8217;ve wasted them.  I&amp;#8217;ll plant these in seedling trays in the backyard, while I&amp;#8217;m waiting for the ground to dry out.
Also?  I&amp;#8217;ve updated my swap list if anyone wants to check it out.  :)

      <title>Dead squash</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/91211?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/91211</guid>
      <description>I think I can&amp;#8217;t grow squash.  This is the third year I have tried, in two different gardens, and they have all ended in failure.
Between the squash bugs, the SVBs and the powdery mildew, they just don&amp;#8217;t have a chance, even with supreme efforts from me.  I removed the last of my squash plants.  I didn&amp;#8217;t even compost them, because they were covered with flies and little maggoty-looking things.
The upside of this is that I now have access to my compost bin again, since I was growing the squash in it.  The stuff in the bin has broken down nicely and is FULL of worms.  Some of ...</description>

      <title>Worm bin harvest and split</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/91210?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/91210</guid>
      <description>I harvested 3 trays from my worm bin.  I had 5 trays on the bin at the time &amp;#8212; which is the most I&amp;#8217;ve ever had at one time.
I think the extra trays really are helpful.  The lowest tray was very finished and had few worms in it.  I found a ton of worm eggs in that level.  The next 2 trays were not as finished, but still good.  They were wetter and had more worms in them &amp;#8212; although they had fewer eggs.  I&amp;#8217;ve read that the worms own waste products deter the eggs from hatching &amp;#8212; a kind of population control.  When there are so many worms that the waste builds up to ...</description>

      <title>White AV update</title>
      <link>http://myfolia.com/journals/90495?from=rss</link>
      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/90495</guid>
      <description>My white AV is doing the best of all of them.  It&amp;#8217;s potted in a homemade self-wicking pot.  This is definitely the way to go for potting AVs.  I&amp;#8217;m going to transition all the rest to similar pots in a year or two or whenever they need repotting.
It&amp;#8217;s a nicely formed plant.  The only trouble I have with it is that the outer leaves sometimes turn yellow.  Perhaps it needs to be fertilized.  I&amp;#8217;ve been pruning them off when I remove the dead flowers.  I&amp;#8217;ll have to think about feeding it soon.  I like the flowers much more than I expected to &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t li...</description>

      <title>Pink AV photo update</title>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/90494</guid>
      <description>My two pink AVs are doing ok.  Neither one is blooming right now.
The one I call &amp;#8220;rose pink with backside surprise&amp;#8221; is in the first photo.  It tends to put out a lot of flowers all at once.  They last a while, then die all at once.  I would complain except that the foliage is so beautiful.  I took this photo right after pruning out all the dead flowers.
The one I call &amp;#8220;pink girl&amp;#8221; has baby pink flowers and ruffled leaves.  It&amp;#8217;s pretty - it&amp;#8217;s pictured in the second and third photos.   However, the plant&amp;#8217;s form is all wrong-the leaves are too tight and...</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/90493</guid>
      <description>I finally had a chance to take more photos of my African Violets today.
My purple/blue AV is doing particularly well.  The flowers on this one last a very long time, and the foliage is very even and keeps it&amp;#8217;s color well.  Sometimes the center gets a bit tight, but when it does, I just stick it under my desk for a few days so that it gets very little light.  That seems to be enough to loosen it up.</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/90405</guid>
      <description>I need to update my African Violet photos.  I started taking pictures of them today at work when my boss walked in my office.  He&amp;#8217;s an AV lover, so that was ok, but it meant I only got this one photo taken.
This AV struggled for a while, losing over half it&amp;#8217;s leaves.  I thought for sure it was a goner, but it has come back nicely.</description>

      <description>Once again, my county has issued mandatory water restrictions that restrict outdoor watering.  And once again, this is not due to a supply problem, but due to a failure in our infrastructure.  This is the third time in 6 weeks this has happened &amp;#8212; the first two times were water main breaks, and this one is due to a power failure. I can probably find enough gray water for my containers, but the other plants will have to suffer.</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/89556</guid>
      <description>My theory that late planting would thwart squash vine borers has been proven wrong.  My plant is under attack.  I&amp;#8217;m off to scrounge through cristyn&amp;#8217;s journals to see if I can find her instructions for how to cut them out.
Since these are grown in a container, and partly trellised, I am not optimistic about my chances of success.</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/89186</guid>
      <description>My purple ruffles basil is green.  I planted 8 or so seeds of this basil, and they&amp;#8217;ve all come up green, except for one plant.  They also aren&amp;#8217;t very ruffled &amp;#8212; again, except for one plant.
This is totally fine with me, because I planted 3 kinds of purple basil and only 2 kinds of green basil.  I was worried about having too much purple basil and trying to convince my husband that purple pesto was edible, but now I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have that problem.
I got these seeds from another Folian, and as I recall she harvested them from one of her plants.  I wonder if they crossed wi...</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/89138</guid>
      <description>My purple/fuchsia African violet died.  Three weeks ago, I was out of town and asked a coworker to water my violets for me.  Two weeks ago, when I got back, I noticed the purple/fuchsia one looked sad, but I figured it just missed me and didn&amp;#8217;t pay two much attention.
Last week it had not improved, and this week I took a close look during one of my not-as-frequent-as-they-should-be pruning sessions.  The crown was rotting from the inside out, making all the leaves soft.  The thing was putting out new buds in spite of this, so I was very sad to dispose of it, but I wanted to remove it ...</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/89047</guid>
      <description>My delicata squash was planted 2.5 weeks later than the lemon squash I grew in 2008 (I didn&amp;#8217;t grow squash in 2009).  Although it was planted late due to laziness, I wonder if it&amp;#8217;s also saved the plants from squash vine borers.
The delicata is a vining winter squash, and the lemon was a bush summer squash, so they aren&amp;#8217;t comparable.  However, by July 19, 2008 I had a serious SVB problem with the lemon squash, but as of today, I can&amp;#8217;t see a single sign of them on the delicata.
I&amp;#8217;ve read that planting squash later helps with the SVB problem &amp;#8212; something about...</description>

      <guid>http://myfolia.com/journals/88738</guid>
      <description>So we&amp;#8217;re in the middle of a heat wave, and our county water commission instituted mandatory water restrictions which meant I could not water outside for 4 days.  Something about a weakness in a water main, not even a real break.  Temperatures have reached 100F (~38C) and higher, with humidity of 75% and higher.  Ugh.  Hot, hot, hot and nary a drop to drink for my garden.
I used gray water as much as possible to water the really thirsty plants &amp;#8212; my tomato, my squash, peppers, and the chard.  I abandoned the dying plants (red-veined sorrel and artichoke) to their fates, and I gave...</description>

I guess I&amp;#8217;ll break out the buckets and start saving gray water.</description>
