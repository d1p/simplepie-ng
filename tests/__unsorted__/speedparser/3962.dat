			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Post written by <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a>.</h6>
<p>You&#8217;d be surprised to know how many emails I get where people are stuck in their lives.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re broke, or unmotivated, or in a job they hate, or they can&#8217;t find their passion, or they can&#8217;t get motivated to get healthy.</p>
<p>And they don&#8217;t know where to start.</p>
<p>It hurts to read these emails. It brings back to life the pain I lived through not too many years ago, when I too was stuck.</p>
<p>I know the feeling of despair when you are unhappy with your life and don&#8217;t know how to change. When you&#8217;ve tried lots of changes, but couldn&#8217;t find the discipline to make them stick. When you feel crappy about yourself because you know you should get off your butt and start improving your life, but you&#8217;d rather put it off for another day.<br />
<span id="more-8744"></span><br />
Problems go away when you ignore them, right?</p>
<p>I also know that there is really only one way out of this mire of despair.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to take an action, no matter how tiny.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to fix everything in your life right now. You don&#8217;t even need to fix one thing.</p>
<p>You just need to do one little, miniscule, almost nothing thing.</p>
<p>Make a list. Go outside and take a walk. Get rid of some of your junk food. Clear off your kitchen table. Cancel something tomorrow so you can make time to create something, no matter how small.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do all of these. Do one. Or half of one, or one thousandth. It doesn&#8217;t matter how small &#8212; the smaller, the better.</p>
<p>Take that first step. Celebrate that first step. Love the step, not the destination. That step, even the motion of taking the first foot off the ground and moving it forward &#8212; that&#8217;s everything.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the truth, and you&#8217;ll not read it in many self-help books: put every microparticle of your existence into that half step, and be nothing but that half step, and love it with all you have &#8230; and your life has changed.</p>
<p>With this half step, everything is different. You haven&#8217;t achieved any goals &#8230; but you&#8217;ve moved. You haven&#8217;t created something amazing &#8230; and yet, more than ever before, you have.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve created beauty and joy and movement where none existed before, where previously only constriction and paralysis and confusion lived. You have changed the world.</p>
<h3>The First Habit</h3>
<p>Choose one little habit to add joy to your life. Just one, and tiny is miraculous.</p>
<p>It can be writing or painting or making music for 2 minutes a day. It can be a ridiculously easy walk or jog or enjoying a bowl of fruit. It can be 2 minutes of meditation or reflecting in a journal.</p>
<p>Enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Create this one habit, and you have a success. This is a foundation, a first step, to build on.</p>
<p>Then you can do a second, and a third, but you can&#8217;t do those without a first.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t change your entire life. Just change this one little thing.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be amazed how much that matters. I was.</p>
<h3>Learn to Create Habits</h3>
<p>There are lots of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/archives/">free resources</a> on Zen Habits for creating habits &#8212; the best of my findings over the years. I encourage you to use these.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also offering <a href="http://habitcourse.com">The Habit Course</a>, which starts Monday Oct. 3. You can sign up through Sunday. I will show you my carefully honed method for creating habits, and the mechanism for habit creation that most people don&#8217;t understand. It&#8217;s a mechanism that changes lives, and I hope to change yours.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Jonathan Fields, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncertainty/dp/159184424X">Uncertainty: Turning Fear and Doubt Into Fuel for Brilliance</a>.</h6>
<p>Uncertainty. It&#8217;s a terrifying word.</p>
<p>Living with it, dangling over your head like the sword of Damocles, day in day out, is enough to send anyone spiraling into a state of anxiety, fear and paralysis.</p>
<p>Like it or not, though, uncertainty is the new normal. We live in a time where the world is in a state of constant, long-term flux. And, that&#8217;s not all. If you want to spend your time on the planet not just getting-by, but consistently creating art, experiences, businesses and lives that truly matter, you&#8217;ll need to proactively seek out, invite and even deliberately amplify uncertainty. Because the other side of uncertainty is opportunity.</p>
<p>Nothing great was ever created by waiting around for someone to tell you it&#8217;s all going to be okay or for perfect information to drop from the sky. Doesn&#8217;t happen that way. Great work requires you to act in the face of uncertainty, to live in the question long enough for your true potential to emerge. There is no alternative.<br />
<span id="more-8696"></span><br />
When you find the strength to act in the face of uncertainty, you till the soil of genius.</p>
<p>Problem is, that kills most people. It leads to unease, anxiety, fear and doubt on a level that snuffs out most genuinely meaningful and potentially revolutionary endeavors before they even see the light of day. Not because they wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded, but because you never equipped yourself to handle and even harness the emotional energy of the journey.</p>
<p>But, what if it didn&#8217;t have to be that way?</p>
<p>What if there was a way to turn the fear, anxiety and self-doubt that rides along with acting in the face of uncertainty&#8211;the head-to-toe butterflies&#8211;into fuel for brilliance?</p>
<p>Turns out, there is. Your ability to lean into the unknown isn&#8217;t so much about luck or genetics, rather it&#8217;s something entirely trainable. I&#8217;ve spent the past few years interviewing world-class creators across a wide range of fields and pouring over research that spans neuroscience, decision-theory, psychology, creativity and business.</p>
<p>Through this work, a collection of patterns, practices and strategies have emerged that not only turbocharge insight, creativity, innovation and problem-solving, but also help ameliorate so much of the suffering so often associated with the pursuit of any creative quest.</p>
<p>Here are 5 starter-strategies to help get you going:</p>
<p><strong>1. Reframe.</strong></p>
<p>We tell ourselves stories all day long. I’m skinny. I’m fat. I’m talented. I’m stupid. This is genius. This is awful. I will succeed. I will fail. I’m terrified and anxious. I’m confident and proactive. It turns out, the storylines we create around a particular circumstance are far more determinative of success than the circumstance itself. They affect not only our willingness to act, but the quality of our ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>If you create a story that empowers action and innovation, that&#8217;s great news. Unfortunately, our brains have a strong bias toward negativity, leading most of us to create stories around circumstances that require action in the face of uncertainty that are more likely to paralyze and stunt creativity than fuel action.</p>
<p>Reframing is a process that asks you to suspend negative storylines, explore if the story you’re telling is the only one and, if not (which is inevitably the case), construct or frame a new storyline that empowers you to experience an uncertain circumstance not as a prime for failure and inaction, but as a signpost for meaning and opportunity.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#8217;re disabling storyline is around the risk of failure, instead of just asking &#8220;what if I fail?&#8221; and creating a doomsday scenario, you also ask &#8220;how will I recover, what if I do nothing and what if I succeed?&#8221; Then build new stories around those questions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Practice Mindfulness.</strong></p>
<p>Reframing is an immensely powerful tool in the quest to lean into the unknown. But it also requires a certain equanimity; the ability to pull back and see what’s really going on, re-center, then breath into that uncomfortable place long enough for amazing things to bubble up. Over time, a daily mindfulness practice goes a long way toward equipping you to do just that.</p>
<p>Plus, it cultivates the sense of persistent grounding that makes living and acting in a world where there is no new normal far more enjoyable. And it trains you in the practice of dropping thoughts, among those, destructive, limiting-beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>3. Exercise Your Brain.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all seen the research on exercise and health, weight loss and disease prevention. But, did you know that certain approaches to exercise also have a profound effect on your brain?</p>
<p>Daily cardiovascular exercise, for example, especially with high-intensity bursts mixed in can improve mood, executive function, decision-making and creativity and decrease anxiety and fear. The latest research even reveals the possibility that exercise can grow new brains cells, something that until only a few years ago, was thought to be impossible. It&#8217;s also strongly correlated with decreases in anxiety and increases in mood, which are directly connected to improved creativity and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>4. Singletask.</strong></p>
<p>Multitasking is out. Turns out this badge of honor from the &#8217;90s is more fiction than fact. Our brains don&#8217;t multitask, they just rapidly switch between tasks, sometimes fast enough for us to believe we&#8217;re doing many things at once. Problem is, every time we switch, there is a &#8220;ramping cost&#8221; in your brain, it takes anywhere from a few second to 15 minutes for your brain to fully re-engage. This makes you feel insanely busy, but simultaneously craters productivity, creativity and increases feelings of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Multitasking also requires you to hold a lot of information in your working memory, which is controlled by a part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). But the PFC is also responsible for will-power, and for keeping fear and anxiety in check. Multitasking increases the &#8220;cognitive load&#8221; on the PFC, overwhelming it and effectively killing it&#8217;s ability to keep fear, anxiety and the taunt of distraction at bay.</p>
<p>Simple solution&#8211;just say no. Do one thing at a time in intense, short bursts.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get Lean.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of creating in a vacuum, explore the possibility of bringing a “lean” or “agile” approach to your creative process. Focus on maximum learning, create the simplest version of your idea possible, then bring a select group of those who’d potentially enjoy it into the process earlier in name of soliciting and integrating input into the next iteration. This not only minimizes waste, it changes the psychology of creation by adding more certainty earlier in the game and encouraging consistent, incremental action.</p>
<p>These five strategies and practices can change the way you experience the creative process in a profound way. They&#8217;ll not only allow you to tap a reservoir of previously hidden creativity, they&#8217;ll also allow you to experience any creative endeavor with a far deeper sense of equanimity and joy.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting slow paces each day in accordance with a natural internal balance: a meaningful peace within that resonates with our human core, and denies the obsessive addiction to the race.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Dave Ursillo of <a href="http://daveursillo.com">DaveUrsillo.com</a>.</h6>
<p>If there is any <em>one </em>indication that <a title="http://zenhabits.net/feel/" href="http://zenhabits.net/feel/">life is best lived slowly</a>, it&#8217;s that among all of the busyness, racing to fulfill tasks and rushing to complete goals, there is one race that nobody wants to finish first: the race of life itself.</p>
<p>Our culture has a mild obsession with racing &#8212; not racing for the sake of sport or simple competition, but racing through many aspects of our lives, so as to fulfill a sense of productivity.</p>
<p>When conquer sprawling to-do lists we hopes that we will feel <em>accomplished.</em></p>
<p>But &#8220;productivity&#8221; is a false-comfort.<br />
<span id="more-8679"></span><br />
When I remember back to my college days, I recall seeing fellow classmates who were so obsessive about fulfilling the idea that they needed to be constantly working, racing, striving and even <em>suffering</em> that they would spend as much time as humanly possibly within the confines of the campus library.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that they didn&#8217;t have work to do or need to accomplish assignments (they did).</p>
<p>But what I realized was that it was almost an obsessive-compulsion to simply <em>reside</em> &#8212; as if subconsciously reinforcing a feeling that they were being &#8220;productive,&#8221; and obliging a widely-shared notion by our culture that said, &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t constantly working, you are falling behind.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Do you do the same?</strong></p>
<p>Outside of a collegiate environment, as adults we still largely obsess to fulfill the idea that living in a constant state of unrelenting work is good.</p>
<p>The obsession is a quiet, subconscious, subtle cultural meme that we all inherently understand as members of our society.</p>
<p>And so we spend a significant portion of our lives tirelessly racing to an imaginary finish under the guise of &#8220;productivity&#8221; &#8212; only to realize that the finish line never comes.</p>
<p>Before long, we forget that life itself is about experiencing the journey &#8212; not racing to the finish.</p>
<p>And considering that take so many measures to prolong the length of our lives and increase the quality of them, wouldn&#8217;t it logically follow that we ought to slow down each and every day, and escape this senseless &#8220;race&#8221; mentality?</p>
<p><strong>Start Slow</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m as much a victim of the &#8220;race&#8221; mentality as anyone else. But what I have discovered is that the pace and quality of my days are largely dictated by how I <em>start</em> my days each morning.</p>
<p>When I wake up, part of me feels obsessively compelled to &#8220;dive in&#8221; to my work and to-do lists. Having recently written and published <a title="http://www.daveursillo.com/lead-without-followers" href="http://www.daveursillo.com/lead-without-followers" target="_blank">my first book</a>, on recent mornings my &#8220;race&#8221; mentality would even take the forms of physical anxiety, shortness of breath and nervousness.</p>
<p>However, each morning I strive to quell those feelings by starting slow.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will go for a run or immerse myself in nature.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll do an hour of slow yoga.</li>
<li>I will practice mindful breathing while accomplishing a short t&#8217;ai chi or qigong routine.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll read a chapter or two of a good book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting slow is less about what you do, but beginning the day in   accordance with a sense of inner peace, patience, and contentment.</p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t get me wrong: starting slow can feel like an <em>agonizing affair</em> on some mornings.</p>
<p>Our self-imposed demands to constantly work, strive and race feel like an overwhelming addiction &#8212; and all we want to do is quell those subconscious demons in our heads that tell us that slowness, quietness, and simple &#8220;being&#8221; are wrong.</p>
<p>However, every morning that I choose to &#8220;start slow,&#8221; something amazing happens.</p>
<p>I am calm, relaxed, and balanced throughout the day. Each moment feels like a gift, and not merely an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to accomplish goals or fulfill tasks &#8212; as if sand in an hour glass that needs to be consumed by &#8220;racing.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I start slow, I am naturally more productive &#8212; and feel more accomplished by the day&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><strong>How to Start Slow</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can start to begin your days slowly:<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write a list</strong> 5 activities, hobbies, or practices.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Choose activities</strong> that are positive, constructive and/or healthy.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Try one</strong> for every weekday morning of next week.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Wake up earlier or go to bed sooner</strong> to best ensure you have plenty of time and energy to experience the moment.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Focus on patience, pace, and calmness </strong>when you &#8220;start slow&#8221; each morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting slow paces each day in accordance with <em>a natural internal balance</em>: a meaningful peace within that resonates with our human core, and denies the obsessive addiction to the race.</p>
<p>Life itself is not a race. Nobody wins by finishing first. We all strive to live as long as we possibly can.</p>
<p>And when we make the little effort to &#8220;start slow&#8221; each morning, we remember to dedicate ourselves to the journey of life itself &#8212; and not the race to reach its finish.</p>

<p>Most people are unaware of why it&#8217;s so difficult to create lasting changes in their lives.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the secret: it&#8217;s all about the mechanisms of creating new habits.</p>
<p>Most people try to exercise, or become more productive, or start meditating &#8230; only to give up a few days or a couple weeks later. And then they feel bad about it, and wonder why they suck at making changes.</p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t realize is that there are certain forces working against us, mostly because we don&#8217;t understand how habits are created.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned is that you can turn those forces around, and make them work for you.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sept. 26, I held a free webinar on how to re-engineer habit changes.</p>
<p>The webinar has ended, but I&#8217;ve recorded it for those who missed it (<a href="http://zenhabits.net/habit-course/">click through to the website</a> to see the video if you&#8217;re reading this in email):</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note: </strong>This is a guest post from Baker of <a href="http://manvsdebt.com">Man Vs. Debt</a>.</h6>
<p>Every time we automate a process in our lives, we trade a piece of consciousness away for a piece of convenience.</p>
<p>This can be fantastic, as long as we ensure that we automate positive, sustainable habits.</p>
<p>The problem with automation comes when we try to apply it to areas in our lives that <em>need</em> more consciousness.</p>
<p>We run into trouble when we try to solve a problem by automating it.</p>
<p><strong>Automation itself doesn’t fix anything.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, automating a undesirable process only buries the problem even further.<br />
<span id="more-8641"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Problems can&#8217;t be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.&#8221; -Albert Einstein.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>We cannot solve problems by trading away consciousness.</strong></p>
<p>We need to reverse this trend. We need <em>unautomation</em>.</p>
<p>Unautomation is the act of deliberately trading back pieces of convenience for increased consciousness in return.</p>
<p>In our financial lives, there are plenty of examples were we can benefit from unautomation<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a list of every item you own. </strong>While far from convenient, this will drastically increase the awareness of our clutter.</li>
<li><strong>Using a 30-day list for wants. </strong>Waiting 30 days to purchase an item can be a drag, but we&#8217;ll likely realize how little we really desired it in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking our spending with pen and paper. </strong>Carry a small pocketbook and record every purchase by hand rather than just on your plastic.</li>
<li><strong>Converting the cost of items into time we&#8217;ll need to work. </strong>This can be a tough exercise, but will put things in perspective quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Purging 2 items for every 1 you bring into your life. </strong>Yet another inconvenient (at times) rule-of-thumb that can raise awareness around just how much clutter we bring into our lives.</li>
<li><strong>Quit signing contracts. </strong>Until you&#8217;ve ever tried to quit signing them, you don&#8217;t realize how fundamental contracts are in our society.</li>
<li><strong>Spending with cash over plastic. </strong>Going without plastic isn&#8217;t easy, but you can&#8217;t get much more aware than we spending cold, hard cash.</li>
<li><strong>Taking public transportation. </strong>You may have to leave early or plan a little more in advance, but taking public transportation will open your eyes the other side of your daily commute.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples are only a handful of hundreds of money instances where we could benefit from a path of less convenience and more consciousness.</p>
<p>The next time you look to change a set of behaviors in your life, don&#8217;t turn to automation.</p>
<p>Start with unautomation.</p>
<p><strong>Registration is now open for <em><a href="http://youvsdebt.com">You Vs Debt</a></em>, Baker&#8217;s 6-week online class with daily videos, challenges, and accountability forums to empower your battle against debt.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Post written by <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a>.</h6>
<p>Often we think of having very little as a hardship.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bad to be poor, right? It&#8217;s not easy struggling with low wages, with debt, with scarcity.</p>
<p>And while all that is true, it&#8217;s also not true.</p>
<p>There can be joy in getting rid of things, in living with less, in freeing yourself of debt and possessions. It&#8217;s all in your mindset.<br />
<span id="more-8603"></span><br />
I grew up poor, and it wasn&#8217;t long ago that I was struggling with an income that was too low to meet my mounting bills and debt payments. One of the worst times of my life, actually.</p>
<p>But as I worked to eliminate my debt, I learned to live with less. And I learned that it can be a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Struggle is hard, no matter how you paint it. But living in scarcity doesn&#8217;t have to be struggle. That&#8217;s completely up to you.</p>
<h3>Reducing Debt</h3>
<p>When my wife and kids and I began reducing our debt, more than five years ago, it was a scary time. We were overloaded with bills, over our heads in debt, and it was one of the most stressful things we&#8217;d ever faced.</p>
<p>So we cut back on spending, which meant learning a whole new way of living. Zap &#8230; we got rid of the cable TV, magazine subscriptions, mocha coffees, regular outings to the movie theaters and restaurants and the mall, and more. We changed our entire lives.</p>
<p>And yet, while we could have thought of this as sacrifice, in truth, we learned to enjoy it. We were living with less, but we were happier.</p>
<p>We were happier because we saw this as an opportunity to reconnect with each other, doing things that were cheap or free. We took the kids outside more, and played with them. Playing kickball and soccer and tag &#8230; these things cost nothing. We dusted off board games and decks of cards, played charades, and had a blast. We visited family and friends more.</p>
<p>We cooked at home and had better meals than ever, got healthier, enjoyed eating together.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t all roses and cream, but there were many, many positive things that came out of this scarcity. When you are forced to cut back, you can moan, or you can find joy. We chose the path that made us happiest.</p>
<p>And once we were out of debt, that was one of the most liberating things ever. So we reached an amazing destination, but the journey was just as wondrous.</p>
<h3>Reducing Clutter</h3>
<p>Clutter is another scary thing for a lot of people. Just facing the piles of clutter in your home can be overwhelming. In truth, clutter is a mountain of procrastination &#8230; putting off decisions and fears and emotional issues and shopping addictions and more. Facing those fears and issues is too much for most of us.</p>
<p>I faced them, and learned that when you deal with these fears and emotions, even a little at a time, it is freeing. You feel clean and spare, not just because you&#8217;re burdened with fewer possessions, but because you&#8217;re burdened with less emotional baggage that you&#8217;re hiding in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>Reducing our clutter meant tough choices, it meant a lot of discussion about what we wanted and why we really need things, it meant learning a whole host of new habits.</p>
<p>But it also meant getting rid of things that were weighing us down, that we didn&#8217;t need but that were still costing us time and energy and mental cycles. We learned to love a spare-looking room, and the amazing feeling of sitting or lying around in a room that was clean and uncluttered.</p>
<p>Living with fewer possessions can be a pure joy that is unmatched by anything you can buy.</p>
<h3>Less Food</h3>
<p>Losing 70 lbs. has been a journey of exploring my relationship with food. In days of fatness, I ate because everyone else was eating, I ate because I was bored or stressed out and needed the comfort of food, I ate because I didn&#8217;t want to confront my health issues, I ate because it was one of the only ways I knew of finding pleasure.</p>
<p>Now I know that less food can also be a joy. Eating simple foods, rather than fast foods or convenient foods or sweet or fatty or fried foods, can be a joy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned the simple pleasures of drinking a cup of unsweetened tea made from whole tea leaves. I&#8217;ve learned the deliciousness that comes from eating a single fresh fig, half a handful of berries, a few raw almonds. When you stop putting so much sugar and sauces on things, you learn their real beauty. When you stop killing animals and learn to appreciate the natural taste of plants, you feel incredible and alive.</p>
<p>I now skip breakfast so I can remember what it&#8217;s like to feel a little hungry &#8212; something I never did when I was fat. I eat two meals a day because it&#8217;s easier to prepare, and I like a little scarcity in my life. I eat what I want, but I find that I enjoy the simple foods more than ever now.</p>
<h3>Fewer Choices</h3>
<p>We think we want a lot of choices, but really we want freedom. There&#8217;s a difference, and the overwhelming number of choices in our lives these days leads to confusion, paralysis, and unhappiness.</p>
<p>Scarcity choices can be seen as a bad thing, but I see it as liberating. I&#8217;m not saying we should have no choices, but fewer is better.</p>
<p>Try narrowing down your choices, in as many ways as you dare. Watch fewer TV shows by picking just three you watch every week. Pick just one book and read that until you&#8217;re done. Have a to-do list that&#8217;s only three items long each day. Make a weekly menu that only has two or three meals you cook in big batches, and eat those all week. You might worry that you&#8217;re making the wrong choices &#8212; you&#8217;re not. There are no wrong choices, there&#8217;s only the fear of making the wrong choices.</p>
<p>I find limiting my choices to be an opportunity to let go of the worries about making the wrong choices, and to focus on enjoying the choices I do make. As I&#8217;ve explored scarcity, I&#8217;ve been left with this one truth: every path I take is perfect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Michael Bungay Stanier of <a href="http://www.boxofcrayons.biz">Box of Crayons</a>.</h6>
<p>You’ll know Michelangelo’s comment about how he worked, so let me paraphrase:</p>
<p>“I just carve away anything that doesn’t look like a lion, and I’m left with a lion.”</p>
<p>In that statement is the fundamental choice at the heart of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/kill-busywork/" target="_blank">Great Work</a>: focus on the No to become clear on the Yes; define the Yes by clarifying the No.</p>
<p>I think it’s the essence of doing more Great Work; or at least it seems to be the critical lesson I keep needing to learn. (You do know we teach what we most need to learn, don’t you?)<br />
<span id="more-8574"></span><br />
Here are four elusive pairs I’d like to do a better job at saying No and Yes to, and the four experiments I&#8217;m going to start to see if I can move in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>1. Saying No to Control</strong><strong> … so I can say Yes to Freedom</strong></p>
<p>My very first boss was creative, prolific and a touch insane. I remember one of my early Career Limiting Moves when, in front of the whole company, I clicked into mouth-operating-before-brain mode and joked he needed to have a finger in every pie.</p>
<p>I have become that very same person.</p>
<p>Pies? I&#8217;ve got pies everywhere I look, way too many pies. Or perhaps it&#8217;s not enough fingers.</p>
<p>But in any case, we – and by that I mean I – have reached a point where it can’t go on. If I haven’t dropped a ball yet, it’s only a matter of time. And hamster-in-wheel is not a job description worth much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inspired by <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/managing-web-projects/" target="_blank">Chris Brogan</a> whose philosophy, as I understand it, is to start something, hand it over and then get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>Here’s the shift in thinking that might make the difference for me. Realizing I am not Box of Crayons but that I only serve Box of Crayons.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to test that by staring one thing, something I&#8217;d normally hold on to, hand it over, move aside and see if it will be the end of the world (which has been my theory to date).</p>
<p>How about you? Where has staying in control become your own <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172929" target="_blank">mind-forged manacle</a>?</p>
<p><strong>2. Saying No to Popularity … so I can say Yes to Friendship</strong></p>
<p>I’m not super obsessed with numbers, and in fact am pretty lousy at metrics. (I mainly go with “Is this the right mix of Great Work and Good Work?” “Am I having fun?” “Are we in the poor house?” I hope for Yes Yes No as the answers.)</p>
<p>But the rise of new technology means that one way of spending time is hanging out in the social media mirrored rooms waving at many (Woo hoo! 14,000 people on Twitter!) but never really holding hands, looking into the eyes and having a real conversation with a few.</p>
<p>I notice that this week, Gwen Bell is leaving Twitter and moving to Google+, because she feels it&#8217;s a place where she can create intimacy, community and <a href="http://vimeo.com/28643975" target="_blank">digital sanctuary</a>. And <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unmarketing" target="_blank">Scott Stratten</a>, one of the Twitterati, has said his greatest mistake was to follow back blindly.</p>
<p>My shift in thinking is to recognize it as a width vs depth thing, and see if I can find the hunger for the depth. I think it&#8217;s there somewhere.</p>
<p>I’m going to start taking the Call a Friend option once a day to connect to people I love.</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p><strong>3. Saying No to Money … so I can say Yes to Impact</strong></p>
<p>For the last eighteen months I&#8217;ve been walking a fine line, working on the business that I love and that pays my bills, and working on my <a href="http://endmalariaday.org/" target="_blank">Great Work Project</a>, a new book whose sale raises money for an important cause.</p>
<p>It has been a constant struggle to give this Great Work the appropriate time and space to come together, and that&#8217;s primarily because of the seductive comfort of Good Work.</p>
<p>Great Work, because it&#8217;s work that truly matters to me, makes me fret, gives me sweaty palms, and invites all sorts of doubt and self-sabotage.</p>
<p>Good Work on the other hand is the relatively simple task of rolling up my sleeves and getting things done, having some fun and making some money along the way.</p>
<p>And yet, Great Work &#8211; unsafe and uncertain as it so often is &#8211; is where I hang out on the edges of my own competence and ambition, learning what’s possible for me and for the world. Great Work is also where I can most easily invite other extraordinary people in to help me create the meaning and impact I&#8217;m hungry for in my life.</p>
<p>The shift in thinking is to remember (and remember and remember) that Great Work projects take time and need time, and your calendar never lies about what really is most important to you.</p>
<p>And the experiment for now is to look again at &#8220;the bottom 10%&#8221; of what I do, to see if I might say No to that in some way, to say Yes to Great Work.</p>
<p>What is it for you? Where might you trade money (or time) for meaning?</p>
<p><strong>4. Saying No to Plans … so I can say Yes to Now</strong></p>
<p>Truth is, I’m unlikely to ever say No to plans. I love them – which is one reason at least that I hang out with <a href="http://www.productiveflourishing.com/" target="_blank">Charlie Gilkey</a>, who&#8217;s a master at them.</p>
<p>I’ve got plans for the week, the month, the quarter, the year. When in doubt, I pull out a piece of paper and start sketching out a plan (which, it must be said, often looks exactly like the plan I’d done two weeks earlier and then “filed” somewhere safe and forgotten about.)</p>
<p>But it’s time to plan a little less. Leo has been talking about<a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/" target="_blank"> No Goals</a> for a while, and (following in his footsteps as I so often do) I am becoming aware that the price I pay for planning is that I spend more time in the future and less time in the here and now.</p>
<p>For instance, the last few months I&#8217;ve been deep in the planning of today&#8217;s book launch. The price I&#8217;ve paid is that summer has slipped by largely unnoticed. I haven&#8217;t stopped enough to feel the heat of the sun on my shoulders, to hear the ice clink in my drink on the deck, to give myself up to the swing of the hammock.</p>
<p>And as I write this now, the first of intimations of Fall are here and I know I&#8217;ve missed a season that I won&#8217;t have back.</p>
<p>The shift in thinking is to realize that planning comes at a cost. A price I’m willing to pay, but perhaps to pay less these days.</p>
<p>My action is to not fill up the final months of the year, but to try<a href="http://www.feelgooder.com/the-absolute-simple-brilliance-of-walking-and-how-it-changed-my-life/" target="_blank"> to wander a little</a> in the white space that&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Got any non plans?</p>
<h3>Yes is too easy</h3>
<p>But a strong Yes is hard, and say a strong Yes to the things that really matter is harder still.</p>
<p>So rather than starting with the Yes, start with the No.</p>
<p>Get to the heart of the choice you want to make, then design your own experiments to see what might be possible.</p>

<p>For at least a couple of years, Zen Habits was one of the top productivity blogs, dispensing productivity crack for a nominal fee (your reading time).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think I helped people move closer to their dreams, but today I have different advice:</p>
<p>Toss productivity advice out the window.</p>
<p>Most of it is well-meaning, but the advice is wrong for a simple reason: it&#8217;s meant to squeeze the most productivity out of every day, instead of making your days better.<br />
<span id="more-8591"></span></p>
<p>Imagine instead of cranking out a lot of widgets, you made space for what&#8217;s important. Imagine that you worked slower instead of faster, and enjoyed your work. Imagine a world where people matter more than profits.</p>
<p>If any of that appeals to you, let&#8217;s look at some traditional productivity advice, and see why we should just <a href="http://liveboldandbloom.com/09/productivity/10-critical-reasons-why-you-should-not-be-productive">toss them out</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Get Organized</strong>. Sounds good, but getting organized is just rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic. It does nothing to stop the ship from sinking. Instead, simplify. If you have a desk with 5 things in it, you don&#8217;t need to organize. If you have a closet with only a handful of clothes, it doesn&#8217;t need a closet organizer. If your day has only one or two appointments, there&#8217;s no need for a detailed schedule organizer. Simplifying means making important choices about what&#8217;s important, rather than ignoring that question and just trying to cram everything into your day (and space) in a logical way.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep an Idea List</strong>. The idea is that whenever you have an idea, you should write it down. Then you&#8217;ll never lose an idea, and you&#8217;ll always have a list of ideas that you can come back to. Sounds great, right? Except in practice, the idea list is never filled with your best ideas. That&#8217;s because when you have a really great idea, you get so excited about it you jump up and want to work on it immediately. Your best ideas are ones that you can&#8217;t put off until tomorrow. That&#8217;s how you know it&#8217;s a great idea. The ideas that go on the Idea List are not your best.</p>
<p><strong>3. Set a Lot of Goals</strong>. Only five years ago, I had a long list of goals for each year, and I was pretty decent at getting them done (better than 50% at least). Then I experimented with three goals a year, and I was even more focused. Then I did <a href="http://zenhabits.net/really-simple-goal-setting/">One Goal</a>, and that was amazing, because it really helped me focus everything I did. Now I do <a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/">No Goals</a>, and it&#8217;s best of all. I let go of future-focused thinking, and focus on what inspires and excites me now. I get even more accomplished, but let go of all the time I used to spend on goal administration (it&#8217;s more than you might think) and all my mental energy is freed to do what I want to do right now. You might not want to do No Goals, but try One Goal or three goals.</p>
<p><strong>4. Track Everything</strong>. If you want to change it, you have to measure it, right? If you want fast results, you need to track it. Except that&#8217;s complete crap. Why do you need such fast results in the first place? And who says you need to track something to change it? I&#8217;ve found more meaningful, lasting results when I don&#8217;t track, but focus on enjoyment of the activity. For example, if I focus on enjoying running, that makes me want to run more often, and that&#8217;s a habit that lasts much longer. If I focus on tracking the running (mileage, speed, VO2 max, intervals, etc), that takes the enjoyment away from the activity (running) and focuses on the results. If you are so focused on the results, the activity becomes only a means to an end. That makes the activity less enjoyable, and therefore less sustainable over the long run. I&#8217;ve become fitter than ever by not tracking, but instead enjoying being active. I&#8217;ve grown my site more now that I don&#8217;t track stats, but instead enjoy the writing. Over the long run, not tracking is better.</p>
<p><strong>5. Be Productive When You&#8217;re Waiting</strong>. Lots of people do this &#8212; you bring a laptop or mobile device or some papers to do some work while you&#8217;re waiting at a doctor&#8217;s office or at DMV or on the train or in traffic. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this, really, except in the philosophy behind it: that every second should be filled with work, or it&#8217;s wasted. I object to this. Sitting in a waiting room, doing nothing but sitting in silence or watching other people, is a beautiful way to spend your time. Reading a novel on a train, or taking a nap, is also wonderful. Waiting in line at DMV or the post office and eavesdropping on other human beings, or making conversation with someone, or just soaking in the sounds of humanity, is arguably more important than doing more work or reading work-related documents. Life isn&#8217;t only about work, and productivity isn&#8217;t everything. Try some <a href="http://www.bemorewithless.com/2011/basking-in-the-glow-of-un-productivity/">unproductivity</a> instead.</p>
<p><strong>6. Keep Detailed, Context To-Do Lists</strong>. In the early days of Zen Habits, back in 2007, I did exactly this &#8212; I kept a series of contextual to-do lists for home, work, phone calls, errands, someday, and so on. This became too much work for me, and so instead of organizing, I simplified. I now focus on one or two things to do each day, and <strike>if</strike> when I get them done, my day is golden. Everything else I do that day is gravy. And the to-do lists gather dust, which turns out to be a very productive thing for them to do.</p>
<p><strong>7. Work Hard in Bursts, with Frequent Breaks</strong>. Work hard for 10 minutes and take a break for 5! Or maybe 12 and 3? Maybe 30 minutes of hard work and 10 minutes of break? The exact numbers really depend on your flavor of productivity, but at their heart they miss the point: you shouldn&#8217;t be forcing yourself to work hard on something you dread doing, and then take a break to reward or relieve yourself from that dreaded work. You should work on stuff you love, so that you can&#8217;t wait to do it, and taking a break is just a matter of enjoying something else (maybe a nice walk, a nice book, a nice conversation with a friend). Life where you work hard in bursts, with some breaks, is dreadful. Life where you&#8217;re always doing something you love is art.</p>
