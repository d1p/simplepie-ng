			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received these tips when I was a graduate student. </p>
<p>Eight Steps For Success In The Art World</p>
<p>1. Do good work.<br />
2. Have a strong background- (There is competition within genres; am I timely?; who is this person?; who has written about him/her?)<br />
3. Show signs of dedication and major commitment.<br />
4. Hang out at key places (word of mouth business; information of the tribe passed around; critical opinion of a well respected artist; should know the names of every critic and artist; )<br />
5. Behave professionally- (have something to say about your work; have slides and resume updated and handy.)<br />
6. Seek help- (there are people out there willing to help you)<br />
7. Be charming (but don&#8217;t overdo it)<br />
8. Be realistic ( but not cynical or pessimistic)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a bit reclusive the past ten months. Last year was a very active year for me, and I spread myself a bit too thin. I had to take a step back to reset and focus on what really matters to me. I&#8217;ve continued to work in the studio this entire time, but I&#8217;ve also spent a fair amount of time playing music and brushing up on my computer skills. I&#8217;ve also doubled my teaching load, so there&#8217;s also a lot to be said for that. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to post today to prove (to those that are paying attention) that I&#8217;m not a slacker and that I have been working. I offer these snapshots as evidence, and perhaps one of these days I will get around to properly posting them on my portfolio site.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the same grey sketch that I was working on  yesterday. It&#8217;s been pushed along a bit further and I&#8217;m happy with where it stands. I&#8217;ve decided that it is more important for me to keep working through ideas rather than worrying about settling on specific direction. I&#8217;ve entered a period where I am not clamoring to meet deadlines or fulfill prior commitments. It&#8217;s time to take advantage of this freedom and create the things that I want to create. </p>
<div id="attachment_350" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://steveamos.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/greysketch2.jpg"><img src="http://steveamos.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/greysketch2.jpg" alt="greysketch2" title="greysketch2" width="600" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taken a step further...</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 18 months working my ass off. I secured a grant, some commissions and a number of exhibition opportunities. These things were all positive developments and they were motivational. Working towards deadlines is important because it sort of forces you to become more disciplined and organized. The pressure of meeting a deadline can also inject some energy into a project. It&#8217;s like a pressure cooker and you&#8217;d be amazed what you can pull off when the clock is ticking. But as productive as this mode of working is, it also has it drawbacks. </p>
<p> When I work towards a deadline, it means that most things are figured out in advance and a lot of my energy is devoted to execution. Other directions and ideas often arise, but they&#8217;re set aside because they might not fit within the series. There&#8217;s always a point within a project where I stop thinking about what is possible and start focusing on what is probable. The work can become quite stagnant and formulaic.</p>
<p> Not working towards deadlines means that I&#8217;m free to make whatever the hell it that I want to make. It means that I can explore multiple directions without being concerned about the end product. This freedom can translate into a significant amount of growth and exploration. </p>

<p>This sketch came from experimenting with the drawing tablet. I wanted to open up the process and do a bit more painting with the computer. I&#8217;ve always relied upon the computer to manipulate existing images or as a tool to generate crisp technical styled drawings. It was nice to focus upon the gesture and re-introduce evidence of the artist&#8217;s hand to the process. This drawing will likely evolve into a painting.</p>

<p>I continued sketching today. I wanted to pay more attention to my surroundings and explore a direction that reflects more of the moment. The goal is to try and generate or rather amplify something positive. Looking at the world, it&#8217;s hard not to develop a harsh glare. It&#8217;s easy to wrap yourself in negativity and cynicism. Remembering the past, and haunted by the future. My previous work has been about my desire to come to terms with ignorance and fear. I&#8217;m searching with the work.  </p>

<p> A couple weeks ago, I found out that the <a href="http://www.thenorthsidehouse.net/">gallery</a> I was showing with was suddenly tossed out on the street. From what I can tell, there was no legitimate explanation for this eviction.  Perhaps this sort of thing just happens when your business partner winds up being a bigoted, gun-toting, jesus-freak, but that&#8217;s just my opinion. </p>
<p>Pardon me if I do come across a tad bitter, but you would be too if you discovered that eight of your paintings were carelessly placed outside in the blistering heat. However, my friends Chris and Jonathan were determined to make the best of the situation. Unwilling to take any guff from the swine, they organized and staged a &#8216;Renegade&#8217; opening in a pair of U-haul trucks parked in front of the gallery.</p>
<p>The event caught the attention of the local media, and this article was ran as a result. I had initially driven down to Cincinnati in order to recover my work, and I was in attendance when the reporter arrived. It is always good to receive press, especially after something as frustrating as this. </p>
