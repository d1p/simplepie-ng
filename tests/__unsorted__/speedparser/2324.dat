<p>We&#8217;re living in a country&#8212;né, a world&#8212;facing distinct challenges. Confronted with the threat of significant economic decline, America has tough choices to make, namely: Where are we headed? And to get us there, who&#8217;s going to feel the pain?
</p><p>

In the face of such potentially seismic shifts in American society, both democrats and Republicans have failed repeatedly and spectacularly in rising to the occasion. Both are intransigent, refusing to bow to wills of popular opinion.
</p><p>

Sounds kind of like the NBA&#8217;s labor dispute, doesn&#8217;t it? 
</p><p>

And just like those goons in Congress, I couldn&#8217;t be more dissatisfied with all sides of the NBA&#8217;s lockout mess. Like the threats of government shutdown, players and owners alike look prepared to deploy the nuclear option.
</p><p>

But the NBA&#8217;s clash is ever more dubious than that of Congress. The league is not coming to grips with mass unemployment, health care, social security and a lack of fundamental belief in the American Dream&#8212;they&#8217;re fighting about how to split billions. In today&#8217;s economic climate, such squabbles are a slap to the face of all NBA fans.
</p><p>

I understand there are layers of nuance in renewing the league&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement. The decisions made will shape the game for years to come. But in the big picture, owners and players alike appear unsympathetic, not unlike tax-mad Republicans: <i>the rich must not be asked to sacrifice!</i>
</p><p>

It makes me ill. Worse so when I&#8217;m reminded how the recently-announced cancellation of the pre-season will immanently harm workers wholly removed larger dispute. All the folks that staff the Rose Garden are already starting to lose paychecks. Canceling the entire season would mean the loss of hundreds of jobs in Portland alone, not to mention an overall hit of $3 million to the city&#8217;s coffers. Just ridiculous.
</p><p>

Now jump with me, quickly, to New York.
</p><p>

I was there last week and met an old friend for lunch. She works for a financial firm in midtown with a beautiful view of Central Park. It&#8217;s a hedge fund of sorts, but they also lend. A lot of their lending clients are NBA players, she told me me, who regularly took short-term cash advances at rates of <i>20%</i>. Twenty-percent! Just dumping money down the drain. 
</p><p>

And they&#8217;re worried about a pay cut.
</p><p>

Owners are just as pitiless. Claiming the league&#8217;s revenue model is broken and giving Rashard Lewis $110 million for six years like driving a car into a wall and blaming the warranty. It&#8217;s no one&#8217;s fault but their own. 
</p><p>

(And suddenly Brandon Roy&#8217;s max deal comes to mind, offered with shaky knees and all.)
</p><p>

My disgust is compounded by the NFL&#8217;s getting their act together in time to salvage a respectable season. To be sure, football&#8217;s economic footing is statue-eque. Their problems were dividing a growing pie, not one that&#8217;s shrinking. Nonetheless, it makes the NBA&#8217;s stalemate appear all the more disheartening. Didn&#8217;t everyone read Moneyball?
</p><p>

With the whole situation simply festering, I can hardly bring myself to think about basketball. When I do, I just seem to slump, stewing with despair. It&#8217;s why updates have been so few and far between&#8212;there&#8217;s just no inspiration. They&#8217;ve sucked it out of me. I assume most of you Blazer fans feel the same way: that basketball isn&#8217;t on the radar like it&#8217;s supposed to be this time of year.
</p><p>

But going forward I want everyone to know: when the season resumes, so will PRS. We are beaten, but far from broke. All the coverage and zeal of years passed will as soon as the first whistle is blown and the jump ball is tossed. 
<p>
But until that day, I&#8217;ll be thumbing my nose in protest. hoping for the league&#8212;and country&#8212;I love to rise above the muck. </p>

<p>Remember the summer of 2007? The Blazers had as clear a path to joining the NBA&#8217;s elite as a young team could hope for; Zach Randolph was finally gone, Brandon Roy was a franchise player, LaMarcus Aldridge was a future All Star, and Greg Oden was the next dominant big man. The franchise seemed doubly blessed with leadership that made good decisions and luck.</p>
<p>Portland drafting Oden catapulted Blazers fans from cautious optimism into a full on Rip City revival. Fans of the Blazers deserve much of the credit they receive nationally for their dedication, but few mention that this team was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2006">dead last in attendance in 2006</a>.  Even Blazers fans need a decent product to support, and suddenly they had a phenomenal one. Conversations weren&#8217;t so much about if that team could win a title as they were how many titles would ultimately be amassed. The buzz was back.</p>
<p>I didn’t experience that elevated spirit directly. I viewed it in a detached way, the way scientists say they do their work. The summer of 2007 coincidentally was the worst time of my life. My family experienced an unexpected loss, the sort that snatches you from normal for a while and makes it hard to think of sports as important. I couldn’t manage to be excited about a basketball team, but a small part of me was pleased to witness the spike in enthusiasm. For lack of the talent needed to clearly describe my feelings at that time I’ll put it like this: I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it, but I looked forward to being able to enjoy it someday.</p>
<p>Now the summer of 2011 is coming to a close. The summer of 2007 wasn&#8217;t so long ago, although things seem so different now that I’m not convinced I didn’t <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167/"><em>Slider</em></a> into a parallel dimension somewhere along the way. I’m back to being wrapped up in frivolous things. It’s questionable whether Roy and Oden will ever be able to play an entire season, let alone perform at a high level. Aldridge, once destined to be the tertiary star to Roy and Oden supernovae, is shouldering far too much franchise weight. Team leadership seems incapable of making even okay decisions, let alone great ones. (Glad to hear <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-wojnarowski_troy_weaver_blazers_090211">the GM search</a> is going well. Hope the one in twelve months runs just as smoothly.) What felt like a lucky franchise now seems like a cursed one. The only thing from the summer of 2007 that remains is a reinvigorated fan base, which has so far kept enough of a grip to keep from falling back to the apathy of the 2005-06 season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how quickly things can change and the opaqueness of the future. Downer examples like the ones above are usually the go-to type used to illustrate these facts of life. As illustrations they are incomplete. Just as things can go from great to crap in a flash, they can leap from crap to great. A surprisingly good trade or three, a player already on the roster rising to a new level (Hi Nico),  Roy and Oden discovering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Pit">the Lazarus Pit</a>, these are just a few possibilities that could put the Blazers back on track to join the NBA elite. It&#8217;s easy to look back at the summer of 2007 and point out how foolish we were for believing in a sure thing. It takes a bit more thought to optimistically apply those lessons to the present. This franchise does not have a doomed fate. There is an unlimited and unknowable amount of future events available to help the Blazers find their way. Embrace that.</p>

<p>Things can change quickly in the NBA. In 2005 the Blazers selected Martell Webster with the sixth pick in the draft. Webster was joining the NBA straight out of high school. No big deal, the team said, we believe in you and are willing to wait for you to develop, the team said. Webster remained a fuzzily defined important piece of the franchise&#8217;s future until 2010, when the Blazers reappraised his value and determined it was comparable to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA54LQs8U6E">Luke Babbit</a> and a Ryan Gomes buy-out.<br /></p>
<p>Webster does not play for the Blazers anymore. Nonetheless,  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MartellWebster">his twitter account</a> is excellent and he still seems like a Trailblazer to me. He comes back to Portland during the off-season to plank, eat, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=203651729688123">organize free community events</a>. He even spent most of last season being injured, like a true Blazer. Here are some of his best tweets in recent history.</p>
<p><blockquote>Yeah today is just one of those days. #planking http://lockerz.com/s/124282709</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MartellWebster/status/96403030144069632">Urban</a> farmers restaurant in Portland OR is the ish. The monkey fingers are tasty. Lol I&#8217;m just joking. Great restaurant none the less.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MartellWebster/status/96408282582884354">If</a> you were throwing public picnic, would Viagra be a terrible sponsor? Its close to decision time I need to know lol. @jrd21 @maitramtran</blockquote> </p>

<p>Since Webster is unlikely to do much winning with the Timberwolves any time soon I am extra proud to call him the first non-Blazer to win a Blazer tweet beat. Whale blubber for everyone none the less.</pb

<p>When I was <a href="http://www.portlandroundballsociety.com/home/2011/6/26/drafting-nolan-smith-over-faried-nothing-is-changing.html">critical of the Blazers drafting Nolan Smith</a>, I tried (and mostly failed) to convey that my criticism was not so much meant for Smith himself. It was about the Blazers&#8217; obsession with drafting backup point guards, a streak that now spans five consecutive drafts, at the expense of addressing more pressing needs like frontcourt depth.</p>
<p>I have no clue how Smith will perform with the Blazers. I&rsquo;m hoping he provides more than just another data point documenting the point guard draft woes of this team, though the odds may not be in his favor. Smith is one of four players that will be eyeing the backup point guard role. Optimistically one could say that this glut will create spirited competition that ultimately benefits the team. Pessimistically, one could say that it will hinder all four of them from finding success.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Smith will be able to carve a niche for himself with the Blazers. Opportunities for development may be few thanks to that crowded back court. Then there are pesky&nbsp;<a href="http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Nolan-Smith-1118/">questions about his ability to play point guard</a>. Here is what I do know about Smith: the more about him I learn, the more I like him. Since the draft I have learned that&nbsp;he is intense enough to get&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2011/7/27/2299276/goodman-blazers-g-nolan-smith-ejected-while-coaching-aau">ejected while coaching an AAU game</a>, that his go to dance move is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWtyGqGP67c">the running man</a>, that he plays hard in charity games (I watched Smith go harder than most during the H206 charity game in Seattle last month), that he is a veteran of the <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2011/8/19/2372971/raymond-felton-beats-nolan-smith-in-nc-pro-am-final">NC Pro Am</a>, that he posts pictures like the one at the top of this entry on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/NdotSmitty/status/103298942195859456">twitter</a>, and that when a reporter asks him why people make fun of his toe nails he deadpans &ldquo;actually, <a href="http://sethcurrysavesduke.blogspot.com/2010/11/its-been-lot-of-fun-though.html">ladies love my feet</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>None of the things I&#8217;ve learned help me form an opinion on how effective Smith will be in the NBA, let alone determine if he is the One the prophecies speak of who will come to Portland and finally satiate the Blazers&#8217; appetite for drafting point guards. But he seems to have an intensity and sense of humor that will fit in well with the rest of the team. Yes, I would still have rather the Blazers went another way with their draft. But Smith seems so likable to me now that I&#8217;m hoping to be wrong.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Portland <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2011/8/18/2371692/mayor-sam-adams-proclaims-today-arvydas-sabonis-day">made it official</a>: August 18, 2011 was Arvydas Sabonis Day. That afternoon legendary Blazers announcer Bill Schonely presented Sabonis with the &ldquo;Key to Rip City&rdquo; in front of thousands at a <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/08/trail_blazers_great_arvydas_sa.html">gathering in downtown Portland</a>. (I hear that Sabonis is not the first to receive this honor. I hope these keys have &ldquo;Do Not Copy&rdquo; engraved into them, as a citizen of Rip City I&rsquo;m getting concerned for my safety. Also, if one lost the Key to Rip City would they have to change all the locks and have new keys made for everybody? Sound expensive. They should look at using swipe cards. Do you want more key-related humor? No you do not.)</p>
<p>Later that evening the Blazers hosted a &ldquo;VIP Reception&rdquo; to honor Sabonis. I was able to attend despite managing to only be as important as anybody else in the humanistic sense. Really the VIP reception was just like being crammed into Pioneer Courthouse Square underneath the Sun with <a href="http://www.iamatrailblazersfan.com/Home/Photos/OfficialGalleryAlbum/tabid/165/GalleryView/AlbumSSP/AlbumID/256187/GalleryID/59414/Default.aspx">2,500 sweaty people</a>, except here you had personal space, air conditioning, could chat with Sabonis, then get a picture, then go get your steak cut exactly the way you like by a guy in a white hat, then chat about how delicious the little red potatoes cut in half and stuffed with sour cream, cheese, chives, and bacon are with Terry Porter (I have never seen so much readily available food and so few media people around to feast upon it), then get a Sabonis bobblehead to take home. And you don&rsquo;t even have to feel like an elitist ass since proceeds from the fifty-dollars per head event go to the <a href="http://www.nba.com/blazers/makeitbetter/">Make It Better Foundation</a>. Now, back to work Pleb.</p>
<p>After posing with numerous smaller humans, Sabonis joined a panel on stage that included team radio announcer Brain Wheeler, former team owner Harry Glickman, former coach PJ Carlesimo, and former team executives Bucky Buckwalter and Jim Paxson. The panel took turns praising Sabonis and telling anecdotes. Sabonis expressed his gratitude and flashed what I will call his trademark giant Lithuanian man humor.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of Glickman&rsquo;s story of an early attempt at signing Sabonis:</p>
<blockquote>I went to the Soviet Union to try to sign him. I&rsquo;ll make a long story as short as possible, finally found somebody to negotiate with, he was the Deputy Minister of Sports and Culture. We started the meetings, he spoke very good English, and he said &ldquo;My father was a contractor and he always said that Portland cement was the best, so it&rsquo;s a pleasure to welcome someone from Portland.&rdquo; I thought &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off on the right track.&rdquo; I thought we had a deal made. We came back, translated the contract from English into Russian, by a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark College, that cost us five-thousand dollars, mailed the contract over there, and never from him again. But I&rsquo;m glad he eventually got here.</blockquote>
<p>Listen to the full Sabonis Panel discussion <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ati7wQb_h2c">here</a>. I would recommend that you listen even if I didn&rsquo;t waste an incredible amount of time figuring out how to upload it. But since I did waste an incredible amount of time figuring out how to upload it, I <em>really </em>want you to listen. If you are like me you will clip out a Sabonis joke and make it your ringtone. I&rsquo;m about to become the most popular person on the bus. Thank you, Arvydas Sabonis, and your Day.</p>

<p>Earlier this summer I believed that <a href="http://www.portlandroundballsociety.com/home/2011/6/19/blazer-tweet-beat-dj-ru-ru-edition.html">the lockout would lead to more free time</a> which would lead to higher quality tweeting. In regards to the Blazers it appears I was very wrong. It is only July and the team has run out of tweet steam (tweam?). As someone who spends a stupid amount of time reading Blazer tweets I&#8217;m optimistically hoping that it can only get better from here. This is the cream of the recent crop. For serious.</p>

<p>As has been expected, the Blazers (finally) announced that they have offered Greg Oden a one year contract worth $8.8 million, making Oden a restricted free agent. Other teams can offer Oden a larger contract, at which point the Blazers would have seven days to decide between matching the outside offer and retaining Oden or allowing him to walk. No team will be allowed to extend an offer to Oden until the lockout is over.</p>
<p>The Blazers also announced extending a qualifying offer of one year and $1.2 million to Patty Mills. If you are in some ways similar to me, you will laugh at <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2011/6/29/2251337/portland-trail-blazers-contract-offer-patrick-mills-luke-babbitt-elliot-williams">Ben’s take over at Blazers Edge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
We&#8217;re now one step closer to Allen building a museum next to the Space Needle to house his Patty Mills game-worn jersey collection.
</blockquote>
<p>The Blazers also exercised options on Luke Babbit and Elliot Williams. If you count Williams the Blazers now have five point guards on the roster for the upcoming season. Sweet.</p>

<p>Last season the Blazers lacked adequate big man depth, to put it mildly. During the draft the team had the opportunity to address this gaping need; forward/rebounding machine Kenneth Faried was available. Instead, the Blazers drafted <a href="http://www.portlandroundballsociety.com/home/2011/1/30/patty-mills-unicorns-and-the-post-porter-curse.html">yet another</a> backup point guard in Nolan Smith. With the draft over and the lockout likely to limit the business of off-season personnel changes, the Blazers face the possibility of another long interior disadvantaged season. The decision to draft Smith over Faried is not nearly as jarring as the firing of two competent General Managers within a single year, but is nonetheless another perplexing move by management.</p>
<p>During the 2011 season the Blazers lack of frontcourt depth meant 43 minutes per game for LaMarcus Aldridge. According to <a href="http://www.82games.com/1011/10POR12.HTM">82games.com</a>, Aldridge spent 40% of the Blazers’ total minutes playing the center position. Star players are meant to be depended on, but leaning so heavily on a player can wear them down, <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/03/lamarcus_adridge_shows_signs_o.html">Aldridge mentioned as much last season</a>. If the Blazers are to ever make a deep post-season run it would be better for their star player to not be running on fumes by March.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that the Blazers will be able to find adequate interior depth amongst their existing talent. That would mean 37 year old Marcus Camby, who played just 59 games last season as 36 year old Marcus Camby, staying healthy. It would mean finally finding the alchemy that heals Greg Oden permanently. If none or only one of those factors workout, the Blazers will again be asking 10-day contract type of players (to be explicit: I am lumping Jeff Pendergraph into this group) to consistently produce above their talent level.</p>
<p>When the Blazers were on the clock with the 21st pick, Kenneth Faried was available. Given <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/06/nate_mcmillan_impressed_by_ken.html">the nice things the Blazers said about Faried</a> before the draft (HE EVEN TIES HIS SHOES HARD!), and the opportunity to fill a gaping team need, I was confident Faried would be coming to Portland. Instead, the team chose to take another shot at upgrading the backup point guard position.</p>
<p>The issue is not so much about whether or not Faried turns out to be a better NBA player than Smith. It is about the team having the opportunity to fill a gaping hole in their frontcourt, in an environment that suggests such opportunities may be few in the near future, and deciding to address a need that was secondary at most.  Drafting Smith over Faried seems to be the latest perplexing decision in an ongoing series of perplexing decisions by Blazers’ leadership. Worse, there is nothing that suggests the muddling will end anytime soon.</p>
