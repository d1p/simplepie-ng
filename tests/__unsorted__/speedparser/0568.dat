        <title>Pocket Owl ACEO from Hand Carved Rubber Stamp</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img1.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.275089825.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3.00&lt;br /&gt;The Saw Whet Owl.  The &amp;quot;pocket ow&amp;quot;l as it is sometimes called.  A little tiny owl you could put in your shirt pocket.  Very tame when approached.  Cute as a button, but also haunting in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey of Peach Products led my father-in-law (photographer of 3 Oaks Enhancements) and I to a tree that is a migratory resting spot for Saw Whet owls.  Here Dick captured this picture, which I turned into two rubber stamps.  One stamp for the &amp;quot;brown&amp;quot; print, and another for the &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; print, to created this two layered stamp image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ACEO (Artist Card/Edition/Original). The card measures 2.5 x 3.5 inches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each card is numbered.  This is the Second Edition of 6 cards.</description>        <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 22:09:01 -0400</pubDate>

        <title>Great Horned Owl ACEO from Hand Carved Rubber Stamp</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img0.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.275168092.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3.00&lt;br /&gt;The Great Horned Owl!  The largest of our owls in the Eastern U.S.  I have had a few personal encounters with this bird, and they are truly a mysterious bird.  My favorite fact about them is that they have a very poor sense of smell, and they are one of the top predators of the skunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ACEO (Artist Card/Edition/Original). The card measures 2.5 x 3.5 inches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each card is numbered.  This is the First Edition of 6 cards.  I have four still available for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owl image is from a hand carved rubber stamp that I created.   It is printed in pigment ink and hand colored with color pencil.</description>        <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 21:55:36 -0400</pubDate>

        <title>Phantom of the Opera Rubber Stamp Hand Carved</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img2.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.274435362.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10.00&lt;br /&gt;A classic!  Probably most people have a totally different image in their head when you say Phantom of the Opera.  But you may not know a silent move version of Phantom of the Opera was made in 1925.  The role of the Phantom was played by &amp;quot;the man of 1,000 faces&amp;quot; Lon Chaney.  Lon&amp;#39;s son carried on his father&amp;#39;s legacy in horror by playing the role of the Wolfman in 1941.Now for the details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a single stamp. It is hand carved by jackbear himself. The stamp measures approximately 1.0 inches wide, by 1.4 inches high. It is carved in Firm Kut rubber for sharp detail and longevity. It comes mounted on 6 mm black foam for stamping ease. It is stained slightly from ink required for the test images, but that in no way harms the stamping quality of the stamps and is normal for Firm Kut material. Stamp cleans up easily with water. Ink not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically mail with Priority Mail. If you prefer a different shipping option, please let me know, I will add/reduce the charge as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image used from a font produced by Michael Gaines.</description>        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 21:41:58 -0400</pubDate>

        <title>Vincent Price Rubber Stamp Hand Carved</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img1.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.274134513.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10.00&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I am too young to fully appreciate the dark and mysterious career of Vincent Price.  It is true my exposure to him was first in Michael Jackson&amp;#39;s Thriller video and the Muppet Show.  Nonetheless, when I think of horror, and I think of gothic shadow, I hear Vincent Price&amp;#39;s voice speaking from beyond the grave.  If you have never seen Tim Burton&amp;#39;s tribute to the Vincent Price (narrated by the godfather of goth himself) you should have a peek : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASHP-vgnjAw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a single stamp. It is hand carved by jackbear himself. The stamp measures approximately 1.1 inches wide, by 1.4 inches high. It is carved in Firm Kut rubber for sharp detail and longevity. It comes mounted on 6 mm black foam for stamping ease. It is stained slightly from ink required for the test images, but that in no way harms the stamping quality of the stamps and is normal for Firm Kut material. Stamp cleans up easily with water.

The 1941 film starred Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man.  He reprised the role in may sequels, and became typecast along the like of Lugosi and Karloff.  However, Wikipedia says, &amp;quot;Chaney is the only actor to portray all four of Universal&amp;#39;s major monsters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein&amp;#39;s Monster, the Mummy, and the vampire son of Count Dracula.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a single stamp.

Supposed he got the role of Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster after Bela Lugosi turned it down!  I imagine Karloff as this big menace, but he was only 5&amp;#39; 11&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a single stamp.

Forever would his likeness be emblazoned on our brains when we think of the monster made by Dr. Frankenstein.  Not only was Karloff&amp;#39;s face now forever burned into our collective vision, but also the walk, and the his stiff rise from the table.  Even George Lucas ripped him off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a single stamp. It is hand carved by jackbear himself.
