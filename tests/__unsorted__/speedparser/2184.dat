Another Fantastic Fest is in the books and the festival once again lived up to its name. For eight straight days I slept little, met friends, ate, drank and watched an inhuman amount of crazy genre movies. Now that it’s over, it’s time to not only rank the best films I saw at the festival, but point out a few trends that defined Fantastic Fest 2011.

Before we get to the lists, I feel it imperative to embed this video. While I, and others, can try to explain to the layman how great Fantastic Fest is, how spectacular the movies and atmosphere are, a picture is worth a thousand words, as they say. So here's a recap video that should do the trick.



And now onto the lists.
The Best Films of Fantastic Fest 2011
1. A Boy and His Samurai [1] – Winner of the festival’s audience award [2], Yoshihiro Nakamura’s film about a single mother and her little son who end up housing a time-traveling samurai turned pastry chef was rightfully beloved by all. It has everything you want in a movie and so much more.

2. Sleepless Night [3] – For pure edge of your seat action, Frederic Jardin’s French film will end up being one of the best of the year. It combines the twists and turns of a Guy Ritchie movie and the visceral action of the Bourne series wrapped great, real time episode of 24.

3. The Skin I Live In – Pedro Almodovar’s latest film stars Antonio Banderas as an influential surgeon who has an incredibly beautiful girl locked up in his house. As their story unfolds, Almodovar not only keeps our interest, he makes us question what is real about our own emotions.

4. Extraterrestrial [4] – A hilarious, incredibly smart romantic comedy set against the backdrop of an alien invasion, Nacho Vigalondo’s sophomore effort brings a sharp, screwball twist to the romantic comedy genre that will have you guessing until the end.

5. You Said What? – Swingers meets State and Main in this utterly charming comedy about a group of friends who hold a fake audition to find their friend a girl and end up having to make the movie anyway. Filled with film references and a kick ass pop soundtrack, it’s formulaic in the way that proves why formulas work so well.

6. Comic Con Episode 4: A Fan’s Hope [5] – Every year, hundreds of thousands of fans descend on San Diego for Comic Con and for those who don’t understand why, they just have to watch this film. Morgan Spurlock follows several unique people whose stories of triumph and failure at Comic Con are the perfect microcosm for the mecca of pop culture.

7. You’re Next [6] – Touted as possible the start of the next great horror franchise, You're Next is about a group of animal masked home invaders who descend on a family reunion. The results are a gory, surprising, but also smart and funny film that everyone will be talking about when it finally gets released next year. It pretty much swept all the festival's horror awards [7] too.

8. Milocrorze: A Love Story [8] – Nearly bursting off the screen with energy and color, this Japanese anthology film about love tells three unique stories that, while wildly different, each are the epitome of cool.

9. Headhunters [9] – An art burglar meets his match in the form of a former military security specialist in this Norwegian, Ocean’s Eleven inspired cat and mouse thriller that keeps the audience guessing, laughing, and talking about the results at the end.

10. New Kids Turbo [10] – The biggest box office hit in the history of The Netherlands, New Kids Turbo is lewd, crude comedy with a social message and characters that grow on you to a point you don’t want the movie to end.

Honorable Mention: Melancholia [11], Michael [12], El Narco [13], Rabies, Paranormal Activity 3 [14]

Note: There were about 65 total features that screened at the fest and I only saw 29, so there were plenty that people liked that I missed such as Sleep Tight, Clown and Beyond the Black Rainbow. Also I saw films like Elite Squad 2, The Innkeepers and Take Shelter before the festival so I didn’t count them in this list.

Finally, whether or not you were at Fantastic Fest, there were a few things this year that seemed to differentiate it from years past. Here are my top five trends of Fantastic Fest 2011.

1. The best movies weren’t that gory - Fantastic Fest is a genre film festival and usually that means gory horror, despicable acts and films that you’d never watch with a significant other. There certainly were some of those this year but, if you look at the list above, very few of the best movies were offensive at all. In fact, many of them were the total opposite.

2. Things are decidedly tamer - Jumping off from number one, the super gory, gross out, offensive films that did screen in 2011 weren’t as buzzworthy as previous years. Human Centipede II [15] is the perfect example and as gross as that film is, you’d be hard pressed to find more than a handful of movies that come close. If anything, some contained only a scene or two of filth.

3. Slow burns are the thing - A good number of this year's Fantastic Fest films suffered from "Slow Burn Syndrome" where the film moves along at a snail-like pace, just waiting and waiting for the big reveal. Sometimes that reveal delivered. Other times, it wasn’t worth the trouble.

 

4. U.S. vs. The World - Out of the almost 30 films I saw at the festival, almost 70% of them weren't in English and only four or five were American. In the game of cool genre movies, the U.S is losing. Badly.

5. A new standard in ticketing is born - This last point is a little bit inside, but interesting nonetheless. In 2010 the Alamo tried to adopt an online ticketing system for attendees but the site crashed and most people were forced to drive to the theater early in the morning to get good tickets.. This year they utilized a website called Queue It [16] which takes huge numbers of people and lets them wait to purchase something. Though it didn’t always work out in my favor, the system is fair and basically went off without a hitch. This is a site that should be widely adopted for high demand sales.

And that's that. Another amazing year of movies and we hope that in covering the festival, you heard about a few movies that you never hard before and your interest is piqued.

Briefly: The "mysterious" part of the headline really goes without saying, doesn't it? Deadline [2] reports that famously secretive filmmaker JJ Abrams is joining forces with screenwriter Billy Ray for a "mystery adventure," the pitch for which has just been purchased by Paramount. That's all we know at this point, but we like Abrams enough that any new project with his name on it tends to grab our attention.

Ray's writing credits include State of Play and Flightplan, and he's also done some directorial work with Breach and Shattered Glass (both of which he also wrote.) He's currently got a few different projects on his plate, including the scripts for Pan, a retelling of Peter Pan's origin story starring Channing Tatum; the big-screen adaptation of 24; and Paul Greengrass' A Captain’s Duty with Tom Hanks. In addition, he's also set to write and direct the English-language remake of The Secret in Their Eyes, which may or may not [3] star Denzel Washington.

Abrams recently confirmed [4] his return to the director's chair for the sequel to his 2009 hit Star Trek, and is expected to begin shooting early next year. On the television side, he's had a hand in two series premiering this fall -- the Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson-starring Person of Interest on CBS, and Fox's Alcatraz.

This weekend can be simply described in two words: Arrested Development. News of a possible fourth season of the brilliant comedic sitcom, followed by the long rumored movie, dominated social media on Sunday as everyone expressed their excitement. Read all the details about that here [1]. The news broke at a New Yorker sponsored reunion of the show which included not only show creator Mitchell Hurwitz and executive producer Ron Howard (via speaker phone) but most of the show's primary cast: Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, David Cross, Portia de Rossi,  Tony Hale, Alia Shawkat, Jeffrey Tambor and Jessica  Walter.

And as exciting as news of more Arrested Development is, it was only a sliver of a much bigger event. Now, thanks to the magic of the Internet, you can watch the entire thing for free. Check it out after the jump.

To watch the video, click on the image below and then "Like" the New Yorker on Facebook [2]. That'll make it available. Thanks to The Film Stage [3] for the heads up.

 [4]

Whether you want to believe it or not, Arrested Development is one of the major catalysts for much of the comedy we enjoy today. It revitalized the career of Jason Bateman, who is now once again a major movie star. It also introduced us to Michael Cera and Will Arnett, both now huge stars in their own right. Episodes were directed by the likes of Greg Mottola, Paul Feig and Jay Chandrasekhar, all of whom went on to bigger and better things. Plus, Arrested Developement's off the wall humor was well ahead of its time and most certainly an influence on some of today's hit shows: Community, The Office, etc.

Despite all of that, the show is still considered a cult hit because the mainstream never embraced it. Maybe now, years removed from its cancellation, it'll finally find the audience it deserves.

If you've seen either version of Planet of the Apes, the overall outcome of Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes shouldn't have come as a huge shock -- the end result is spelled out right there in the title, after all. But there was one key element of the ending that nearly turned out very differently, until a very late reshoot shifted the fate of one of its major characters. And given that the film ultimately wound up grossing $409 million worldwide, essentially guaranteeing a sequel or two, it was probably a pretty wise move on the part of the filmmakers. Read more about the alternate ending after the jump. (Spoilers for Rise of the Planet of the Apes follow, obviously.)

To refresh your memory, the version we saw in theaters this summer ends with James Franco's character Will Rodman apologizing to lead ape Caesar (Andy Serkis) for everything that's happened, and trying to convince him to come home so Will can protect him. Caesar declines, giving Will a hug and telling him "Caesar is home." (Watch the theatrical ending here [2].)

During a panel at the Visual Effects Society Production Summit, however, Gagliano revealed [3] that the character of Will was originally supposed to die, and that the ending we saw was the result of a last-minute change of heart from the filmmakers. Franco and Serkis were flown in July 4th to reshoot the scene for the film, which had an opening date of August 5. According to an excerpt from an earlier draft of the script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, posted over at The Playlist [4], Will perishes saving Caesar's life.

Gagliano didn't give a reason for the change, but one likely explanation is that the filmmakers felt it might be useful to have a major human character that they could bring back for a potential sequel. But if you'd rather see Franco's character drop dead, you may still get your chance eventually. Gagliano also spoke about "the importance of alternative scenes and supplemental material" for after market sales. "For example, we thought James Franco's character should die (in Apes), so we are going to sell (the alternative clip) down the road," he said.

Discuss: Which ending do you prefer? Personally, I think Will's death would've been the more interesting route, as it would've added another layer of poignancy to Caesar's storyline. But then, I tend to come out on the side of killing off characters, so maybe that's just me.

Read more about the alternate ending after the jump. (<strong>Spoilers</strong> for <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> follow, obviously.)</p>
<p><span id="more-113121"></span>To refresh your memory, the version we saw in theaters this summer ends with <strong>James Franco</strong>&#8216;s character Will Rodman apologizing to lead ape Caesar (<strong>Andy Serkis</strong>) for everything that&#8217;s happened, and trying to convince him to come home so Will can protect him. Caesar declines, giving Will a hug and telling him &#8220;Caesar <em>is</em> home.&#8221; (Watch the theatrical ending <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB1C00TLW8">here</a>.)</p>
<p>During a panel at the Visual Effects Society Production Summit, however, Gagliano <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-exec-at-ves-panel-242957">revealed</a> that the character of Will was originally supposed to die, and that the ending we saw was the result of a last-minute change of heart from the filmmakers. Franco and Serkis were flown in July 4th to reshoot the scene for the film, which had an opening date of August 5. According to an excerpt from an earlier draft of the script by <strong>Rick Jaffa</strong> and <strong>Amanda Silver</strong>, posted over at <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/last-minute_reshoots_saved_james_francos_character_from_death_in_rise_of_th/">The Playlist</a>, Will perishes saving Caesar&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Gagliano didn&#8217;t give a reason for the change, but one likely explanation is that the filmmakers felt it might be useful to have a major human character that they could bring back for a potential sequel. But if you&#8217;d rather see Franco&#8217;s character drop dead, you may still get your chance eventually. Gagliano also spoke about &#8220;the importance of alternative scenes and supplemental material&#8221; for after market sales. &#8220;For example, we thought James Franco&#8217;s character should die (in Apes), so we are going to sell (the alternative clip) down the road,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss:</strong> Which ending do you prefer? Personally, I think Will&#8217;s death would&#8217;ve been the more interesting route, as it would&#8217;ve added another layer of poignancy to Caesar&#8217;s storyline. But then, I tend to come out on the side of killing off characters, so maybe that&#8217;s just me.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

The first trailer has dropped for The Catechism Cataclysm, Todd Rohal's oddball comedy about young priest Father Billy (Steve Little, Eastbound &#38; Down) who reunites with his high school role model, a former rocker named Robbie (Robert Longstreet, Pineapple Express). For reasons I can't quite make out, the two near-strangers decide to go on a male bonding canoe trip. The pair quickly get lost, and things move from awkward to strange to deeply fucked up. Watch the video after the jump.


[via Geek Tyrant [2]]

The film's meandering, stoner-ish sensibility doesn't seem to be for everyone. While some critics called it "delectably strange," [3] others complained that the humor was juvenile and "[not] particularly funny." [4] Pretty much everyone, however, seem agreed Rohal has a very clear vision, and that the movie is totally out there. If anything, it sounds even weirder than the offbeat trailer makes it look, but I thought the trailer had some promising moments.

The Catechism Cataclysm opens October 19.

Synopsis:
Storytelling in all its forms is skewered in Todd Rohal's hilarious THE CATECHISM CATACLYSM. A favorite of Sundance, SXSW and BAMcinemafest 2011, this divinely bizarre and funny tale infuses stories within stories with wild characters until lines between Biblical tales, Mark Twain, and campfire stories are hysterically blurred. From producers Jody Hill, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, THE CATECHISM CATACLYSM tells the tale of Father Billy (Steve Little, EASTBOUND &#38; DOWN), an eccentric young priest who tracks down his high school idol Robbie, an ex Heavy Metal rocker (Robert Longstreet, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS) who begrudgingly agrees to a canoe trip. As they embark on their journey, it slowly becomes clear that the two old friends might not be as close as Father Billy remembers. When night approaches, and they realize they have lost their way-- that's when things get weird.

In Hollywood, everyone is always looking for a foot in the door. The belief is once you get that foot in the door, the sky is the limit. Dante Harper certainly believes that. The screenwriter developed Black Hole for David Fincher which led him to rewrite [1] Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, he's penned a Timothy McVeigh biopic called Dreamland and his biggest break, All You Need Is Kill, is now casting [2] under director Doug Liman.

His star keeps rising, too, because Sony just hired Harper to adapt Isaac Asimov's Foundation which Roland Emmerich has been attached to [3] since 2009. Last we heard [4], Emmerich wanted to film make the sci-fi trilogy "very different from other science-fiction movies" without "the burden of too big a budget." Harper must bring that to the project. Read more after the jump.

Foundation is the first book in an award-winning trilogy by Asimov. It's about “a mathematician named Hari Seldon, a psychohistorian who is able to  predict large-scale events using scientific principles. When Seldon  foresees the downfall of the Galactic Empire, which will precipitate a  dark age lasting 30,000 years, he establishes two human oases  (”Foundations”) in an effort to preserve human knowledge” according to a previous piece [5].

Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) was the first writer [6] on the project and though Emmerich said earlier this year that "The studio’s happy with the script" either that's not the case or Harper has been brought in to make it cheaper. Deadline's source article [7] on the subject doesn't say either way.

What we do know is that Foundation won't be Emmerich's next film [8]. That'll be another sci-fi film called Singularity. The question then becomes will Emmerich do Foundation after that or get away from sci-fi for a while? Odds are that decision will be made based on the quality of Harper's script.

It's hard to say if Harper is a good fit here as nothing he's written has been released yet, but are you excited Foundation is still being developed?

Now that I've left the geeky confines of Fantastic Fest, I can get this off my chest. I've never seen a Hatchet movie. The topic of best new horror franchises came up quite a bit during the festival in relation to You're Next [1] and Paranormal Activity 3 [2] so, inevitably, people would mention the Adam Green-directed films about a murder named Victor Crowley. I was forced to nod, well-aware of my shame, and then talk about last year's controversy when the unrated Hatchet 2 was placed, then pulled [3], from AMC Theaters.

My ignorance about the series aside, fan passion has overshadowed dismal box office and Hatchet 3 is a go...without Adam Green as director. Instead BJ McDonnell, the cameraman on the first two films who worked very closely with Green, is taking the reins.

Read his thoughts and how Green will help after the jump.

According to Variety [4], Hatchet 3 will "pick up where the last film left off, as a young woman sought revenge on  the malevolent monster that killed her family while they were fishing in  Louisiana swamp country."

In a press release printed by Shock Till Ya Drop [5], McDonnell said the following:
I’ve been with the Hatchet team from the very beginning and am honored and thrilled that Adam has handed me the reins on this third movie. I grew up watching horror films and like Adam Green, I’m a true genre fan at heart. I have been waiting for an opportunity like this to step up and make my directorial debut with something I love and know inside and out. Working together with Adam, we plan to make a kick ass movie!
Green added that:
BJ was not only the camera operator on the first two Hatchet movies. He was there alongside me creating every shot, working closely with me to craft each scene, moment, outrageous kill, and performance. He is absolutely beloved by the entire HATCHET family and his experience on everything from huge studio films to smaller independent productions will ensure that he will do the franchise proud.
McDonnell has done more than Hatchet, though. He was also the cameraman on Battle Los Angeles, Rob Zombie’s Halloween, MacGruber, Spiral, TV’s Heroes, The Darkest Hour, Killer Joe by William Friedkin and is currently working on One Shot starring Tom Cruise.

Green will, of course, "work closely with McDonnell on all aspects of production."

If you're a Hatchet fan, how does this sound? Are you disappointed Adam Green won't be directing Hatchet 3?

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

We already knew a little bit about Frank or Francis, Charlie Kaufman's second directorial effort after his insanely ambitious, gloriously bizarre Synecdoche, New York. Basically, we were aware that it existed, that Nicolas Cage, Steve Carrell, and Jack Black had signed on, and that the film would revolve primarily around the feud between an Internet blogger and a Hollywood director. But this being Kaufman, of course, there was bound to be a whole lot more to the project than that.

Now, we have lots more details on the story -- and the more I learn, the more I'm dying to see this film. After the jump, read all about the script, and find out which very weird role(s) Kevin Kline has just been cast in.

First, let's get the simpler stuff out of the way. Variety [2] writes that Kline is now attached to play two supporting characters in the film. The first, Richard Waller, is the brother of Jonathan Waller, whose fictional hit Hiroshima becomes the highest-grossing movie of all time but fails to win Best Picture. Richard and Jonathan team up to create an animatronic head called Richard's Head, which is programmed to develop the perfect script: totally inoffensive, with the widest possible appeal and no artistic integrity whatsoever. The robot head is Kline's second role.

If that didn't make a whole lot of sense, perhaps a more detailed description of the story will clear things up. (Actually, it won't, but I needed a segue.) The Playlist got their hands on the script, which they're describing as "the ne plus ultra of Charlie Kaufman-esque." What does that mean, exactly? Well, true to form, Kaufman didn't just write a story about online film criticism or even the movie industry as a whole -- that would be too simple. The expansive and "hyper meta-textual" project also covers "society, culture, human nature (and race) and human behavior" in addition to "the entire [movie-making] machine." It's definitely worth heading over to their site [3] to read their detailed explanation, but here are a few of the major points

The story follows three main characters. They are:

	Frank Arder (Carell), a pretentious writer/director whose film You gets nominated for 29 Academy Awards. Arder also plays every single role in You including the lead character, a homeless man.
	Francis (Black), an Internet troll who's earned some notoriety by posting caustic commentaries on the movie industry. Offline, however, he's simply a self-important jackass who lives in his parents' attic.
	Alan Modell (Cage), a fading comedian tasked with hosting the Oscars. He's best known for his idiotic Fat Dad series of films -- think The Fatties from Tropic Thunder.

Frank, Francis, and Alan's plot threads run parallel to each other, touching only occasionally until the "outrageous" conclusion. Got it? Good, now add in:

	a cheating subplot for Frank and his wife;
	a central love story for Francis;
	"a Romanian waitress and two talking ghost-like thumbs who have a Romanian political agenda";
	and the aforementioned Richard's Head.

Then toss in the fact that about half the dialogue is sung, musical-style. Seriously. Apparently, this tends to happen particularly often when characters are writing on the Internet.

It's still early enough in the process that some of the stuff described above could change, but it seems like a fantastic start, and quite Kaufman-esque indeed. I was a huge, huge fan of Synecdoche, New York, a glorious mess of a movie that in the space of 124 minutes attempted to tackle the gigantic topics of love, creativity, mortality, self-importance, and more. Frank or Francis sounds every bit as poignant, ambitious, and weird, and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.

The project is currently casting, most notably for two female roles that require singing. (Frank and Francis' love interests, perhaps?) Shooting on the film is scheduled to start in January.

Let's wind down this post with some of Kaufman's own thoughts on the project. Here's him talking to Time Out London [4] (via The Playlist):
If I look at some of the things in the script that I’m about to embark on, I’d have to say I don’t really have any idea how we’re going to do it... The movie I’m about to do has got a lot of scenes and a lot of characters. And the scope of it and the world it inhabits is very, very large. In the broadest possible sense, it’s about online film criticism, but as usual, the world that I’m writing about is not necessarily the world that I’m writing about. It’s just a place to set it. There’s a lot in there about the internet and anger: cultural, societal and individual anger. And isolation in this particular age we live in. And competition: it’s about the idea of people in this world wanting to be seen. I hate to use the word “about”, as it implies that what I’m doing is an analogy and that I’m trying to say something. I’m not. That’s for the audience to do.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-113062" href="http://www.slashfilm.com/charlie-kaufmans-frank-francis-online-film-criticism/charlie-kaufman/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-113062" title="Charlie Kaufman" src="http://bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/charlie-kaufman-550x300.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We already knew a little bit about <strong><em>Frank or Francis</em></strong>, <strong>Charlie Kaufman</strong>&#8216;s second directorial effort after his insanely ambitious, gloriously bizarre <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>. Basically, we were aware that it existed, that <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong>, <strong>Steve Carrell</strong>, and <strong>Jack Black</strong> had signed on, and that the film would revolve primarily around the feud between an Internet blogger and a Hollywood director. But this being Kaufman, of course, there was bound to be a whole lot more to the project than that.</p>
<p>Now, we have lots more details on the story &#8212; and the more I learn, the more I&#8217;m dying to see this film. After the jump, read all about the script, and find out which very weird role(s) <strong>Kevin Kline</strong> has just been cast in.</p>
<p><span id="more-113052"></span>First, let&#8217;s get the simpler stuff out of the way. <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118043721">Variety</a> writes that Kline is now attached to play two supporting characters in the film. The first, Richard Waller, is the brother of Jonathan Waller, whose fictional hit <em>Hiroshima</em> becomes the highest-grossing movie of all time but fails to win Best Picture. Richard and Jonathan team up to create an animatronic head called Richard&#8217;s Head, which is programmed to develop the perfect script: totally inoffensive, with the widest possible appeal and no artistic integrity whatsoever. The robot head is Kline&#8217;s second role.</p>
<p>If that didn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense, perhaps a more detailed description of the story will clear things up. (Actually, it won&#8217;t, but I needed a segue.) <em>The Playlist</em> got their hands on the script, which they&#8217;re describing as &#8220;the ne plus ultra of Charlie Kaufman-esque.&#8221; What does that mean, exactly? Well, true to form, Kaufman didn&#8217;t <em>just</em> write a story about online film criticism or even the movie industry as a whole &#8212; that would be too simple. The expansive and &#8220;hyper meta-textual&#8221; project also covers &#8220;society, culture, human nature (and race) and human behavior&#8221; in addition to &#8220;the entire [movie-making] machine.&#8221; It&#8217;s definitely worth heading over to <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/charlie_kaufman_says_frank_or_francis_is_about_online_film_criticism_--_but/">their site</a> to read their detailed explanation, but here are a few of the major points</p>
<p>The story follows three main characters. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Arder (Carell), a pretentious writer/director whose film <em>You</em> gets nominated for 29 Academy Awards. Arder also plays every single role in <em>You</em> including the lead character, a homeless man.</li>
<li>Francis (Black), an Internet troll who&#8217;s earned some notoriety by posting caustic commentaries on the movie industry. Offline, however, he&#8217;s simply a self-important jackass who lives in his parents&#8217; attic.</li>
<li>Alan Modell (Cage), a fading comedian tasked with hosting the Oscars. He&#8217;s best known for his idiotic <em>Fat Dad</em> series of films &#8212; think <em>The Fatties</em> from <em>Tropic Thunder</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frank, Francis, and Alan&#8217;s plot threads run parallel to each other, touching only occasionally until the &#8220;outrageous&#8221; conclusion. Got it? Good, now add in:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cheating subplot for Frank and his wife;</li>
<li>a central love story for Francis;</li>
<li>&#8220;a Romanian waitress and two talking ghost-like thumbs who have a Romanian political agenda&#8221;;</li>
<li>and the aforementioned Richard&#8217;s Head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then toss in the fact that about half the dialogue is sung, musical-style. Seriously. Apparently, this tends to happen particularly often when characters are writing on the Internet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early enough in the process that some of the stuff described above could change, but it seems like a fantastic start, and quite Kaufman-esque indeed. I was a huge, huge fan of <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>, a glorious mess of a movie that in the space of 124 minutes attempted to tackle the gigantic topics of love, creativity, mortality, self-importance, and more. <em>Frank or Francis</em> sounds every bit as poignant, ambitious, and weird, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what comes of it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

Update: EW [2] has confirmed that Showtime and Netflix are in talks with producers about airing the miniseries.

Keep holding out hope, Arrested Development fans. Five years after the series finale, creator Mitchell Hurwitz is still insisting that, yes, a movie based on the brilliant-but-cancelled sitcom is definitely in the works. And what's more, he's now hoping to do a nine- or ten-episode lead-in miniseries as well. Intriguing news indeed, but I don't think I'll be holding my breath. More details after the jump.

During a New Yorker Festival event Sunday afternoon, the New York Times [3] reports, Hurwitz took the stage with cast members Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Michael Cera, David Cross, Portia de Rossi, Tony Hale, Alia Shawkat, Jeffrey Tambor, and Jessica Walter for a panel about the show. Predictably, moderator Nancy Franklin inquired at one point about the status of the long-rumored film. Hurwitz' response: "We’re 80 percent of the way to an answer."

Hurwitz explained that he and Ron Howard, who narrated and executive produced the TV series, "had been talking about [the movie] for ages and trying to get this going." On a creative level, Hurwitz said that he has "been working on the screenplay for a long time and found that as time went by, there was so much more to the story." So much more, in fact, that he's now trying to create a limited TV series of nine or ten episodes to explain what's happened to each of the characters since the events of the series finale.
"[W]here everyone's been for five years became a big part of the story [of the movie]," said Hurwitz. "So in working on the screenplay, I found even if I just gave five minutes per character to that back story, we were halfway through the movie before the characters got together." From there, it made sense to consider the possibility of the limited-run series. "We’re basically hoping to do nine or 10 episodes, with almost one character per episode," he continued.
Hurwitz offered a possible outline for the first episode, which would revolve around protagonist Michael's childlike younger brother Buster (Hale). "The latest joke we have is that it’s Cambridge, Mass., and there’s all these scientists in lab coats and they’re waiting for somebody. Buster comes through the door in a white lab coat -- 'Let’s begin' -- and they say, 'Oh, no, you don’t get to wear the lab coat. We’re experimenting on you.'"

However, there are still a few issues that Hurwitz and his team will need to tackle. The NYT notes that Hurwitz did not name any studios or television networks involved with either project. And Hurwitz did acknowledge one possible difficulty -- that the two projects "[require] studios to work together that don’t typically work together, film and TV."

Bateman put out a targeted date of "next summer" to begin shooting the series and/or movie, referencing "a very specific plan" as to the project's scheduling. (He later went on to tweet [4] a possible release date of "early '13"; considering the proposed continuity, the television miniseries would presumably come first.) For his part, Hurwitz seemed slightly less optimistic, saying, "Perhaps the series is in the fall. This isn’t my decision."

Finally, Hurwitz cleared up some earlier rumors that Cera had been the stumbling block with regard to previous plans to put together an Arrested Development movie. "I kind of was perpetuating a little thing, like, wouldn’t it be funny if Michael Cera was the holdout. Let’s put that out there," Hurwitz said. "And then it really turned ugly, quickly. So I really just have to say, for those of you that have been following this saga, Michael’s always been great."

Considering how long it's been since the end of the series, as well as the fact that many of the cast members have since moved on to other projects, I'm still somewhat skeptical that we'll ever see either of these projects actually pan out. But perhaps that's just the pessimist in me speaking. Here's hoping that all goes well, and we'll find out in 2013 that I was dead wrong to ever doubt Hurwitz, Bateman, etc. when the new episodes and movie live up to our wildest dreams.

Discuss: Which of the following proposed TV-to-film projects do you think will hit the big screen first: Arrested Development, Veronica Mars [5], Party Down [6], or Friday Night Lights [7]?

The /Filmcast: After Dark is a recording of what happens right after The /Filmcast is over, when the kids have gone to bed and the guys feel free to speak whatever is on their minds. In other words, it’s the leftover and disorganized ramblings, mindfarts, and brain diarrhea from The /Filmcast, all in one convenient audio file. In this episode, David Chen [1], Devindra Hardawar [2], and Adam Quigley [3] discuss your e-mails about Drive and Contagion. Special guest Laremy Legel joins us from Film.com. [4] Be sure to check out Cinemezzo's piece comparing The Social Network and Contagion. [5]

Now that J.J. Abrams is officially on board [1] and we've given up seeing the film next Summer, we can all settle in and watch Star Trek 2 get made the right way. The latest update comes from one of the film's screenwriters, Roberto Orci, who also happens to be the creative director on a new set of comic books set in the world created by the original 2009 film. Speaking about those, Orci revealed location scouting is underway on the film and said the comic books would begin give fans hints about the movie. Read more after the jump.

TrekMovie [2] points us to the interview on the official Star Trek webpage [3]. Here's Orci's brief quote on the movie specifically:
The cast is excited. We have a director. We’ve started scouting  locations. The second time around the crew is already together from the  start, so we can jump right into the adventure.
As for the comic books, they're being published by IDW and - if you are a fan of the new Star Trek movie - it sounds like they are going to be pretty great. I won't get too detailed here, but the article on the official Trek site talks about how these comics will re-imagine classic episodes of the TV show with these new versions of the characters. Pretty cool stuff. Then there's this quote from one of the comic's writers, Mike Johnson:
As we get closer to the next movie, the stories will begin to foreshadow  the events of the movie, such as possibly introducing new characters we  will see onscreen... pun very much intended. 
He also suggested the development of the comics is happening congruently with the film:
It’s fantastic to have Bob’s input, because he can steer us clear of story elements that might conflict with what’s coming up in the next movie, and we can lay in subtle clues to what’s coming up so that once you see the new movie you can go back and see how it evolved in the comics....Bob and I have discussed the major beats of the next movie, which is a  great help in laying clues in the comic. We have very few secrets, that I  know of anyway.
Do you think it's smart to start leading your audience toward the movie in that way? Do you think much will be spoiled?

No matter what the judge's score cards say about who won Quentin vs. Coens Rounds One [1] and Two [2], the real winners are us. We, once again, get to enjoy awesome art based on the films of Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers.

After two successful shows in New York and San Francisco, Spoke Art is pitting the Quentin against Coens one more time in Los Angeles this weekend. Quentin vs. Coens Round Three will be on display on October 1 and 2 at the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles. After the jump, see a whole bunch of images from the show and get all the specific information on how to attend.

Thanks to Poster Shizzle [3] for many of these images.

The show itself is open from 6-11 p.m. Saturday October 1 and noon-5 p.m. Sunday October 2 at the Barnsdall Art Park, 4800 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles. Visit http://www.beyondedenartfair.com/ [4] and http://spoke-art.com/ [5] for more info.

Anyone in LA going to check this out? You know I'll be there.

And if you can't make it to Los Angeles, keep an eye on Spoke-Art.com [6] and all their social media for release dates on the prints and more.

Trailers are an under-appreciated art form insofar that many times  they’re seen as vehicles for showing footage, explaining films away,   or  showing their hand about what moviegoers can expect. Foreign,   domestic,  independent, big budget: I celebrate all levels of trailers   and  hopefully this column will satisfactorily give you a baseline of   what  beta wave I’m operating on, because what better way to hone your   skills  as a thoughtful moviegoer than by deconstructing these little   pieces of  advertising? Some of the best authors will tell you that   writing a short  story is a lot harder than writing a long one, that you   have to weigh  every sentence. What better medium to see how this   theory plays itself  out beyond that than with movie trailers?




The Pirates! Band Of Misfits Trailer

Any animated film that wants to incorporate nudists and leprosy in its promotional materials has my backing.

Director Peter Lord, last seen helming Chicken Run twelve years ago, hasn't done much in the way of actually directing but he has been producing the hell out of animated programming in that time. I don't know if a dozen years has sharpened the Lord's sensibilities but what I like about this trailer is that it bridges that crucial gap for me between kiddie fare and adult innuendo.

The whole tempo of the thing is one that just sets up things within a  few seconds and then rolls right into the nonsense that is a ditty that  drops nudists, grog, leaping dolphins, and accidental impalings. It's such a short trailer, and the song that carries us throughout the trailer is a jaunty one, but what we see is filled with great comedic beats and fantastical looks at what ought to be just a fun movie that you could most likely take the kids to while enjoying some of the more ribald moments that are intended for the a-dults. Whether that's true or not, and it ends up being more Wallace &#38; Gromit than it's selling itself as, I'm perfectly fine based on what's here.

While the film looks fun, and that's enough reason for my ankle biters to drag dad in to see it, it appears that there is a little more catering to my older sensibilities this go around than there was in Flushed Away, a film that still stands as a movie that was good but not great. This movie, by comparison, looks like it bridges the gap between catering to two kinds of audiences: kids who want to see pirates and the parents hoping to see something that won't be 90 minutes of excruciating misery.



Glitch In The Grid Trailer

It's experimental, original.

Director Eric Leiser's background, if you take IMDB's word for it, is that he's a graduate of CalArt's Experimental Animation program. His past work, if you dig a little further, reflects an understanding and appreciation of how to push the boundaries of normative storytelling. In fact, by the time you're done with this trailer, I dare you to tell me what this movie is about.

The answer to that question of the movie's contents, though, wouldn't be as interesting as watching everything unfold. Its musical score is something that is simple, delightful, but complimentary to what we see going on in the frame. It does not follow any conventions of establishing who this person is that's talking or why we should care in the first place. However, the artistry of showing the many different ways this film is being animated is the real treat.

From action figures come to life, to tricks of stop-motion photography, there is a spirit in here that you cannot deny. It's at the same time strange and indecipherable but it's beautiful to look at and be in awe of as it pertains to the technical skill of a filmmaker that wants to tell a story in a manner not seen much nowadays. The trailer displays a technical talent which I hope, at the very least, can make up for the obfuscating story details.

I'll stay for the art but the film will only resonate beyond its running time if there's some humanity behind all the stop motion.






Munger Road Trailer

I'm chasing the dragon, I realize this.

Ever since Scream came into my life I've always been on the lookout for a movie that could be just as entertaining with the way it presented horror. The thing about Scream was that it was highly polished but had a keen sense of how to bring the death blows. The further it went on, and as sequels gave way to ludicrous set ups, the less exciting it became. I could never find something that came close to capturing that vibe but this, for some reason, got my attention.

For all the wrong reasons, with how basic the film looks, how common the plot is, this trailer works for me.

First and foremost, I'm giving this movie a couple of handicap strokes for simply being an independent film. There are some things that you just have to let slide and I'm more than amiable to allowing the video camera-style "footage" to be used in order to set things up as it pushes everything else into motion. As a first time director, Nicholas Smith gets a stroke or two as I'm liking its vibe.

Bruce Davison, who is a solid go-to guy when it comes to character acting, breathes a little bit of life into the questioning, pensive cop whp wants to get down to this mystery in town. Somehow his delivery in this trailer doesn't feel hackneyed as it does genuine. As well, the use of a single evening to compress everything and the absence of a tightly wound woman screaming out her lungs was very much appreciated.

What else I enjoyed was the trailer's dependance of real tension of the hunting and seeking out of this madman and not overly dependent on gore and gristle. The moments chosen here really do add to the sense this might actually be more than just your usual slasher film. From not going to the jump cut blitzkrieg of flashing dozens of scenes within seconds as a violin crescendos to silence route to just laying out the basic plot and leaving it at that I'm impressed by the restraint shown here. Plus, with it being fall, there's just something that's aesthetically right about a horror film that embraces this time of the season by setting it in this time of the year.





The Vinyl Frontier Trailer


The adulation of Olly Moss is something I completely get.

I feel bad that Moss' amazing poster designs will not ever adorn my walls but I share everyone's enthusiasm when it comes to collecting these things, these works of vibrant art.

Daniel Zana, the director of this project, looks like he has a handle on the subject, instead of looking at it from the perspective of an outsider looking at a subculture he appears to be steeped and informed of the scene that surrounds the fervor over these items.

The opening sequence succinctly shows you what this film is going to be about by essentially blowing through dozens of these figurines. While there isn't a single word spoken, you get it. It's understood.

There isn't a grand production budget as evidenced by the lo-fi quality of the interviews of those at the vanguard of this movement to create art that is both eye-popping, subversive, and wholly accessible. While people like myself have only been around this world tangentially, only being vaguely aware that these things exist, the trailer really puts an effort in establishing why this is important, why you should care about it, how passionate people get over these things, and why it would be worth to sit a while and take in its presentation.

It's artistry for the people and it's projects like this that get me excited when you consider how this represents the breakdown of barriers between artists and the people who want to consume their ideas, their creations.






Note bene: If you have any suggestions of trailers to possibly be              included in this column, even have a trailer of your own to       pitch,        please let me know by sending me a note at          Christopher_Stipp@yahoo.com

In case you missed them, here are the other trailers we covered at         /Film this week:


 
	The Deep Blue Sea Trailer [1] - A sad, broken love story that you just know won't end well? I'll be right there.
	Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey Trailer  [2]- Looks like one of the true feel-good movies of the year and there's nothing wrong with that.
	John Dies At The End Trailer [3] -I would actually like to see this. Seems to have a certain style and zip all its own.
	One For The Money Trailer [4] - I can't believe someone wrote a check with a whole lot of zeroes at the end of it to make this pile.
	Sleepless Night Trailer [5] - Looks absolutely nuts and I'm looking forward to it.
	New Year's Eve Trailer #2 [6] - I'd rather have a ramrod plunged into the small of my back than to see one frame of this film.
	Paranormal Activity 3 Trailer #2 [7] - I'm not sure about the movie but this trailer manages to be interesting and exciting. Color me impressed.
	6 Days To Air Trailer [8] - To watch this beehive move at the clip that it does is to witness true creative energy at work.
	Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Trailer [9] - I see nothing but emotional manipulation if I were to enter a pact to see this film. Not interested.
	The Thing International Trailer [10] - I know this film is completely unnecessary but I like this version of the trailer simply for how in-depth it gets with the actual gore. 2 points Russia.
	I Melt With You Trailer [11] - This is a great trailer, flat out. If it's hiding a truly horrible film, one of the worst of the year, then whoever made this needs an extra pack of Skittles in his paycheck.

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

A couple weeks back, we reported [2] that Kevin Costner had pulled out of talks for a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained due to scheduling conflicts. While it wasn't a huge blow for the project, it was disappointing news nonetheless. But the project is moving forward quickly, and it seems Kurt Russell could be stepping into the part that would've been Costner's.

Also joining the cast is Laura Cayouette, who had a minor role as Rocket in Kill Bill. More details after the jump.

Set in the 19th century, Tarantino's spaghetti Western-style latest follows a freed slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with a German dentist-turned bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) in order to free Django's wife from an evil plantation owner. Leonardo DiCaprio is also set to star as villain Calvin Candie, while Samuel L. Jackson is signed on to play Candie's head house slave Stephen. Dennis Christopher has also recently boarded [3] the project, in the role of Candie's attorney Leo Moguy.

TheWrap [4] reports that Russell may already be lined up for the part of Ace Woody, Candie's sadistic right-hand man. One of Woody's jobs is to train slaves for combat, as Candie and his friends enjoy watching them fight to the death for his amusement. According to The Hollywood Reporter [5], Cayouette will play Candie's widowed sister, who co-owns his plantation.

Russell and Tarantino have collaborated previously on 2007's Death Proof, in which Russell starred the bad guy, aging stunt double "Stuntman" Mike.

We'll no doubt continue hearing casting updates as the film gears up to enter production within the next month or so. One of the more crucial roles that still need to be cast is that of Broomhilda, Django's wife. Plus, we've still got our fingers crossed that Tarantino will find something to do [6] with The Wire's Michael K. Williams...

Django Unchained is scheduled [7] to drop Christmas Day 2012.

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

Marvel Studios had quite a big summer this year, with Thor, X-Men: First Class, and Captain America: The First Avenger all opening within three months of each other. And we already know they've got an equally huge 2012 lined up as well, with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, The Amazing Spider-Man, and of course, The Avengers all slated for next year. But what comes after that? After the jump, read about the studio's plans for 2013 and beyond, which include the previously announced Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 as well as some more unexpected projects.

io9 [2] has the story on Marvel's next moves, via a revealing sidebar from Entertainment Weekly. The first few are projects we've already known about, and EW doesn't really offer anything we didn't already know.

	Iron Man 3 is still on track to hit in May 2013, with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang writer Shane Black still attached to direct.
	Thor 2 is expected to enter production in April. As we've previously reported [3], Patty Jenkins (Monster) is in talks to direct.
	The long-gestating Ant-Man is still "definitely in the works," though it remains "nebulous" at this point. Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige says that Edgar Wright has "developed an excellent draft recently," which we assume is the same one he's been working on [4] with Attack the Block writer/director Joe Cornish for some time.

Now, the next two are where it gets interesting.

	Feige corroborates an earlier rumor [5] that a Guardians of the Galaxy movie is in the works. The superhero team, which originally premiered in 1969 and was rebooted in 2008, consists of interstellar warriors who are the last of his or her kind. Founded by Star-Lord, they work to protect the galaxy in a "proactive" manner.  "There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which Thor sort of hints at, in the cosmic side of the [Marvel] universe," says Feige.
	The article also confirms reports [6] of a film based on the Inhumans, a race of evolutionary advanced beings who are the result of experiments performed on humans by an alien species called the Kree. The intention was to create super soldiers that the Kree could use to fight the Skrulls, but the test subjects were eventually abandoned to their own galactic kingdom.

Feige says that if either the Guardians of the Galaxy or the Inhumans become a movie, we should expect an ensemble piece a la the X-Men or the Avengers.

Here's the scan of the original article, via Comic Book Movie [7]:

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

We've already got a fairly good idea of what David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will look like, thanks to all those previously released photos [2], trailers [3], and whatnot [4], but since everything has looked pretty damn stunning so far, we're more than happy to flip through a few more pictures. Empire Magazine has unveiled some gorgeous new promo pics of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in character in their latest issue. See Blomkvist (Craig) keeping his cool while handcuffed to a chair, Lisbeth (Mara) hanging out with her space heater, and the two of them sharing a smoky moment after the jump.

[via First Showing [5]]

Check out that intensity -- the photos serve as an excellent reminder of why this is one of our most highly anticipated releases of the winter movie season. Craig looks tough here, but Mara looks downright badass. I wasn't sure what to think when Fincher originally handed [6] her the role, since I hadn't seen her in too films up to that point. But judging by the images and video we've seen so far, I'd say he definitely made the right choice. She looks every bit as fierce as Noomi Rapace did playing the same character in the 2009 Swedish adaptation, which is high praise indeed. Still more scans from the issue, which include some actual set photos as well as these promotional images, can be found here [7].

Based on the first volume of Stieg Larsson's phenomenally popular Millennium trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) as he tries to solve a decades-old mystery about the missing niece of retired CEO Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). His investigation leads him to cross paths with Lisbeth Salander (Mara), a fierce young hacker. Stellan Skarsgård, Robin Wright, and Embeth Davidtz also star in the movie, directed by Academy Award nominee Fincher and scripted by Steven Zaillian. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo hits theaters December 21, 2011.

		<description><![CDATA[ [1]

Marc Guggenheim, who co-wrote this summer's Green Lantern, has signed on to write and produce a new original project for Disney titled Time Zones. The sci-fi fantasy adventure unfolds in a universe in which a spontaneous event has created fractures in the space-time continuum. As a result, the world has developed "time zones," so that, for example, "it might be 1750 in France, 300 B.C. in China and 2065 in New York." More details after the jump.

The Hollywood Reporter [2] writes that the story will center around a man who figures out that since he can now move through time simply by traveling around the world, he can go back into the past and save his life's wife. The mission reunites him with his estranged daughter.

Green Lantern aside, Guggenheim's previous experience has been primarily in television, on shows including Law &#38; Order, Brothers &#38; Sisters, and Eli Stone. However, he's been gravitating toward film work as of late. He is co-writing [3] the script for The Flash, which has been percolating in some form or other for quite some time [4], and has put together a script outline [5] with Green Lantern co-writers Greg Berlanti and Michael Green for Green Lantern 2. However, it'll be some time before we see either of those projects, and it's uncertain whether the Green Lantern sequel will proceed with the current outline or scrap it and start fresh.

In addition to those comic book movies, Guggenheim also has another film in development with Disney. Earlier this week, the studio picked up his untitled project [6] with screenwriter Ashley Bradley, about a young female detective who is the descendant of another legendary sleuth. Disney seems to have a thing for female detectives at the moment -- the studio also has a younger, more contemporary adaptation [7] of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novels in the works.

Time Zones will be produced by Mark Gordon, whose past credits include Speed, Criminal Minds, and Grey's Anatomy. The new project falls under Gordon's first-look deal with Disney, which he signed back in April.

FX's American Horror Story won't debut until next week, but it's already been getting some intriguing buzz. The premise sounds normal enough: Connie Britton, Dylan McDermott, and Taissa Farmiga star as the Harmon family, who relocate from Boston to a haunted house in Los Angeles; Jessica Lange plays their neighbor. However, early reviews have indicated that it's outrageously over-the-top and very, very weird in its execution. Which, actually, shouldn't come as a surprise seeing as it comes from the minds of Glee and Nip/Tuck creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuck.

After the jump, check out the first five minutes of the show. It looks like pretty standard horror movie stuff here, but Murphy, who directed the pilot, does a fine job of setting up an eerie mood.

The clip, which is set in 1978, doesn't show any of the main cast. However, it does offer a good long look at the house at the center of the story. In the scene, two bratty young boys decide to explore the abandoned property -- but as they begin to notice animal corpses and human heads pickled in jars, they realize they're getting more than they bargained for. Oh, if only they'd listened to the warnings of the creepy little girl out front!

American Horror Story doesn't sound like the kind of thing that'll appeal to everyone -- Monkey See [3] calls it "a sex-filled gorefest," which is the kind of description that either really appeals to you or turns you off completely -- but it sounds worth checking out for its uniquely bizarre sensibilities. Say what you will about the later seasons of Glee and Nip/Tuck, but the beginnings of both those shows prove that when Murphy and Falchuck are on, they can create some of most addictively offbeat television out there.

American Horror Story kicks off Wednesday, October 5 at 10 PM. The series also stars Frances Conroy, Denis O'Hare, Evan Peters, and Alexandra Breckenridge.

Now, the time has finally arrived that you might actually be excited about a Twilight movie...

Warner Bros is in talks with Christopher Nolan, Michael Bay, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men), Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and David Yates (Harry Potter films) for a new movie adaptation of The Twilight Zone. The 1983 Twilight Zone movie was presented as an anthology, each of the four stories helmed by A-list directors: Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Joe Dante and George Miller. Hollywood no longer likes the idea of an anthology film (note Warner Bros' handling of the highly praised 2007 horror anthology film Trick 'r Treat), so the new movie is one storyline, and will require a single director.



Variety [1] reports that there is "mutual interest is brewing between WB and at least three individuals" listed above, although talks with Yates have "waned". Nolan is said to be the front runner for the project, and has a great relationship with the studio -- so its his for the taking if he wants it (also note Leonardo Dicaprio's involvement). Bay has been eager to direct [2] a lower budget passion project, Pain &#38; Gain, which he pushed back to helm Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Even though he is supossedly "high on the script", tt seems unlikely he would push that film back again.

First announced [3] in July 2009, with Leonardo DiCaprio's company Appian Way hiring Rand Ravich (writer/director of The Astronaut's Wife, producer of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) to pen a script. In October 2010, screenwriter Jason Rothenberg (whose lone credit is the TV movie Body Politic) was hired [4] to write a new draft of the film. Meanwhile, this Summer the Bureau of Moving Pictures picked up the life rights [5] to The Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, and is seeking to make his biopic, written by Wall Street writer Stanley Weiser and produced by Rod Serling's widow Carol Serling.

Previously from Russ:

The original five-season show The Twilight Zone ('59-'64) has been reborn in multiple incarnations: two additional television series, in 1985 and 2002, multiple book anthologies and comic books, a pinball machine (where the article's image originated) and a theatrically-released movie in 1983.

The original series, created, hosted and often written by Rod Serling, featured a mixture of original screenplays and stories adapted from authors like Richard Matheson, who also wrote many of the show's scripts. Remakes of episodes from the original series have dominated the brand since. The two televised revivals featured both new stories and remakes of classic episodes, and the 1983 feature had four stories, three of which were remakes of original episodes. So it's easy to assumed that Rand Ravich will go back to Rod Serling's well for some of his material. At this point, differentiating the name The Twilight Zone from Serling's influence and those original stories is almost impossible (And foolish -- Serling was the show's identity). Indeed, when so many other forms of sci-fi and unusual television storytelling have taken the series' ideas much further, returning to The Twilight Zone seems almost quaint.

That's leaving out the fact that the last time a Twilight Zone movie came to screens, things didn't work out so well. Three actors - Vic Morrow and two illegally-hired children - were killed when a setpiece involving a helicopter went horribly wrong on the set of the segment directed by John Landis. That makes an adaptation of the television series a loaded prospect, as an accident like that isn't something Hollywood ever forgets.

Watch some of the classic episodes from original seasons one, two and three at the CBS website [6].
