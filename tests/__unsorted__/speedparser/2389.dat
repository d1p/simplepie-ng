      <title>2. Sooth Your Pain</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/sooth-your-pain</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;So you got me loving you girl&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So many miles to see your face&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got a feeling I can’t change&lt;br /&gt;
And I don’t want to sound cliché&lt;br /&gt;
But my heart aches&lt;br /&gt;
Now I’m living inside your dreams&lt;br /&gt;
So if you find it hard to sleep&lt;br /&gt;
And if you’re feeling lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Just call me&lt;br /&gt;
You know my voice can sooth your pain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside my pillow I see your face&lt;br /&gt;
A recent memory I can’t erase&lt;br /&gt;
And I don’t want to sound passé&lt;br /&gt;
But I need your taste&lt;br /&gt;
And now you’re living inside my dreams&lt;br /&gt;
Your silhouette is enough for&lt;br /&gt;
So if you’re feeling the same way&lt;br /&gt;
Just call me&lt;br /&gt;
You know my voice can sooth your pain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just need a touch&lt;br /&gt;
Of your eyes that I miss so much&lt;br /&gt;
Your smile is all I need to survive&lt;br /&gt;
This loneliness inside&lt;br /&gt;
And don’t you worry about a thing now&lt;br /&gt;
Temptation might be all around me&lt;br /&gt;
But it’s not the same&lt;br /&gt;
So if you’re lonely&lt;br /&gt;
You know my voice can sooth your pain.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>3. Society Gates</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/society-gates</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Humanity is conformity&lt;br /&gt;
Conformity is society&lt;br /&gt;
Society is this reality&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The faces that saw me&lt;br /&gt;
And the angles that warned me&lt;br /&gt;
They told me to run&lt;br /&gt;
And dispose of the gun&lt;br /&gt;
I could have escaped&lt;br /&gt;
Be gone with no trace&lt;br /&gt;
Instead I just stayed&lt;br /&gt;
Within societies gates&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cos I can run but I can’t hide&lt;br /&gt;
And I must justify&lt;br /&gt;
The way I live my life&lt;br /&gt;
Until the day I die&lt;br /&gt;
I live within these gates&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot go against&lt;br /&gt;
So I must see it through&lt;br /&gt;
There’s nothing left to do&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They said I was crazy&lt;br /&gt;
And they called me a fool&lt;br /&gt;
But words cannot change me&lt;br /&gt;
And my respect for the rules&lt;br /&gt;
I may be part of the system&lt;br /&gt;
But if I could rule this land&lt;br /&gt;
The rules would be different&lt;br /&gt;
But I am just one man&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I wish I was under a tree&lt;br /&gt;
Far away from society&lt;br /&gt;
Where the only truth in me&lt;br /&gt;
Is the soothing sound of my own entity?&lt;br /&gt;
While my other voice is free&lt;br /&gt;
It expresses words of plea&lt;br /&gt;
To return to a stable form of reality&lt;br /&gt;
But I’m inside of that tree&lt;br /&gt;
That tree is inside of another tree&lt;br /&gt;
The perplexity is infinity&lt;br /&gt;
So I will just chill with a spliff&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can run but I can’t hide&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>4. Wandering Love</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/wandering-love</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Hickory dickory dock&lt;br /&gt;
The mouse ran up the clock&lt;br /&gt;
The clock struck one&lt;br /&gt;
The mouse ran down&lt;br /&gt;
Hickory dickory dock&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well I know it’s late and its probably fate&lt;br /&gt;
That I can’t get through to you&lt;br /&gt;
But I needed to hear your voice in my ear&lt;br /&gt;
To start my day a new&lt;br /&gt;
But your phone was off and I missed your calls&lt;br /&gt;
And now you’re fast asleep&lt;br /&gt;
So when you get up and you’re ready to rock&lt;br /&gt;
You can make my mobile beep&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make, make, make my mobile beep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The look in your eyes of gold&lt;br /&gt;
And the freshness inside of your soul&lt;br /&gt;
Takes a hold of my glance you’ve got me in trance&lt;br /&gt;
And you heat me up in the cold&lt;br /&gt;
The soothing sound of your voice&lt;br /&gt;
It speaks to my heart in rhyme&lt;br /&gt;
You lift me out of before to now&lt;br /&gt;
And you place me back in time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are a wandering love&lt;br /&gt;
From dusk till dawn&lt;br /&gt;
We are a wandering love&lt;br /&gt;
Like two kites in a storm&lt;br /&gt;
We are a wandering love&lt;br /&gt;
All day long&lt;br /&gt;
We are a wandering love and we can’t be torn&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make, make, make my mobile beep&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Red and yellow and pink and green&lt;br /&gt;
Orange and purple and blue&lt;br /&gt;
I can see a rainbow&lt;br /&gt;
See a rainbow too&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Red and yellow and pink and green&lt;br /&gt;
Orange and purple and blue&lt;br /&gt;
I can see a rainbow&lt;br /&gt;
And that rainbow is you.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>5. Fly With Me</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/fly-with-me</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Rest your head now little girl&lt;br /&gt;
You’re on your way now&lt;br /&gt;
Open your mind up to the sky&lt;br /&gt;
And fly away now&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve got nothing to prove&lt;br /&gt;
No one to hurt you&lt;br /&gt;
You got no one to pull you down push you around&lt;br /&gt;
Make you frown and cry&lt;br /&gt;
You are alone now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Waking up every day with a beam of the moonlight in my eye&lt;br /&gt;
Stimulate my consciousness with the focus of my mind&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got to take myself back to the feeling of eternally breaking free&lt;br /&gt;
Knowing that my body’s motionless and still asleep&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So fly with me&lt;br /&gt;
There’s a whole sky to see&lt;br /&gt;
I’m taking your mind with me&lt;br /&gt;
Into lucidity&lt;br /&gt;
Flying in unity&lt;br /&gt;
Could be normality&lt;br /&gt;
What you perceive to be&lt;br /&gt;
Is your reality&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reality is the concrete of our minds&lt;br /&gt;
Our own cities where the conscious streets unwind&lt;br /&gt;
In the centre of your world you have your sense of gravity&lt;br /&gt;
Just lay your head and put your eyes at ease&lt;br /&gt;
Create your life and the world that you perceive&lt;br /&gt;
In the centre of this world you have your own imaginary planetary universe&lt;br /&gt;
Fly with me…&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>6. Flow</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/flow</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Joined at the soul with a pair of headphones&lt;br /&gt;
We need nobody to let ourselves go&lt;br /&gt;
Always at my side as we rock a stage show&lt;br /&gt;
In an ocean of music we move with the flow&lt;br /&gt;
A hand in my hand I don’t wanna let go&lt;br /&gt;
A partner in life on this mean old road&lt;br /&gt;
We got the wind on our back that blows&lt;br /&gt;
We can’t drift apart we just move with the flow.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>7. Future</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/future</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Where is the future where is the past&lt;br /&gt;
Astronomy without technology cannot last&lt;br /&gt;
Solar system colonies, teleport machines&lt;br /&gt;
Imminent optimism grasped&lt;br /&gt;
We’re taking it back to our dreams&lt;br /&gt;
Full steam as we scheme into a future unseen&lt;br /&gt;
A blank canvas screen&lt;br /&gt;
We’re taking it shaking it making it gleam&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s scream…&lt;br /&gt;
And let me tell you about my dream&lt;br /&gt;
I want to evolve let me tell you what I mean&lt;br /&gt;
You see a nuclear weapons intention&lt;br /&gt;
Isn’t for protection but destruction&lt;br /&gt;
I’m betting that the invention has a function of selection&lt;br /&gt;
To determinate how much to exterminate&lt;br /&gt;
While the reserve gets paid&lt;br /&gt;
Come on give me a break&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s put our money into something that counts&lt;br /&gt;
Why all the bouts, when agony emphatically amounts&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s not fall behind&lt;br /&gt;
Peace on earth is evolution for man kind&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long division is a timely process&lt;br /&gt;
Subtract through the shadows and darkness&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply your movements to shine&lt;br /&gt;
Add all your thoughts to equal sublime&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve spent so many days and nights&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to walk this earth&lt;br /&gt;
And what I’ve realised is that this whole universe&lt;br /&gt;
Is trying to sympathise giving us a veer to purse&lt;br /&gt;
But we ain’t got no purpose so we just search an search&lt;br /&gt;
Blowing up the skies until the ozone bursts&lt;br /&gt;
Putting toxic waste up underneath the earth&lt;br /&gt;
We want to live longer, and still give birth&lt;br /&gt;
While all the information gets lost&lt;br /&gt;
I only ever here one song on the radio&lt;br /&gt;
And all the false reality on those TV shows&lt;br /&gt;
So I just hit my pedal let the bass lines flow&lt;br /&gt;
Open your mind or I’ll show you the door just,&lt;br /&gt;
Shut your eyes so your soul doesn’t know&lt;br /&gt;
Shuffle your feet on the dance floor&lt;br /&gt;
Let yourself go, show the bare minimal&lt;br /&gt;
Love is sublime and not subliminal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long division is a timely process&lt;br /&gt;
Subtract through the shadows and darkness&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply your movements to shine&lt;br /&gt;
Add all your thought to equal sublime&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>8. Love Someone</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/love-someone</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;It’s possible to love someone&lt;br /&gt;
And not treat them in the way that you want&lt;br /&gt;
It’s possible to see your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
Be the devil in disguise with another front&lt;br /&gt;
And, it’s possible to change this world&lt;br /&gt;
Revolutionise the boys and girls&lt;br /&gt;
It’s possible to educate&lt;br /&gt;
The next generation that will rule the world someday&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The changing times of the 21st century&lt;br /&gt;
Means nothing to me cos I would rather be&lt;br /&gt;
At the beginning of time, earth would be mine&lt;br /&gt;
Living in luxury&lt;br /&gt;
Discovering a world out there&lt;br /&gt;
Believing in the sun earth water and air&lt;br /&gt;
Take me there so I could see the world bloom&lt;br /&gt;
Standing on a sea cliff howling at the moon&lt;br /&gt;
Creating a world for the open minded&lt;br /&gt;
A unique perception of truth inside it&lt;br /&gt;
I know we could find it&lt;br /&gt;
It’s just a matter of where and when we collectively decide it&lt;br /&gt;
The world is not a vicious place&lt;br /&gt;
It’s just the way we’ve been raised&lt;br /&gt;
Discovering time and space&lt;br /&gt;
I know that we could make a change&lt;br /&gt;
Rearrange the way that we appreciate the world today&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s possible to love someone..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now as i start to put my mind into words&lt;br /&gt;
I stall I fall I’m loosing it all, my inhibitions&lt;br /&gt;
The thought of wasting a way&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that the music’s at a place not far away&lt;br /&gt;
Yet I stray and stick to my world&lt;br /&gt;
In love with my life my beliefs and a girl&lt;br /&gt;
Is it luck that I love this crazy place, the human race?&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t get me wrong I still think we could change&lt;br /&gt;
But this life and the fact that time exists&lt;br /&gt;
And were here and we don’t come equipped with it all&lt;br /&gt;
Half the fun is learning and I’m having a ball&lt;br /&gt;
While the world keeps turning my role is small&lt;br /&gt;
But I’ll make a change&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you’re feeling the same way&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you’re seeing what I say&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s possible to love someone..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this concrete jungle we live&lt;br /&gt;
Our survival is love that we give&lt;br /&gt;
Now my instinct is guiding my way&lt;br /&gt;
It’s true what they say&lt;br /&gt;
The world is your chance to create&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>9. Intensions</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/intensions</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;My intentions have never been bad&lt;br /&gt;
I try to make others celebrate&lt;br /&gt;
I forgot the times i was ever sad&lt;br /&gt;
But mainly the times of hate&lt;br /&gt;
Its funny how much can happen&lt;br /&gt;
But things will stay the same&lt;br /&gt;
Then life will turn a corner&lt;br /&gt;
And decisions turn up made&lt;br /&gt;
So I sing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sun comes up but my head is low&lt;br /&gt;
I’m still in bed cos the world is cold&lt;br /&gt;
Everything is a daze to me so i fly into outer space&lt;br /&gt;
The moon above has a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;
I’m flying over the streets I know&lt;br /&gt;
And everything that I used to see has gone&lt;br /&gt;
To another place&lt;br /&gt;
Now I can’t help but feel a sudden anger in me&lt;br /&gt;
Starting from my stomach and rising up within me&lt;br /&gt;
It’s taking over my life making me feel so dizzy&lt;br /&gt;
Making me look at the news as if its one big conspiracy&lt;br /&gt;
I see the truth an I feel the lies&lt;br /&gt;
But so many different views in so many different eyes&lt;br /&gt;
Make us paralysed, where all so hypnotized&lt;br /&gt;
From all the fluorides and chem. trails up in the skies&lt;br /&gt;
They want to dumb us down just because they’re scared of us&lt;br /&gt;
They know that if we band together we can rise above&lt;br /&gt;
They feed us lies on the telly cos so many trust&lt;br /&gt;
That the UN’s agenda actually cares about us&lt;br /&gt;
But I know better, you see it’s all about to end&lt;br /&gt;
A worldwide suicide fashion trend&lt;br /&gt;
We like to look pretty and we want to all pretend&lt;br /&gt;
But the truth is something nobody can comprehend&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sun come up but my head is low…&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>10. Step On My Trip</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/step-on-my-trip</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Confused abused&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve overused my walking shoes&lt;br /&gt;
I never turn back cos i know the score&lt;br /&gt;
I never reuse what i do before&lt;br /&gt;
But it’s too late, my fate&lt;br /&gt;
I regurgitate all the words that i say&lt;br /&gt;
Listen up don’t miss the fall&lt;br /&gt;
But just pick it up now off the floor&lt;br /&gt;
And guess who, yeah you&lt;br /&gt;
You’re the ones that I’m talking too&lt;br /&gt;
Your never going to guess what’s coming next&lt;br /&gt;
Let your mind inside what i manifest&lt;br /&gt;
But inside this rhyme you will find my mind&lt;br /&gt;
Just sip my crazy lips and step on my trip&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step on my trip&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got, no pecks to flex&lt;br /&gt;
All day long i dream about sex&lt;br /&gt;
But I’m impotent and now I’ve seen mi arse&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t remember when i got it up last&lt;br /&gt;
I stink, i need a drink&lt;br /&gt;
Role another spliff to help me think&lt;br /&gt;
I’m living on the road just like a gypsy&lt;br /&gt;
Cos staying in one place fucking shits me&lt;br /&gt;
Sunshine, moonshine&lt;br /&gt;
Change the way that i would read your mind&lt;br /&gt;
Living inside this solar flux&lt;br /&gt;
Where all trapped in a perpetual paradox&lt;br /&gt;
But your here I’m near&lt;br /&gt;
They way that i flow is all so clear&lt;br /&gt;
Just sip my crazy lips and… step on my trip…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The words in my mind that i see&lt;br /&gt;
Flow out of me easily&lt;br /&gt;
So easily that my mind is free&lt;br /&gt;
To blaze up your mind with my fantasy&lt;br /&gt;
Cos when i get on this mic&lt;br /&gt;
I’m flowing so awfully tight,&lt;br /&gt;
So awfully tight that my rhymes are like&lt;br /&gt;
The claw of a tiger that’s ready to strike&lt;br /&gt;
Now when i get on the street&lt;br /&gt;
Creating a brand new beat&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to come up and meet me&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be shy cos you could never distract me&lt;br /&gt;
When negative vibes attack me,&lt;br /&gt;
Get into my mind and hack me&lt;br /&gt;
I act like nothing’s happening&lt;br /&gt;
Their aint no way to stop me&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>
&lt;i&gt;I’ve got my eyes open wide to the ceiling&lt;br /&gt;
I’m lying on my back in the centre of a room&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got a voice giving me a funny feeling&lt;br /&gt;
Its telling me the world’s going to end real soon&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got to get a job otherwise I’m unappealing&lt;br /&gt;
Do my little dance for the man and consume&lt;br /&gt;
So i let my energy build for the healing&lt;br /&gt;
So i can reign down with my super sonic boom&lt;br /&gt;
I’m held down by a fog on my way to the top&lt;br /&gt;
All clouded and the pressure won’t rise&lt;br /&gt;
I’m on a mission to the sky with the stars in my eyes&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the weather won’t compromise&lt;br /&gt;
Like a ball on a chain that is strapped to my brain&lt;br /&gt;
I’m a prisoner inside of my dreams&lt;br /&gt;
So i will appreciate the future of a day&lt;br /&gt;
Where the clouds open up and scream&lt;br /&gt;
And i sing now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I aint gonna spend my time wandering why i never made it&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve already made it&lt;br /&gt;
I aint gonna spend my days thinking about why i never made it&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like the pages of a novel at the bottom of a shelf&lt;br /&gt;
I grow stiff yet i keep my pride&lt;br /&gt;
Like the one raindrop in the centre of a rose&lt;br /&gt;
I’m in heaven with a world outside&lt;br /&gt;
Like another metaphor to describe my vibe&lt;br /&gt;
I’m just a vessel for my conscious needs&lt;br /&gt;
So i will appreciate the future of a day&lt;br /&gt;
Where the clouds open up and scream&lt;br /&gt;
And i sing now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I aint gonna spend my time…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its times like this i need to lose my inhibitions&lt;br /&gt;
Raise my fist and forget about decisions&lt;br /&gt;
Help assist in the party that im giving&lt;br /&gt;
Take on the vibe and soon you will be singing&lt;br /&gt;
That its times like this ya need to lose your inhibitions&lt;br /&gt;
Just raise your fist and forget about decisions&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll help assist in that party that we’re giving&lt;br /&gt;
Take on the vibe and soon ya will be singing&lt;br /&gt;
I aint gonna spend my time wandering why, i never made it&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve already made it.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>12. Not Cool</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/not-cool</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Now, let me begin but letting you in&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got a way about getting up and doing my thing&lt;br /&gt;
See i could never front and act like something I’m not&lt;br /&gt;
Talking about cribs and cars that i haven’t really got&lt;br /&gt;
But i can tell you this I’m gonad change your mind&lt;br /&gt;
From my persuasive energy that i project through the rhyme&lt;br /&gt;
See, it’s all about doing what ya need to do&lt;br /&gt;
To get where ya wanna go&lt;br /&gt;
And be who ya wanna be&lt;br /&gt;
But don’t relax; it won’t come to you,&lt;br /&gt;
Cos theirs a million other cats out competing with you&lt;br /&gt;
But not doin it the same way&lt;br /&gt;
Ya see, seeing the world through different eyes is your gateway&lt;br /&gt;
A special gift from your consciousness an individual-ness&lt;br /&gt;
For you to rock to this&lt;br /&gt;
A little kiss from an emptiness for you to bop to this for you to jump to this&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not cool i just pretend I am&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not a fool but yet I say I am&lt;br /&gt;
I’m old school cos i know I am&lt;br /&gt;
Rocking the mike every night&lt;br /&gt;
In my jimmy jams&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
so let me pursue and give much respect to&lt;br /&gt;
The rhyme in my mind that i find for you&lt;br /&gt;
I let it All hang out I got my heart my sleeve&lt;br /&gt;
I let the clock count down like it was New Years Eve&lt;br /&gt;
It don’t affect me, cos i play my game&lt;br /&gt;
I got my own set of rules and its nothing strange&lt;br /&gt;
I’m just a humble soul on the side of the street&lt;br /&gt;
Making my own tunes with my voice and my feet&lt;br /&gt;
Ye I’m living day by day&lt;br /&gt;
Like a nomad stumbling on out of his cave&lt;br /&gt;
i celebrate the sun i live my life for the earth&lt;br /&gt;
i let the rain come down on my endless search&lt;br /&gt;
i never quit, I’m planting seed by seed&lt;br /&gt;
I’m evolutionising to try and save my breed&lt;br /&gt;
I’m just a cog in the machine&lt;br /&gt;
A part of the process, im here to express&lt;br /&gt;
That we need some progress&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not cool…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And now I’m changing my point of view&lt;br /&gt;
Everything i know and everything i knew&lt;br /&gt;
It’s all about to change we’re in a new age&lt;br /&gt;
It’s golden and pure and true&lt;br /&gt;
Me don’t listen to the words they say&lt;br /&gt;
One too many lies in the media today&lt;br /&gt;
I focus on my mind i focus on my health&lt;br /&gt;
I try to stay true to my self&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now let me begin by letting you in&lt;br /&gt;
As you know I’m about to rip it up again&lt;br /&gt;
I aint hard to please I’m not the type to fight&lt;br /&gt;
But if you lie to my face then you aint so bright&lt;br /&gt;
See I, I’m an out and about sort&lt;br /&gt;
You may have seen me on public transport&lt;br /&gt;
I’m famous, for pulling my pants down&lt;br /&gt;
And doing all the silly things that make you frown&lt;br /&gt;
But you can giggle with me&lt;br /&gt;
It aint a riddle you see&lt;br /&gt;
I’m just making fun of life with the perspective of a tree&lt;br /&gt;
so you can speed on up accelerate or overtake me&lt;br /&gt;
but feel free to come up and take a leaf&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
im not cool&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>13. Love Me Or Not</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/love-me-or-not</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;You could love me or not&lt;br /&gt;
But either way I’ve got to&lt;br /&gt;
Wake up to face another day tomorrow morning&lt;br /&gt;
You could love me or not&lt;br /&gt;
But either way I’ve got the sunrise looking in my eyes&lt;br /&gt;
And i know i could love you or not&lt;br /&gt;
But either way you’ve got to&lt;br /&gt;
Wake up to face another day tomorrow morning&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not getting used to my new solitude&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve still got a photo in my wallet of you&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got to stop my self&lt;br /&gt;
From picking up the phone and just calling you&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got to keep my emotions together and forever&lt;br /&gt;
So don’t be afraid&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t erase memories with the actions i seize&lt;br /&gt;
And I can not erase your smiles and your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
With your hair in the breeze&lt;br /&gt;
And the only way for me to move on&lt;br /&gt;
Is to write it in a song that life goes on&lt;br /&gt;
And I’m kicked off this earth&lt;br /&gt;
With no one to hold its getting cold and my chest hurts&lt;br /&gt;
You could love me or not…&lt;br /&gt;
What will the world bring?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve got to be strong&lt;br /&gt;
Your story goes on and on&lt;br /&gt;
Even though our page is gone&lt;br /&gt;
Cos theirs a world out there&lt;br /&gt;
And even though it aint fair&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve got to not be scared cos i swear&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll always be true to you&lt;br /&gt;
Forgetting your smiles and eyes i could never do&lt;br /&gt;
Your love is skin deep with me&lt;br /&gt;
You could never be replaced&lt;br /&gt;
Even though you know my heart is free&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be afraid….&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>14. Time Will Tell</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/time-will-tell</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;I can’t even express the thought of in excess&lt;br /&gt;
And all the love for all my angels&lt;br /&gt;
And friendship which enables&lt;br /&gt;
Prosperity and good will&lt;br /&gt;
For the cup of life will spill&lt;br /&gt;
And bring us a new dawn&lt;br /&gt;
To which we feel reborn&lt;br /&gt;
And all the vibe of all the colours&lt;br /&gt;
And intellectual muller’s&lt;br /&gt;
Who read all the above&lt;br /&gt;
And feed off all our&lt;br /&gt;
Will turn their cries to sing&lt;br /&gt;
Not taken under wing&lt;br /&gt;
For now we surely know&lt;br /&gt;
Our peace will always grow&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I always thought that it would be an illusion&lt;br /&gt;
But only time will tell, only time will tell&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t even express, the thought of emptiness&lt;br /&gt;
And all the people who are around me&lt;br /&gt;
And things that you will soon see&lt;br /&gt;
The spirits of my domain&lt;br /&gt;
Will never stay the same again&lt;br /&gt;
Until we surely find a peace that more inclined&lt;br /&gt;
And all the vibe of all the colours&lt;br /&gt;
And intellectual muller’s&lt;br /&gt;
Who read all the above&lt;br /&gt;
And feed off all our&lt;br /&gt;
Will turn their cries to sing&lt;br /&gt;
Not taken under wing&lt;br /&gt;
For now we surely know&lt;br /&gt;
Our peace will always grow&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forever changing my mind is rearranging&lt;br /&gt;
My words are contemplating&lt;br /&gt;
And my thoughts are always skating&lt;br /&gt;
Around and around I cannot here a sound&lt;br /&gt;
The words are blocked out&lt;br /&gt;
And my feet aint left the ground&lt;br /&gt;
So I stop, I think, I really need a drink&lt;br /&gt;
And just before I blink I realise I’m jinxed&lt;br /&gt;
I lose my inhibition I need another mission&lt;br /&gt;
You will never catch me bitching&lt;br /&gt;
As I rock out in the kitchen&lt;br /&gt;
I await my date I need to hesitate&lt;br /&gt;
Do think I got it easy cos its handed on a plate&lt;br /&gt;
Too late, my fate this world aint full of hate&lt;br /&gt;
And that is all I have to say as I deliberate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forever moving my bodies always grooving&lt;br /&gt;
The sounds are always soothing&lt;br /&gt;
And my heart is always using&lt;br /&gt;
The love that I feel when I bounce in time&lt;br /&gt;
I’m free like a bird in the sunshine&lt;br /&gt;
I crouch down to the sound if I like the bass&lt;br /&gt;
I put my hands in the air and I scrunch up my face&lt;br /&gt;
I dance till my legs get weaker&lt;br /&gt;
To the rhythm that I here from the speaker&lt;br /&gt;
I’m a school teacher&lt;br /&gt;
When I jump on the mic&lt;br /&gt;
I’m nursery rhyming while riding my bike&lt;br /&gt;
If we do show and tell you can show me what you like&lt;br /&gt;
We can play all day in that rainbow light&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to be my friend and bounce around with me&lt;br /&gt;
You got to spread that love with positivity&lt;br /&gt;
You got to bend the bend the boundaries of reality&lt;br /&gt;
And finally together we can be free&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>1. The Rain Is Gone</title>
      <link>http://dubfx.bandcamp.com/track/the-rain-is-gone</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Well I woke up this morning&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn’t believe my eyes&lt;br /&gt;
I opened up a window in my mind&lt;br /&gt;
And I saw that the rain was gone&lt;br /&gt;
The rain is gone&lt;br /&gt;
Ye the rain is gone&lt;br /&gt;
I could see all the colours of the trees&lt;br /&gt;
They were smiling at me&lt;br /&gt;
Well a rainbow symbolised the sun had come&lt;br /&gt;
And that the rain,&lt;br /&gt;
Ye the rain is gone..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To many people out there&lt;br /&gt;
Have got the rain in their minds&lt;br /&gt;
And it’s clogging up the sunshine&lt;br /&gt;
Yes indeed, with the warmth of the sunray&lt;br /&gt;
We could have a better place&lt;br /&gt;
For the children to play&lt;br /&gt;
Won’t you see out there&lt;br /&gt;
Look out the window&lt;br /&gt;
It doesn’t take a genius to realise&lt;br /&gt;
That when the rain is gone&lt;br /&gt;
There’s a smile on your face..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can see the sun&lt;br /&gt;
I can see the sun light&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rain is gone…&lt;br /&gt;
(Flower Fairy sings)&lt;br /&gt;
The sun has got his hat on hip hip hip hip hooray&lt;br /&gt;
The sun has got his hat on and his coming out to play&lt;br /&gt;
The sun has got his hat on hip hip hip hip hooray&lt;br /&gt;
The sun has got his hat on and his coming out to stay&lt;/i&gt;
