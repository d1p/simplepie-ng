But what was that lyric?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You put your arms around me and hold"?&lt;br /&gt;"You put your arms around me and fall"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't make it out, and there sure are a lot of songs out there about arms doing hugging-like things... but I got lucky:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Christina Perry singing "Arms" and the lyric is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You put your arms around me and I'm home."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is beautifully poetic... but since she turns "and I'm home" into one melodic syllable it's really hard to figure out what she's singing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can Google "Christina Perry Arms" and see what you can come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're welcome. :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-9119637202411443433?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/9119637202411443433/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=9119637202411443433" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/9119637202411443433" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/9119637202411443433" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/ZpzGFboy01g/put-your-arms-around-me-lyrics.html" title="&quot;Put Your Arms Around Me&quot; lyrics" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2011/07/put-your-arms-around-me-lyrics.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-2538012912589102792</id><published>2011-07-14T00:12:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2011-07-14T00:49:17.186-05:00</updated><title type="text">When comments go bad</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm so angry at the StarTribune.com comment process, I could spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what I get for bothering to engage on their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was Paul Walsh's story about the &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/west/125408448.html"&gt;Farmers Airship arriving in the Twin Cities&lt;/a&gt; (lifted from the AirshipVentures.com press release) that got me interested in watching the landing with my daughters. In the article, Walsh wrote that "In a nod to its sponsor, the airship is scheduled to pass over the Farmers Insurance regional headquarters in Bloomington."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know where that is, Google the phrase and you'll find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?&amp;amp;cid=14673487912694924028"&gt;http://maps.google.com/maps/place?&amp;amp;cid=14673487912694924028&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That office is easy to find; it's at the corner of 494 and 100 which, to my non-local readers, is a major intersection north of the Flying Cloud airport where the airship was heading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We watched the tracking site from our home in Eagan and I left with my girls at what seemed like a reasonable time, and saw the ship in the distant sky to our south-west. That meant that we should head up 77 to west-bound 494 and meet up with it at Hwy. 100. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, it didn't go there. It stayed south and went straight to the Flying Cloud airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Walsh then updated his Star Tribune story to the present-tense without changing the planned fly-over or noting that it didn't happen, saying, "In a nod to its sponsor, the airship passed over the Farmers Insurance regional headquarters in Bloomington."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't, it didn't, it didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don't mean "I expected it to fly so close that they could drop a beanbag out the window and onto the roof." I mean that it was nowhere near Bloomington, as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wrote that in a comment on the StarTribune.com site that night:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;emlarson Jul. 12, 11 8:55 PM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't usually complain about news articles, but as far as I know the Farmers Airship didn't go anywhere near the "Bloomington headquarters." I can understand that this morning's article was just pulled from the press release and they might have intended to fly there... but to just switch that poetically phrased plan into the past tense and write "In a nod to its sponsor, the airship passed over the Farmers Insurance regional headquarters in Bloomington" (which has to be the district office at 494 and 100) is just downright wrong and means we have a news story misrepresenting the facts of an event. Not cool. (I know it wasn't there, because I swung north and cut across 494 with my kids as we ran late and drove west, hoping that we could catch a glimpse of it before it landed. No luck because, as far as I can tell, it actually came straight across Burnsville and Savage up to Flying Cloud.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, there were promotional spots on the morning news shows and the zeppelin started flying back-and-forth between Flying Cloud airport and downtown Minneapolis. That's what prompted this comment from "bigj111":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;bigj111 Jul. 13, 11 11:50 AM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;emlarson: "I know it wasn't there, because I swung north and cut across 494 with my kids as we ran late and drove west, hoping that we could catch a glimpse of it before it landed. No luck because, as far as I can tell, it actually came straight across Burnsville and Savage up to Flying Cloud"-----In fact, you ARE wrong. I watched it out my office window near Hwy 100 this morning. Get yourself a new map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;See the problem here? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airship Ventures sends a press release saying they're coming to the Twin Cities and plan to fly over sponsor's headquarters as they arrive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newspaper reporter quotes that verbatim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zeppelin arrives late and avoids sponsor's headquarters by several miles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newspaper reporter simply updates now-inaccurate schedule to the present-tense without verifying that it happened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commenter points out this error that evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;next morning&lt;/em&gt;, Airship Ventures does fly over the headquarters. &lt;strong&gt;The scheduled event did happen, but not on the schedule that Paul Walsh said it did&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;BigJ111 then lifts my comment from the night before, quotes me by name, mocks me with the insult of "Get yourself a new map," and puts my words in the context of that morning's zeppelin trips (which were completely different things on completely different days).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So, I wrote a comment on the StarTribune.com story pointing out that my concern was about the reported events of July 12th and the bigj111 sighting was the morning of July 13th, which are totally different days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Star Tribune chose to not publish that correction.&lt;/strong&gt; They published another comment made a couple hours after my comment, so it's not that they're not publishing anything on articles that are a day old. But, for some reason, they left mine unpublished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see if they publish my second attempt (which I re-wrote from scratch in case they didn't like some particular phrase or punctuation, not that I can imagine what might have been wrong with it). A few minutes ago they just updated the story with a video, so I know that there are at least night-owl interns working on it. But I doubt I'll be given the chance to clear my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what's my point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're talking about the basic facts of reporting a story. That's something near and dear to my heart. When someone attempts to correct the record, and is unjustly attacked for it... and is blocked from defending himself... &lt;strong&gt;what kind of platform is a business building for itself&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;Will I ever comment on the Star Tribune site again? Probably not under my own name. Not because I don't trust my own words, and not because I don't believe I can defend the facts, but because I don't trust the Star Tribune to allow its readers to defend themselves and I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; nobody from the Strib is coming to my defense in my place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this what "journalism" has come to?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-2538012912589102792?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/2538012912589102792/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=2538012912589102792" title="3 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/2538012912589102792" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/2538012912589102792" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/ljBCpAf60jE/when-comments-go-bad.html" title="When comments go bad" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>3</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2011/07/when-comments-go-bad.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-6524950594002636759</id><published>2011-05-14T22:43:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2011-05-14T22:43:25.834-05:00</updated><title type="text">Rascal T.

When I finished my M.A. in Human Resource Development (a field that you can steer in the "career coaching" or "instructional design" directions -- I went with the latter) I moved over to the Web and Media Services department as a Business Analyst, where I first encountered the Social Media Breakfast (and attended meeting #3).  I've attended off-and-on (mostly "on") ever since.   I've dabbled in all-things-web ever since Gopher (how's that for an obscure reference?) which explains the odd Kari Byron references on this particular blog; I mentioned her in passing once and checked my stats only to find that there were lots of geeks desperate for information on her, so I figured I'd have some fun with it... and it's still my #1 search result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also a Capricorn and like long walks on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And long sentences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my SMBMSP interest today was to see how we can move beyond (not "instead of" but "in addition to") the "typical" mobile conversation about retail sales and physical check-ins.  I totally "get it" for that kind of business relationship... &lt;strong&gt;But what about using mobile technology to mediate relationships that aren't "sales" oriented?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I'd argue, "donations to non-profits" is really just a different spin on "sales".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about building relationships through the mobile side of "social media"?  &lt;strong&gt;What about getting people more engaged in causes that they profess to value&lt;/strong&gt; -- and probably &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; value, if only they can be nudged in the right way at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Churches and other communities of faith relating to their members?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faculty connecting with their students... and students to each-other?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charities who want people to engage with them using more than their checkbooks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What does that look like?  Once people check-in with Foursquare or scan their QR code... &lt;strong&gt;then what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm the first to admit that maybe I'm asking the wrong question. Maybe the answer is, "Dude, you're talking about getting people to engage in relationships.  The tools are irrelevant; once there's a relationship there, it will be 'brokered' through a variety of technology and non-technology means and people will figure that out just fine."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.

Conversely, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;our college years were marked by an externally applied "demand" that we learn and grow&lt;/span&gt;; even if we didn't enjoy sitting through calculus class, we couldn't help ending that semester having been "changed" in some way.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Today, we no longer have a mandate of personal growth imposed on us&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Maybe it's just me, but I found this really profound.  Is this a key role for higher education today -- to "impose personal growth" on students?  Faculty have joked that we ought not underestimate the "value of custodial care" at a university; I think that the value of a structured "demand" to learn a specific curriculum carries quite a bit of weight, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My immediate reaction is a mental tangent on the topic of home-education -- a term that my parents preferred to the more common "&lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling" rel="wikipedia"&gt;home schooling&lt;/a&gt;" because the entire principle was one of self-direction, contrasted with the imposition of a "school" structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For highly self-motivated individuals, this is all fine... but for those of us who need a nudge at times, being left to explore on our own means we'll stagnate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, our question for next time will be "how do we improve self-motivation"...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="zemanta-related"&gt;&lt;h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em; margin: 1em 0pt 0pt;"&gt;Related articles&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;ul class="zemanta-article-ul"&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/category/self-discipline/"&gt;Self-Discipline&lt;/a&gt; (stevepavlina.com)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"&gt;&lt;a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Enhanced by Zemanta"&gt;&lt;img style="border: medium none; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=7f08f8bc-b83c-4c7e-8035-4566eb8ce7a9" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-9118569135155957507?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/9118569135155957507/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=9118569135155957507" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/9118569135155957507" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/9118569135155957507" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/r7kzIc4gWhk/college-as-mandatory-personal-growth.html" title="College as &quot;mandatory personal growth&quot;?" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/10/college-as-mandatory-personal-growth.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-645006020700815297</id><published>2010-10-28T08:37:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2010-10-28T09:04:23.447-05:00</updated><title type="text">Why isn't podcasting easier?</title><content type="html">My first podcast was recorded in 2005.  More than five years later... recording, editing and distributing a podcast isn't any easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't that a bit surprising?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've lamented the loss of &lt;a href="http://gigavox.com/platform/"&gt;GigaVox Audio Lite&lt;/a&gt;, which became &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://podango.com" title="Podango" rel="homepage"&gt;Podango&lt;/a&gt; ShowBuilder Lite, which became totally nonexistent.  I figured something would step up to take its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phone-to-podcast solutions came and went -- &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/gcast" title="Gcast" rel="crunchbase"&gt;Gcast&lt;/a&gt;, Garageband, etc.  I finally became excited about the idea again when I discovered that drop.io offered the service... only to find they discontinued it.  (The phone number reference still appears on accounts but it doesn't seem to do anything.)  The few I've come across so far (&lt;a href="http://uhaveaudio.com/"&gt;UHaveAudio.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ipadio.com/"&gt;ipadio&lt;/a&gt;.com -- which has nothing to do with the Apple iPad -- and &lt;a href="http://yodio.com/"&gt;Yodio.com&lt;/a&gt;) don't seem to match the ease/simplicity of Gcast -- nor do they have the posting speed.  (I don't want to have to wait a few hours to see if my call was successfully recorded.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="zemanta-img separator" style="clear: right; width: 250px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57746891@N00/263639044" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; display: block; float: right; clear: right;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/92/263639044_cda626aad2_m.jpg" alt="Paul Colligan" style="font-size: 0.8em; border: medium none;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="zemanta-img-attribution" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; clear: both; float: right;font-size:78%;" &gt;Paul Colligan image by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57746891@N00/263639044"&gt;Neezee&lt;/a&gt; via Flickr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Colligan offered PremiumCast.com which seemed to do some of the same things as ShowBuilder, but that's now become "&lt;a href="http://nanacast.com/"&gt;Nanacast&lt;/a&gt;" but from its &lt;a href="http://nanacast.com/docs/features/"&gt;features list&lt;/a&gt; I'm still having a hard time figuring out what it can do for "automatic show assembly".  And with it starting at $97 a month, it's not really good for the academic/hobbiest market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for what it's worth, years after I first mentioned it to Paul, both the &lt;a href="http://www.premiumcast.com/index.php?&amp;amp;req=doc&amp;amp;id=10007"&gt;PremiumCast terms of service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nanacast.com/index.php?&amp;amp;req=doc&amp;amp;id=10001"&gt;Nanacast terms of service&lt;/a&gt; still list as one of its "Restictions on Use" that "you may not (and may not authorize any other party to) ... (iii) hyper-link to this site, without the express prior written permission...."  I don't know about you, but if I'm offering a podcast at a site I should would like to be able to link to that site.  (I know that's not what they &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;, but that's what they &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;, and the fact it's still not fixed causes me to worry about what else might be lurking in the TOS...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured, "Maybe I can do the 'best of breed' thing and use multiple services, then combine those different feeds into one..." but the only tool around (other than the "running out of some guy's basement" level of developer service) is &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/pipes" title="Pipes" rel="crunchbase"&gt;Yahoo! Pipes&lt;/a&gt; and reports are that it's flaky.  In my experience, it works fine except that it won't sort the feeds by date and just tacks one onto the end of the next, which isn't very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there something out there that I'm missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="zemanta-related"&gt;&lt;h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em; margin: 1em 0pt 0pt;"&gt;Related articles&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;ul class="zemanta-article-ul"&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.socialmedia.biz/2009/09/28/premiumcast-making-money-from-podcasting/"&gt;Premiumcast: Making Money from Podcasting&lt;/a&gt; (socialmedia.biz)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2010/09/23/comparing-options-for-free-audio-recording-directly-to-the-web-ipadio-and-voisee/"&gt;Comparing options for free audio recording directly to the web: iPadio and Voisee&lt;/a&gt; (speedofcreativity.org)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"&gt;&lt;a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Enhanced by Zemanta"&gt;&lt;img style="border: medium none; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=3fc60647-bcf1-4878-b75c-6489f52dabd3" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-645006020700815297?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/645006020700815297/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=645006020700815297" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/645006020700815297" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/645006020700815297" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/CtU_f14isnM/why-isnt-podcasting-easier.html" title="Why isn't podcasting easier?" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/92/263639044_cda626aad2_t.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/10/why-isnt-podcasting-easier.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-2140175179848412292</id><published>2010-08-23T11:46:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-23T12:09:21.081-05:00</updated><title type="text">Still trying to collect my life</title><content type="html">I mentioned in passing on a recent &lt;a href="http://www.ericast.com/"&gt;Ericast&lt;/a&gt; that I've owned emlarson.com "since 2002".  I have... but I bought it in December of 2000 so I've owned it for longer than that.  Why was "2002" stuck in my brain?  Because it's this &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_%28service%29" title="Blogger (service)" rel="wikipedia"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; blog that I've "owned" (have been writing at) since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what should I write here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This "home" pre-exists &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://posterous.com/" title="Posterous" rel="homepage"&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter" rel="wikipedia"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook" rel="wikipedia"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, etc. etc. etc.  I bumbled into the popularity of mentions of Kari Byron and Ginger Alexander (which I moved over to &lt;a href="http://att.ention.net/"&gt;att.ention.ne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://att.ention.net/"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; once I realized that there were people out there who were searching for them) which really have nothing to do with me as a person, but which became hyper-popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've dabbled in Google AdSense here... and found that people might read about TV starlets but that doesn't mean they're motivated to buy anything that someone might want to advertise with those starlets in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back eight years, this blog started out as a "web log" of links and interesting sites... but that's a role better served by &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_%28website%29" title="Delicious (website)" rel="wikipedia"&gt;Delicious.com&lt;/a&gt; now (which also appeared on the scene after 2002)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So part of me thinks that I should just stop writing here (hence the "folding up the blog" post)... but the other part me thinks that I should write &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; here and get back to a "journal of thoughts" view of blogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I'm sure anyone's reading... but I always advise bloggers to write for themselves (in the sense of "writing for your own good and benefit" as opposed to "write as if you're your own audience" -- the latter might not make sense) so maybe I should take that advice and write more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway way I slice it, I think I need a new design.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Zemanta analyzes text and brings blogging to a level that borders on auto-blogging; let's see what they recommend based on a couple minutes of dashed-off thoughts here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Related articles by Zemanta&lt;div class="zemanta-related"&gt;&lt;ul class="zemanta-article-ul"&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2010/08/22/sexy-geek-kari-byron-gets-own-science-show-head-rush/"&gt;Sexy Geek Kari Byron Gets Own Science Show: Head Rush&lt;/a&gt; (geeksaresexy.net)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2010/08/build-successful-adsense-income-blog/"&gt;7 Key Factors to Build A Successful Adsense Income Blog&lt;/a&gt; (quickonlinetips.com)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://zacjohnson.com/10-tips-for-better-blog-monetization-profit-part-two/"&gt;10 Tips for Better Blog Monetization &amp;amp; Profit - Part Two&lt;/a&gt; (zacjohnson.com)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://andremalan.net/blog/2010/08/19/your-personal-learning-environment/"&gt;Your Personal Learning Environment - Presentation to JumpStart 2010&lt;/a&gt; (andremalan.net)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrickvanburen.com/archive/how-to-consistently-un-motivate-yourself"&gt;How to Consistently Un-motivate Yourself&lt;/a&gt; (garrickvanburen.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That first one isn't quite NSFW but is a bit "frisky" for my taste.

Anyone in customer service has plenty of opportunities to be stuck with (or to even perpetrate) some major screw-ups. So I usually give people a lot of latitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when something that ought to be trivial becomes impossible to solve, &lt;strong&gt;I get frustrated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when that something is grounded in a power differential that has the capacity to really victimize an innocent citizen (typically found in cases of police misconduct, but also in unethical billing practices that corrupt credit ratings and land people in court), &lt;strong&gt;I get downright angry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it's not happening to me personally, "It's the principle of the thing."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're not there yet with Children's... but at the rate we're going, I have no reason to think we won't be in a few months. Yet I really have no idea; Rule #1 is "Keep the victim guessing."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since those in authority always claim that HIPAA keeps them from saying anything useful, I'll disclose right away that our daughter Chloe was born with a cleft lip and palate. Because that basically means that her head wasn't knit together quite right in the womb, she also has fluid in her ears and needs to be assessed for hearing loss -- a standard cleft-related issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We go to Children's Hospital in Minneapolis and have had great luck with their "&lt;a href="http://www.childrensmn.org/web/clinicsanddepts/031769.asp"&gt;Cleft and Craniofacial Clinic&lt;/a&gt;" -- Dr. Sidman's team is nice (though his partner Dr. Lander has better bedside manner than he does) and Dr. Rich did a good-looking lip surgery. We haven't had much experience with the rest of the team (and, given our current experience, we're not going to if I have anything to say about it...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than just "fixing a lip," clefts involve speech therapists and dentists and orthodontists and ENTs and audiologists, so the "cleft clinic" will schedule one annual appointment where you come for a whole day and rotate from one doctor to the next to the next and get a "team report" at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our appointment was in early April, we're still dealing with billing problems, Children's has promised four times to fix them, and we have no idea when the problem will actually end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've got insurance -- "&lt;a href="http://www.bcbsmnfoundation.org/pages-whoweare-tier3-About_Blue_Cross_and_Blue_Shield_of_Minnesota?oid=7156"&gt;Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;," which says it's "the largest health plan based in Minnesota, covering 2.7 million members in Minnesota"... so I would have thought that Children's had dealt with them before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't seem like it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When hospitals submit an insurance claim, they "code" it so the insurance company knows what it was. Cleft stuff is coded with some sort of "cleft code" that reveals it's mouth related, and hearing stuff is coded with some sort of "ear code" that reveals it's hearing related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield apparently doesn't look at "secondary diagnosis" when they process claims... which I think is strange, but that's how these things work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Children's billed the audiology session at our team clinic appointment (in three separate bills for some reason?) as "cleft" (with a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; diagnosis of hearing loss) Blue Cross rejected it outright. To their computers, that's like seeing someone get a foot exam because of their heart attack; maybe it was medically necessary for some reason, but the computer sure doesn't like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we make a call to Blue Cross: "No problem; we don't look at secondary diagnosis, so just have Children's re-submit those audiology bills with the audiology code as the primary diagnosis and they'll be covered."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call #1 to Children's Minneapolis billing department: Wife is told "We don't have any record of that submission." Wife explains it's in paper right in front of her. Wife is told to call back in a couple weeks when it's in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait. Bill comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call #2 to Children's Minneapolis: Wife is told outright, "I don't understand what you want me to do." Wife spends 20 minutes explaining to rep, who promises to send it off to the billing department. Wife is also promised that the account will be flagged as under revision so we don't get any erroneous bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait. Another bill comes. Same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call #3 to Children's Minneapolis: "Would you like me to transfer you to the last rep you spoke with, ma'am?" No, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don't do that. Rep promises to re-submit the claim to their "coding department" but "depending on whose desk it lands on, it could be two or three weeks". Okay. Could you please note it in the system that this is actually in progress so we're not treated as deadbeats who won't pay our bills? "Sure, I can do that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait. Another bill comes. They're getting angrier. Same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call #4 to Children's Minneapolis: "No, ma'am, we can't make those kinds of coding adjustments; that has to be made by the Dr.'s office." Wife: "Do you have any idea why it is that after four calls &lt;strong&gt;you're the first person who has told me that&lt;/strong&gt;?!?" "No, ma'am, but that's who you have to talk to."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Why do they put the number for the billing department on the bill if the billing department isn't the right place to call, they're not even going to tell you that secret until the fourth time you call them?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call #5 to Children's Minneapolis: Wife talks to the coordinator in the Dr.'s office, who promised to look into it and call back with news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're waiting for that call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So were the first three reps... Incompetent?  Liars?  Or were they correct, the fourth rep was wrong, and we're going to be dealing with this all over again in a couple weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my issue: People screw up all the time. Companies screw up worse because they're composed of bunches of people. I understand that. But for some strange and magical reason &lt;strong&gt;I've &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; seen a billing mistake in my favor&lt;/strong&gt;. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are some rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I point out your error... &lt;strong&gt;If you promise to fix it, then you'd better fix it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And if you value me as a customer or client or patient or victim or whatever term you prefer, &lt;strong&gt;you'd better not threaten me while you take your time fixing your problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And if your employees have given me the run-around, &lt;strong&gt;then you'd better not give me more runaround while telling me that if I'd known your process I wouldn't be in the mess I'm in&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;There's one really, really good thing about this experience: It's teaching me exactly how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to treat any of my clients. I wish I weren't living through it myself, but that does make the experience more memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/emlarson/status/16169992223"&gt;Tweeted &lt;/a&gt;that the Children's billing department is either criminal or criminally negligent, and here's why I put it in those terms:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either they're a) intentionally botching the billing process in the hopes that they can scam patients into paying their full bill rather than the negotiated reduced insurance rate (which is quite possible, but would be criminal)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or b) they've put my family's personal and private medical information (and insurance information, and bank account information, and the power to send me through a collections process and corrupt my credit rating... or worse) into the hands of a series of employees who are so profoundly incompetent with basic billing procedures and basic communication that Children's Hospital staffing rises to the level of negligence that should be illegal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point before now, the answer of "Yes, they made some mistakes" would suffice. It doesn't anymore. I don't have to take my daughter to Children's Minneapolis; why am I putting up with this?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-8767279013979158111?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/8767279013979158111/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=8767279013979158111" title="1 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8767279013979158111" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8767279013979158111" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/VemBGSklooA/our-childrens-hospital-minneapolis.html" title="Our Children's Hospital Minneapolis billing experience" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/06/our-childrens-hospital-minneapolis.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-4004674114984431326</id><published>2010-05-05T13:41:00.010-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-05T14:29:40.169-05:00</updated><title type="text">The struggles with "rewards" programs</title><content type="html">I heard back from the good folks at &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/staplestweets"&gt;StaplesTweets&lt;/a&gt; who asked for details on the problems I've had with rebate programs, since I mentioned them as part of a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/emlarson/status/13402607121"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on my less-than-fun experiences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="status-body"&gt;&lt;span class="status-content"&gt;&lt;span class="entry-content"&gt;"I'm amazed at how companies (@&lt;a class="tweet-url  username" href="http://twitter.com/bestbuy" rel="nofollow"&gt;bestbuy&lt;/a&gt;, @&lt;a class="tweet-url username" href="http://twitter.com/officedepot" rel="nofollow"&gt;officedepot&lt;/a&gt;, @&lt;a class="tweet-url username" href="http://twitter.com/staplestweets" rel="nofollow"&gt;staplestweets&lt;/a&gt;)  make their "rewards" programs so convoluted &amp;amp; frustrating"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in brief (but not as brief as 140 characters that I'd be limited to on Twitter), here's my Staples experience in particular:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In March, I had two "Staples Rewards" certificates -- 20-some dollars that expired that month, and 30-some dollars that expired a month or two later.  I made a $30-something purchase and paid by handing over my $20-something certificate to pay most of it, then handing over my $30-something certificate to pay for the few dollars on the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I took a close look at the receipt; instead of there being nearly $30 left on the certificate, it said that there were only $4 or $5 left.  It's as if the first certificate didn't exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the kids to bed and rushed back to the store before their 9:00 closing so they could dig out my first certificate from their bag-of-certificates (which, of course, I had no evidence of having given them once I gave it to them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, it turns out that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Staples "rewards certificates" are actually "coupons" &lt;/span&gt;(according to the store manager) and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;y&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;ou&lt;/span&gt; can only use one&lt;/span&gt; at a time.  When I handed over the second one, it applied to the entire purchase and the first one (which expired earlier) was ignored (but not handed back to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the manager voided the entire purchase and re-rang it all, then took just the first certificate, and I paid the balance in cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically asked, "Is the second certificate still good, or will the computer consider it to be 'used' now?"  She said it would be fine, but if I had any questions she'd be sure to remember me and fix it if it didn't work the next time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I made sure to go back on the same day and time when I used it a week or two ago because -- you guessed it! -- it didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife had sent me to get some batteries that are supposed to be free (or super-cheap or something) "after rewards"... but now, not only do I not have any idea if I'm really going to get the rewards on something that I bought with a rewards certificate... but even if I'm supposed to, I don't know if I really will because I don't know what the manager did to the system to make sure that it actually worked that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, from what I understand, it's going to be weeks before I know whether the sale "posted" to my account properly.  What I &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; know at this point is that the purchase of a chair mat on a day I wasn't there has shown up just fine... which doesn't give me much confidence in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;here's the point&lt;/span&gt;.  Eventually, it'll all work out fine (though it might take a few phone calls from my wife)... but &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;I don't "feel good" about Staples, and isn't that the purpose of a "rewards" program?  &lt;/span&gt;When my wife says, "Can you swing by Staples and pick this up for us?"... I don't feel excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't that a bad thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be an equal-opportunity complainer, here's a response I sent last night to someone else about a the Best Buy rewards program:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With rebates, there's kinda the  understanding of "If you jump through these hoops, we give you an  insanely good price on something".  But the "rewards" stuff is branded  as "You're a loyal customer so if you buy things with us instead of our  competitors, we'll treat you as 'special' and give you some money or  coupons once in awhile."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let's take Best Buy as a  hypothetical example...  I bought a Wii and a cheap Insignia camcorder for  Christmas.  No points showed up, for weeks.  When I re-entered the  receipt number, it said it had already been entered.  So I just went  back in [to the Best Buy rewards site], found that I had a $5 certificate waiting with one month before  it expires, but that $89 and change had been "forfeited" on 2/5.  And  when I checked my preferences, I found that "e-mail me coupons and  things" had been unchecked, which I know I'd had checked before -- and  which I'm sure is why I didn't get any sort of "birthday coupon" in  January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, what's my feeling about Best Buy?  Certainly not  the warm, fuzzy, "I like shopping here" thing that they're going for.   With rebates, I understand that it's a "game".  But the "rewards" thing  is supposed to make me happy and make me like them, isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime  soon I have to podcast about the opposite -- the AWESOME way the  Burnsville Hope Depot handled their Saturday morning kids program (in  contrast to the Apple Valley one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;it's just frustrating&lt;/span&gt;  -- not personally, but &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;in that "No, squirrel! Don't run under that car  that's speeding toward you!" sense.       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And, rounding things out... I bought some stuff at Office Depot using a gift card that I'd received, and they were supposed to end up "free after rewards"... but the system says that rewards aren't given when purchases are paid with a "merchandise card".  A "gift card" isn't supposed to be a "merchandise card"... but that's how it showed up on the Office Depot rewards site.  But Ruth called and asked and they said that the free-after-rewards program was "totally separate" from their standard rewards program.  Will my free stuff be free?  Maybe.  Of course, they said if it didn't come through, "all we'd have to do is call them"...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;I don't feel very "rewarded"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-4004674114984431326?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/4004674114984431326/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=4004674114984431326" title="1 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/4004674114984431326" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/4004674114984431326" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/hV_Pu9HP7Jc/struggles-with-rewards-programs.html" title="The struggles with &quot;rewards&quot; programs" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/05/struggles-with-rewards-programs.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-5243120758139196666</id><published>2010-04-28T10:26:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-28T10:32:06.268-05:00</updated><title type="text">A solution to the Adobe Acrobat Error 1500 when updating</title><content type="html">Just had a bunch of problems with trying to update Adobe Acrobat in a computer lab; I'd get the error:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Failed&lt;br /&gt;Cannot install the update&lt;br /&gt;Please run Adobe Acrobat Repair&lt;br /&gt;Error: 1500&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running the Adobe Acrobat Repair from the Help menu gave me an error that my U: drive couldn't be found... which is what gave me the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, our computer labs map the My Documents folder to a network drive but my administrative account doesn't have a network drive so its "My Documents" folder is invalid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is that the Adobe Acrobat update requires a valid My Documents folder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right click My Documents on the desktop, choose "Properties," choose "Restore Default" and get a working path to My Documents, adn the update ran fine -- I didn't even have to run the Adobe Acrobat Repair utility.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-5243120758139196666?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/5243120758139196666/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=5243120758139196666" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5243120758139196666" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5243120758139196666" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/vzxMur_CG9Q/solution-to-adobe-acrobat-error-1500.html" title="A solution to the Adobe Acrobat Error 1500 when updating" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/04/solution-to-adobe-acrobat-error-1500.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-198316663731945483</id><published>2010-04-26T22:40:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-26T22:44:51.720-05:00</updated><title type="text">Folding up the blog?</title><content type="html">It's been... quite a few years (7? 8?) and I'm pondering whether I should basically "archive" off the Blogger blog here and move to something different like Posterous (which I'm using at the moment for my "random thoughts that don't fit into Twitter" -- &lt;a href="http://emlarson.posterous.com"&gt;emlarson.posterous.com&lt;/a&gt;, if you really want to take a look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also put out a call on Twitter for design advice on &lt;a href="http://emlarson.com"&gt;emlarson.com&lt;/a&gt; in general; it always was an "aggregate of various things and interests" but, at this point, all of those things and interests will fall under a different site (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Posterous, PicasaWeb, YouTube, att.ention.net, etc.) or not at all... right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any ideas or suggestions?

The remaining mystery is why Chuck, who grew up in Minneapolis, was tied to a division based out of Illinois...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Ruth's great-uncle Chuck.  Chuck didn't have any kids so when the old photo eventually ended up in our hands, we sold it off for the frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a good idea, maybe a bad one.  But what are you going to do with a big picture of someone who nobody really knows (or knew)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, from a geneology perspective the mystery is: what does the patch on his shoulder represent?

Greg‘s company went out of business in March, and the family arranged to pay UHC directly while COBRA was being worked out. UHC gave the hospital approval in writing, saying it would pay for everything connected with the pregnancy even if it was high risk because she was having twins. Heather was hospitalized at several points to stop premature labor, and the babies were born premature and needed extra care. Heather then learned during a doctor’s appointment that UHC had canceled the policy - though there was no notification, and UHC continued to accept their premiums. UHC demanded reimbursement, and then the family was “bombarded” with bills from the hospital and doctors. The family is facing bankruptcy and had to move in with Greg’s parents.  The strain of the situation has contributed to the couple’s recent separation and pending divorce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn't look good...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-5272384992219945609?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/5272384992219945609/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=5272384992219945609" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5272384992219945609" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5272384992219945609" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/TJ2NZjV5rEA/whatever-happened-to-greg-and-heather.html" title="Whatever happened to Greg and Heather Mroz?" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2010/03/whatever-happened-to-greg-and-heather.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-2787382457921762884</id><published>2010-02-18T10:52:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2010-02-18T10:55:52.139-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Livescribe" /><title type="text">LiveScribe pens and "community notes"?</title><content type="html">I've yet to see a &lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.livescribe.com" title="Livescribe " rel="homepage"&gt;LiveScribe&lt;/a&gt;

Bear in mind that I live in a mental world of metaphors... and that's what it to come up with the following, with full props to Rick and Mylk and everyone who works on the excellent Social Media Breakfast here in the Twin Cities...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;We're looking forward to the upcoming CPBMSP #23! This month's Breakfast will continue to explore the new (but rapidly maturing) phenomenon of "Cocktail Parties" with a multitude of topics:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drambuie vs. Glayva: Bringing Variety to your Cocktails!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing plastic storage containers through Cocktail Parties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to mix Selling Candles and Sipping Cocktails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cocktails and Cooking: Hold a Pots and Pans Party!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;In planning our upcoming meetings, we're also hoping to have a discussion about some emerging uses of Cocktail Parties:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some religious groups will gather in homes in what they call "Bible Studies;" since the consumption of cocktails at these gatherings is more limited than usual, are they truly "Cocktail Parties"?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art galleries are begining to hold Cocktail Party gatherings where the focus is on discussion of the art rather than monetizing the relationships with the artists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;And on the artistic front, actors will sometimes greet theater-goers after a performance; is this kind of activity something that we'll see more of in the Cocktail Party space?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;See where I'm going with this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really boils down to one big "DUH!": "social media" is just one means or venue for conversations -- for engaging in relationships. There's a little bit of value in talking about venue itself, and it's inevitable that (some) people will jump to the "how can we make money from this?" question. But if probing of "social media" as a definable, tangible "thing" ends there, there's not much point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's SMBMSP discussion of social media in health care was a great example of the (potential) value of "social media" as it's used for some sort of societal benefit -- to make people more healthy, in this case. For me, the hope of these tools (or any technology) is that it can be used for some sort of "good" rather than used for its own sake... and that hope is either really hard or really easy to get a handle on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-1937710802712876638?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/1937710802712876638/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=1937710802712876638" title="1 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/1937710802712876638" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/1937710802712876638" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/3VPAySBPnwc/i-think-i-have-social-media-figured-out.html" title="I think I have &quot;Social Media&quot; figured out!" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/12/i-think-i-have-social-media-figured-out.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-6106941633966927187</id><published>2009-12-17T21:58:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2009-12-17T22:05:46.176-06:00</updated><title type="text">What is "social media" good for?</title><content type="html">I’m really looking forward to tomorrow’s &lt;a href="http://smbmsp.ning.com/"&gt;Social Media Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; because its topic (health care) has the potential of talking about something that actually means something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a fan of the “get rich quick” internet stuff (ever since the pre-internet magazine ads attracted my attention in the 1980s; I was too cheap to send in the $19.95 to find out the “secret to millions,” though I suspect the answers lay along the lines of “Run ads in magazines asking people to send $19.95…”). The problem is that most of the “get rich quick” marketing appeals to others who are marketing the same thing – “buy this $1000 seminar so that you can learn my secrets that have gotten me rich as I sell seminars”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few “real products” like weight loss or stock tips but, aside from &lt;a href="http://www.russellbrunson.com/"&gt;Russell Brunson&lt;/a&gt;’s star pupil &lt;a href="http://www.startapreschool.com/"&gt;Joy Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (who sells information on how to start a preschool out of your home), it seems there’s very little “real content” to be had or sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel the same way about “social media”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the folks in the “social media” space are either 1) using social media to talk about how great social media is, or 2) using social media to sell something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latter is fine – we live in a capitalist society and I realize that “sales” is what makes the world go ‘round – but you have to remember that I’ve grown up and have always lived and worked in an “academic space,” which has the opposite problem: people charge (sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly) that academia doesn’t live in reality either, and nothing we do is “real”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, somewhere, I’m hoping to find the “happy medium” where we can talk about “social media” (or any technology, for that matter) used not for its own sake, and not to just sell something or other, but to do some real good for a genuine purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does that make any sense, or do I need to work harder to try and raise this thought to the level of basic coherence?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have any suggestions/alternatives/examples of social media being used outside of basic marketing (typically for a product or service but, in worst cases, merely for itself as a concept)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-6106941633966927187?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/6106941633966927187/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=6106941633966927187" title="1 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/6106941633966927187" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/6106941633966927187" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/f_UhklfF6wA/what-is-social-media-good-for.html" title="What is &quot;social media&quot; good for?" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/12/what-is-social-media-good-for.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-5605402535899261197</id><published>2009-11-30T10:43:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2009-11-30T10:51:17.819-06:00</updated><title type="text">Fumbling with Foursquare</title><content type="html">I keep hearing how cool/revolutionary/hip this "&lt;a class="zem_slink" href="http://playfoursquare.com/" title="Foursquare" rel="homepage"&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;" thing is, so I figured I'd give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps part of my problem is that I've got a Blackberry which, for some reason, doesn't yet have a Foursquare client.  It works fine from its web browser, I'm told, but... this doesn't make much sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question:  Does the Foursquare client for other smart-phones have some sort of geo-location feature (using cell towers or such)?  Because, when using the web browser on the Blackberry, all it does is narrow my options down to the "Twin Cities" (which, if you don't know, is pretty big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm 0 for 3 in the Foursquare locations I've searched for, and the search process seems &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;really &lt;/span&gt;awkward.  When it finds something, the results seem random; that's probably because the locations are manually entered by other Foursquare members, but it seems to lead to a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, this morning, I was at the Holiday station in Eagan.  There are three Holidays in Eagan, in fact, but none of them appeared in Foursquare search.  What &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; turn up was permutations of "Holiday Gas," "Holiday Station Store," etc. -- some with locations in their title and some without, some with complete addresses and some without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is an app that behaves like your contacts on your phone:  Based on cell-tower location, a list of known sites is populated, and as you type parts of the name ("Holiday" or "gas") it would narrow down the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I'd like some sort of "scrubbing" of the data on the back-end, so that duplicate entries are matched and removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that something that other incarnations of Foursquare do and I'm just suffering on a bad client, or is what I'm dreaming of just way too complicated for today's technology?&lt;span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-5605402535899261197?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/5605402535899261197/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=5605402535899261197" title="4 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5605402535899261197" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/5605402535899261197" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/A5KOny2TJao/fumbling-with-foursquare.html" title="Fumbling with Foursquare" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>4</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/11/fumbling-with-foursquare.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-238407548932600482</id><published>2009-11-26T10:55:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2009-11-26T11:02:07.048-06:00</updated><title type="text">Pairing YouTube with other website content?</title><content type="html">Here's something I'm pondering in my spare time -- and I'm hoping that some of my web geek friends can pitch in with some suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The background:  I love the 1980s.  And 1990s.  And nothing captures the spirit of those times like commercials and TV news clips.  Thanks to my pack-rat tendencies and the miracle of home DVD burning, I've been able to go through my ancient VHS tape archive and put clips up for all to see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/bighairtv"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also own the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;BigHair&lt;/span&gt;.TV domain (where nothing sits at the moment) and I'm hoping to build out a site that features (but isn't limited to) that video content.  For instance, I'd love to track down some of the old TV personalities for "Where Are They Now?" interviews... but if it's written rather than video, it would need to be posted somewhere other than YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I don't want to be manually "maintaining a blog" -- I don't want to have to post something to the YouTube channel, then go to the blog and write a post about it.  Somehow, I want the YouTube content to be pulled into the site automatically (though, admittedly, I don't really know what "the site" would look like at this point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't be the only person thinking about this kind of thing -- a web site whose main (but not only) content lives on YouTube.  How would &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;build something like that?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-238407548932600482?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/238407548932600482/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=238407548932600482" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/238407548932600482" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/238407548932600482" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/lbim6tLD-Dc/pairing-youtube-with-other-website.html" title="Pairing YouTube with other website content?" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/11/pairing-youtube-with-other-website.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-5992920428235654512</id><published>2009-11-25T15:36:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2009-11-25T15:49:20.715-06:00</updated><title type="text">Any help with the Exchange Web Services edition of Entourage 2008?</title><content type="html">For Mac users who are trying to get their e-mail from a Microsoft Exchange server, the new (new-ish) Exchange Web Services of Entourage (Entourage EWS) held a lot of promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works great... as long as you don't need your calendar or contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's quite a limitation... and I don't think it's supposed to be that broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the situation: If a contact or calendar item is "born" in Entourage EWS, it syncs to the Exchange server just fine. And if you delete that item from another client -- from Outlook Web Access (OWA) or Outlook 2007 on Windows, then it disappears from Entourage EWS on the Mac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you create a calendar item on something other than Entourage, it never makes its way &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Entourage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can watch Entourage EWS "poll through" all your calendar and contact items -- it says it's downloading them, but they never actually appear anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned on logging and see a lot of the following in the huge resulting log file:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = m /&gt;&lt;m:getitemresponsemessage responseclass="Error"&gt;m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Error"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/m:getitemresponsemessage&gt;&lt;m:getitemresponsemessage responseclass="Error"&gt;m:MessageText&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An internal server error occurred.

Mean Faceless Corporate Giant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, you should know that I've been buying things on eBay since 1996. No, that's not a typo and I'm not off by a decade; back when the auction site was named "AuctionWeb" (the reason that eBay e-mails had/have "aw" in them) tucked under the domain "eBay.com" (which was the "holding company"), I was buying brochures and guidebooks from the 1939 New York World's Fair there. So I know eBay pretty well, and have seen it shift from a cooperative community to a bloated money-making-venture for its owners to a dying site that has driven away its sellers by victimizing them in the name of "buyer protection".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to today's topic. Years ago (just shy of four years, to be exact), we listed some old books for sale on Half. There weren't many sales... though one notable one went to "peaceandhope060" who gave Ruth her first and only negative feedback after claiming a book never arrived. For some reason, "peaceandhope060" didn't bother to contact Ruth and tell her about that before permanently messing up her eBay feedback rating. (Knowing Ruth, regardless of things like post office delivery receipts, she would have just refunded the purchase price and shipping cost just to avoid the hassle... but, hey, the experience taught us that it's the ones named "Peace and Hope" that you have to watch out for...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, point being, the Half.com experience was never a good one for us. We took that set of books, set them to "Suspended" so that they were no longer included in the Half.com database as available, and figured we might get back to selling them someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, having paid very little attention to Half.com for a very long time, a surprise appeared in the Inbox. Before reading, note a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;The book in question wasn't for sale&lt;/span&gt;. It was tied to our account in "suspended" state, but nobody could buy it. (In fact, it was part of a collection that we gave away last year.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;We have no way of knowing what the problem really was. &lt;/span&gt;The book has already been deleted. eBay and Half.com: Judge, Jury, Executioner, Sender of Form Letter -- in that order. In a nutshell, the message is "Trust us; there was something wrong, but we already obliterated all evidence of it."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;If we do it again (what, exactly?) the punishment will be worse. &lt;/span&gt;"You don't know what 'it' was, but so help me, if you do 'it' again, we're going to 'escalate' on you, though we won't tell you what &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; means, either." Nice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;None of the suggested issues could possibly apply&lt;/span&gt;. The only comments that we added to our listings are regarding quality (e.g. "Name on inside" or "Some highlighting"). It wasn't an international edition or teacher edition. I'm pretty sure it wasn't an 8-track tape. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Look, I'm all in favor of having policies and standards. But when you're trying to be a decent, honest, law-abiding (and TOS-abiding) citizen of the Internet, and you go through the pain of matching up ISBNs and making sure everything complied with Half.com standards... how are you going to react when out-of-the-blue you get a snippy e-mail like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello ----- (-@-------.com),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are writing to inform you that the following item(s) were removed from your Half.com inventory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12357068252 - Sociology : David M. Newman (Paperback, 1995)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When creating a listing at Half.com, sellers must match the ISBN, title, author, edition, binding format, publisher and publication date on the catalog page exactly. It is not appropriate to use the seller comment field to change any of this information. If an item your want to sell does not match an offering in our retail catalog, you will not be able to sell it on Half.com. Your item was ended because it did not match the catalog page exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can request that your item be added to our catalog by using the form below. If your book is not in our catalog and is out of print, published before 1990, from an out of business publisher, or vanity press we strongly suggest that you list the item on eBay instead of requesting a catalog edition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://pages.half.ebay.com/help/wizard/result_2_7_20.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following items can not be listed on Half.com and should be sold on eBay. In some cases you must be in possession of distribution rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- International edition books&lt;br /&gt;- Teachers editions books&lt;br /&gt;- Book club publications and Music Club releases&lt;br /&gt;- Prepublication editions books (ARCs, galleys, proofs, etc)&lt;br /&gt;- Promotional music cd's (including items with drill holes and saw cuts)&lt;br /&gt;- The cassette, LP, and 8-track music formats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have already deleted the item from your inventory. If you have any specific questions regarding your recently ended item please reply to this email and include the ended ITEM NUMBER and ITEM TITLE indicated above. We do ask that you find some time to review our list of prohibited items and compare it to the items in your inventory. Please delete any prohibited items from your inventory. If Half.com is continually ending your items it may escalate into stronger administrative action against your account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half.com Trust &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, Half.com, here's the scoop: I "found some time" and &lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt;I just deleted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"&gt; the items from our inventory&lt;/span&gt;. Happy now? Every last one of them. I started with the "suspended" ones, which left just five active books... but you still said that I had 36 listed out of the 90+ I started from. I'm no math expert, but I think 36 is greater than five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was awfully helpful of you to show that I had a second page of content... but when that page just duplicates the five books that really are there, I realize that you can't manage a database... and you can't write a civil form letter... and history shows that you can't be trusted to broker someone's online reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... Goodbye, Half.com!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-8759292102390904828?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/8759292102390904828/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=8759292102390904828" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8759292102390904828" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8759292102390904828" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/z1WkzqZ8ScQ/goodbye-halfcom.html" title="Goodbye, Half.com!" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/07/goodbye-halfcom.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-4528016085996827799</id><published>2009-06-11T00:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-11T00:05:42.386-05:00</updated><title type="text">Matthew Lesko (the "Free Government Money!") guy</title><content type="html">Just came across an article about Matthew Lesko (&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/14/AR2007071401118.html"&gt;Marked Man - washingtonpost.com&lt;/a&gt;).  The guy knows his niche -- and does the "get rich quick" sale really well.  But my favorite part of the article?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;To create his first infomercials, Lesko spent a lot of money hiring&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood professionals. Now, he hires eager young kids who shoot cheap and edit&lt;br /&gt;on laptops. "They're terrific," he says. "They work for dirt and they're excited&lt;br /&gt;and they have good ideas."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesko found Fleg, his latest director, by putting an ad on Craigslist.&lt;br /&gt;Fleg answered it and agreed to produce ads for $1,500 apiece. At that price,&lt;br /&gt;Lesko can afford to shoot an ad, then test it on cheap rural cable stations, and&lt;br /&gt;toss it out if it doesn't sell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's in the same vein as "crowd-sourcing" work -- the fact that, depending on your standards, a lot of work can be done a lot less expensively than it could be done a dozen (or even a couple) years ago.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-4528016085996827799?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="related" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/14/AR2007071401118.html" title="Matthew Lesko (the &quot;Free Government Money!&quot;) guy" /><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/4528016085996827799/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=4528016085996827799" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/4528016085996827799" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/4528016085996827799" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/nZKkeYBOEdQ/matthew-lesko-free-government-money-guy.html" title="Matthew Lesko (the &quot;Free Government Money!&quot;) guy" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/06/matthew-lesko-free-government-money-guy.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3810494.post-8137889306190541267</id><published>2009-06-07T22:03:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-07T22:26:38.267-05:00</updated><title type="text">We don't care what you can prove; you're denied anyway</title><content type="html">Here's the text of the message that I just sent through the whitehouse.gov comment form; I think it speaks for itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello, dedicated staffer or intern!  :)  Just a quick head's up&lt;br /&gt;that there really are thousands of us out here who are deeply concerned about&lt;br /&gt;the Airyn Bell case; she's the wife of Art Bell who was denied citizenship&lt;br /&gt;because the USCIS seems to have lost (or is choosing to ignore) the paperwork&lt;br /&gt;that the USPS has proven that USCIS received.  (USCIS case WAC0900851515;&lt;br /&gt;details at Mr. Bell's website: &lt;a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/art-bell-s-wife-denied-u-s-visa"&gt;http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/art-bell-s-wife-denied-u-s-visa&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there are much (MUCH!) bigger problems in the world today. &lt;br /&gt;President Obama has "more important" things to focus on.  Far bigger&lt;br /&gt;travesties of justice happen every minute.  But this case strikes me as&lt;br /&gt;noteworthy; how can we trust a "reformed" government that holds people's lives&lt;br /&gt;in its hands but ignores Constitutional concepts of due process... and whose&lt;br /&gt;employees lie to congressmen when faced with incontrovertible evidence that a&lt;br /&gt;citizen has followed all proper procedures and fulfilled all the legal&lt;br /&gt;requirements asked of him?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same concept (of "lying in the face of evidence") comes through in &lt;a href="http://ericasts.blogspot.com/2009/06/episode-113-dealing-with-liars.html"&gt;my latest podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  As I say there, there are some things that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get to me, and people who say "I'm going to ignore or deny your proof and falsely insist on something untrue that now negatively reflects on your character..." ...well, that really gets to me.  Check out the podcast and let me know what you think.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3810494-8137889306190541267?l=blog.emlarson.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://blog.emlarson.com/feeds/8137889306190541267/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3810494&amp;postID=8137889306190541267" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8137889306190541267" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3810494/posts/default/8137889306190541267" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emlarson/~3/m6P6x5Apx54/we-dont-care-what-you-can-prove-youre.html" title="We don't care what you can prove; you're denied anyway" /><author><name>emlarson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02393270901671791879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.emlarson.com/2009/06/we-dont-care-what-you-can-prove-youre.html</feedburner:origLink></entry></feed>
