			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working from home is the ideal situation for many Americans. A recent study by Skype revealed that <a href="http://livingworkplace.skype.com/">34% of Americans work from home at least part time</a>. While working from home offers more flexibility in your daily schedule, extra comfort, and the ability to sleep in an extra hour or two, working from home requires you to maintain the same level as productivity as if you actually went into an office. Here are four ways that you can stay productive while working from home.</p>
<p><strong>Manage Your Time</strong></p>
<p>The biggest requirement for success at your job while working from home is being able to manage your time. This usually requires setting a rigid schedule to keep you on track of your projects, meetings, and email. Without a defined schedule, people who work from home can more easily get distracted by a show on TV, errands to run, or the idea of going back to bed for a nap. Staying productive also means not checking your email every 30 seconds, or visiting Facebook more often than if you were in the office. Set an alarm clock to force yourself to devote time to actually working for 40 minutes, and then use the other 20 minutes of an hour to check and follow-up on email and check Facebook if you are so inclined. For even more success, try checking your email only three times per day. Nothing via email will be so important that you must respond only minutes after receiving the email for fear of the world ending.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Track of Your Finances</strong></p>
<p>If you work from home, you may be on a contract that pays you for projects as they are completed. The financial life of a freelancer or contractor can ebb and flow based on available projects. If you want to be as productive while working from home, know how many projects you need to maintain financial security &#8212; or at the least, to pay your bills. Not knowing if you will be able to pay rent next month is a distraction that will negatively impact your productivity. Instead, keep track of your finances to know what projects you need to focus on, and whether you need to pitch for more.</p>
<p><strong>Define a Work-Life Balance</strong></p>
<p>Being productive while working from home requires knowing what part of being at home is about maintaining your business, and what part of being at home can be reserved for setting aside work and enjoying your life and home itself. Having a work-life balance is critical for recharging your batteries and letting go of frustrations you might experience throughout the day so that they don&#8217;t continue to impact your productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Organized</strong></p>
<p>While working from home &#8212; especially as a freelancer &#8212;  you likely don&#8217;t have the luxury of advanced organizational tools like Basecamp or a contact manager like Salesforce. If you work from home &#8212; and for yourself &#8212; it is critical to use available tools to stay organized enough to not lose a moment of productivity. Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts can be great and free solutions for staying on schedule and managing email. Other apps to consider are FreshBooks to keep track of your time on multiple projects, as well a task management app like Things to organize all the aspects of your projects. Losing track of important conversations or deadlines can have a severe negative impact on your productivity, so it&#8217;s important to utilize programs and apps that are available to you to stay organized.</p>
<p>If you work from home, what do you find critical to help you stay productive? Sound off with your advice in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re finally fed up with Facebook, can&#8217;t get a grasp on the functionality of Google+, or want to follow the latest in news and gossip without bookmarking dozens of Web sites, Twitter is the best social network you aren&#8217;t using yet. With Twitter, you can easily follow the updates of almost anyone else, including national and local news sources, celebrities, bloggers, and even your friends. If this isn&#8217;t enough to convince you to start using Twitter, here are five reasons you should.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s no need for bookmarks or RSS feeds.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow several blogs or bookmark dozens of gossip and otherwise legitimate news Web sites, Twitter can eliminate your need to read through an RSS feed or click on several bookmarks to get your share of the news. By following the Twitter accounts related to the blogs and news sources you already read every day, you can read up-to-the-minute updates from these sources &#8212; even before they break the gossip on their blog or Web site.</p>
<p><strong>You can stay informed.</strong></p>
<p>Checking the local news Web site is one of the last things anyone thinks to do during their day, let alone check national and global news sources. With Twitter, you can follow dozens of news sources that provide news that is important to you and then add each of these Twitter account to a list. If you have a few minutes throughout the day, you can check this Twitter list for a comprehensive stream of the biggest news stories of the day &#8212; or at least the type of news that matters to you.</p>
<p><strong>You can build relationships with celebrities.</strong></p>
<p>When I was growing up, the only way to get attention from a celebrity was sending a letter in and requesting an autograph. Now, users of Twitter can not only follow the thoughts and life of almost every celebrity, but reply to their tweets to start a conversation with them. Celebrities like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alyssa_milano">Alyssa Milano</a> are especially easy to engage with on Twitter, as she consistently responds to other Twitter users who mention her or ask her questions.</p>
<p><strong>You can share more about you.</strong></p>
<p>With Twitter&#8217;s 140 character limit, it&#8217;s easy to quickly post an update about your life, react to a news story, or a share a useful blog post you found. Other Twitter users can follow you to keep up with your interesting news and insights, which could help build new friendships or professional relationships. While having a blog can accomplish this, Twitter is an easy way for more people to get to know you on a personal level, which could help supplement your real-life friendships or help serve as a point of reference when looking for something like a new roommate.</p>
<p><strong>You can get a job.</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is becoming one of the best ways to curate job leads and start a conversation with the company, all on Twitter. Many Twitter accounts exist to only tweet about job openings in specific industries, and you may also find specific Twitter users who are so well connected they also tweet often about job opportunities in your field. If you find a job lead in which you&#8217;re interested, you can also use the opportunity to have a casual cup of coffee or lunch to discuss the job in more detail and so the company can get to know you better. This could help you bypass a formal interview entirely, or accelerate your position in the interview process.</p>
<p>Twitter users, what are your reasons for using Twitter instead of a different social network? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m huge proponent of mental vacations, jetsetting off to another city for a weekend to clear my mind, seeing some friends, and checking out a different part of the country. Sometimes I spend part of this time alone, resigned to recommendations from friends and Yelp to find somewhere to eat lunch or grab a cup of coffee in the afternoon. If you use Foursquare, you now have an even better way to plan your next mini-vacation with <a href="http://www.my-next-trip.com/">Plan My Next Trip</a>.</p>
<p>Plan My Next Trip is the winner of Foursquare&#8217;s recent second hackathon, beating 100 other Foursquare apps to win the event. Plan My Next Trip is a Web app that taps into the Foursquare API and generates a two-day itinerary of things to do, places to see, and restaurants to visit. Even people who are not Foursquare users can use Plan My Text Trip to build a schedule when visiting a different city, as it returns ideas based on the popularity of places on Foursquare.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-4408" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/Plan-your-next-trip-1-300x134.jpg" alt="Plan My Next Trip" width="300" height="134" />If you happen to have several friends in a different city who use Foursquare, Plan My Next Trip will work best. The app will create an itinerary using the places your friends have checked in to as well as those that are most popular. The more friends who have checked in to places in a city and also left reviews will weigh more heavily than the overall popularity of a location.</p>
<p>Users who are visiting a new survey will only want to use this app as a guide, however, as I was recommended questionable parks to visit in the afternoon and grocery stores to &#8220;pick something up.&#8221; Plan My Next Trip was otherwise generally helpful in generating an itinerary for my upcoming trip to San Francisco. Just make sure that if you do, in fact, use Fourssquare, you check the box when entering the city to search for, or else you will not receive personalized results based on your Foursquare friends.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.my-next-trip.com/">Plan My Next Trip</a> and let us know what you think of the app in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Yahoo! made the shocking decision to shut down Delicious, the popular bookmarking site that also helped users discover other content as well. Delicious was then bought by AVOS, which has now completely revamped Delicious and changed the entire concept of the service. Delicious has relaunched with a new design in beta, attempting to recreate the wheel with some new features that are either very similar to the previous function of Delicious or missing the point entirely &#8212; but both with enough bugs to make the service generally unusable for the time being.</p>
<p>For (pissed off) former-Delicious users who are now looking for a free alternative to Delicious, consider <a href="https://www.google.com/bookmarks/l">Google Bookmarks</a>. This service functions very similarly to the old Delicious, and features public lists created by other users. These lists are searchable, so if you are looking for bookmarks related to vegan food, for instance, you can simply type in &#8220;vegan&#8221; and dozens of lists created by other Google users will be returned with bookmarks to topics related to vegan living, dieting, cooking, and related issues. Google Bookmarks users can also easily import their Delicious bookmarks to assist with a complete transition away from the new Delicious.</p>
<p>Google Bookmarks is only available to Google users, but is easily accessible when logged in to other Google services. Google Bookmarks also features a bookmarklet for Chrome users, so Google Bookmarks users can easily bookmark a link without having to copy and paste URLs between browser windows or tabs.</p>
<p>Google Bookmarks is one of the most easy to use, intuitive alternatives to Delicious. For those looking for more functionality, such as tags, <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> is another great alternative, though it is not free. Signing up for a Pinboard account will cost $9.45, but does offer more features that former Delicious users expect in a bookmarking site.</p>
<p>Are you a former user of Delicious? If you now use another bookmarking service, let us know your favorite in the comments below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re running a social media campaign for a brand or business, you know how critical it is to be able to prove that your presence on social platforms like Facebook and Twitter is increasing. There are several apps that can display data like growth of followers, but they are often bundled with social media management tools like HootSuite or Tap11, and these reports are not often free. If you&#8217;re looking for a report of you or your brand&#8217;s growth on Twitter as defined by number of followers, those you follow, and total tweets, Twitter Counter may just be the tool you are looking for.</p>
<p>Twitter Counter is a freemium tool that quickly and easily shows the growth of your Twitter account over the past six months. You can see the trend of new followers, those you are following, and your tweets. For an additional $15 a month, users can upgrade an account to generate more reports about followers and those who are followed through the past year, as well as see reports about the trends of your @mentions and retweets. With a premium account, users can also export stats to Excel or download PDF reports.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-4403" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/Kelly-Clay-Twitter-Stats-Twitter-Counter-300x159.jpg" alt="Twitter Counter" width="300" height="159" />For those of you not looking for your Twitter account growth patterns beyond the past six month, you may want to augment these reports with those generated by <a href="https://metricly.com/">Metricly</a>, which show the trend of your tweets, @mentions, and retweets, but don&#8217;t generate a report of your followers. Using only the features of both Metricly and Twitter Counter, users can get a comprehensive picture of growth (and success) of you or your brand&#8217;s Twitter account &#8212; and it is also free. Additionally, you can opt in to receiving emails about your Twitter data, making it even easier to stay on top of your Twitter account&#8217;s exact growth.</p>
<p>If you manage a social media account using Twitter, how do you track the growth and success of your campaign? Let us know your favorite tools in the comments below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite new features that Facebook has recently rolled out is the ability for Spotify users to automatically share music they are listening to with their friends on Facebook. These updates appear both in the ticker and the news feed. Unless you&#8217;re listening to something embarrassing (like Justin Bieber or the Backstreet Boys), this feature can help Facebook users discover new music that their friends already like. Since most Facebook users have something in common with each other (or else they wouldn&#8217;t be friends), it is likely that the users will have a common taste in music as well and enjoy the recommendations provided by friends via what they are actually listening to.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4399" style="margin: 5px;" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/Fullscreen-2.jpg-200x207.jpg" alt="Make Spotify Private" width="200" height="207" />However, some Facebook users do indeed listen to potentially embarrassing music. While I need a weekly dose of pop circa 1998, I don&#8217;t want to share every Ashlee Simpson song I listened to while cleaning my apartment. (What? Like you don&#8217;t have a guilty pleasure?) While Spotify has always had a feature for Facebook users that allowed Spotify listeners to turn off sharing altogether, Spotify is rolling out a new option to easily toggle the sharing options. Instead of having to dive into Spotify&#8217;s preferences and turn off the option to <strong>Get personal recommendations by sending music you play to your Facebook Timeline</strong> by unchecking the related box, users can now simply go into private mode on Spotify.</p>
<p>This new feature will allow you to easily and temporarily not only stop Spotify from sending your music to Facebook, but stop sending all user data to Facebook. The option is available for Mac OS X users by clicking on Spotify in the menu bar and selecting <strong>Private Listening</strong>. And if you don&#8217;t see this option yet, sit tight; Spotify is rolling out the new option to users as we speak.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are dozens of reasons to unfollow someone on Twitter. Perhaps they only post inane updates about their shopping habits, or spam their followers with all the gossip fit for both celebrity and tech blogs. Perhaps you&#8217;re concerned about your Klout score, and need to reduce the ratio of those you follow and those following you. Or perhaps you don&#8217;t actually read the updates from the majority of those you follow, and don&#8217;t see a need to actually be following them.</p>
<p>For whatever reason you want to unfollow someone, you can always use Twitter.com to manually unfollow specific users. However, if you want to unfollow several types of people &#8212; such as by who is not following you or hasn&#8217;t posted recently &#8212; you can use tools like Refollow and JustUnfollow to help you clean out your Twitter house.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/how-to-unfollow-twitter.gif" border="0" alt="How to Unfollow People on Twitter" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="200" align="right" /><strong><a href="http://www.justunfollow.com/">JustUnfollow</a></strong> is a simple Web app that uses Twitter&#8217;s API to determine who is not following you back. While this seems like a narcissistic reason to unfollow someone at first, keep in mind that Twitter is about relationships and discussions. If they&#8217;re not contributing to your discussions by reading your tweets, you clearly don&#8217;t have a relationship (at least on Twitter) with that user. While the lack of reciprocal follows can be useful to read tweets from media and thought leaders, there is no reason to follow anyone else who doesn&#8217;t follow you. To get rid of such people you follow, JustUnfollow is a great solution.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to unfollow more than just those who do not follow you &#8212; or unfollow other types of users, such as inactive ones &#8212; <strong><a href="http://refollow.com/">Refollow</a></strong> is a better option. With this tool, Twitter users can generate a list of Twitter users based on several options &#8212; such as when they last tweeted, if they have a picture or not, or if they have ever sent an @mention to you &#8212; to unfollow even users who follow you back but aren&#8217;t being engaging with you.</p>
<p>Twitter users, let us know if and why you unfollow other Twitter users and your favorite tools to help in the comments below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowdsourcing is <em>so</em> hot right now. Facebook users love the &#8220;Ask Question&#8221; feature to poll their friends to impact a decision they have to make, decide which movie to watch, or collect a series of answers, and Facebook pages can now embed a survey from SurveyMonkey to poll followers and customers about their opinions and decisions.  There are also apps like Swayable where users pick one of two options both on the Web or with their smartphone, as well as dozens of other services and apps users can poll fans, friends, and followers with like WuFoo, Poll Daddy, and SurveyGizmo (just to name a few).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4369" style="margin: 5px;" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/Wedgi.es-Which-new-@VegasJelly-logo-do-you-like-most-Designs-by-@hybrideels-200x426.jpg" alt="Ask a question with wedgies" width="200" height="426" />Now, a new app called <a href="http://wedgi.es/">Wedgies</a> makes it easy to poll users by creating a simple, social survey that makes voting easy by only requiring users to click on a URL to cast their vote. Wedgies allows users to ask a simple question and present two options from which to answer. If a user can keep the question and answers under 140 characters, users can click on the option for each answer right from Twitter, eliminating the need to visit a third party app or Web site. This is also useful for users who want to ask questions via email or SMS. Wedgie survey creators can also add an image to each answer, allowing users to pick an answer based on each image provided. The local tech community in Las Vegas used Wedgies to choose their new logo.</p>
<p>Not only are Wedgies surveys great for asking text-based questions, but each survey can be embedded on another Web site, such as a blog. The widget retains all components of the survey, such as images, and shows how many votes have been cast. Voting on any Wedgies survey reveals the total votes for each answer, and votes are geo-tagged to show votes by users based on location.</p>
<p>Wedgies was created by Porter Haney and Jimmy Jacobsen, who built Wedgies because<img class="alignright" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/TweetDeck-2-200x99.jpg" alt="ask a question on twitter" width="200" height="99" />, they said, &#8220;We saw how awful normal Web surveys were to build and take.  We wanted a simpler solution that gave survey creators an easier way of getting their feedback.&#8221; Wedgies is indeed a simple solution and it completely disrupts typical forms of surveys. By letting users create and share surveys where voting occurs by only clicking shortened URLs, a wedgie survey can be taken literally almost anywhere and by anyone and is ideal for polling followers on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>You can create your own Wedgies survey to share with friends and followers, or see others in action, by visiting <a href="http://wedgi.es/">wedgi.es</a>.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After living by myself for over five years, I now have not only one roommate again, but two. While they are (thankfully) tech savvy and are open to making split payments &#8212; like rent &#8212; via PayPal, it&#8217;s become obvious that at some point we will share more expenses than just the rent due every month. We&#8217;re all fans of using whiteboards and text messages to stay in touch, but will undoubtedly need an easier and streamlined way to track shared expenses &#8212; like cleaning supplies and new decor. Someday, we will also need a way to reimburse one of the others for things like furniture.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4360" src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/09/splitwise.gif" alt="How to Use Splitwise to Split Bills with Roommates" /><a href="http://splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a>, a service still in beta, resolves all these problems and more. With Splitwise, a roommate can set up a new &#8220;apartment&#8221; and start categorizing and noting expenses that are shared so that the other rommate(s) can be reimbursed for paying the expense. Splitwise is easy to set up and it keeps track of expenses owed and paid by each roommate in a very intuitive interface. . Users of Splitwise can also set reoccurring bills &#8212; such as rent and cable &#8212; or only invoice roommates for a single expense, such as shared items purchased from the grocery store. If each roommate owes a different amount, Splitwise can also easily calculate the total amount owed to each other, reducing confusion and making it easier for an indebted roommate to get paid the correct amount, and much more quickly. Users can also use Splitwise&#8217;s calculators to calculate a fair cost for couch-surfer guests or to adjust expenses if a roommate is being too loud.</p>
<p>Splitwise was created by Jonathan Bittner (JB) and Ryan Laughlin with the mission &#8220;to make shared living easier by providing neutral advice, fair judgement, and simplified expense sharing through Web-based tools, calculators, and blog content.&#8221; JB and Laughlin know that most roommates use different ways to keep track of shared expenses, whether through Post-its or complicated Excel spreadsheets. Splitwise emerged as a simple solution to track the annoyance of repaying shared expenses between roommates. While other services like SplitABill aim to do the same thing, Splitwise is comprehensive and intuitive without being complicated.</p>
<p>You can start splitting expenses with your roommates at <a href="http://Splitwise.com">Splitwise.com,</a> and be sure to check out the Android and iPhone apps for Splitwise to track and bill for shared expenses on the go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is one of the best sources to get real-time news and updates about almost anything happening in the world. Tech bloggers discuss new apps and gadgets before publishing on their respective blogs, and traditional media and journalists detail developing stories before they air on the next newscast. The short, quick nature of Twitter makes it easy for anyone to share details about their life, jobs, and hobbies without needing to sit down to write a comprehensive story or blog post. To use Twitter as a news stream, populated by the people who matter most to you, make sure you are following these four types of people on Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lockergnome.com/social/files/2011/08/twitter-giveaway-contest-red-flag.jpg" border="0" alt="The Four People You Should Follow on Twitter" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="200" align="right" /><strong>Journalists and Media</strong></p>
<p>Local and national media is quickly and widely adopting the use of Twitter to not only share stories, but also reach out to their communities for opinions, insight, or more details. Be sure you follow your local broadcast and print media on Twitter to stay up to date with developing news, as well as have a chance to become a part of the story. Most Twitter accounts from media are listed on their Web sites, but you can Google for their accounts, too, by typing in something like &#8220;Channel 4 Seattle Twitter&#8221; &#8212; or use the name of station if you know.</p>
<p><strong>Friends</strong></p>
<p>While Facebook is the most widely used social media platform, now boasting over 800 million users, several of your friends likely use Twitter as well &#8212; and use it very differently than they use Facebook. Some of my friends from high school and college &#8212; who are not social media savvy by any means &#8212; use only Twitter to share information about their shopping habits or detail their opinions about sporting events. If your friends are using Twitter, be sure to follow them for insight into their lives and opinions in a way they don&#8217;t share elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Thought Leaders</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of whether your job is in tech or retail, there are individuals, organizations, and companies who pave the path for your industry. These people and businesses can help you discover new or better ways to do your job, advance in your career, or even advise changes to help you and your business thrive, which will likely impress your boss. Consider using a service like <a href="http://listorious.com/">Listorious</a> to find these types of people to follow on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Hobbyists</strong></p>
<p>While you can use Twitter to keep up with people who can impact your job, there are thousands of people on Twitter who talk about what they do for fun. If you&#8217;re a flag-football fanatic or find therapy in baking cupcakes for all of your friends, there are other like-minded people on Twitter who can offer recipes, feedback, an opportunity to join a local group in which to participate, or just casual conversation with like-minded people. To find people who have the same interests and hobbies as you, use <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search-advanced">Twitter&#8217;s Advanced Search</a> to search for specific terms and types of people to follow.</p>
