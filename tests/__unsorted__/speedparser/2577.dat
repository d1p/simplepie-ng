i am aware of the irony of me sharing this article&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;by Christian Williams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have been raised according to the “Protestant work ethic.” That is to say, we were encouraged to work hard and thus become a successful and productive member of society. But what if this advice is wrong? As the economy reaches and breaches the limits to growth, working long hours causes market failures, giving weight to the idea that governments should intervene to reduce average working hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “empty world” of the past, hard work was a public good with few negative externalities on society. In today’s “&lt;a href="http://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Daly_SciAmerican_FullWorldEconomics(1).pdf"&gt;full world&lt;/a&gt;,” work has become a common-pool resource, vulnerable to over-exploitation. In the absence of social or cultural norms to take care of this common-pool resource, governmental intervention is the best option for preventing market failure and encouraging an optimal amount of work. Unfortunately, our work ethic is worsening the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:231px"&gt;&lt;img title="Working long hours" src="http://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Working-long-hours.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="142"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn't a shorter work week seem like a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological development over the past few centuries has allowed for a combination of reduced hours of work and increased consumption. Indeed, these are the only options for dealing with higher labor productivity (and labor productivity has consistently risen) while still maintaining high employment rates. But as the economy hits the limits to growth, the option to maintain employment through further increases in consumption becomes unavailable, meaning that work sharing becomes necessary. But &lt;a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS"&gt;OECD statistics&lt;/a&gt; reveal that over the past three decades there has been very little reduction in the amount of time people spend at work. Instead, consumption has risen drastically while unemployment has remained unacceptably high. If governments in high-consuming nations shift their focus from economic growth to wider sustainability objectives, they will quickly see that there are many benefits of a &lt;a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/sites/neweconomics.org/files/21_Hours.pdf"&gt;shorter work week&lt;/a&gt;.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of those benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy consumption would decrease, especially energy spent on getting to and from work;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource consumption would decrease as people trade some of their wages for more time;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With extra time, people could make more sustainable lifestyle choices (e.g., bike, walk, exercise, eat well, garden etc);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People would have more time for family and friends, less stress and better health;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer people would be unemployed, and they could make an easier transition to retirement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There would be more time for democratic participation, education, and exploration of other avenues to personal and community enrichment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better-rested workforce is likely to be more productive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both employers and employees could take advantage of more flexible employment circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these and other potential benefits, we need a stronger case to justify government intervention. And that case begins with the recognition that “free” labor markets are far from free. Employees, even if they are aware of the benefits of working less, are often unable to reduce their working hours. Previous work time reductions have not originated through individual choice, but through strong union influence or state legislation, such as the Ten Hours Act (1847) in the UK or the Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) in the U.S. Juliet Schor and other scholars have suggested that a rising imbalance of power between employers and employees over recent decades has led people to work longer hours than they would otherwise choose. Most workers simply can’t ask their boss for a four-day week.[2] Other analysts have suggested that the power of marketing has led people to spend above their means and then work more to pay their debts. Furthermore, in times of economic crisis, people feel anxious about losing their jobs. Such anxiety can drive them to work harder to protect themselves, resulting in a work intensification that contributes to the tragic “&lt;a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/08/the-us-jobless-recovery-assertive-management-meets-the-double-hangover.html"&gt;jobless recovery&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people will not or cannot choose to work less, what are the implications? Society suffers from three market failures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have an overworked workforce, resulting in social costs from broken families to higher healthcare costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a large, disenfranchised group of people who can no longer find work, a breach of their human right to work (Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long hours contribute to greater production and, in turn, consumption, with a larger ecological burden being placed on future generations and other species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These failures are the result of a rush to secure a share of a depleting common-pool resource. But as the amount of work becomes increasingly scarce, it is natural that people try to maintain and enhance their share — a “&lt;a href="http://www.eoearth.org/article/Tragedy_of_the_Commons_%28historical%29"&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;” scenario as described by Garrett Hardin. We can’t deal with this tragedy using outdated, empty-world tactics. In the empty world, we responded to technological improvements by increasing consumption. Moving forward, we must either learn to work less and be content with an excess of leisure, or reject the technological innovations that replace human labor — that is, reject the focus on efficiency and labor productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that we do not contribute to the impending tragedy, we must all aim to work less. This also requires a social overhaul of the work ethic, and a new respect for idleness and leisure. Keynes, writing some eighty years ago, saw that adjusting to a life of leisure was the primary challenge for coming generations (us), as opposed to meeting basic needs as had been the challenge for all of human history. “To those who sweat for their daily bread, leisure is a longed-for sweet — until they get it”.[3] Personally, a shorter work week sounds fine to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] See for example, the report from the New Economics Foundation in the UK titled &lt;em&gt;21 Hours&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] For an interesting discussion on individual labor supply curves and hypotheses, see David George (2000): “Driven to Spend: Longer Work Hours as a Byproduct of Market Forces” in &lt;em&gt;Working Time: International Trends, Theory and Policy Perspectives&lt;/em&gt;, (eds.) Lonnie Golden and Deborah Figart, Routledge, London. George refers to Schor’s book &lt;em&gt;The Overworked American&lt;/em&gt; (1991) among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] Keynes, John M., 1963, “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren” in &lt;em&gt;Essays in Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, (first published 1930), W. W. Norton &amp;amp; Co., New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Williams recently completed a Master’s in Sustainable Development at Uppsala University (Sweden). His thesis focused on the shorter work week as part of a transition towards a steady state economy, including a case study and political analysis from New Zealand. If you would like an electronic copy of his thesis (with a more comprehensive version of the above argument), please &lt;a href="mailto:unclegis@hotmail.com"&gt;contact him by email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But for $1, residents who bicycle to a new health clinic in town can get an appointment with a physician who appears on a large-screen television, beamed in over broadband Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic, built by a startup called Healthpoint Services, is one of a network of eight "e-health points" that the for-profit company has built in India as part of a growing effort by entrepreneurs to capitalize on the rapid expansion of cellular and broadband access in the poorest parts of the world. With successes such as text-message-based mobile payments taking off in some countries, many experts see medicine as the next major application of technology in poor nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, the rural population often has little access to medical services. When villagers get sick, they must either make a costly trip to visit clinics in big cities, take their chances with poorly trained local practitioners, or go to free government clinics that are staffed by physicians only a few hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

         &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Why does an insurance company need to buy insurance? Because some events are so awful — hurricanes, tsunamis — that the insurance company doesn't have enough money to pay off all the claims.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;Firms that sell insurance to insurance companies are called reinsurers, logically enough. The field is the subject of &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/printer/magazine/the-god-clause-and-the-reinsurance-industry-09012011.html"&gt;fascinating story in the latest BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt;. It's written by a guy who was consulting for a reinsurance company in downtown New York on Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;The core of the reinsurance business is estimating the probability and costs of massive catastrophes — and figuring out which categories of disaster are fundamentally unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;blockquote&gt;            &lt;p&gt;This is what the industry casually refers to as  the "God clause": Reinsurers are ultimately responsible for every new  thing that God can come up with. As losses grew this decade, year by  year, reinsurers have been working to figure out what they can do to  make the God clause smaller, to reduce their exposure. They have  billions of dollars at stake. They are very good at thinking about the  world to come. ...&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;Their choices on risk, with billions of dollars at stake, are  necessarily aligned with the pursuit of truth. If a reinsurer is more  scared of a risk than it should be, its shareholders will punish it. If  it is less scared than it should be, the world, eventually, will break  it.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/blockquote&gt;            &lt;p&gt;Reinsurers paid out billions of dollars after Sept. 11th. But after that, they began to exclude terrorism from their large policies. The industry decided that massive terrorist acts are fundamentally unpredictable. So there's no way to properly price the risk, which is the core task of any insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;As one reinsurance exec tells BusinessWeek, "There cannot be a mathematical model for people like bin Laden."&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

Poverty like that--understanding it and imagining ways to fix  it--is what Esther Duflo lives for. Since 2003, her Abdul Latif Jameel  Poverty Action Lab (named for a wealthy Saudi donor), or J-PAL, has  conducted 240 randomized, controlled trials of specific ways to help the  poor. She tests poverty solutions the way medical researchers test new  drugs, which can violate the pieties of the philanthropic community. But  she has earned a lot of respect along the way: In 2009, the MIT  economist won a MacArthur "genius award" for bringing the scientific  method to development work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rajasthan, Duflo has been exploring whether incentives might help  get more young children vaccinated. In countries like the U.S., more  than 90% of children are immunized. But that&amp;#39;s not the case in the  developing world. Some 27 mil­lion children around the globe fail to get  the shots they need each year; 2 million to 3 million people die as a  result. In India, 44% of children get them, but in Rajasthan the  official number drops to 22%; in Duflo&amp;#39;s study area near the city of  Udaipur, it was less than 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for the low numbers. While the Indian  government offers free basic medical care at rural subcenters,  government nurses in the area were chronically absent, resulting in  clinics pad­locked nearly half the time. Accord­ing to Duflo&amp;#39;s recent  book &lt;em&gt;Poor Economics&lt;/em&gt; (written with Abhijit Banerjee), there is a  cultural resistance to immunization. Superstitions play a powerful  role--the "evil eye" is believed to cause illness, and babies are  traditionally kept inside for the first year to protect them from it.  Furthermore, immunizations have an image problem. When they work, the  effect is invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they don&amp;#39;t seem to work, how­ever, the effects are extremely  visible and frightening: The sight of a child made sick by vaccination  is terrible, at least in part because it emphasizes how powerless the  average person feels in the hands of modern medicine. Rumors of links to  autism drove vaccination rates down among rich, educated Americans; not  surprisingly, J-­PAL found that irrational fears held sway among poor  Indians as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat all this, Duflo&amp;#39;s team attempted some simple solutions.  &amp;quot;First,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;we wanted to make it easy.&amp;quot; Seva Mandir, a local  not-for-profit that partnered with J-PAL, set up monthly immunization  camps in 60 villages, each well­ publicized in the local area and each  with a nurse--who was paid only when her attendance was verified.  &amp;quot;Second,&amp;quot; Duflo adds, &amp;quot;We wanted to give them a reason to act today, as  opposed to waiting one more day.&amp;quot; And that&amp;#39;s where the incentive came  in. At half of the immunization camps, researchers gave families a free  kilo of lentils every time they brought their child in for shots. If  they completed a full series of shots, the family got a set of plates.  At the other camps, families only got the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were compelling. Simply making shots more available  increased the immunization rate from 2% to 18%, according to a survey of  households with children aged 1 to 3 years old. But in villages with  incentives, the rate jumped to 38%. That's a great result, of course,  but it came with an added benefit. Since so many children showed up, the  total cost per immunized child fell by half, despite the $1 bags of  lentils that were handed out. Since the nurses were paid by the hour,  the busier camps made more efficient use of their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cables further confirm previous reports from the Web site Truthout on the diplomatic pressure the US has put on &lt;a href="http://archive.truthout.org/us-vatican-genetically-modified-food-is-a-moral-imperative66369"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://archive.truthout.org/wikileaks-us-ambassador-planned-retaliation-against-france-over-ban-monsanto-corn66131"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, two countries with powerful anti-GE crop movements, to speed up their biotech approval process and quell anti-GE sentiment within the European Union (EU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several cables describe “biotechnology outreach programs” in countries across the globe, including African, Asian and South American countries where Western biotech agriculture had yet to gain a foothold. In some cables (such as this &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2010/01/10RABAT14.html"&gt;2010 cable&lt;/a&gt; from Morocco) US diplomats ask the State Department for funds to send US biotech experts and trade industry representatives to target countries for discussions with high-profile politicians and agricultural officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthout recently &lt;a href="http://www.truth-out.org/second-green-revolutionaries-gates-foundation-and-monsanto-push-ge-crops-africa/1310411034"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on front groups supported by the US government, philanthropic foundations and companies like Monsanto that are working to introduce pro-biotechnology policy initiatives and GE crops in developing African countries, and several cables released this week confirm that American diplomats have promoted biotech agriculture to countries like&lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2010/01/10TUNIS18.html"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2010/01/10PRETORIA75.html"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2010/01/10MAPUTO51.html"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cables detail US efforts to influence the biotech policies of developed countries such as Egypt and Turkey, but France continues to stand out as a high-profile target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07PARIS515.html"&gt;2007 cable&lt;/a&gt;, the US embassy in Paris reported on a meeting among US diplomats and representatives from Monsanto, DuPont and Dow-Agro-sciences. The companies were concerned about a movement of French farmers, who were vandalizing GE crop farms at the time, and suggested diplomatic angles for speeding up EU approvals of GE Crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2008/04/08PARIS714.html"&gt;2008 cable&lt;/a&gt; describing a “rancorous” debate within the French Parliament over proposed biotech legislation, Craig Stapleton, the former US ambassador to France under the Bush administration, included an update on MON-810, a Monsanto corn variety banned in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stapleton wrote that French officials “expect retaliation via the World Trade Organization” for upholding the ban on MON-810 and stalling the French GE crop approval process. “There is nothing to be gained in France from delaying retaliation,” Stapleton wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough regulations and bans on GE crops can deal hefty blows to US exports. About 94 percent of soybeans, 72 percent of corn and 73 percent of the cotton grown in the US now use GE-tolerate herbicides like Monsanto’s Roundup, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/BiotechCrops/"&gt;U.S. Agriculture Department. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/10/07STATE150199.html"&gt;2007 cable&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that the French ban on MON-810 could cost the US $30 million to $50 million in exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 cable obtained by Truthout in January, Stapleton threatened “moving to retaliate” against France for banning MON-810. Several other European countries, including Germany, Austria, Hungary and &lt;a href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=124797"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, have also placed bans on MON-810 in recent years. MON-810 is engineered to excrete the Bt toxin, which kills some insect pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clementines, if you are not familiar with them, are type of orange. They are slightly smaller, seedless, easy to peel, and very sweet. You can find them in supermarkets produce section, usually in netted bags such as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the label readers that we are, the following information from the back of the package caught our eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ughh - chemical coatings" src="http://www.fooducate.com/blog/wp-content/media/coating-warning.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="160"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coated with food grade vegetable, beeswax and/or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lac based wax or resin to maintain freshness.  May be &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;treated with one or more of the following: thiabendazole, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;orthophenyl phenol and/or imazalil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are all these funny sounding chemicals doing on fruit you may ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to know:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bag of clementines made it all the way from Chile to America. That’s quite a journey for citrus fruit, who are susceptible to a variety of molds. That’s why they are lightly waxed and treated with antifungal chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;thiabendazole – &lt;/em&gt;a fungicide used in the wax covering fruit. In high doses it may cause nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headaches, but since we don’t eat orange peels, there should be no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;orthophenyl phenol (E231))&lt;/em&gt; – this is another fungicide applied post harvest to citrus fruits. It may cause a burning sensation in the eyes upon contact, but is considered safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;imazalil – &lt;/em&gt;another fungicide&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;considered safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would citrus fruit need so much protection? Well, these babies come a long way to our supermarkets. All the way from Chile in South America. Keeping mold away is a big challenge and that’s where all these fungicides come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do at the supermarket:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you buy your fruit in season, there is a much lower need to spray them with fungicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it is a good idea to wash your oranges and citrus fruit before peeling. Wash extra careful if you plan to use the zest or make candy out of the peel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't think it was possible, but my admiration for Martin Luther King Jr. grew even stronger these past days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I headed to jail as part of the first wave of what is turning into the &lt;a href="http://www.tarsandsaction.org/"&gt;biggest civil disobedience action&lt;/a&gt; in the environmental movement for many years, I had the vague idea that I would write something. Not an epic like King's "&lt;a href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html"&gt;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&lt;/a&gt;" but at least, you know, a blog post. Or a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But frankly, I wasn&amp;#39;t up to it. The police, surprised by how many  people turned out on the first day of two weeks of protests at the White  House, decided to teach us a lesson.

&lt;p&gt;We spent three days in DC's Central Cell Block, which is exactly as  much fun as it sounds like it might be. You lie on a metal rack with no  mattress or bedding and sweat in the high heat; the din is incessant;  there's one baloney sandwich with a cup of water every 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

	Privatizing QE3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pity the plight of the central banker.   The halcyon days of inflation targeting recede ever farther into the past, along with the glorious simplicity of agonizing whether 25 bp is enough.  Instead, the fate of the world seems to hang in the balance, even while the Fed Funds rate remains stuck at zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All over the world, central banks are stepping in to catch the falling knife dropped by their ostensible political masters, the issuers of sovereign debt.   Most notably, the ECB has extended its bond-buying to Spain and Italy, and the &lt;a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fed has guaranteed&lt;/a&gt; another two years of ZIRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;div style="display:inline;text-align:right;float:left;margin-left:0px;margin-right:15px;width:350px;height:263px"&gt;&lt;img alt="Green Shoots!  Japanese garden at the Boston Fed" src="http://ineteconomics.org/sites/inet.civicactions.net/files/Japanese%20Garden.jpg" style="float:left;margin-left:0px;margin-right:15px;width:350px;height:263px" title="Green Shoots!  Japanese Garden, Boston Fed"&gt;&lt;p style="font-size:11px;color:gray;line-height:110%;margin-top:0px"&gt;Green Shoots!  Japanese Garden, Boston Fed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/" rel="nofollow"&gt;central bank balance sheets&lt;/a&gt; are still swollen from the private sector rescue of 2008.  And central bankers are under much closer scrutiny than in 2008—no chance this time that the Fed will be able to double its balance sheet before Congress notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s why &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/3/7e6841b0-c33b-11e0-9109-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1UiaW0qYh" rel="nofollow"&gt;QE3 is happening&lt;/a&gt; off the Fed’s balance sheet, rather than on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To see this, it is helpful to recall QE1 and QE2.  QE1 was about buying mortgage-backed securities, and QE2 was about buying long-dated Treasury securities.  In both cases, the purchase was made using the Fed’s own liabilities; that’s what the $1.6 trillion of excess bank reserves are funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This time around the Fed is not buying anything, so why do I say it is doing QE3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Basically, the ZIRP provides strong incentive for carry trades of all kinds.  If you can borrow at zero, and can roll your borrowing for two years, then anything with a positive yield looks good.  If a hedge fund borrows at zero and buys MBS, that is QE1 private-style.  If a hedge fund borrows at zero and buys long-dated Treasuries, that is QE2 private-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The difference is that, since the Fed is not doing the trade on its own balance sheet, it has no control over which trades get made.  Private &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/58a0f47a-c36f-11e0-b163-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1UiaW0qYh" rel="nofollow"&gt;speculators can also buy yen or Swiss francs&lt;/a&gt;, and central banks intent on preventing currency appreciation are forced to take the other side of the speculation, so &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0f6e3458-c350-11e0-9109-00144feabdc0.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;doing their own QE&lt;/a&gt;.  And speculators can also buy gold, or indeed any other asset, so long as expected capital gains exceed storage costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another difference is that private-style QE gets financed with private money expansion (private debt secured by the asset purchased) rather than public money expansion (Fed debt which is bank reserves).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this perspective, private-style QE3 looks like a repurposed shadow banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As everyone now knows, the collateral that stood behind the &lt;a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/research/staff_reports/sr458.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;original shadow banking system&lt;/a&gt; turned out not to be the AAA credit it was claimed to be.   But, at the time, demand for private money backed by that dodgy collateral was sufficiently strong that there were strong incentives not to look too closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, even as the Fed’s ZIRP creates incentives to rebuild the shadow system, there is no question that the demand is still there.  (Zoltan Pozsar’s recent paper, &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d5733486-c42d-11e0-ad9a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1UiaW0qYh" rel="nofollow"&gt;glossed by Gillian Tett&lt;/a&gt;, establishes this point convincingly.  &lt;a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11190.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Read it now&lt;/a&gt;.)  The question is where to find the collateral needed to back the corresponding supply.  The search is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the collapse of the original shadow banking system, we met demand for a while with an extraordinary expansion of public money.   Not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This time it will be private money, and that means that the profit motive is key.   As we were building the original shadow banking system, that profit motive led to all kinds of weird and wonderful engineering, all directed to creating AAA collateral.  This time, end investors are likely to be looking more closely at the underlying credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nevertheless, just like last time, collateral transformation is the name of the game.  Anyone who can figure out how to create AAA collateral from existing non-AAA assets can, in effect, coin money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The search is on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Perry Mehrling</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://ineteconomics.org/blog/feed"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://ineteconomics.org/blog/feed</id><title type="html">Institute for New Economic Thinking blogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://ineteconomics.org/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1312326534755"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3999b52cd15d7e3</id><title type="html">The Big Choice</title><published>2011-08-02T23:08:54Z</published><updated>2011-08-02T23:08:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.capitalinstitute.org/blog/big-choice-0" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.capitalinstitute.org/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;

What keeps pre-packaged shredded cheese from clumping, low-fat ice cream creamy, and pre-made milk shakes smooth? You guessed it! WOOD PULP. They call it "cellulose," but it's just powdered wood pulp. The industry loves this stuff. It's cheap. It helps stabilize food, lowers fat content, increases fiber. Did I say it's cheap?

As the prices of other food ingredients rise, food manufacturers are increasingly turning to cellulose so that they can keep production costs low. Even big organic brands like Organic Valley are not immune from the appeal.&lt;br&gt;

If you do, I'm sure you're careful to buy the kind that's 100% juice and not made from concentrate. After all, that's the healthier kind, right? The more natural kind? The kind without any additives? The kind that's sold in the refrigerator section so it must be almost as good as fresh-squeezed orange juice?

If I'm describing you, then you're either going to hate me or love me by the time you're done reading this post. The truth is, that orange juice you feel so good about buying is probably none of those things. You've been making assumptions based on logic. The food industry follows its own logic because of the economies of scale. What works for you in your kitchen when making a glass or two of juice simply won't work when trying to process thousands upon thousands of gallons of the stuff. 

Haven't you ever wondered why every glass of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice tastes the same, no matter where in the world you buy it or what time of year you're drinking it in? Or maybe your brand of choice is Minute Maid or Simply Orange or Florida's Natural. Either way, I can ask the same question.
