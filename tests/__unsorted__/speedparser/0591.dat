			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A symbol is worth a million words</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the expression: &#8220;A picture is worth a thousand words&#8221;. If that&#8217;s true, then a symbol is easily worth a million. Symbols have the power to encapsulate terabytes of information, making complicated information easier to passdown. In martial arts we leverage symbols at every turn. Weapons, technique names and of course animal strategies are all well known symbols. The complicated ideas behind them are hence easier for the student to grasp and someday passdown to younger generations of Sanchinka.</p>
<h3>Encoded within Sanchin-Ryu basic fundamentals is such a symbol, the Ouroboros.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/20101130-012935.jpg"><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/20101130-012935-200x200.jpg" alt="" title="Ouroboros" width="200" height="200" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1251" /></a>
<p>From wikipedia:<br />
<blockquote>The Ouroboros or Uroborus is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.</p>
<p>The Ouroboros often represents self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things perceived as cycles that begin anew as soon as they end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example for how powerful a symbol can be. In this brief description, I can see many different ways this symbol can benefit our study of Sanchin-Ryu. However, for the sake of time, I will limit myself to examining just one.</p>
<h3>A Counter (or at least nullifier) for each basic</h3>
<p><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Jake-and-Joe-Basic-Ju.png"><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Jake-and-Joe-Basic-Ju-200x200.png" alt="" title="Jake and Joe Basic Ju" width="200" height="200" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1251" /></a>
<p>This exercise will require just a little bit of imagination. Take a moment to imagine yourself as your own opponent, same knowledge as you, same techniques as you. You approach your alter-ego to attack, you begin with Ichi and work your way through basic Ju (ten). With each strike you throw, you find your efforts being diverted. Ichi is knocked away, Ni misses, San is stopped dead&#8230;  What&#8217;s going on? Why aren&#8217;t these techniques working? Your opponent (ie you) has found a counter.</p>
<p>Now, take a moment to think of the different ways the basics can be countered, diverted or a least made null. Ichi could be elbowed away, Ni could be stopped with a well placed Star-Step, you get the idea. But, this requires something that is inherantly difficult when under the stress of kumite, choice. What if one technique could be effective the majority of the time? Such a technique exists and chances are, you&#8217;re already pretty good at it. Watch the ten minute video below for all the details of this amazing technique!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wansu is widely known as the &#8220;dumping form&#8221;, referring to opponent dump used in the first sequence of the form. However, the first dump is not the only dump Wansu has to offer. In fact, there are easily three dumps and even more for those that have mastered the form. That&#8217;s a lot considering how relatively short the form is.The following exercise was inspired by Master Jeff Barnes, District Master from Lansing, Michigan.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naihanchi, the third form in Sanchin-Ryu is notoriously tricky to commit to memory (and to master, for that matter). It&#8217;s difficulty can be attributed to it&#8217;s many direction changes and to the variety of techniques used and targets addressed. Breaking down the form into small pieces and practicing those pieces like C.B.A.s is a good work-around to begin the process of putting Naihanchi &#8220;under your belt&#8221;. Once you try this process of learning with Naihanchi, see how this works with any other forms or katas that are giving you trouble! Enjoy your Naihanchi workout this week and be sure to let us know how it&#8217;s going.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction<br />
</h3>
<p>Think back to the last time your sensei said &#8220;Tonight we&#8217;re going to work on Iron Horse!&#8221; If you made a run for your car, you&#8217;re not alone. I have vivid memories of Chief Grand Master Dearman instructing class to get into Iron Horse, only to vanish for what seemed like hours! Honestly though, my Iron Horse has never been better since those days. Let&#8217;s talk about your study now. After completing the first few sessions of Sanchin-Ryu study, the benefits of Iron Horse stance became clear. However, understanding benefits is not always enough to bridge-the-gap and get us to practice. When it comes to difficult techniques, we need a plan of action!  If you find yourself avoiding Iron Horse, today is a new day for your study of Sanchin-Ryu karate. We&#8217;ve put together a simple workout plan for you, whether you are a new student of a fledgling master, you&#8217;ll find a reasonable plan below! Read below or <a href="#video">jump to the video</a> at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<h3>Iron Horse test<br />
</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is figure out what level you&#8217;re starting from with Iron Horse. The easiest way to do this is by simply setting up the stance.  The image below depicts a <strong>basic Iron Horse</strong> position (picture taken on just another cold Michigan day).
</p>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/032510_1808_IronHorseWo1.png" alt="Basic Iron Horse Karate Stance"/>
	</p>
<p>Get into the basic iron horse position (as seen above) and see how long you can go. Feel free to do basic upper-body movements and wiggle around as you wish. After you&#8217;re done, see which letter you fit into below:
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Choose below based on duration of basic Iron Horse stance (held with little discomfort throughout)<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>30 seconds or less
</li>
<li>30-60 seconds
</li>
<li>1 minute or more
</li>
</ol>
<p>Great work! No, seriously! About 90% of the people that started reading this article are long gone. You&#8217;ve still here and that&#8217;s worth some kudos! See below to find out where you should start:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Level one. Not to fret, the beginning is a good place to start!
</li>
<li>Level two. Good for you, you&#8217;re extra karate time you&#8217;ve allotted at home is paying off!
</li>
<li>Level three. You are a true outlier. Sanchin-Ni is clearly your favorite form. <img src='http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Iron Horse workout plan<br />
</h3>
<h4>Level One: Basic Iron Horse<br />
</h4>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/032510_1808_IronHorseWo2.png" alt="Basic Horse Martial Arts Stance"/>
	</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a basic Iron Horse position. Stand with your feet six to eight inches wider that shoulder width apart. Point booth feet outward (imagine both feet on a horizontal line). Stand with a slight bend in the knee. Extend both fists out, in front of your shoulders. Also keep your shoulders aligned with your hips throughout. Try doing three sets. Here is how we break down sets into reps:
</p>
<p><strong>3 sets, 3 times a week<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 set= 4 x 45 seconds<br />
</strong></p>
<h4>Level Two: Intermediate Iron Horse<br />
</h4>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/032510_1808_IronHorseWo3.png" alt="Intermediate Iron Horse Karate Stance"/><br />
<h4>
		</h4>
</p>
<p>In addition to the description listed in the previous level, bend the knees deeper, keeping your focus on balance. If you experience discomfort, direct your attention to flexing the hind quarters and calves. Try doing three sets. Below is what each set represents:
</p>
<p><strong>3 sets, 3 times a week<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 set= 4 x 35 seconds<br />
</strong></p>
<h4>Level Three: Advanced Iron Horse<br />
</h4>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/032510_1808_IronHorseWo4.png" alt="Advanced Iron Horse Karate Stance"/>
	</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve mastered the previous steps, it&#8217;s time for a challenge. Focus on getting as low as possible, while maintaining the ability to rise from the low position at will. Check this by simply getting into the lowest stance you can and trying to move into hidden foot stance. If you feel cumbersome, then adjust your stance by setting slightly higher. Do three sets, once these adjustments are complete. Each set is represented below:
</p>
<p><strong>3 sets, 3 times a week<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 set= 4 x 25 seconds<br />
</strong></p>
<h3>Conclusion<br />
</h3>
<p>The key point of this article (and video) is a simple one. If we can break-up practice into small pieces and make a routine around it, we will have a much greater chance of success. Don&#8217;t punish yourself if you miss a day or two, it&#8217;s no big deal! If any of the prescribed sets seemed too difficult, change it! It&#8217;s OK to modify exercises in the favor of making it more accessible for you.
</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yep, you&#8217;ve read it right. We&#8217;re going back to the wall for another exercise.  Only this time we&#8217;re going to use it as a tool rather than a weapon <em>(actually, you may end-up throwing </em><strong>yourself</strong><em> into it, so it may still be a weapon.</em> Read below or <a href="#video">jump to the video</a> at the bottom of the page.<br />
</em></p>
<h3>Think back</h3>
<p>Think back to the last time you worked on &#8220;combined basics advanced&#8221; (<strong>CBAs</strong>). Did they feel flawless? Okay, I know this is obviously a loaded question, just humor me. If you answered <em>&#8220;No&#8221;</em>, then you&#8217;ve once-again found yourself in good company with the vast majority of Sanchin-ka out there.
</p>
<h3>The most important karate skills</h3>
<p>Most of you have heard that the CBAs were carefully designed to be difficult. This is true, not simply for the sake of being difficult, but to give us the tools needed to develop the <span style="text-decoration:underline">most important skills for karate</span>.  The next time you find yourself making excuses to avoid practicing, repeat this little mantra: &#8220;Every time I do CBAs, I get better&#8221;. Say it out loud and often, because it&#8217;s true!
</p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>This exercise is designed to calibrate your Sanchin-Ryu instrumentation. All that is required is you, the first five CBAs and a wall. Here are some good beginner exercises for CBAs:
</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 1: Hips, heels and shoulders<br />
</h3>
<p>Back-up to a wall. Make sure your heels and hips touch the wall through the entirety of the exercise. Now, extend your fists out in front of your shoulders (with little space behind us this is the best place for them). For a bigger challenge, try to keep your shoulders against the wall as often as possible throughout the following steps.
</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: The &#8220;neutral position&#8221; mentioned throughout this article represents the heels, hips and shoulders being aligned.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>

		</strong></p>
<h3>Step 2: CBAs 1-5<br />
</h3>
<p>Now perform the first five CBAs a few times. Remember to keep your heels and hips tight against the wall as you go. Did you feel limiting? If so, what about it was limiting?
</p>
<p>You may have noted that staying &#8220;glued&#8221; to the wall limited the <span style="text-decoration:underline">range of motion</span> you&#8217;ve grown accustomed to with CBAs.  I too, noticed this. Staying true to what the CBAs teach, we&#8217;re going to use these limiting factors to develop a deeper understanding.
</p>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/031010_2221_CBAsaWall2.png" alt=""/>
	</p>
<h3>Step 3: Watch your step<br />
</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by observing the first glitch we feel. Most of us (I include myself here), start CBAs by taking a big step into CBA 1: Ni-Ichi, turning my hips and shoulders toward my first opponent. When we stay glued to the wall, we no longer can take that big step forward. The wall makes our stance stay in a neutral position throughout the CBAs. This allows for more efficient movement from opponent-to-opponent and less extreme movement to balance. Simply put, this actually makes CBAs a lot easier.
</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: Try to make your steps tighter. Raise your leg to waist-level and place your heel closer to your original footing.<br />
</strong></p>
<h3>Step 4: Snap-back your stance too<br />
</h3>
<p>The next big glitch we need to address is hip and shoulder positioning. If you&#8217;re doing this exercise faithfully, you&#8217;ll notice that your hips try to pry themselves off the wall at every turn. Every cross-body strike the CBAs use (which is many) requires a small turn in the hips and shoulders. But where do you point after the fact? We need to <span style="text-decoration:underline">snap them back</span>! Yes, stance gets snapped-back too, just like a basic strike.
</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: When you strike cross-body, always snap your hips and shoulders back to the &#8220;neutral position&#8221;.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/031010_2221_CBAsaWall3.png" alt=""/><strong><br />
		</strong></p>
<h3>Step 5: Hip, hiccup<br />
</h3>
<p>For an extra challenge, try saving your hip movements for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">very last moment</span> when doing cross-body techniques. This creates what has been dubbed a &#8220;hip-hiccup&#8221; referred to in the video below.
</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
<li>Try to make your steps tighter. Raise your leg to waist-level and place your heel closer to your original footing.</li>
<li>When you strike cross-body, always snap your hips and shoulders back to the &#8220;neutral position&#8221;.</li>
<li>You know you&#8217;re on the right track when each CBA moves with ease to the next.
</li>
<li>Use CBAs as you would a piece of exercise equipment. Think of them as your &#8220;stair-stepper&#8221; of Sanchin-Ryu
</li>
<li>Actively search through your CBAs (and any other technique) to find the awkward spots and experiment with adjustments accordingly
</li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div id="attachment_1106" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-1.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1106" title="2-23-10 western visit figure 1" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-1-200x200.png" alt="Use the wall as a weapon" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: Use the wall as a weapon</p></div>
<p>
If your heart flutters at the thought of being attacked against a wall, you&#8217;re not alone. In fact, this &#8220;gut&#8221; feeling is a good thing. Anything designed to keep you safe is positive, with moderation (more on that later). It doesn&#8217;t take an expert to see some of the inherent dangers of being pinned against a wall. <a href="#video">Click here to jump straight to the video demonstration.</a> Be sure to login first!</p>
<ul>
<h4>Against the wall; Cons:</h4>
<li>Limited mobility makes your movements easier to predict.</li>
<li>The wall can be used as a surface to strike you against.</li>
<li>You could loose your balance and fall into the wall.</li>
<li>Limited escape routes for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, if the thought of any of the above make your skin crawl, good! These emotions indicate that you are a normal human-being. However, as useful as these emotions can be, they can also work against us. When little hope is at sight, a form of paralysis can overtake us, rendering necessary actions unavailable to us. Is there a way to prevent this? Yes, perhaps contemplating what motivates a person to spend 20-60 years studying Sanchin-Ryu or any other form of karate is good place to start. <img src='http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h3>Step 1: Look at the bright side</h3>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve looked at the negative parts of the scope. Let&#8217;s now direct our focus to what we <strong>can </strong> do. It&#8217;s first important to note that the list of benefits that the attacker has are also yours. Any of the above work as a two-way street does. In fact let&#8217;s go ahead and use the same exact list to point out the <strong>Pros</strong> of being backed-up against a wall:</p>
<ul>
<h4>Against the wall; Pros:</h4>
<li>Limited mobility makes <em>the attacker&#8217;s</em> movements easier to predict.</li>
<li>The wall can be used as a surface to strike <em>the attacker </em>against.</li>
<li><em>The attacker</em> could loose <em>his or her</em> balance and fall into the wall.</li>
<li>Limited escape routes <em>for the attacker.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Amazing! Notice how all of those fearful thoughts just got tossed to the wayside? Why is that?! You&#8217;ve put yourself in control, being &#8220;in the driver&#8217;s seat&#8221; is a powerful state of mind!
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Hands Up and Stance</h3>
<div id="attachment_1107" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-1-2.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1107" title="2-23-10 western visit figure 1-2" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-1-2-200x200.png" alt="Present a &quot;fence&quot; to the attacker" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2: Present a &quot;fence&quot; to the attacker. Extend one arm three/quarters and the other one/quarter.</p></div>
<p>
Notice in figure 2 how innocent I look. This is not by accident. I&#8217;ve placed open hands out, showing my hands to my opponent. This is a physical expression of my desire to avoid this confrontation. This type of body language is essential to keeping the peace. However, while I am showing that I don&#8217;t want to fight. I am also taking a strong posture, both with my upper and lower body. Not shown is the Seisan stance (heel-toe) I&#8217;ve taken. Also, notice how one arm is extended further that the other. This enables me to create the necessary amount of distance I need to react (or more appropriately, <em>act </em>) when an attack is initiated. Extend one arm three-quarters and the other one-quarter. Note that your feet should be in a similar arrangement as the hands. Because of the wall behind us, it&#8217;s important to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the wall (by touch).</li>
<li>&#8220;Bump&#8221;-out about 6-10 inches into stance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us enough distance to pull angles on either side of our body. It also helps us to keep track of where the wall is, essential to the following steps.
</p>
<h3>Step 3: Incoming!</h3>
<div id="attachment_1129" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-2-2-2.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1129" title="2-23-10 western visit figure 2-2-2" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-2-2-2-200x200.png" alt="Fence being breached" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3: The attacker tries to move your leading hand out of his way. Quickly set-up for figure 4.</p></div>
<p>
We&#8217;ve done everything we can to stop the fight, but the opponent isn&#8217;t having it. He&#8217;s initiating an attack. If you&#8217;ve put your &#8220;fence&#8221; up properly, he will either have to throw a long punch (to cover more distance) or we&#8217;ll have to slap my leading hand out of the way to try to get in-close <em>(Note: I&#8217;m taking artistic liberties with this over-simplification, there are more than two things our opponent could do. I just find these two common in ego-driven attacks.)</em>. In figure 3 I&#8217;m countering the attackers attempt to get close. The video at the bottom of the page shows how this could work with an incoming punch as well.
</p>
<h3>Step 4: Take control</h3>
<div id="attachment_1109" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-2-3.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1109 " title="2-23-10 western visit figure 2-3" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-2-3-200x200.png" alt="Now extend your &quot;interior&quot; hand. Strike with the elbow and grab opponent's collar" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4: Now extend your &quot;interior&quot; hand. Strike with the elbow and grab opponent&#39;s collar</p></div>
<p>
If everything has gone according to plan, we&#8217;re set to start our throw. First, we need to make sure we have control over our opponent&#8217;s center. With control, quickly move the opponent&#8217;s aggressive arm to the side. Simultaneously throw an elbow with your free arm, securing a sanchin-fist on the attacker&#8217;s collar.
</p>
<h3>Step 5: Tight-L Stance</h3>
<div id="attachment_1113" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1113" title="2-23-10 western visit" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-200x200.png" alt="Figure 6: Tight-L Stance" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6: Tight-L Stance</p></div>
<p>
In comes a stance you probably haven&#8217;t payed much attention to: Tight-L. We&#8217;re going to use this stance as a means to conserve space (because the wall has allowed us very little). To get into this position, simply move your back foot up, connecting that foot&#8217;s instep to the front legs heel.
</p>
<h3>Step 6: Turn your hips 90 degrees</h3>
<div id="attachment_1111" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-4.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1111" title="2-23-10 western visit figure 4" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-4-200x200.png" alt="Figure 7: Tight-L after 90 degree turn" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7: Tight-L after 90 degree turn</p></div>
<p>
Here comes the big splash! There is a little void you created when you changed into the Tight-L. Fill-it with your opponent! To do this, turn your hips 90 degrees while moving your shoulders even further.</p>
<p><h3>Step 7: End Result</h3>
<div id="attachment_1112" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-5.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1112" title="2-23-10 western visit figure 5" src="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2-23-10-western-visit-figure-5-200x200.png" alt="Figure 8: End Result" width="200" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8: End Result</p></div>
<p>
Pow! Bang! Boom! Insert what ever sound effect you like here. If we&#8217;ve done all (or most) of the steps correctly, we&#8217;ve just used the wall as a weapon. Notice how in figure 8 I have my opponent locked against the wall. This is not necessary, but is a good way to make sure you keep the control you just earned.</p>
<p><h3>Special Thanks</h3>

Chief Instructor Cataline&#8217;s video: <a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/dojo/campout-2008-highlights-basics-of-hand-to-hand/">&#8220;Campout Highlights: Basics of Hand-to-Hand&#8221;</a> from last years <a href="http://sanchinsystems.com/events/campout.html">Weekend Campout</a> is a good source for hand-to-hand inspiration.
