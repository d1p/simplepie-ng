<p>My friend Andy <a href="http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/">has a terrific post up about his ordeal settling with the photographer Jay Maisel over the threat of a copyright lawsuit</a>. Chances are if, you&#8217;re reading this, you know about that. If you haven&#8217;t ready Andy&#8217;s story, go and read it and then come back.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one pointed question I&#8217;ve seen crop up in a number of conversations about the settlement: </p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t it wrong that Andy chose to pay the licensing fees for the music but not for the photograph?</strong></p>
<p>This question makes the assumption that Andy <em>could</em> have paid the licensing fees to Maisel like he did for the music. He couldn&#8217;t have. This is because Jay Maisel refused to license the image and there&#8217;s no compulsory license for photography like there is for musical compositions.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license">compulsory license</a> is what it sounds like: the owner of the underlying musical composition is required, by law, to license it to anyone who wants to use it at a predetermined rate. This prohibits song writers from picking and choosing who gets to perform their works. It also allows Andy to license, at a fair rate, the underlying song compositions from a Miles Davis album to make a new album of original recordings (remember, copyrights to recordings are different from copyrights to the compositions of a song).</p>
<p>The copyright of photographic works, unlike works of music composition, is not subject to a compulsory license.</p>
<p><strong>This means that photographers, unlike song writers, can forbid anyone from reusing their work, whether it is for a poster or for an album cover.</strong> </p>
<p>Now, artists like Jay Maisel obviously enjoy this absolute control over their work because it lets them dictate who uses their art and when. Song writers, unfortunately aren&#8217;t afforded to this their published works.</p>
<p>So while no one could have prevented Andy from recording an album of remixed music written by Miles Davis &#8212; <em>not even Miles Davis himself if he were alive</em> &#8212; the same does not hold for a photo of Miles Davis.</p>
<p>Remember, Maisel admitted he would have refused to license to Andy the rights to the photo. So Andy&#8217;s only option, short of not using the photo at all, was to use the 8-bit remix cover and wager it was a fair use. </p>
<p>That Andy could, in one case, hire artists to legally remix music by paying a compulsory license, but in another case had to make an expensive and risky bet on fair use (a bet that didn&#8217;t pan out) feels unfair.</p>
<p>Put another way: why are composers required to license their compositions at a fair rate to anyone, but yet virtually every other type of artist doesn&#8217;t have to play by the same rule? </p>
<p>I doubt anyone would argue that song composition is a lesser art or any less deserving of full royalties than other arts.</p>
<p>One reason is that the practicalities of compulsory rights for photographs (and other works) are hard to imagine. Music compositions are written, then performed, then recorded, whereas photographs are snapped and then printed. There&#8217;s no underlying right in a photograph (thank goodness) to its &#8220;composition&#8221; like there is for a piece of music. So that is part of why compulsory licenses for photos don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>But I think another part of the story is that the law has evolved the musical compulsory license as an implicit acknowledgement that music compositions are both maleable and fundamental components to our culture. Compulsory licenses make possible everything from karaoke bars to cover bands to remixes like Andy&#8217;s. The alternative &#8212; allocating complete power to composers over who reuses their work &#8212; yields transactional costs on culture that are simply too high. The law hasn&#8217;t felt the same way for the visual works.</p>
<p>So will other art forms, like photography, adopt compulsory licenses? I doubt it, but I can&#8217;t help but they&#8217;d be a great compromise in light of Andy&#8217;s settlement. I asked Andy over email whether he would have paid a mechanical license for the photo:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Absolutely. If the laws and protocols for remixing photos were as clear and fair as covering music, I would&#8217;ve bought a mechanical license for the photo in a heartbeat. But the laws around visual art are frustratingly vague, and requiring someone&#8217;s permission to create art that doesn&#8217;t affect the market for the original doesn&#8217;t seem right.  I didn&#8217;t think it would be a problem, especially considering the scope of my project, but I was wrong.  Nobody should need a law degree to understand whether art is legal or not.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Sprint" src="https://shop.sprint.com/assets/images/common/nav2/logo_sprint_nav.gif" alt="" width="111" height="47" /><br />
I&#8217;ve been trying become a Sprint customer for almost a week.</p>
<p>I want to order two 4G Motorola modems for a redundant Internet connection at work.</p>
<p>I call the Sprint phone number to determine price, terms of service and what their refund policy is.</p>
<p>The telephone sales representative sounds like he&#8217;s communicating through a CB radio from Southern India. He gets pushy and wants me to sign up right then and there, but I say no thanks, I&#8217;ll try to go into the store and do it. That was my first mistake. There must be a Sprint store near where I work, and indeed, I find one on Google Maps. I call the phone number and listen to a beep-beep-beep-boop-this-number-has-been-disconnected message. I try Google maps to find the phone number on the side of the awning, call that number, no one picks up.</p>
<p>I locate another Sprint store, in the West village, and call them to ask if they have the modems in stock. Nope. Do they get them in often? Nope. Do they know of any other stores that might carry them? Nope. Is it something that stores even carry? Not really, the woman on the phone has never seen them stock and is pretty sure I have to order them online. I begin to order the modem online and get a Request Timeout error that looks like its from a default Apache configuration. This does not inspire a lot of confidence.</p>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<p>Finally get to the end of the online order form and am told that there is a problem with my account &#8212; my identity and credit needs to be verified further, and an email is sent to the same effect, encouraging me to call a phone number for more information. I call said phone number only to be told my information isn&#8217;t in the system, and that Sprint can&#8217;t help me yet. I need to wait between 24 and 48 hours to call back to verify my information. OK. I call back in the next couple of hours and try to get to the bottom of what they need from me: a copy of a utility bill with our information faxed into a number with a cover sheet with my email, an Application Number (not order number) in order to verify my identity.</p>
<p>I send the fax and wait.</p>
<p>The next day, with no confirmation or indication that they&#8217;ve been able to verify my identity, I call back and ask what the status of my order is. I wait on hold.</p>
<h2>Worse</h2>
<p><em>That is strange</em>, Sprint says, they can&#8217;t find any evidence of my fax being sent in.</p>
<p>It turns out the representative that handled my previous call didn&#8217;t make a &#8220;note&#8221; of the impending fax so therefore no one thought to look for it.</p>
<p>Where did my fax go? Sprint isn&#8217;t sure, they can&#8217;t say because my order didn&#8217;t have a note in it saying that a fax was coming. So I just sent my utility bill to your fax machine and now no one knows what happened to it? Yes, that appears to be the case.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to send the fax in again, but this time they&#8217;ll make a note of it and be sure that it will be associated with my order. Will I get any confirmation that they&#8217;ve received my fax? Can I check? No, a credit department representative will be in contact with me within 24-48 hours to tell me whether I have enough credit to order the modems. How? They&#8217;ll either call or email.</p>
<p>Two days later an email arrives from Sprint&#8217;s Business Credit department saying that a line has been approved for me and that I am eligible for up to 5 devices and a $150 deposit per device and so on. I reply: OK does that mean my order can go through? No, the Business Credit department informs me that they do not handle orders. What should I do now? I have to call one of another dozen Sprint phone numbers (if anyone needs a company directory, let me know, I got &#8216;em all).</p>
<p>I get back on the phone with Sprint with someone who sounds more competent than the rest of the people I&#8217;ve been dealing with. She shows a modicum of empathy. &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to give your company money. I want to be a customer and you&#8217;re making this very difficult for me.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I understand&#8221; she says and starts dealing with the credit department.</p>
<p>Hold music and an advertisement from Sprint warning of the dangers of App Stores and espousing their company&#8217;s &#8220;personalization&#8221; taunts me. They play it over and over again and again and I try to remember to beg the representatives to just put me on silent hold so I won&#8217;t have to listen to this. But every time I forget and start to understand the potential of repetitive auditory stimula for inducing psychosis.</p>
<p>Finally the woman comes back on to tell me that we&#8217;ll have to cancel the old order and try again. Does that mean I have to give you all the information I gave the website over the phone? No. But what she really means is yes. Yes, that is exactly what I&#8217;m going to have to do: as she goes through the list of information I recognize every question as a field from Sprint&#8217;s online checkout form. My own name and business address cease being meaningful concepts as I mumble them drearily into the phone.</p>
<p>More hold.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s back: ok we&#8217;re almost there. We need to charge the credit card. Get the credit card.</p>
<p>Getting the credit card. After an hour on hold, I can hear the excitement in both of our voices.</p>
<p><em>Whose credit card is this? Its the company card. Who is that?</em></p>
<p><em>Can I speak to the card holder please? No, he&#8217;s our CEO and is very busy right now.</p>
<p></em></p>
<p><em>The only way we can charge that card is if I speak to the cardholder.</em></p>
<p>I hand my boss the phone and he says yes and gets asked what he just agreed to.</p>
<p>Back on the phone with woman, ready to charge the card for the deposit plus first month of the modems. So very close.</p>
<p>The credit card was denied. My boss gets a phone call, its American Express verifying the charges. He spends 10 minutes on the phone with Amex trying to navigate their voice prompts to allow Sprint to charge our card.</p>
<p>Finally the modems are charged, and I get sent a confirmation email from Sprint for the new order.</p>
<h2>Terrible</h2>
<p>Back at work, Monday morning, check the status of the account: <strong><em>Your order has been canceled</em></strong>. Please call Sprint for more details.</p>
<p>I get passed from one person to another, and signing off, the first person says to me: for more information on your order, you can check sprint.com/myorder. I tell him that the reason I&#8217;m calling is that that page told me to call this number. He repeats himself and hangs up.</p>
<p>After half an hour on the phone, having talked to 4 different people, and at least one manager, I&#8217;m told that Sprint cannot verify my identity and they are incapable of fulfilling my order (or any order) over the phone. This concept no longer makes any sense to me, but I&#8217;m defeated at this point.</p>
<h2>Surreal</h2>
<p>Is there any possible way I can order these modems? Yes, I&#8217;m told, I can go to a store and order them.</p>
<p><em>What? Your stores don&#8217;t carry the modems. The stores told me to order them from the web.</em></p>
<p><em>Let me find you a store sir.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>My apologies, sir, but our store locator is broken.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>So I can&#8217;t order two modems from you&#8211; I can&#8217;t become your customer because your store locator is broken? </em></p>
<p><em>Maybe there&#8217;s a store outside of the city you can go to.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to leave NYC to order a modem from your company?</em></p>
<p><em>Our store locator isn&#8217;t working.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you have any idea when it will work?</em></p>
<p><em>No, they haven&#8217;t given us a time frame when it will work.</em></p>
<p><em>So not only can&#8217;t I order from your website, but I can&#8217;t even determine which stores I could go to?</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry sir.</em></p>
<p>They ask me for a new zip code and I give it to them. 10 minutes of hold later, I&#8217;m given 3 different stores with 3 different phone numbers. I call the first store.</p>
<p><em>Do you carry the modems? </em></p>
<p><em>No, you can only get them on the website because they&#8217;re for home use.</em></p>
<p><em>Sprint told me that I could get a store like yours to verify my identity and then I could order the modems over the web. Does that make sense to you?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, that makes sense, but we can&#8217;t actually do that because we&#8217;re not actually a Sprint store.</em></p>
<p><em>So I was just told to call a store that Sprint thinks is a Sprint store but isn&#8217;t actually a Sprint store?</em></p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ll have to go to the main Sprint store to verify your identity. The one on 23rd.</em></p>
<h2>Sell your Sprint Stock</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph comparing AT&amp;T (blue) and Verizon&#8217;s (red) stock with Sprint&#8217;s (green):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=ATT#chart2:symbol=att;range=my;compare=vz+s;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828" title="AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint Stock" src="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-10-at-11.36.43-AM.png" alt="" width="618" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>It is no mystery that Sprint is not doing well, and many people believe they are on the verge of bankruptcy. With sales (not customer) service like this, that&#8217;s not surprising. It shouldn&#8217;t be this hard to become a customer of anyone&#8217;s business.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m back from a wonderful couple of days of hanging out with the Kickstarter team near the beach. I managed to rent a surfboard and catch a couple of waves too. During a margarita-induced what-if-session, someone encouraged me to try and auto-generate <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">some blurbs from the Kickstarter homepage</a>. These are typically 150-200 character descriptions of projects that our community team labors over and refreshes daily.</p>
<p>Since I had worked with <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/generative/#markov">Markov Chains</a> for Dan Shiffman&#8217;s class &#8220;<a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/">Programming A to Z</a>&#8221; at ITP and had done two projects using them: <a href="http://www.robodrudge.com">ROBODRUDGE</a> (autogenerated Matt Drudge Headlines) and <a href="http://www.therutabaga.com">The Rutabaga</a> (an April Fools Joke that Google was attempting to compete with The Onion by using auto-generated news headlines), they seemed like an obvious place to start. I found <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2006/02/25/markov-chain">Eric Hodel&#8217;s Markov Chain ruby code readily usable</a> and went from there.</p>
<p>To give some background to Markov Chains: the basic principle is to use probability to auto-generate new sequences based off old patterns. Sometimes these sequences can be numerical, sometimes they&#8217;re musical, and sometimes they&#8217;re  characters and words.</p>
<div id="attachment_798" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse"><img class="size-full wp-image-798 " title="Exquisite Corpse" src="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Exquisite_Corpse_-_D_A_M-2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="358" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An example of exquisite corpse from Wikipedia.</p></div>
<p>Another way to think of Markov chains is as a computer&#8217;s attempt to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Equisite Corpse</a>: it is fed a certain amount of existing information and then it attempts to extrapolate a similar pattern. A classic example is to feed a Markov Chain Engine Shakespeare; not only is it readily available in raw text and in the public domain, but Markov Chain generated Shakespeare looks strikingly similar to the real thing (thanks to <a href="http://blog.mischel.com/2009/02/19/shakespeare-vs-markov/">Jim&#8217;s Random Notes for the work</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If they in thou, thy love, that old,<br />
Thought, that which yet do the heat did excess<br />
My love concord never saw my woeful taste<br />
At ransoms you for that so unprovident:<br />
For thereby beauty show’st I am fled,<br />
Althoughts to the dead, that care<br />
With should thus shall by their fair,<br />
Where too much my jade,<br />
Her loves, my heart.vs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I pulled down a document with a majority of the text that Kickstarter has used to blurb projects on the homepage. Below is a subset of an almost infinite list of hilarious and sometimes disturbing auto-generated project blurbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It features monstrous puppets, mystic sex rituals, yellowface assassins, wildly stylized violence, and a songwriter who created that all-important childhood fave Schoolhouse Rock.</li>

<li> First Law of Mad Science channels cyber-punk and sci-fi to bring you a hand-drawn postcard from the original.</li>

<li> After the success of the most disgusting way of making coffee we&#8217;ve ever seen, plus fun quotes like Let&#8217;s go slightly less on the road, and you can still get the book for just $10, plus artwork, CDs, a photo book honoring space exploration.</li>
<li> Dario Ciriello&#8217;s homegrown publishing outfit is guided by a subway car or Wal-Mart aisle is a massive interactive Burning Man installation comprised of an old Dodge pickup with fresh, seasonal veggies, Truck Farm was born.</li>
<li> Cobbled together from actual footage and the Outs have recorded a sweet, limited-edition EP on cassette (you heard me right) to help everyone send their phones to space and is going to help everyone send their phones to space and designing an app that will take place in a beautiful color poster, the DVD, and tickets to see any show, or a private event thrown in your town AND cook you dinner- what&#8217;s not to love?</li>

<li> Backers can witness the event in real-time; $20 gets you a package of exotic recipes, hard-to-find ingredients, and info cards on your voicemail to a Brooklyn rooftop.</li>
<li> It&#8217;s an inventive project from SFHny Studio, a group of thespians shouting thank you at their laptops to a unique photo book and traveling gallery show, dubbing the project that’s so infectious.</li>
<li> Fed up with a variety of sculpted paper viruses.</li>
<li> Get rewards like an unreleased font and a songwriter who created that all-important childhood fave Schoolhouse Rock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most represent composites of parts from two or three different project blurbs, and I&#8217;ve also tried to remove the ones that weren&#8217;t modified at all (sometimes MCEs just spit out unmodified sentences). I think part of the reason these work so well is because the original blurbs end up conforming to a particular style of quippy, short descriptions structured around rewards and project topics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-781" title="William Barr" src="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/95px-William_Barr_official_photo_as_Attorney_General.jpg" alt="" width="95" height="119" />In early 2007 I attended a talk at <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_782.asp">Fordham Law School by William Barr</a>, the former US Attorney General and current Verizon General Counsel and Executive Vice President. The premise of his talk was that regulation, of the network neutrality kind, would only hurt technological innovation in the broadband and Internet space.</p>
<p>A lot of has changed since then, and now that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/12net.html?_r=1&amp;hpw">Google and Verizon have stuck a deal purportedly threatening the openness of the future of the web</a>, I thought I&#8217;d revisit some of my thoughts from that night as well as muse about what this deal might mean and why its happening now.</p>
<p>During his lecture Barr attempted to point out that there had never been an instance of a telecommunications company violating the terms of network neutrality, so why would they begin now? Out of nowhere, from behind me, someone shouted &#8220;What about Madison River?&#8221; That person was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wu">Tim Wu</a>, who I didn&#8217;t personally know at the time, but who would later become a friend of mine. Tim had interrupted Barr to remind him about<a href="http://news.cnet.com/Telco-agrees-to-stop-blocking-VoIP-calls/2100-7352_3-5598633.html">Madison River where a local telecom had blocked VoIP connections for broadband subscribers</a> because the telephone company didn&#8217;t want to compete with inexpensive internet telephony. It was precisely the kind of violation of network neutrality that Barr was claiming could never have happened. Barr dismissed Madison River as an isolated incident which didn&#8217;t represent the overall policy of non-discrimination by the telecom industry.</p>
<p>Later in the lecture, Barr tried to envision an industry closely regulated by the FCC in order to uphold network neutrality. This would be a world that Barr thought no one would want: innovation would peter out as businesses would face a high barrier of entry in the form of regulations. Conversely, if corporations had the opportunity to really invest in research and development without the fear of future regulatory action, then they might come up with services and tech that would be even better than TCP/IP. Barr believed that it was naive for us to blindly accept that TCP/IP was the best we were going to get for transferring data and communications over a network. Who is to say Verizon or AT&amp;T couldn&#8217;t come up with a better protocol? TCP/IP has plenty of performance issues (real time synchronous voice communication was a huge challenge), so why not let Verizon innovate at the protocol level, and sure, maybe they&#8217;d prioritize some kind of traffic, but it would be for the benefit of technological innovation. Just think of all the potentially amazing applications they&#8217;d could come up with if the FCC just left the innovation to Verizon&#8217;s R&amp;D lab instead of the open internet and the public?</p>
<div id="attachment_785" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 412px"><img class="size-full wp-image-785" title="Compuserve" src="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/compuserve.gif" alt="" width="402" height="448" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Just say no to walled gardens.</p></div>
<p>During the question and answer period, I asked Barr why he thought that consumers wanted more walled gardens of content, and whether it was wise to assume the market was going to support another set of AOLs, Compuserves and Prodigys? He replied that of course they consumers wanted better content &#8212; video on handheld devices was going to be the future and the telecoms were going to be the only companies who could deliver it. I insisted that consumers only really want the internet in their pockets and that he was kidding himself if he thought a curated walled garden on a handset would be nearly as appealing as an actual functional web browser (something no mobile company had delivered yet).</p>
<p>In a sense we were both wrong and we were both right. Consumers did want mobile video on demand, but they also wanted the entire open web in a functional experience.</p>
<p>Prior to Barr&#8217;s lecture Verizon had announced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/11/28/what-will-youtube-be-like-on-your-mobile-phone/">a half-baked partnership with YouTube</a> which would offer limited and selected versions of YouTube videos for watching on handheld devices. Then, a couple of months later, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone which would have even greater support for YouTube. Verizon was banking on curated portals inside hobbled handsets, and Apple had just bet the farm on the touchscreen and a mobile Safari browser. We know who won this battle. Does anyone ever talk about watching YouTube on their 3 year old cell phone any more? Does anyone even remember the partnership?</p>
<p>Why Verizon and none of the other telecoms never fully invested in a serious mobile browsing experience is best explained by their general hostility to the open web. The big telecoms have always loathed the net, whether it was manifest in an engineering snobbery towards the &#8220;<a href="http://connectedplanetonline.com/residential_services/news/verizon-ceo-blasts-net-neutrailty-1021/">dumbness</a>&#8221; of TCP/IP or the fact that the net worked best when it treated their products not like products at all but like common utilities, something no company wants.  So it has never been surprising that the telecommunications industry never bothered to create a real mobile browsing experience; they were too eager to strike Big Deals with Exclusive Providers of Proprietary Content than supply an actual connection to the open web.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, to his credit, saw the opportunity to serve consumers what they really wanted, and he and Apple have since been handsomely rewarded for creating a mobile browsing experience worth using. Google&#8217;s choice to freely offer Android was a brilliant bit of strategy: all of the telecommunications firms and handset manufacturers were panicking and desperate to compete with Apple&#8217;s iPhone, so why not give supply them what they wanted?</p>
<p>So now Verizon and Google are making an uneasy deal behind the FCC&#8217;s back and trying to assuage the FCC and the public that they&#8217;re really doing it in the name of technological innovation. Think about all the applications that could exist if we didn&#8217;t have to rely on the Internet! Healthcare Monitoring! The Smart Grid! Advanced educational services! Incredible entertainment and gaming options! <strong>These are all ghosts of walled gardens past and there&#8217;s no reason to believe that a competitive startup can&#8217;t supply these exact services over the open web.</strong></p>
<p>The wireless component of the Google/Verizon deal is the biggest wild card and the most controversial aspect of their joint policy proposal. The two companies argue that the principles of network neutrality shouldn&#8217;t apply in the wireless space. I couldn&#8217;t agree less. The telecoms have demonstrated very little capacity for innovation in the wireless space in the last 15 years (why is it so hard to develop SMS applications? why is Google voice such a pain to reconfigure as my voicemail? etc.), so why would we trust them now?</p>
<p>Ultimately, why shouldn&#8217;t the principles of common carriage and network neutrality apply to the wireless space? Because its too difficult? Too expensive? I don&#8217;t buy it.  What the wireless space needs now is faster and cheaper TCP/IP service and a more open application infrastructure. Negotiating one off deals for new channels and services will only remind us of Compuserve circa 1999.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part of Microsoft&#8217;s aggressive Windows 7 TV advertising campaign revolves pairing feature ideas with tongue-in-cheek-reenactments of how those ideas occurred to &#8220;real&#8221; users. The &#8220;real&#8221; user retells how and where they came up with the concept and then demonstrates that, hey, Microsoft thought it was a good idea too and hey, look at that its now in Windows 7! Clearly Microsoft is finally listening to its users (as opposed to Windows Vista).</p>
<p>Anyway, these faux testimonials-reenactments never struck me as particularly sincere and after being subjected to one just a couple of minutes ago, I realized that I had seen basically same commercial with another actor claiming to have thought of the same feature. So I went and double checked on YouTube, and indeed, there are two commercials with two totally different men (with different names) claiming to have thought of the &#8220;Aero Snap&#8221; feature in Windows 7. The former one is the original US one, and the latter one is the UK version.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rmiPzMY4nuE&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rmiPzMY4nuE&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SnolmuFgW7w&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SnolmuFgW7w&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p>So, who came up with the idea? For the sake of the argument, let&#8217;s interpret it in the most generous way possible: two independent, real people named Jake and Ramin came up with the same idea and Microsoft chose to implement it. How cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/aerosnap3.jpg"><img src="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/aerosnap3.jpg" alt="" title="Aero Snap" width="650" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764" /></a></p>
<p>But wait, wouldn&#8217;t Microsoft probably own a patent on the Aero Snap feature? <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&#038;Sect2=HITOFF&#038;d=PALL&#038;p=1&#038;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&#038;r=1&#038;f=G&#038;l=50&#038;s1=7,552,397.PN.&#038;OS=PN/7,552,397&#038;RS=PN/7,552,397">Sure enough, they do</a>. Its actually a lot more broad and powerful than simply snapping windows, but Microsoft applied for and received the patent in 2005. </p>
<p>And now they have two commercials with two people claiming to have come up with the same idea by themselves.  Just imagine if one of those users didn&#8217;t submit the idea to Microsoft, but merged into a free software project at the same time? (It turns out that KDE, a free software window manager has long had such a feature). </p>
<p>In this generous interpretation Microsoft has implicitly created an argument against patents: independent and simultaneous discovery of inventions. Who do you give the patent to, Jake or Ramin? This is actually a hugely interesting area of contemporary research, and there&#8217;s been lots of work done to demonstrate that new ideas are almost never new. <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/05/simultaneous_in.php">Kevin Kelly has a good post about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a more likely and cynical explanation for the duplicate commercials: someone at Microsoft &#8220;discovered&#8221; the concept (here&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx">MS blog post discussing its development</a> and effectively taking credit for it), and then they did two or more sets of commercials with different demographically-appealing actors claiming credit for the features.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently my alma-mater (and current part-time employer) <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">ITP</a> is suggesting current students look at my thesis because of its formatting. </p>
<p>I used LaTeX to format it and used the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM template here</a> I&#8217;m proud to finally post it almost 2 years later. It also means that ITP students don&#8217;t have to go through the demented process of trying to recreate / reformat a template. </p>
<p>The significant departures from ACM&#8217;s template are the copyright notice and the image inclusions. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you want to compare two different websites and how many users of each site have bothered to fill out their e-mail address. But you have one problem: Site A only has 6 users, while Site B has 636 users. Does it make sense to compare the completion rate between the two sites? How confident can you be when comparing such different size samples?</p>
<p>As many people who work on usability studies will tell you, the small sample size of Site A constrains the conclusions you&#8217;re allowed to draw from your results, but the sample size of Site B is large enough to give you good confidence about most results you want to draw from its population.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s assume 4 out of the 6 users of Site A have filled out their e-mail address, and that 424 out of Site B have. These numbers represent exactly the same ratio: both sites have a little more than 66.66% of their users who have completed the task. But can we really trust the comparison and say that they have equal e-mail-completion rates?</p>
<p>Statisticians measure this trustworthiness with something called a &#8220;confidence interval&#8221; and its very important when looking at trials or polls, especially when comparing two trials that have different sample sizes. As the sample size grows larger, this interval shrinks.</p>
<p>Now there are a number of ways to estimate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for a trial, but the one that seems to be the best for small sizes (such as half a dozen users) is something called the Adjusted Wald method. The site <a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/">Measuring Usability</a> has <a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/wald.htm">a fantastic calculator that will generate these numbers for you</a> and has a great explanation of them, but since I&#8217;ve found myself doing a lot of work in SQL, I created a generalized query I can drop into other queries to give me the results in the command line. </p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p><code>SELECT n.c as "Total",r.c as "Successes", CONCAT(ROUND((r.c/n.c)*100,2),'%') as "Raw Ratio", CONCAT('±',ROUND(1.96 * SQRT((( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) ))*(1-(( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) )))/(n.c + (1.96*1.96)))*100,2),'%') as "Confidence Interval",  CONCAT(ROUND((( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) ))*100 - 1.96 * SQRT((( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) ))*(1-(( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) )))/(n.c + (1.96*1.96)))*100,2),'%') as "Lower Limit",  CONCAT(ROUND((( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) ))*100 + 1.96 * SQRT((( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) ))*(1-(( r.c + (1.96*1.96)/2 )  / (n.c + (1.96*1.96) )))/(n.c + (1.96*1.96)))*100,2),'%') as "Upper Limit" FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as c FROM users WHERE users.email IS NOT NULL) as r, (SELECT COUNT(*) as c FROM users) as n;  </code></p>
<p>This query uses two derived tables (the one named <em>n</em> represents the total number of users on the site and the one named <em>r</em> represents the users who have something in their e-mail address field) and will return 6 columns.</p>
<p>The first column will be the total number of users in your users table. The second will be the number whose e-mail address is not null, and the third column is the raw percentage. </p>
<p>The &#8220;Confidence Interval&#8221; column represents the confidence interval as calculated by the using the Adjusted Wald Method based on <a href="http://measuringux.com/AdjustedWald.htm">the walkthrough at MeausingUX.com</a>. Finally, the &#8220;Lower Limit&#8221; and &#8220;Upper Limit&#8221; columns are the simple result of subtracting and adding the confidence interval to the probability. The confidence interval is assuming a 95% confidence (you can choose 99% if you want, just replace the occurrences of 1.96 with 2.58, but using a z-score of 1.96 for 95% confidence is very common) and the units of the results are in percent (hence the 100 multiplier).</p>
<p>So this is what the results look like for a query which returns 4 out of 6 user trials:<br />
<code><br />
              Total: 6<br />
          Successes: 4<br />
          Raw Ratio: 66.67%<br />
Confidence Interval: ±30.59%<br />
        Lower Limit: 29.57%<br />
        Upper Limit: 90.75%<br />
</code><br />
And 424 out of 636 trials:<br />
<code><br />
              Total: 636<br />
          Successes: 424<br />
          Raw Ratio: 66.67%<br />
Confidence Interval: ±3.66%<br />
        Lower Limit: 62.91%<br />
        Upper Limit: 70.22%<br />
</code></p>
<p>Notice how because of the small sample size, the first trial&#8217;s results can swing between 29% and 90%! That&#8217;s a huge margin of error.</p>
<p>But in the case of the Site B, with 636 users, there&#8217;s only a swing of 3.65%, meaning that the margin of error could only get the probability down to 62.9%. </p>
<p>If we assume the worst case scenario, meaning the Site A&#8217;s trial gets the lowest bound and Site B gets its highest bound, then there&#8217;s more than a 40% difference (29% vs. 70%) between the two sites statistics despite the ratio of users being identical!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not terribly exciting news if you&#8217;re working with small numbers, but I hope my little query gets you on slightly more solid footing when comparing results of trials.</p>
<p>Good luck and please let me know if you have any questions (or suggestions &#8212; this is my first attempt at writing a stats post, so I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s room for improvement/bug fixes).</p>
