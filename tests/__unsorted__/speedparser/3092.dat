<p>As a recent RSA Fellow I take a keen interest in the education lectures from afar. On thursday I attended my first daytime one on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/School-Wars-Battle-Britains-Education/dp/1844677362/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316832781&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">School Wars</a> with <a href="http://melissabenn.com/" target="_blank">Melissa Benn</a>, co-founder of the <a href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk" target="_blank">Local Schools Network</a> who was talking about her book and the merits of the comprehensive system with <a href="http://www.arkonline.org/about-us/ark-team" target="_blank">Lucy Heller</a>. Lucy, managing director of ARK Schools, was representing the Academies.</p>
<p>I remember Lucy Heller from the infamous <a href="http://joannejacobs.net/?p=1742" target="_blank">Channel 4 Education conference</a> in 2010 where she shared the podium with Stephen Heppell and Rachel Wolf among others. I seem to remember she had very forthright views on the use (or not as was the case) of ICT in schools. Perhaps that is why information about her on the internet is rather meagre whereas Melissa Benn has a blog,<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Melissa_Benn" target="_blank"> a twitter feed</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Benn" target="_blank">a wikipedia entry</a>. I am still trying to get footage of that day out of Channel 4 for some of the comments made at the time.</p>
<p>The speakers were eloquent and polite but both, to be honest, seemed rather out of touch as did a lot of the audience. Speakers, even the audience, kept referring to taxi drivers&#8217; views as if they meant anything at all. This was quite amusing and reminded me of Myles na gCopaleen&#8217;s satirical construct of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O'Nolan" target="_blank">The Plain People of Ireland</a>. I wondered if anyone would quote what a teacher had said at any point?</p>
<p><strong>Becky Francis</strong>, head of education, RSA, sat between them doing a good job of chairing. However, I was unconvinced. She did mention that the RSA had academies and I do know those academies have a cultural remit completely different from some chains I could mention.</p>
<p>Melissa was very gracious about Lucy&#8217;s Ark Academies and it was all very polite and Lucy even mentioned she could have been Melissa&#8217;s publisher at Verso at one point.</p>
<p>But I just think they are hopelessly out of touch with the cultural change going on in society in general and in education specifically. There was an obsession in both camps about GCSE&#8217;s as if these were the only passports to success and that was the agreed nostrum for everything and how many pupils did or didn&#8217;t get to Oxbridge from families who have free school meals.</p>
<p>Ofsted was mentioned quite a lot as some kind of salvation for failing schools on both sides. I always marvel at how Ofsted have achieved this high reputation. They are in no way a formative assessment body and any aggregation of data they do have, they seem to keep to themselves for strategically timed press releases that self serve the organisation. What is needed is a truly professional and independent inspection and mentoring body that can sell services to schools to show them good models based on all the data they have but rarely release. For years I have suggested it might be useful to have an inspection system that makes transparent what schools do well and then to link to specific instances and aggregate lessons through simple searchable data techniques then bring in some good mentors for heavens sake not just grade professionals like some 1950&#8242;s infant&#8217;s test. There just hasn&#8217;t been any will to up this professionalism and why? Because rather than engage in pedagogy Ofsted is more concerned with number crunching a small subset of easily definable metrics that give the government purchase on some semblance of accountable attainment but which bear no relation to learning in the wider world. And I am afraid the wider world is beginning to breach the school walls and as pedagogy turns more into <span>heutagogy aided by technology in some cases there is a rapid cultural change beginning to happen. Arguing over the carapace of old and outmoded systems doesn&#8217;t cut it I&#8217;m afraid. But I won&#8217;t go into that argument here. It just seemed the obsessions with qualifications were to the fore on both sides without any reflection on what it is to actually &#8220;learn&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>One of Melissa&#8217;s arguments was that the climate of Free Schools and Academies would bring an unstable atmosphere into the local areas and there was lots of anecdote but no really hard evidence on both sides. I was amazed that the lack of transparency about differing funding arrangements wasn&#8217;t mentioned once and that Academies and Free Schools and especially the NSN have a cloak of invisibility when it comes to these inequalities. Money was mentioned but in terms of benefactors. It all seemed very patriarchal on both sides. <strong>That school is something to be done to you rather than something you do!</strong></p>
<p>Our education system, when it comes to exams, is beginning to run its course. More and more pupils are sensing a lack of authenticity. People like Melissa and Lucy should listen to this interview I did with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/petejbell" target="_blank">Pete Bell </a> at <a href="http://www.tedxlondon.com/first" target="_blank">TedXLondon</a>. He sets the exams for a major examinations board!</p>

<p>My other concern was the issue of chains of Academies. This seriously worries me. I have been in public meetings where representatives of the DfE have freely admitted they are <strong><em>very</em></strong> concerned about this aspect of scaling up one particular model and corporate governance beginning to take hold. There are alternatives to both systems and I could quote reams of exemplars but I&#8217;ll point to Neil Hopkin as one particular head responsible for more than one school. Both protagonists would do well to read <a href="http://neilhopkin.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a>.</p>
<p>I am afraid I am deeply cynical about LAs as a teacher who kept coming into conflict with them over innovative and ground breaking projects being pulled down by petty bureaucratic paperwrok at local and governmental level. I once had to get a letter of permission from the government to set off a plastic water rocket in Regents&#8217; Park for an after school science club &#8211; I still have it framed on my wall. But I am no fan of Free Schools either because when it comes down to it the government would like us to believe we can teach any way we like but still sets a whole new bunch of parameters that can be easily quantified and measured by Ofsted. Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; there is no true freedom in the curriculum and all this propaganda involving &#8220;rigorous&#8221; and soft subjects is totally ridiculous it is a false dichotomy. The arts have brought in as much income for this country over the last few years as the financial sector and with less ethical concerns.</p>
<p>I am afraid part of the session at the end consisted of barracking by Westminster councillors; this was unfortunate for them really and didn&#8217;t give a very good impression. Even when I worked for Westminster it had, possibly, one of the less favourable reputations in the country for school management; ever zealous about cutting back on services and funding but not much support or scaffolding for teachers and their professional development &#8211; always too top down &#8211; thank goodness the <a href="http://www.teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/19975349/FrontPage" target="_blank">TeachMeet movement</a> is putting paid to that attitude all over the country.</p>
<p>It was a stimulating afternoon but judge for yourself and listen to the<a href="http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/school-wars" target="_blank"> whole session here</a>. You don&#8217;t have to be a fellow and they are all free so I&#8217;d urge people to go along if they have the time.</p>
<p>I noticed Francis Beckett writing in his blog that he is considering giving up his subscription (<a href="http://www.iaindale.com/posts/why-i-have-got-to-cancel-my-rsa-subscription" target="_blank">Why I have got to cancel my RSA subscription</a>) &#8211; I&#8217;d urge him to get into those RSA Academies and have a look around &#8211; he might be surprised at what he sees. There is localism instead of corporate governance for a start. I am pretty upbeat about lots of innovative and forward thinking about how to run schools and I think that there are several elements that are obvious to anyone who has been in the game for some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>great leadership</li>
<li>collaboration</li>
<li>community involvement and parental engagement</li>
<li>mentoring and learning for both staff and pupils</li>
<li>excellent channels of communication</li>
<li>local and involved governance</li>
<li>increasingly good use of ICT</li>
</ul>
<p>Why polarise the issues &#8211; the real war will be fought when more innovative models start to roll out. For me it seems it is about interleaving the school within the community. It is not about structures two away from the communities we serve. My recent interview with Dan Roberts of Saltash community school might give an insight into the way things are going. To be quite honest the new educators aren&#8217;t interested in old battles &#8211; they just want to get on with new ways of learning that are more democratic and more effective.</p>
<p>Francis Beckett also wrote on his blog:<br />
&#8220;<strong><em>There was no educational debate at all..</em></strong>&#8221; And I will agree with that but the difference is I am trying to change it and I&#8217;ve become a Fellow to help that process along.</p>
<p><em>There is an educational revolution going on out there and you won&#8217;t get the news sitting in the back of a taxi.</em></p>
<p><em>There are numerous organisations coalescing around these ideas:</em></p>
<p>MirandaNet<br />
Teachmeet<br />
WholeEducation<br />
Purpose/ed<br />
TedX<br />
UkedChat<br />
Learning Without Frontiers<br />
Naace<br />
Computing at School</p>
<p>I could go on but I would challenge the RSA to stop acting as a conduit for debates around old media and bring in some new blood, the bloggers, the teachers, headteachers and parents who are evolving new and highly agile systems of education. Bring them in &#8211; stir things up a bit and create a bit of change to see things anew.</p>
<p>And the Gas Mask?</p>
<p>Well it was a threat that never became a reality. And also at the end of the debate a somewhat elderly gentleman sitting next to me, turned to me and sighed, and said:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t say anything &#8211; just a lot of hot air&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of posts ago I put up several interviews with people after TedXLondon. Now I get a lot of hits on my site when I do this but I am always conscious that it is often a one way process. Someone&#8217;s made a point in time and then it&#8217;s gone. So I thought I might put up one SoundCloud interview with Oliver again and see what interested parties might want to add to the debate to extend it with materials, links, observations.

<p>I have launched the <a href="http://www.socialmediaforschools.org.uk">Social Media for Schools</a> site as part of the first stage of a not-for-profit service to schools for senior managers. Although it is not-for-profit it <strong>is</strong><em> a paid-for </em>service.</p>
<p>I fully intend it to be a highly efficient  social network for senior managers showing them how to manage networks for their school communities. Almost everyone I have talked with thinks this is a good idea.</p>
<p>Social Media for schools is <strong>not</strong> about selling a specialised social network to your school &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that to other commercial firms and good luck to them. What SMS is about is building sustainable networks and infrastructure and, above all, community to extend expertise in managing how people learn.</p>
<p>I think that is a far more important role in the long run.</p>
<p>To begin with we are releasing a number of videos (sorry they are not downloadable and are fully copyright) of practitioners already using social networking management techniques in their schools. I&#8217;ll be organising CPD sessions for headteachers and others from BETT onwards.</p>
<p>In the meantime look at Dan Roberts talking about how he uses Social Networking at Saltash community school.</p>

<p>I have just finished uploading <a href="http://audioboo.fm/Eyebeams" target="_blank">quite a few audio vox pops</a> from people in the audience at the TedXLondon event today. I worked out that if there were a 1000 people there, I have interviewed just under 0.02% of them.</p>
<p>My perception of <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">Ted</a> has always been one of a world class brand designed to get the chattering classes bound into ideas and innovation. It&#8217;s slick, it&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s innovative &#8211; big heart &#8211; big brand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been involved in a few TedX events in the past and my experience with organisers behind the scenes has been &#8220;interesting&#8221; with regards to protection of that brand to say the least.</p>
<p>The London TedX event looked pretty much a bigger, better version of previous smaller scale education events in previous years and I was curious how the whole thing had evolved. This one certainly seemed to have a number of differences.</p>
<p>First there was a free live stream for anyone who couldn&#8217;t get there which is a major plus for an event like this. It was streamed out extremely professionally. This is a big, big plus in my book. Gone are the days of trooping off surreptitiously to some really cool Old St startup to look at the whole thing via an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; video conference &#8211; this ensured it was an open, transparent, <strong>global</strong><em> </em>event.</p>
<p>I will confess that I did not pay for my ticket &#8211; someone kindly paid for me to go &#8211; which is just as well because I could never have afforded the £65.00 price tag. That, in itself, was a kind of financial shibboleth for starters. I had approached organisers to get a pass to do the vox pops but they didn&#8217;t even reply to my email &#8211; (to be fair it was a couple of days before the event).</p>
<p>What I did want to do was document and highlight the debate around the &#8220;Education Revolution&#8221; &#8211; I had actually <a href="http://blip.tv/learning-without-frontiers/sir-ken-robinson-march-2011-learning-without-frontiers-4928095">streamed Ken Robinson&#8217;s</a> earlier talk for <a href="http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.com/">Learning Without Frontiers</a> in the UK, back in March. I have the odd distinction of having spent the last three decades working in schools and also in and around Soho post production houses for a super indie film/ web company; so I kind of see things from multiple viewpoints&#8230;</p>
<p>I use film, audio and slideshows to document what teachers are doing in schools but I am also a practitioner &#8211; in my last role, working in a school earlier this year as part of a creative partnerships project, the pupils (the year 6 school council) grilled me for the job. Luckily I got it!</p>
<p>So TedXLondon seemed a perfect opportunity to start to join up the dots.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Fred Garnett" src="http://static2.boo.fm/files/images/0156/7638/Fred_Garnett.JPG?1316294765" alt="" width="185" height="280" /></p>
<p>When I arrived the very first person I met on the street was <a href="http://alchemi.co.uk/archives/ele/fred_garnett_on.html" target="_blank">Fred Garnett</a> who is involved with the <a href="http://mosialong.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/aggregate-then-curate/">Mosialong project</a> in Manchester. I had met Fred first at a Southbank Event and subsequently bumped into him at a couple of seminars he was giving at the notorious &#8220;<a href="http://reallyfreeschool.org/">Really Free School</a>&#8221;  earlier this year.</p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em></em>For me the &#8220;Education Revolution&#8221; is about Cultural Change not purely cool uses of Educational Technology. It is about how communities are evolving in the light of global upheaval &#8211; well that&#8217;s my analysis at least.</p>
<p>I sensed, by some of the tweets coming in about the event, that more than a few people in education were a little &#8220;resistant&#8221; to the idea of this big media beanfeast in London and that their perception was one of things not quite happy with things being &#8220;on message&#8221; &#8211; there was an undertow of cynicism in the air. So I decided to explore this and play devil&#8217;s advocate and sound out a few people with some well intended provocation &#8211; I have to say people were wonderful and very reflective, no-one rose to my provocations but all acknowledged that something needed to be done.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Nicole Charles" src="http://static0.boo.fm/files/images/0156/7110/nicole2.png?1316278759" alt="" width="347" height="311" /></p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://www.makebelievearts.co.uk/Information/About+Us/Creative+Associates/Nicole+Charles">Nicole Charles </a>on her own in the RoundHouse cafe and she seemed tired and distracted (a stint in Edinburgh and far too much work probably being the cause) but she gave me some amazingly thoughtful responses to some pretty searching questions about the nature of TedX, privilege and the whole perception of the media industry getting involved in the process of an &#8220;Education Revolution&#8221;.<a href="http://www.makebelievearts.co.uk/Information/About+Us/Creative+Associates/Nicole+Charles"><br />
</a></p>
<p><iframe style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;" allowtransparency="allowtransparency" cellspacing="0" frameborder="0" hspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" vspace="0" src="http://audioboo.fm/boos/474217-interview-with-nicole-charles-at-tedxlondon/embed" title="Audioboo player"></iframe></p>
<p>It does seem to me that too many people are locked into their own industry silos and do not talk to people in other fields &#8211; one of the things we were urged to do at TedxLondon was to go out and talk with other, new people. I didn&#8217;t know Nicole or what she did but I loved her thoughtful responses which kind of blew out of the water attitudes like that put forwards by <a href="http://davidpriceblog.posterous.com/yes-but-how-do-we-bring-on-the-learning-revol" target="_blank">David Price</a> in his blog after the event.</p>
<p>I think it can be too easy to snipe with a &#8220;Teacher knows best&#8221; attitude rather than take a serendipitious &#8220;how can I learn&#8221; approach &#8211; <em>especially</em> teachers.</p>
<p>I thought Nicole&#8217;s responses were wonderfully open, disarming and full of the insight. What more could you ask of someone who has worked in both worlds &#8211; an amphibian as I call them. What this country needs is more people like Nicole &#8211; people who have a deep understanding of the cultural changes and the really hard work that needs to be put in to be involved in this area. They have my immense respect.</p>
<p>As I wandered around in the breaks I came across more and more people I have never met before on any other circuits so, for me, the day was fascinating. I love the challenge of finding and talking with other people in different fields with different specialties and seeking out those areas where there&#8217;s a match.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Clare Collins of the NGA" src="http://static0.boo.fm/files/images/0156/7974/clare_collins.JPG?1316304013" alt="" width="392" height="220" /></p>
<p>The next person I managed to stop and talk with briefly, was <a href="http://www.nga.org.uk/NatLship.aspx" target="_self">Clare Collins</a>. She had some pretty good insights into the nature of TedX and its purpose to inspire but she also had some realistic views on the downside. I was intrigued by her comments on technology, though, and wish she&#8217;d expanded on them.</p>

<p>Next I managed to talk to some of the people exhibiting during the breaks and came across a teacher working for Teach First on her second day of teaching!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Jo Cooper Music Teacher on TeachFirst " src="http://static1.boo.fm/files/images/0156/7920/teachers.JPG?1316302758" alt="" width="379" height="252" /></p>

<p>I won&#8217;t list all the people I met yesterday because it is past 5 am and this blog is getting far too long.</p>
<p>At the end of the event I had a great discussion with <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/governing-bodies/london-council/marcus-davey/" target="_blank">Marcus Davey</a>, <span class="st">Chief Executive and Artistic Director of the Roundhouse Trust</span>, about all the excellent work the Roundhouse does with young people. He certainly wasn&#8217;t going to take any of my provocations lying down and gave me a long list of the outreach and training that the Roundhouse does in the local area.</p>

<p>At the very end of the evening I had a fascinating conversation with <a href="http://www.oliverquinlan.com/blog/" target="_blank">Oliver Quinlan</a> and <a href="http://petebell.com/?p=356" target="_blank">Pete Bell</a> about the nature of what TedX should be about and what it actually was and this invitably spilled over into a wider discussion on education.</p>

<p>So what did impressions did I take away from the day?</p>
<p>Well I felt things had changed &#8211; that TedXLondon was the beginning of something that may have some bearing on being able to harness the immense expertise gathered together in that hall.</p>
<p>For me education and learning needs to be connected back to the communities that surround schools. I really do believe that pupils can re-engage with learning with other people in a way that has never been able to happen before through intergenerational learning, local &#8220;plugin parnerships&#8221; with multi-agency input. But to do this people are going to have to be prepared to come out of their professional &#8220;bunkers&#8221; and get involved with others in new and imagine ways to reconfigure how they work together and do things.</p>
<p>I suspect that there is a cultural change going on that schools are entirely unequipped to deal with and that there is a distinct lack of vision and direction. What is obvious is that people are beginning to realise they have to co-create and collaborate in the future, to have dialogues and start to connect.</p>
<p>If TedXLondon holds true to its pledge that they will connect up all the organisations there that night online and towards a common purpose we may yet see the beginnings of more than just a series of inspirational talks.</p>
<p>I still do worry that all this talk is fairly paternalistic and that there is a fear that throwing off the reigns allowing people to follow their passions is just too unpragmatic. Too liberal arts wishy washy.</p>
<p>Well I think that is exactly what we should be doing. Don&#8217;t believe the false dichotomies of &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; subjects or the &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; exam and assessment system. I think we should be pulling people together to build new learning communities around the social hub of schools. To experiment, to fail, to get it right and to explore and find our passions. I also think we could achieve this with mentors from the local community and that we could have home grown cottage industries arising out of community activity that is purposeful and authentic and business and entrepreneurial activity that is not abstracted and self-serving but involves social enterprise as a motor for engagement and happiness.</p>
<p>At TedXLondon there were over a thousand curious and committed people, passionately interested in the idea of changing education, society and how we interact with each other. That, surely, is a small but significant  start.</p>
<p>The best and most hopeful speakers at TedXLondon, were, inevitably, the youngest. They are our future &#8211; why else are we here?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was live streaming audio from Exeter Cathedral as part of the Arts Project &#8211; the <a href="http://www.imagineproject.info">Imagineproject</a>.</p>
<p>It was quite a challenge to get a signal through those ancient walls and despite mountaineering sound engineers passing me down a wonderful audio feed I thought the network wasn&#8217;t going to manage it. But like all good projects I enjoy a challenge and I was able to buy a Mi-Fi box from 3 and happily broadcast out once all the cables were connected. </p>
<p>You can hear the result below &#8211; the whole project was extremely touching and one of the more interesting ones I have been involved with in recent years.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of upgrading my video and audio kit to broadcast quality, I invested in a FlashMic. I had to take a deep intake of breath before buying the beast but so far it has been worth every penny.</p>
<p>Since getting it I have made about 20 audio interviews with teachers, senior leaders and with others in unrelated projects as well as lending it out to others for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DigitameVideo#p/a/u/1/MSNmK1W6Fk4">ImagineProject </a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src=" http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6152715641_1f3a2dd15e.jpg" title="L4L FlashMic" class="alignnone" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>It has definitely increased my productivity and workflow and the sound is superb. </p>

<p>Will be researching/ filming over the next year for a 2013 release&#8230;</p>
<p>Realistically it will take me about 18 months &#8211; as well as documenting the history of TeachMeet and interviewing all the key players in the UK &#8211; I am looking for 3 &#8211; 4 teachers who plan to go to a teachmeet for the very first time. I&#8217;d be interested in documenting their reactions to the process. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be using broadcast quality equipment.  Please get in touch if you know anyone who would like to help. </p>

<p><em><strong>Steve Davy Year 4 NQT Teacher at the Wroxham School</strong></em></p>
<p>This tuesday 7th June 2011, I was at The Wroxham School to help out with filming and livestreaming a  <a title="TeachMeet WroxhamCPR" href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/38855223/TeachMeet-CPR">TeachMeet</a>. I have done a number of these over the years for free as a pro bono service for the education community. I feel, that as a practitioner and adviser, I have to keep my practice and knowledge about current good practice up to date and that means literally week on week and day to day. Education, for me, is all about community; a living breathing dynamic process in which we are all constantly engaged. Recording it means others can reflect on and think about these models.</p>
<p>The headteacher at <a title="Link to The Wroxham School" href="http://www.wroxham.herts.sch.uk/Home.html">The Wroxham School</a> is <a title="Link to details about Alison Peacock" href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/peacock/" target="_blank">Alison Peacock</a>, who also happens to be National Network Leader                        <span class="at">at </span> The Cambridge Primary Review. The presentations, in the main, came from the teachers at the school and the afternoon was a delight as I saw more and more excellent work. <a title="Link to Roger Billing's Blog" href="http://www.rogerbilling.co.uk/">Roger Billing</a> is the Deputy Head at the school and in his capable hands the afternoon was a complete success.</p>
<p>The majority of the people who were at the event were new to TeachMeets and were interested to see the model in practice.</p>
<p>One particular presentation, that of the Year 4 NQT Steve Davy, on his work in local history, stood out as quite amazing for someone in their first year of teaching. Steve started from a local pillbox on the nearby golf course &#8211; a remnant from WWII and opened out his whole project co-opting various members of the local community. For his Tudors project Steve co-opted the local bowling club and the afternoon culminated in the showing of a film the teachers and children made about the <a href="http://vimeo.com/24324842">Battle of Barnet</a>.</p>
<p>This is how to use technology and community to make history come alive! To be honest I was absolutely stunned by how Alison and her team have enabled Steve to produce such innovative work with the local community in only his first year.</p>
<p>I am glad to have captured the event on film. A big thankyou to Alison, Roger, Steve and all the teachers and parents for giving their permissions for this to be shown. <a title="Link to Whole Education" href="http://www.wholeeducation.org.uk">Whole Education</a> was part of this event and I think this whole ethos of inclusion with the local community in ways that have a bigger scope than just the immediate boundaries of the school is a big leap forwards. Let&#8217;s hope we see much more of this practice up and down the country.</p>

<p>As I now do at each new TeachMeet, I also take one or two non-intrusive Vox Pops with people new to the meetups and try to garner information about their attitude to the phenomenon.</p>

<p>I also talked with Steve afterwards about the ethos in the school and how he has managed his first year. I find these case studies are like gold dust for anyone interested in innovation in education in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Paradoxically it is the face to face, day to day interaction with the wider community that seems to bring with it the most engaging and compelling education. Hasn&#8217;t it always been the case? What is interesting about Steve&#8217;s practice is that he has involved older members of the community around the school to engage with the children &#8211; this model is touched on by Keri Facer in her new book <a title="Link to Keri Facer's Learning Futures" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Futures-Education-Technology-Social/dp/0415581435" target="_blank">Learning Futures</a> and it is fascinating to see the most successful schools adopting such a model of reaching out to the community and getting both young and old to share social experiences where each can gain from the other.</p>
<p>But somehow, somewhere along the line, I think our education system might have lost its way. The importance of schools helping to  forge and reinforce good social models for and with their immediate communities  needs to be taken seriously and is one of the key elements to any success academic or otherwise. Listen to the enthusiasm of Steve about his first year and the aspiration and support he has received from his colleagues. I know this may not be a revelation to many people but it reinforces how much work goes into laying the groundwork for excellent practice and this was certainly superb CPD.</p>
<p>This, for me, is &#8220;real education&#8221; and not Phonics tests or SATs. I well  up inside when I see how well this can be done and in all my years as an  adviser and innovation practitioner I never ever tire of projects like  this &#8211; they always bring with them an emotional and intellectual  charge that is invigorating and inspiring. People know authenticity when they see it and now deeply committed educators like these are succeeding because there&#8217;s no spin, no commercial selling, no dependency culture just a &#8216;can do&#8217; attitude and wider community involvement. That is why I film TeachMeets and that is why I love what I do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have just been informed by a Tweet that Teachers TV will be made available for <a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6081387&amp;s_cid=RESads_TTVvideos" target="_blank">download by the TES</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>In fact they have a very small selection of the archive up already at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6081871&amp;s_cid=RESads_TTVvideos" target="_blank">http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6081871&amp;s_cid=RESads_TTVvideos</a></p>
<p>but still none available for download I can see.</p>
<p>So along with <a title="Teachers Media " href="http://www.teachersmedia.co.uk/" target="_blank">Teachers Media</a> (the people behind making TeachersTV) and Ten Alps <a title="Schoolsworld" href="http://www.schoolsworld.tv/" target="_blank">SchoolsWorld</a> TV (a former Teachers TV investor) and a host of other companies yet to declare, it seems we are spoiled for choice. I am sure the market will decide which flavour of the resource is best and most useful in tandem with, other, new, resources.</p>
<p>However if you have been involved in the<a title="Twitter hashtag for #saveTTV" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23saveTTV" target="_blank"> #saveTTV </a>campaign <strong><em>I should still upload your files if asked to</em></strong>, as the TES and other companies have yet to clarify their exact position on this.</p>
<p>Obviously, if all companies are going to make files available for download then the campaign becomes redundant. But, in the meantime, people can see what the archives comprises of by going to the spreadsheet at:</p>
<p><a title="Teachers TV Archive Spreadsheet" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0" target="_blank">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0</a></p>
<p>and requesting access.</p>
<p><em><strong>We now have a fair percentage of the archive collated and available for peer to peer distribution as a stopgap. So please, if you are asked to, please continue to upload the files</strong></em>.</p>
<p>What this whole campaign has proved is that Teachers put an extremely high value on resources made for, about and with them &#8211; in the latter stages of Teachers TV the company was also helping teachers make their own programmes as in the<strong><em> Action! Teacher Video series</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone for their amazing work on highlighting the archive as an amazing resource and helping to bring the possible demise of the programmes to the attention of the wider teaching community.</p>
<p>As an exercise in crowdsourcing and direct action it was incredibly successful and shows what a dedicated group of teachers can do when they set their minds to it.</p>
<p>Watch this space for further news and developments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So if no-one is going to make Teachers TV programmes anymore in the future &#8211; why don&#8217;t we do it ourselves?</p>
<p>For a few years now I have been perfecting how to do this with minimal equipment and maximising the use of web based services &#8211; I think I would be able to run a Teachers TV equivalent on a shoestring and get people to upload their own content.</p>
<p>I think this should be a ground up initiative and involve schools at source and Social Enterprise services</p>
<p>Obviously people will have to think of IPR and copyright and privacy considerations but the few people who&#8217;d like to take this forwards &#8211; especially Schools, FE, HE and ITT institutions and organisations like the TDA &#8211;  I&#8217;d be very interested in working with you.</p>
<p>What do people think?</p>
<p>Let me know&#8230;</p>
<p>See the video below.</p>

<p>Well what a week it has been!</p>
<p>Since receiving a letter on the 21st April about the closure of Teachers TV on <strong>29th April</strong> and then proposing on twitter via the hashtag #saveTTV, that everyone should do exactly that: &#8220;save&#8221; Teachers TV, there have been so many wonderful things happen.</p>
<p>The next day I put up a Google Docs Spreadsheet for people to log their downloads and a small band of people got together the very next day and sat down to save all the Teachers TV videos.</p>
<p>I had suggested that they all be cached on a Dropbox and asked for funding:</p>
<p>Dawn Hallybone, Gideon Williams, Anne Fielder, Jackie Berry, DrBob (Teacher -West London), Robert Rollins, Jen Kenny, Sinclair Mackenzie, Stuart Swann, Colin Revell, Carol Rainbow, Heather Marshall, Alexander Bellars Theo Kuechel, Penny Patterson (twice!!), Dale Jones, John Heffernan, Alan Stewart and Ceri Williams all responded immediately and we had space for caching.</p>
<p>Four days later, thanks to the efforts of everyone below, everything has been saved.</p>

<p>If I have missed anyone out please accept my apologies.</p>
<p>During the last couple of hours before the site was due to go down, the TES and other major players said they had expressed an interest to the DfE about getting a licence to &#8220;stream&#8221; the entire video catalogue.</p>
<p>But all the archive has already been saved by teachers to their drives for use in UK schools under the Creative Archive licence.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the process even Andrew Bethell, the <span>ex CEO and Director of External Affairs at Teachers TV, said: </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Great work. this is an amazing affirmation of what we achieved  a real benefit to our users. Thanks.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What Next?</strong></p>
<p>Well &#8211; we now have a central list of people in possession of the video files. The DropBox will be used, not to distribute, but to cache the files for transfer to media to be used in UK schools and educational institutions.</p>
<p>In the meantime if you want something specific &#8211; ask one of the teachers on the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdFhtNDhIejRNSGpxQUNvV3FfcXdGNFE&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0" target="_blank">Google Doc spreadsheet list</a> of the series of files and I&#8217;m sure they will be of help.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the DfE has now repositioned its response by saying the files will all be back up in a couple of weeks&#8217; time but I suspect it may take longer than that. My question is, why weren&#8217;t they up straight after the site is being shut down? Anyway, we have yet to see&#8230;</p>
<p>#saveTTV was never intended to be a distribution system, merely an interim measure, but everyone is well aware teachers prefer to have the physical files &#8220;in-house&#8221; because you try giving CPD to colleagues or a lesson starter to a group of Year 9&#8242;s on a wet Wednesday afternoon. The #saveTTV initiative is intended to complement any streaming service that will emerge in the future.</p>
<p>What we need now, is a weekly CPD Teachers TV station on YouTube. Anyone up for that?</p>
<p>Thank you again everyone. I will be in touch &#8211; give me a week to let the dust settle please. Get in touch by email in the meantime.</p>
<p>Best Wishes and enjoy the holiday!</p>

<p>Thank you everyone who made possible the creation of a DropBox for caching the Teachers&#8217; TV Videos.</p>
<p>I am going to hold fire on the process of making a DropBox until Tuesday &#8211; I want to be absolutely sure that people will be able to upload the files and that they can be re-encoded within the terms of the Creative Licence.</p>
<p>I have just heard from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/richardanderson" target="_blank">@richardanderson</a> that all the files are on <strong>iTunes U</strong> but from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markw29" target="_blank">@markw29</a> that they will be removed imminently.</p>
<p>But in the meantime I would like anyone who can, to now donate something even more valuable, <em><strong>their time</strong></em>!</p>
<p>Please could you put aside a few minutes to downloading at least one of the Teachers&#8217; TV videos and putting up the details and your contact details on the Google Doc for the purpose of sharing who has got what and where:</p>
<p><a title="Link to the Google Doc Spreadsheet" href="http://bit.ly/fbJJed" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/fbJJed</a></p>
<p>In this way it becomes a truly peer to peer process and does not infringe the Creative Licence in any way.</p>
<p>The DropBox will initially be used to &#8220;cache&#8221; the vids so people can transfer them in bulk to their local school servers or hard drives for use in UK Schools only and proof of working in a UK school and being responsible for the resource will be required. It will also be useful for batch re-encoding groups of films that have not been encoded for QuickTime or MP4 format as well. <em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I am NOT acting as a distributer but merely enabling a Peer to Peer process between school communities as allowed by the <a href="http://www.teachers.tv/creativearchive" target="_blank">Creative Archive Licence</a>.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>So can I ask you to:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Go to Teachers&#8217; TV and choose a file to download.</p>
<p><a title="Link to Teachers' TV" href="http://www.teachers.tv/" target="_blank">http://www.teachers.tv/</a></p>
<p><strong>or you can download the files easily (and faster) from iTunes U</strong> before the end of the week because they are being cut then.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Download and check off that this film series doc and check it hasn&#8217;t been downloaded in that area:</p>
<p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdFhtNDhIejRNSGpxQUNvV3FfcXdGNFE&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdFhtNDhIejRNSGpxQUNvV3FfcXdGNFE&amp;hl=en_GB</a></p>
<p>@BobToms100 has suggested you might also use <a href="http://www.getright.com" target="_blank">www.getright.com</a> to throttle up downloads from TTV in tandem with Firefox&#8217;s Flashgot app that works with Getright. B<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ut bear in mind it <strong>only downloads the lower resolution films&#8230; </strong></span><strong>Correction GetRight allows you to control the download speed.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Go to the Google Docs page and check it hasn&#8217;t already been downloaded:</p>
<p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0" target="_blank">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0</a></p>
<p>People can pick a &#8220;series&#8221; and mark this off before adding to the detail sheet. To quote Penny:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The main categories are huge and have much overlap – the series do not have any overlap.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>So that can help you determine and winnow what you want to download.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong>Download the TeachersTV file if you are a Teachers TV subscriber using the tools above or just right clicking. Or use the faster methods outlined in <strong>2)</strong> above.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teachers.tv/" target="_blank">http://www.teachers.tv/</a></p>
<p>Be sure to check you can download the film under the right license :</p>
<p>See here for details:  <a href="http://saveteacherstvvideos.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">http://saveteacherstvvideos.wikispaces.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Fill in the spreadsheet with your file details <strong>and your contact details</strong>. Make sure first that the Video File is under the Creative Archive Licence as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0" target="_blank">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0</a></p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Check that someone isn&#8217;t duplicating your effort by already working through a series &#8211; see Penny&#8217;s doc above.</p>
<p>Five people have already managed to download almost a tenth of the 3,500 files on there &#8211; your one download could spread the load of work.</p>

<p><strong>Remember we now only have 6 days to do this.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure the Vids will be streamed by some third party organisation in the future for free but how can we ensure we take control of this resource now in the community for the community&#8217;s benefit in a way that truly works?</p>
<p>This will show the power of the network and how ICT can be used quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the people who have donated:</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Dawn Hallybone, Gideon Williams, Anne Fielder, Jackie Berry, DrBob (Teacher -West London), Robert Rollins, Jen Kenny, Sinclair Mackenzie, Stuart Swann, Colin Revell, Carol Rainbow, Heather Marshall, Alexander Bellars,Theo Kuechel, Penny Patterson (Twice and she&#8217;s downloaded over 150 films), Dale Jones, John Heffernan, Alan Stewart, Ceri Williams, Kevin Mc Laughlin, Lara Savory, William Gibbon, Rosemary Slosek.</em></strong></p>
<p>If I have missed anyone out please let me know.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> And thank you to all the people currently beavering away at downloading the videos and filling in the spreadsheet &#8211; especially &#8211; @AmandaWilson169, @mrmackenzie, Gregory Canderson, @CLaireJoanne35 and Stuart Swann &#8211; you are all amazing people working late into the night on Easter Weekend!!!!!</p>
<p>Immense thanks to :</p>
<p>Bill Gibbon, Dan (@moodledan), Penny Patterson, RIchard Anderson &#8211;  who have all downloaded almost a tenth of the archive already and  filling in their efforts on the Google Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>In the event that the DropBox cannot be used we&#8217;ll refund the donations or seek a workaround and consult everyone.</p>
<p><strong>The main thing at the moment is that the films are downloaded and information about who has them should be shared as quickly as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Once again thanks to everyone who has given their time on this so far. The response has been amazing!</p>
<p><em>For years people have been saying how useful is ICT? &#8211; well now is the time to show them, perhaps? It will, at the very least, give a strong message to the powers that be, how socially agile ICT teachers are and how organised.</em></p>
<p><strong>Latest addition</strong> &#8211; I have started a Wiki about the licensing &#8211; that tells you what is safe to download and what isn&#8217;t &#8211; please keep all debates <a href="http://saveteacherstvvideos.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">there</a> (<a href="http://saveteacherstvvideos.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">http://saveteacherstvvideos.wikispaces.com/</a>)  and on the <a title="#saveTTV" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23saveTTV" target="_blank">#saveTTV hashtag</a> on Twitter or with the #saveTTV in other blogs.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for an amazing day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the government is wiping Teachers TV and all the videos that go with it and they are doing it in the Easter holidays in seven days time from this post on 29th April but they are opening up offers of third party organisations to host and stream it.</p>
<p><a title="DfE announcement on Teachers TV and what will happen" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/toolsandinitiatives/teacherstv?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Shut+Down+Secondary+1" target="_blank">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/toolsandinitiatives/teacherstv?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Shut+Down+Secondary+1</a></p>
<p>Unless there has been some done deals already then hosting and streaming is going to be expensive on any one organisation&#8217;s budget especially in these cash strapped times&#8230;</p>
<p>So how can you save this vital resource at grass roots level quickly and easily? Well here&#8217;s one way I am going to suggest &#8211; I am not sure if it breaks T&amp;C&#8217;s with the Licence but we&#8217;ll suck it and see.</p>
<p>I am putting up a <a title="Save Teachers TV" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqOhBi9yGR1LdHlYREszU0I5anRHX2tVM0VPLWZhWmc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0" target="_blank">Google Doc</a> for people to put down the programmes they have saved and the format they have saved them in. This is the MOST important part because UK schools can get in touch with other educational professionals in UK schools to get hold of resources. This, surely, is the BIG SOCIETY idea everyone is talking about&#8230;</p>
<p>I am starting the ball rolling by downloading the 24 Hard to Teach Videos and re-encoding them in MP4.</p>
<p>I am also setting up a Dropbox for 100 GB But I need paypal donations, please, to pay for the 100 GB space &#8211; it currently costs £182.00 for a year&#8217;s subscription. All donations from UK schools and teachers will be given access to the box. I must state quite clearly here I am not asking for money or profiting from distributing files outside of the UK &#8211; this is merely a donation to a 100GB dropbox in the first instance. NO money or profit is being made from this process. Only UK schools will have access.</p>
<p>There is only 7 days to organise and do this &#8211; please help save the TeachersTV archive and stop it getting into the hands of big commercial concerns who, possibly, will plaster advertising all over it for exchange of data.</p>
<p>We have 7 days to appropriate the content for ourselves and remash and localise to our heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><strong>Remember &#8211; films can only be distributed within UK and UK schools &#8211; check each <a title="Creaive Archive Licence" href="http://www.teachers.tv/creativearchive" target="_blank">licence</a> individually before download &#8211; some of the later ones are full copyright.</strong> <strong><em>Please, please fill in the Google doc.</em></strong></p>
<p>The hashtag for this on Twitter is #saveTTV</p>
<p><strong>We have reached the  £180 in a few hours and 300 files downloaded (almost a 10th of the archive). I will now make a web post about what happens next.</strong></p>

I prefer film, edited and unedited, these days, as a medium of communication. When this post comes out there will also be a link to a live streamed debate at the <a href="#RFSEDIT">bottom of the page</a> to <a href="http://reallyfreeschool.org/" target="_blank">The Really Free School</a> in Bloomsbury, London on 10th February 2011 where the conversation will continue in other forms.</p>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of education?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/resstaff/profile.php?name=Keri&amp;%20surname=Facer" target="_blank">Keri</a> (Facer) asks in the <a href="http://purposed.org.uk/2011/02/lets-get-this-party-started/" target="_blank">first post</a> of this purpos/ed project:</p>
<p>What is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summum_bonum" target="_blank">Good</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society" target="_blank">Life</a>?  (she actually talks about Society but I interpret it like this).<br />
What is your vision for the Good Life and how can education help in that  process of creating that vision for a Better Life?</p>
<p>For me we have to start by <a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/scenarios/world-1/#scenario1" target="_blank">reconnecting communities</a> with learning. I’m with <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2011/02/purposed-its-not-about-the-purpose-of-education-its-about-whether-we-want-people-to-learn-at-all.html" target="_blank">Ewan</a> (McIntosh) on this one in the fact that <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fredgarnett/fg-ouemergenttable" target="_blank">learning</a> is paramount but in terms of how we reconnect learners with themselves and their interests and curiosities;  that is what the purpose of education is for me.</p>
<p>Because then that leads to a more <a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/scenarios/world-3" target="_blank">cohesive</a>, <a href="http://www.designingforcivilsociety.org/" target="_blank">civilised</a> and wholesome society where things are more genuine, more authentic, more <a href="http://www.digital2020.org.uk/blog/2010/07/26/the-rise-of-social-media-surgeries-in-yorkshire-and-the-humber/" target="_blank">plumbed into</a> how we connect as people and how we learn, and how we build those relationships and those communities in terms of how we want to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Towns" target="_blank">move forwards</a> in our lives towards happiness and Well Being.</p>
<p>And, for me, learning has always been about curiosity; engagement; reaching out; building <a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/19975349/FrontPage" target="_blank">networks</a> between people for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good" target="_blank">Common Good</a>.</p>
<p>I think, in many ways, our communities have lost their way:</p>
<p>- whether they are more able and aspirational &#8211; they are disconnected from their learning and obsessed with achievement;</p>
<p>whether they are not so able, and dysfunctional, and, therefore, cannot connect with their learning -</p>
<p>they have not got the courage of having <a href="http://cetl.matcmadison.edu/efgb/3/3_3_5.htm" target="_blank">self-validated learning</a> through their communities and, for me, we have to move on to that.</p>
<p>Now that’s quite a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire" target="_blank">radical vision</a> and the vision is: we <a href="http://wholeeducation.org/" target="_blank">reconnect our communities</a> back to their learning.</p>
<p>We need to drive that learning using new technologies, social networks and networks in general between people. That entails changing or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism" target="_blank">reconfiguring</a> how we <a href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/"target="_blank">do</a> things. It means we have to take the structures that are traditional and remodel them for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_education" target="_blank">different</a> learning spaces we can now <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=690" target="_blank">inhabit</a>.</p>
<p>I feel, in the coming years new technologies, <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PennState2009.html" target="_blank">social media</a>, will afford us more ways in which to <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/get-your-group-on-introducing-posterous-group" target="-blank">connect</a>; we have to be <a href="http://www.dark-mountain.net/about-2/the-project/" target="_blank">imaginative</a>; we have to take the <a href="http://www.newcultureoflearning.com/newcultureoflearning.html" target="_blank">initiative</a> and connect our communities back to learning in a more authentic way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html" target="_blank">Sugata Mitra</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxYgpQhsrU" target="_blank">Granny Cloud</a> and self-sustaining, self-building communities of interest are the way forwards I feel. They can help evolve and make ways in which we can learn, ways in which we can authentically connect with each other, and spark that curiosity; that wonderful way of learning about stuff and sharing it with each other, and pulling ourselves up and creating a Better Life.</p>
<p>So that is my vision and the purpose of education.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have filmed so many conversations at BETT2011 that I have decided to put up a dedicated <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?page_id=240" target="_blank">TV channel</a> to the content. Of course there is so much content it will take me weeks to get it out.</p>
<p>So I have decided to devote an area of this site to the films and live video feeds as they happen over the year. I do so many of them now I feel all those marvellous conversations would be wasted if there wasn&#8217;t a smart way to put the information up in manageable packets.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a quick preview of the service I&#8217;m going to be rolling out for free in the next few weeks&#8230;.</p>
<p>I hope, as usual, people find these ideas useful:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m here at the marvellous <a href="http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.co" target="_blank">Learning Without Frontiers conference</a> and I&#8217;m multitasking with streaming, twittering and closely observing all the presenters and it&#8217;s a bit like <a href="http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html" target="_blank">the blind men and the elephant</a> all over again. Each presenter has one part of the solution but no-one seems to be stating the obvious.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/edvaizey" target="_blank">Ed Vaizey</a> is here representing the government. Disregarding the fact that the DfE wasn&#8217;t represented here at all, he made a good fist of trying to understand the landscape. He mentioned the NESTA research into <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/press/assets/features/weakest_link_found_in_subjects_necessary_for_careers_in_video_games_and_visual_effects" target="_blank">Gaming and Education </a>with an emphasis on lack of understanding of the role of Academic Subjects in Gaming but what he didn&#8217;t point out was this other scheme which is focused on the <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/creative_industries/hyper_island" target="_blank">Creative Industries</a>; maybe the &#8220;softer&#8221; subjects don&#8217;t count or no-one had bothered to find out or promote this side of what NESTA is doing, to him?</p>
<p>Never mind &#8211; I&#8217;m not one to nitpick I&#8217;m more interested in practical strategies that will work or at least have a possibility of making change happen rather worrying about government ed policy in this area. Ed&#8217;s argument that the Games industry happened despite there being no kit in schools is true. In the early 80&#8242;s &#8211; if you had the money &#8211; you could buy a cheap home computer and you could teach yourself to program on it &#8211; few schools had them. But the problem is now that if there are no computers at school and if you don&#8217;t have one at home then where are you going to get access? Well I remember back in the early 90&#8242;s &#8211; young children in my class didn&#8217;t have a computer but in central London they paid for access themselves at the early computer cafes.</p>
<p>Next up was Derek Robertson showing wonderful videos about children&#8217;s expertise in the home with Gaming Kit. One question he was asked was about teachers being able to cope with lots of children who want to learn about gaming, game construction and then I kind of lost it&#8230;</p>
<p>The teachers don&#8217;t have the expertise to deal with this?!! So what we have is a situation where kids are frisked for their skills at the school gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you got there? Oh it&#8217;s a piece of knowledge and expertise I don&#8217;t understand/can&#8217;t manage &#8211; that&#8217;s dangerous &#8211; empty out your pockets and, possibly your head.&#8221; Unfair &#8211; I know but Derek clearly shows that the skills, knowledge, expertise are IN THE HOME so why not focus on that arena and co-opt it with the school. Why are we still thinking in terms of institutional vs community silos?</p>
<p>OK so I have been thinking about what would level the playing field and open out the opportunities for learning. Well it would seem to me that it isn&#8217;t about devices any more &#8211; it is about connectivity and the social contracts and spaces real or virtual, around that.</p>
<p>Her&#8217;s one model:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9294368.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9294368.stm</a></p>
<p>Now imagine it is about the connectivity and access rather than silos and gatekeeping?</p>
<p>Number one &#8211; the divisions between home and school are brought in under the same umbrella so some of them can be managed one and the same.</p>
<p>Number two &#8211; the learning space between home and school is connected &#8211; never mind VLEs &#8211; you can have those if you want but so long as you have the connectivity you can put whatever device or platform (even a gaming one) you want on it. What is more important is how you manage the community?</p>
<p>This necessarily means moving the focus around as well &#8211; sometimes into the home where the kids can show their expertise &#8211; where they are most comfortable in showing expertise. At other times in the school &#8211; at other times elsewhere; in virtual and real arenas. Let&#8217;s mix it up.</p>
<p>Number three &#8211; have a community learning manager as well as a head teacher- change people&#8217;s roles. What would that entail?</p>
<p>How about this &#8211; building community &#8211; putting in management services to enable learning where learning is happening. Sort out licensing, e-safety and e-community footprints. Teach digital literacy awareness &#8211; build alternate spaces that move to where the &#8220;real&#8221; learning is happening and facilitate that. Build a workable foundation that enables rather than blocks &#8211; how many people would relish that challenge?</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; make the school a social and academic hub but extend out and embrace the local area and make transparent how people learn. Notice I am not talking about kit here &#8211; if you are truly wired into your community &#8211; you are agile enough, innovative enough, flexible enough to adapt to any system and you teach that too, and make that process transparent to others and you will learn to build in those systems if you have connectivity being ubiquitous and commutative between different physical spaces.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t frisk the kids &#8211; you invite them in &#8211; you embrace their skills and you make that learning and how you enable that learning, transparent to everyone else and bring them along with you. Remember we are all in this together&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about how well you bring people together; how quick you can think on your feet; how well you manage other people.</p>
<p>Get commercial firms to sponsor connectivity, take the focus away from the school and bring it into the wider community. Build new jobs and roles around this new larger scope with a wider vision of what education and learning could mean?</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; Learning Without Frontiers &#8211; but let&#8217;s start with our own back yard.</p>
