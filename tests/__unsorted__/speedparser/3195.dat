			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gas is really cheap in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Louisiana</span>, $2.49!<span id="more-4"></span></p>
<p>I want good headphones for my <span class="blsp-spelling-error">ipod</span>, these sound like they are about to blow. Now that I think about it, it would actually be somewhat pointless, because I rarely use my headphones since I usually listen to my <span class="blsp-spelling-error">ipod</span> in my car&#8230; and the only time besides family road trips when I&#8217;d use then is in <span class="blsp-spelling-error">school</span> when I have to be <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">conspicuous</span>, so big bulky headphones probably aren&#8217;t the best idea.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like high pitched rappers. <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Akon</span>, T-Pain&#8230; *thumbs down*</p>
<p>51cents! <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Ha</span>. I hate when gas stations do that, leave out the dollar amount for gas. So we can assume the dollar amount, which would obviously by 2, but I see it and get <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">temporarily</span> really stoked, then I just feel dumb.</p>
<p>I love overpasses. I think they are pretty. When there is a ton of them all around crossing <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">over</span> each other and curving around. That would be my dream. A bunch of overpasses, in the middle of a forest of ivy, moss, and willow trees. With a big building and a waterfall.</p>
<p><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Bizarre</span>, a man in a suit driving a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">door less</span> jeep.</p>
<p>Just passed a baseball stadium that had a strange haze around it.</p>
<p>I bet you&#8217;d meet the most interesting people working at a Waffle House. I think I want to do that at some point in my life.</p>
<p>I hate silent letters. Knife, Gnat, they just don&#8217;t make sense. I want to make the perfect language, no silent letters, no crazy exceptions, just simple words.</p>
<p>4:45, just crossed into Texas.</p>
<p>My <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Sobe</span> lid says &#8216;Slow Your Roll&#8217; which is interesting, because I was just thinking about how I just want to start taking every day as it is, and enjoy it more fully. And stop living so much in the future, because I am constantly thinking about what is going to happen for me in the future, and not really looking at what I can do now to make that happen. I also look at the past a lot too. Not <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">necessarily</span> regret, just thinking about what I do that screws myself over and how to improve upon that.</p>
<p>I think I want to live in Texas again at some point in my life. There is just something about it that I love.</p>
<p>Just saw a sign for &#8220;Friendship <span class="blsp-spelling-error">BoBo</span> Baptist Church&#8221;. Sounds like a fun church.</p>
<p>I miss my cat, Buster.</p>
<p>Speaking of cats, I miss <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kavita</span>. As annoying as it was to wake up to her clawing me in my sleep, she was like a child to me. I litter trained her, and taught her to drink from the water bowl. She was so adorable. I hope she is doing well. I wish I could visit her.</p>
<p><span class="blsp-spelling-error">McDonalds</span> with <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Wi</span>-<span class="blsp-spelling-error">Fi</span>! Texas has some pretty up-scale <span class="blsp-spelling-error">McDonalds</span>. <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Nacogdoches</span> is really cute, there are a lot of donut shops. It screams college town, <span class="blsp-spelling-error">hah</span>.</p>
<p>My brother gave us a &#8220;rolling tour&#8221; of the town. It made me kind of excited for college, because he showed us this street that he said he always partied at. And shows us the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Sorority</span> and Fraternity houses, and I decided I&#8217;ll probably join one, because it just sounds kind of fun.</p>
<p>Our hotel had complementary Cookies and Milk! And anyone who knows me, knows that I&#8217;ll only drink skim milk, but they only had 2%, so I drank it. I can honestly say I was really proud of myself.</p>
<p>Scott took us to this taco place, its this little 24 hour taco shanty, with two little <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Mexican</span> ladies just making food. It was cute. I scoped some <span class="blsp-spelling-error">hotties</span> too. <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Hah</span>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a cool article the other day about the brain. <span id="more-3"></span>It was something along the lines of the 10 biggest mysteries of the brain, and one of the mysteries was what the point of sleep was. There were many theories, but the one I thought was coolest has to do with memories. It said that sleep was a way for the brain to discard unwanted rubbish and store the &#8220;good&#8221; memories. It made me think of the memories that my brain decided were &#8220;good&#8221;, and which ones were &#8220;bad&#8221;. The ones that stick the most were memories in which people said or did really nice things to me, and those moments when I laughed uncontrollably. There were also those moments that made my heart drop, like the day my dad told me that him and my mother were getting divorced. I can remember those moments so vividly, almost down to every word. I have very vivid memories involving ceiling fans too. Maybe it is a sign that they will play an important role in my life.</p>
<p>I really like kudzu, I think there is an overwhelming, untamed, kind of beauty to it. It just looks natural and untouched. And the figures that it makes, make it look so mysterious, like you never know what lies behind it.</p>
<p>I hate when you write about thinking so much that all you can think about is writing.</p>
<p>Death Cab makes for perfect road music. As does Coldplay. We are passing through Atlanta and it makes me want to be watching ATL. T.I. is a very attractive man.</p>
<p>I just had a very blonde moment. I was thinking to myself that there are a lot of Georgia tags around here, then I realized that it is probably because Atlanta is in Georgia. hah.</p>
<p>Those trucks that carry cars always make me nervous. Not tow trucks, but the ones that carry like 6 cars. I just saw one loaded up with Cadillac Escalades and thought how horrid it would be if one fell.</p>
<p>I realized there are a lot of things I want, but I don&#8217;t consider it &#8220;materialistic&#8221;. I consider myself relatively simple, there are just a few technologies that I desire. iMac, Blackberry Pearl, New lense for my camera, new keyboard, but I feel like these things would help better my art.</p>
<p>It is very hard to remain manly while driving a &#8216;new&#8217; Volkswagon beetle (by new I mean any year after 1980). It is just a very feminine car. You can drive a Jetta or a Cabrio, or basically any other car, just not a beetle unless it is from the seventies. I saw a man driving a bright yellow beetle, with a bunch of little yellow sunflowers in the vase. He was old, and it was probably his wife&#8217;s, so it was cute, but definately not manly. I realized though, that I can&#8217;t think of many &#8216;manly&#8217; cars, maybe I&#8217;m a feminist.</p>
<p>I hate when you go somewhere to pee, and there is only one bathroom. Because then I feel rushed, and like the people waiting outside can hear me. Speaking of unplesant bathroom expieriences, I hate when you go and there is hair, and/or pee on the seat. Because I feel gross using it even after wiping it off. Every restroom should have a sign above the toilet that reads, in the words of my fifth grade gifted teacher Mrs. Dowling:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;font-family:trebuchet ms;">&#8220;</span>Please Be Neat And Wipe The Seat<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:courier new;">&#8220;</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>As I look out in front of me I see the winding road, and the sun turning the sky an orangey hue from behind the mountains. Oh how I love nature and all it has to offer. Mother Earth provides such beautiful things for us to see and I want to see it <span style="font-weight:bold;">all</span>. It is a shame how many people are so distracted and do not take the time to truely appreciate it.</p>
<p>We are stopping in Meridian, Mississippi for the night.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size:130%;"> </span></p></blockquote>
