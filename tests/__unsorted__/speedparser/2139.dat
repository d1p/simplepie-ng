		<description><![CDATA[...so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a famous quote from the <a title="The Man in the Arena" href="http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html" target="_blank">Speech by Theodore Roosevelt,</a> given in Paris in 1910. The quote goes something like this</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who              points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds              could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is              actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and              blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and              again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but              who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms,              the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at              the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who              at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so              that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who              neither know victory nor defeat.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>And after reading this&#8230; I question myself&#8230;am I one of the souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>

We as in both, the people who can afford and pay taxes and the people who cannot afford  two square meals a day!!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Whilst the job of the so called Govt of India is to look after its citizens, the objective seems to be shifting more towards scoring high on profit and growth numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">India has a huge population which lives below the poverty line who endure great pains just to have two square meals a day. India also has a good number of people who fall in the categories of HNW Individuals, Upper class, Upper-middle class and lower middle class&#8230;.of we can go on in dividing the demography of the country into various classes!! But basically it falls into two broad categories, people who pay taxes and are able to earn a decent living and people who are not able to do that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Govt. of India uses the tax money mainly to give provide for the politicians, either by salary which keeps on going high every year or by the various innovative methods of corruption these politicians come up with. Whatever little that remains, is used for the development of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the money mentioned is used to buy grains and other edible material from the farmers and give them at a concessional rate to the poor people. Well, at the first look it sure is a novel idea and act up as a balancing act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But what happens when, the bought food is not sold to the poor but rots in the store of the country? The food prices for the people who can afford rises because a portion of the supply is removed and the poor are still left hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our spineless judiciary did take note of this and rightly directed the Govt of India to give them away for free to the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does our famed PM respond to this, that it will remove the incentive from the farmers to produce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My question here is, will it ?? I believe the farmers will be interested in the money we give them in exchange of the grain and not what we do with the grain? So if the Govt of India is really worried about the incentive to farmers then it should give them a higher price for their goods. AND not create an artificial hike in the price by removing the supply, in the name of providing for the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole fiasco just outlines how we are being duped by our so called Govt. of India!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We as in both, the people who can afford and pay taxes and the people who cannot afford  two square meals a day!!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I am feeling as the Legacy Character all over again ...!!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s conversation left me in a state of shock. In state where I couldn&#8217;t understand what happened. What role did I play .. or do I play, what is the truth and what actually are my beliefs. I was surprised to see the person in the state in which I usually am, and even more to find myself to play the role what I was playing.</p>
<p>But I cannot fail to highlight, that the immediate feeling I had when the conversation was over, was the feeling of great distance. The feeling that I have really lost ground and suddenly I am no longer as important as I thought I was&#8230;Suddenly I started to feel like the Legacy Character all over again&#8230;!!!</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong !!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8230;there I just said it, </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I am scared you will forget about me&#8230;!!</em></p>

and two weeks into this lifestyle…I think I am liking it. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Its been 10 years since I have left home.</p>
<p>I lay in my bed, and I have this feeling in my head. I can&#8217;t seem to define it…but it reminds me of some other time. As I then, sat in that chair, in the evening thinking…what next. That was 10 years ago, when I first left my home. When I first left the comfort of family. The kind of comfort which comes only from family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past 10 years, the ride has its fair share of ups and downs. Times when I knew I was reaching new heights&#8230;and then times when I knew I was exploring new bottoms. I have been fortunate know many people &#8230;and at the end, better able to understand myself&#8230; Also, over the course of these 10 years, I found a comfort of another kind. The comfort of my friends…and now, as I lay in the bed, the same thoughts come rushing back… of may be something … of asking … what next?</p>
<p>What has changed??</p>
<p>Well I have gone the single biggest of change in my lifestyle…since leaving home.</p>
<p>and two weeks into this lifestyle…I think I am liking it.</p>

Govt. of India now seems just like any other corporation in the world, and does not have a very good management, and whats worse is, it has tremendous power in its hand. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been thinking about the recently concluded Spectrum auction that was held recently in India. The thoughts have been from different angles, some from technical points, some from business points and few from conceptual points.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The recently concluded so called 3G auction raked in huge chunks of money for the government. But is it really good for us? Ofcourse, the huge spectrum costs, along with the huge costs to roll out the network infrastructure will be passed on to the end customers, that would be us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">India, for long has had the lowest Telecom rates in the world. Many attribute it to the competition brought in by the government policies. Well I think it is not that straight forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The competition part is true, but it is not because of good government policies, partly yes but thats not the whole story. It also because the spectrum was sold at an exceptionally cheap price.  The new companies rolled out networks charged the user at around 50% of the calling charges of the already set in players, mainly to capture market share. Smaller companies which can survive on lesser margins started the price war. The end product, cheaper call rates for the users. In the meantime the hue and cry is over the media that Government of India licensed the spectrum at dead cheap price, and inturn lost a lot of money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But then,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> When did the Government of India became a Corporation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheaper prices translate to cheaper call rates to user, which allows them to have bigger purchasing power in other places. So, the general public does benefit out of it and moreover, they get to decide how to spend it. This is instead of passing that money to GoI and then ends up in pockets of Politicians and other corruption black holes, which suck in money with no accountability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would prefer the present outcome of 2G spectrum. And moreover, I am quite skeptical how affordable the 3G technology would translate to us, compared even to the Broadband Wireless also known as 4G. I am quite hopeful, that we will have better rates in calls and broadband connection in the 4G spectrum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, the senior Ambani brother may have pulled out the Ace on everyone else and he may jump start the 4G revolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With all these thoughts, <em>I have started to see the general Public of India as different from the Government of India</em>, and I have begin to believe that our interest do not necessarily align. Govt. of India now seems just like any other corporation in the world, and one which does not have a very good management. Whats worse , it has tremendous power for its disposal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally&#8230;after weeks of trying&#8230;I have finally given up. I hope only  temporarily. On my way back from lunch, I grabbed the half litre, caffeine filled coffee to my desk. Yes, my tryst to increase the quantity of blood in my caffeine system has taken a set back. Only because I wanted to concentrate more on my web surfing and usual LBDN instead of pretending to be awake while sleeping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it related to me not posting more blogs here. Ofcourse,  blogging has been a good way of LBDN, but I hope it is not because of this reason. My brains ability to churn out thoughts has somehow reduced inspite of having few people who continuously pester me to post. Yes, the word &#8216;pester&#8217; has be used!!! I think is more to do with the tools of the new social media, posting of one liners, also known as micro-blogging. As some of the connected people would have noticed that, when I was deprived of the Internet, I had resorted to these mediums to let go of my mental rants in few characters. Mostly on Twitter and few times on Facebook. My habit of Micro-blogging has left me feeling comfortable with unpursued thoughts. And now, I am able to churn out decent posts, reading which I can relate myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I have posted sub-quality posts many times in the past, I have refrained from them a lot more. And unlike some of the other blogs I read, I do not want  to post just for the sake of posting, and hence, I the huge gaps. Yes, like everyone else, I also suffer from mental black holes. Which suck every thought thrown to them and refuse to let out anything worthwhile. Infact, even crap is not coming to me know. So, I have resorted to being blank rather then type posts which are like&#8230;ummm&#8230; this one in nature!!! <img src='http://www.kidunltd.com/scribbles/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having said that, I will continue diluting blood in my body and end this here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope I will no longer pretend to be awake while sleeping!!!</p>
