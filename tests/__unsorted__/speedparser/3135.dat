		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.panoptican.org/words/?p=714">&lt;p&gt;I would sit in my Driftwood Room in Cloquet, Minnesota in various positions throughout the tiny, confined space listening to his stories. I would sit with my back aligned horizontally across the mattress, my legs dangling from the edge of the bed. I would sit sometimes half upon the sheets my upper body and head hanging upside down and the blood would rush in great waves of discomfort to my brain and I would be listening to his stories. I would sit standing upon my feet pacing the entire length of the ten foot room. I would sit on the dresser where the cable television sat, my arm resting on the television&amp;#8217;s shoulder and my legs crossed as I thought superficially about the story he was telling. I would sit in the chair before my computer screen and I would have the look of staring with great concentration at something on the CRT but all I was doing was listening to his stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamen Walker&amp;#8217;s Your Radio Nightlight was a sporadically produced radio program broadcast on WZBC Boston during a four-year period spanning 2000 to 2004. I don&amp;#8217;t know what WZBC Boston is, but I happened across the radio program no less. In 2005 and 2006, Benjamen Walker was producing a different, but similar, radio program called Benjamen Walker&amp;#8217;s Theory of Everything and on that program&amp;#8217;s now defunct website toeradio.org, Benjamen Walker made available the MP3s of thirteen Your Radio Nightlife episodes. I sat and listened to them each during a short stretch of time. I would work during the day in my Driftwood Room on market research, telecommuting to Cedar Rapids, Iowa from Cloquet, Minnesota and I would put in my hours during the day. Afterward, at least during this stretch of time, I would listen to Benjamen Walker&amp;#8217;s Your Radio Nightlight in three episode bursts with lengthy, arbitrary breaks in between episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Radio Nightlight tells the stories of the depraved individuals living and working among us in a documentary fashion that any listener of Radio Lab or This American Life is surely familiar with. In Your Radio Nightlife, Benjamen Walker interviews the principal characters involved in these post-modern fantasies and more often than not, the stories he tells are his own. During the show, Benjamen Walker asks these many curious bystanders penetrating questions about the absurd circumstances of his stories, for instance how did he come to meet a three-headed dog and what are these men chasing us with guns for? Listening to these observant people calmly explain to the excitable and dramatic Benjamen Walker how these total fucking insane events came to pass you get the unnerving feeling that these people are agents of the situation. These people are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamen Walker narrates his radio programs, sometimes in the first-person and sometimes in the third-person, in a stressful tone. Sometimes listening to Benjamen Walker I would hold my breath for long periods of time. I would stop breathing so that I could hear perfectly what he was going to say next. More often than not, he would surprise me with a quick plot change or witty turn of phrase but even in those moments, I could not shake the feeling that I was induced to choke myself at the sheer drama of his stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the recent past, the episodes of Your Radio Nightlight detailed below went offline. Through various re-formats of my hard drive and the accidental disposal of DVDs containing my archive of Benjamen Walker, I lost possessions of these stories. Thanks to the awesome power of &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/137301/Looking-for-Your-Radio-Nightlight"&gt;Ask Metafilter&lt;/a&gt; (in particular, the gallant &lt;a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17975"&gt;knave&lt;/a&gt;), I now once again possess thirteen episodes of Your Radio Nightlife. I make available these thirteen episodes as a service to the public, may we all enjoy Your Radio Nightlife forever more.&lt;/p&gt;

Read the whole &lt;a href="http://noise.panoptican.org/post/220890817/preslav-literary-school-ohrid-must-die" target="_blank"&gt;Preslav Literary School post&lt;/a&gt; with sonic accompaniment, as it was originally intended.

&lt;p&gt;This man next door has drilled a hole through the wall separating my kitchen from his hallway. He stands at the other side of the wall, his eye peering into my kitchen at all hours of the day and he waits for me to engage him in a bit of conversation. We speak through the hole in the wall, our communication compressed into tidy bits of regurgitated information. Sometimes he asks me about the stars in the sky, he says heâ€™s never seen them before. I tell him itâ€™s daylight right now and you canâ€™t see something that isnâ€™t there. In the light, the stars are hidden or else they donâ€™t exist anymore. Besides, I tell him, you only just drilled the hole in the wall and surely youâ€™ve seen the stars before that. He doesnâ€™t answer but he does ask that I relay a few questions to the stars on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I come to the hole in the wall and find him gazing silently at the blender on the counter. I tell him that I spoke to the stars and that they wanted to know more about the grass that shifts so slightly in the evening breeze. He says he thought they might be interested in the grass and â€œWhat did you tell the stars?â€ I tell him about the conversation I had with the stars about grass and about how in the daytime when the stars are hidden or no longer exist, the grass is green and it sways lightly then too in the morning breeze or the afternoon breeze. In the daytime the grass buzzes with the activity of insects and rodents and other larger animals some of which eat the grass for sustenance. Then I tell him that the stars had no interest in his proposal and he blinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day while eating breakfast at the kitchen table directly below the hole in the wall, the man next door coughs a little. It isnâ€™t very loud but he usually doesnâ€™t make noise unless we are in direct eye contact. I finish eating my cereal and then I wash the dishes. In order to delay the inevitable, I even dry the dishes and place them in their proper place before confronting the man next door at the hole in the wall. I ask him if he is alright and pass a cough drop through the cough drop-sized hole in the wall. He thanks me and asks about the stars. I tell him I havenâ€™t talked to them much lately and besides, there are more important things to spend time thinking about. â€œLike what?â€ he asks. I tell him about nuclear weapons because itâ€™s the first thing that comes to mind. I tell him about the difference between fusion/fission nuclear weapons and the new pure fusion nuclear weapons that are currently under development in the unknown deserts and forgotten islands of the world. He says the stars might know something about that. I listen to his over-wrought explanation about the technical aspects of a star and even though his description is wordy and sometimes beyond my comprehension, I have to admit that he might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, I lay in the grass on my back staring at the sky until dawn breaks. I ask the stars questions that the man next door told me to ask. I wrote down the questions on a small notepad, transcribed as best I could. The hole in the wall sometimes leaves artifacts in our speech though so I had to guess which words and sounds were extraneous. The stars knew things beyond our basic understandings of nuclear physics and certainly beyond my basic understandings of science and no matter how quickly I wrote, the words strung together on my notepad only added to nonsense. I spent the whole night like this. I spoke my disjointed findings from the stars to the man next door through the hole he drilled into our wall and even in his eyeball I could see him nodding. After I finished speaking my notes to him, he filled the hole with Spackle and left the hole in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;
For weeks there were loud noises that I could hear through the wall and then one day he left.&lt;/p&gt;

Is there a purpose to this blog? The purpose of this blog is indeterminate. The purpose of this blog is indeterminate. The purpose of this blog is growing every day. The purpose of this blog becomes you and we will enjoy it. At the moment, it seems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A contradiction of &amp;#8220;first publishing rights&amp;#8221; that journals so greatly desire is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random assortment of little read poetry and prose is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A polemic to the vast success and failure of web enterprise is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasional redesigns and a great deal of &amp;#8220;thinking&amp;#8221; about typefaces is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussions and designations and delusions and debates about Mexican and Argentine poetry is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking tea is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tao Lin is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandon Scott Gorrell is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blake Butler is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name dropping random &amp;#8220;blog school&amp;#8221; authors to generate traffic from those &amp;#8220;blog school&amp;#8221; authors when they search their own name on &amp;#8220;Google&amp;#8221; is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading Bolano is as close to &amp;#8220;having sex&amp;#8221; as reading gets is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A three pronged blog strategy is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, read &lt;a href="http://ieb.panoptican.org/" target="_blank"&gt;IEB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://noise.panoptican.org/" target="_blank"&gt;such loud noise&lt;/a&gt; also is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating less traffic than &lt;a href="http://ieb.panoptican.org/" target="_blank"&gt;IEB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://noise.panoptican.org/" target="_blank"&gt;such loud noise&lt;/a&gt; is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martha Zweig is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martha Zweig is not a &amp;#8220;blog school&amp;#8221; author is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine Martha Zweig is very beautiful and I would fall in love with her and eat blackberries in a green tinted kitchen with her, if by chance I had the chance is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.panoptican.org/words/topics/tweet-twat/" target="_blank"&gt;Tweet Twat&lt;/a&gt; is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomorrow is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Wednesday is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A long digression on The Savage Detectives is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday is the purpose of this blog.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would sit together outside of your place, on cement blocks just talking about the past like it was the long forgotten missed opportunity. Smoking cigarettes that were meant for other mouths, trading stories and truth about the nature of our experience, I would feel a warmth rising in my chest and you would too maybe because weâ€™d light up another in a chain of smoking lasting far too long for the cold. Together we were neglected, unappreciated, barely acknowledged enough to be ignored, an invisible class but we could have changed the face of history, you and I we could have made a difference in perceptions. I would sometimes watch you at the podium, giving a speech about whatever, your thought process transparent while discussing the inherent impacts and topical technicalities. You were off thinking otherwise and maybe we were meant to be, our mindsets so similar in distraction, unable to even consider the here and now. We would sit and reminisce out of a dearth of subjects to speak of but then occasionally there would be a spark, a poem recited and I would share with you the words of my ways. And in those moments, I reflect now, an art was born in the each of us, an often indescribable feeling and desire for creation. I think again about seemingly insignificant times spent doing drugs and smoking cigarettes, stooping for a better view, finding our voice together, one realization at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tweet twat is an examination of the Twitter technocracy that attempts to unravel the very nature of my random 140-word missives.
