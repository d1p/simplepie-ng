&lt;i&gt;Here it comes to take hold of me &lt;br /&gt;
I could scream or hurt somebody &lt;br /&gt;
Serve my time &amp;amp; get my money &lt;br /&gt;
Bring it home to my baby &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before it's too late &lt;br /&gt;
Too late...I gotta quit &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hide in the Ladies Room &lt;br /&gt;
He's yelled at me and it's not even noon &lt;br /&gt;
I wonder how I put up with that &lt;br /&gt;
Cause momma need a new pill box hat &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before it's too late &lt;br /&gt;
Too late...I gotta quit &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never was a man I hated more &lt;br /&gt;
Never was a boss I hated more &lt;br /&gt;
I hate his right hand man I hate his left, ohh &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pros still out weight the cons, two to one &lt;br /&gt;
so i'll serve my time and... get my money &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never was a man I hated more &lt;br /&gt;
But I'll serve my time &amp;amp; get my money &lt;br /&gt;
Before it's too late, too late, too late &lt;br /&gt;
Too late ohh...I gotta quit&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>3. Sparked A Memory</title>
      <link>http://kingscountycaravan.bandcamp.com/track/sparked-a-memory</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;I'm here to tell you I saw heaven in a street light,&lt;br /&gt;
Sparked a memory I had not before found.&lt;br /&gt;
Eight years old and I was money on a school night, &lt;br /&gt;
Chiefs at Denver with the snow comin' down&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Space invaders, Conrad Meyers, &lt;br /&gt;
and that neighbor kid who just moved to town.&lt;br /&gt;
I say mam sir, ask-direction &lt;br /&gt;
And I'm wakin' meek and humble, &lt;br /&gt;
It's tough in this town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day was cold my nose was running didn't feel right,&lt;br /&gt;
Sparked a memory and this road I'm goin' down&lt;br /&gt;
I's 16 looking funny never feelin' right,  &lt;br /&gt;
It's on man it's tough, &lt;br /&gt;
Another day another round.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Calculators, friends and liars&lt;br /&gt;
And that neighbor kid he cranks it up loud.&lt;br /&gt;
I say mam sir ask direction &lt;br /&gt;
And I'm wakiin' meek and humble, &lt;br /&gt;
It's tough in this town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Present-day like any other guess it's alright, &lt;br /&gt;
Engine revvin' on a hard way to town.&lt;br /&gt;
Hit the head fill the belly in the short sight, &lt;br /&gt;
Missed the bus on all those deals goin' down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Corporate raiders, stock bond buyers&lt;br /&gt;
And that neighbor kid he's moving uptown.&lt;br /&gt;
I say mam sir ask direction &lt;br /&gt;
And I'm wakin' meek and humble, &lt;br /&gt;
It's tough in this town.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>4. Jerusalem</title>
      <link>http://kingscountycaravan.bandcamp.com/track/jerusalem</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Every morning I turn the bedsheets down&lt;br /&gt;
Swing my legs over the edge till my feet meet the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t make a sound.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I just sit there so confused&lt;br /&gt;
Because I don’t know just who I am.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, Jerusalem, leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Every afternoon we lay side by side in your bed&lt;br /&gt;
And I beg you once again let me be your good friend&lt;br /&gt;
I won’t make a sound.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I’ll just sit there so confused&lt;br /&gt;
Because I don’t know just who I am.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, Jerusalem, leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Every evening I look for the moon and there’s two of them.&lt;br /&gt;
One for me and one for Jerusalem.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Every evening I look for the moon and there’s two of them.&lt;br /&gt;
One for me and one for Jerusalem.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There’s not one moon there are two of them&lt;br /&gt;
One for me and one for Jerusalem...&lt;/i&gt;

      <link>http://kingscountycaravan.bandcamp.com/track/granny-mary</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
High all the time &lt;br /&gt;
Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
Taking what is mine &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drainin Poor daddy dry &lt;br /&gt;
Like any good parasite &lt;br /&gt;
Mother left him on his knees &lt;br /&gt;
After 30 years or more &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mary’s lost her soul to the methamphetamines &lt;br /&gt;
Now she’s found a man to live out her lazy schemes &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
Old before her time &lt;br /&gt;
Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
Haunting me and mine &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s like Pa’s gone back to his own kind &lt;br /&gt;
His Ma cooked Meth in their double-wide &lt;br /&gt;
They smoked cigarettes with the windows closed &lt;br /&gt;
In fake wood paneling &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No good women why you haunting me &lt;br /&gt;
Infiltrating my family tree &lt;br /&gt;
No good women nothing better to do &lt;br /&gt;
You better start running when I, when I catch up to you &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
It’s just a matter of time &lt;br /&gt;
Oh Granny Mary &lt;br /&gt;
Before you die &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How could he put, Her before his own children &lt;br /&gt;
Now Mary’s just making sure, there’s nothing left for them &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he’s tapped she’ll be, off looking for another sucker man &lt;br /&gt;
Leave the kids to care for pa, and pay her debts for him&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>7. Curly Fries</title>
      <link>http://kingscountycaravan.bandcamp.com/track/curly-fries</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;I learned to stand up for a crowd this size.&lt;br /&gt;
The first time was hell, there was pinball and curly fries.&lt;br /&gt;
If you're talkin' don't mind me, you're there just for the beer.&lt;br /&gt;
Just tap feet in rhythm and the last call you lend an ear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I's sold, bought and seasoned. &lt;br /&gt;
My baby ran around.&lt;br /&gt;
I croon, craw, raise the roof high, sold, bought and seasoned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Big girl raisin' hell while I'm singin a sad one.&lt;br /&gt;
The young'ins don't care. &lt;br /&gt;
They like them rippin' and jammin'.&lt;br /&gt;
With a Pal Mal and a shot for me and hey I think I know that guy.&lt;br /&gt;
Now i'm mixin' up all the words. &lt;br /&gt;
Take a step back man and close your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I's sold, bought and seasoned. &lt;br /&gt;
My baby ran around.&lt;br /&gt;
I croon, craw, raise the roof high, sold, bought and seasoned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Six songs and I rocked the place.&lt;br /&gt;
This serenading is such a chore.&lt;br /&gt;
I guess it's good gettin out, but my head it hurts and my shoulder's sore.&lt;br /&gt;
The light it fades to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;
I tell my friend you give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;
And i'm thinkin' as I'm walkin home, bread and milk I forgot to buy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I's sold, bought and seasoned. &lt;br /&gt;
My baby ran around.&lt;br /&gt;
I croon, craw, raise the roof high, sold, bought and seasoned.&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>8. New Song for the Crossroads</title>
      <link>http://kingscountycaravan.bandcamp.com/track/new-song-for-the-crossroads</link>
      <description>
&lt;i&gt;The Saints they gather in the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;
And the Widows they mill around the field.&lt;br /&gt;
While one Saint kneels down to sharpen up his sword,&lt;br /&gt;
One Widow kneels and hammers at a shield.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
And they know throughout all their loving&lt;br /&gt;
That they’ll never get out of this world alive.&lt;br /&gt;
If the flood waters rise they would calmly close their eyes&lt;br /&gt;
And sleep at the bottom of the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
And you can tell your daddy I still love you&lt;br /&gt;
And there’s nothing in the world would ever change my mind&lt;br /&gt;
But if it’s honor that he wants, well then it’s honor he shall have&lt;br /&gt;
And I will meet him at the crossroads at dawn.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As we walk between the fields and the shadows&lt;br /&gt;
Arm-in-arm and making up a song,&lt;br /&gt;
We hear a baby cry in a window far away&lt;br /&gt;
And you say he’s only trying to sing along.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Oh, sweet Anne of San Francisco&lt;br /&gt;
Let me tell you all about the scene of the crime.&lt;br /&gt;
I was just a young man in a foreign room&lt;br /&gt;
And it was either his blood or mine.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
And you can tell your daddy I still love you&lt;br /&gt;
And there’s nothing in the world would ever change my mind&lt;br /&gt;
But if it’s honor that he wants, well then it’s honor he shall have&lt;br /&gt;
And I will meet him at the crossroads at dawn.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
And he will come from the west all dressed in black&lt;br /&gt;
With a pistol bleeding in the palm of his hand&lt;br /&gt;
And I will rise from the east like a newborn son&lt;br /&gt;
And I’ll be leading a ragtime band.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
And we will sing a new song for the crossroads&lt;br /&gt;
We will play it to the fields and the shadows everywhere&lt;br /&gt;
And when the time comes along I will lay down my song&lt;br /&gt;
And I will fire all my pistols in the air.&lt;/i&gt;
