			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I promised that Big Sandy wasn&#8217;t going anywhere once the baby arrived, but guess what?  I underestimated how time consuming a little baby could be.  It&#8217;s crazy times.  Today I sat down with my Wacom tablet and the best of intentions when BAM my kid started screaming at me.  My wife was in a class, so I wasn&#8217;t able to work on the comic.  I was trying hard to keep the updates consistent, even if it was less frequent than before.  I&#8217;m not sure if I can do it, at least not right now.  I don&#8217;t want people checking back hoping to see new comics only to keep getting disappointed.  Anyway, what I want to do is start writing some jokes so I don&#8217;t have to keep thinking things up at the last minute.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to get back to writing for Big Sandy and not worry too much about drawing it just yet.  Once I get a backlog of comics written, then I&#8217;ll draw a few and have some in the can.  Then, once I have a buffer, then I&#8217;ll update Big Sandy once or twice a week, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you all know that I haven&#8217;t forgotten about comics, and I haven&#8217;t given up on Big Sandy. I still need some more time to get things in order so I can do this thing right.</p>

<p>In other news, the baby and her parents are doing great!  I love being a dad.  I&#8217;m trying to get back into the swing of comics, but it&#8217;s hard!  I was so busy last week, I even forgot to post my guest strips.  The baby plus a little oral surgery kind of complicated it.  Anyway, enough excuses.  I&#8217;ll let y&#8217;all know as soon as I make a decision about the future of Big Sandy, but rest assured there will be a future of Big Sandy!</p>

<p>This strip comes from Donald Poquiz, who I met through the podcast I do with Chris Flick, the Lightbox Podcast.  I love thinking about my characters in clothes, as it is funny to me that they&#8217;re naked all the time.  Anyway, thanks so much Donald for this awesome strip!  It really helps a lot.  Please go check out his work at <a href="http://donaldspeaks.com" target="_blank">Donald Speaks</a> and leave a comment thanking him for his great work!</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s my birthday.  Happy birthday to me!</p>
