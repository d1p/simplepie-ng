			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Social-thumb-People.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5483" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Social thumb People" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Social-thumb-People-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Nielsen’s recent <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/social/">Social Media Report</a> (we&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/2011/09/15/nielsen-state-of-the-media-q3-2011-mobile-access-to-socnets-is-booming/">about it before on this blog</a>) revealed the size of the audience and the degree of consumption across social networking platforms in the U.S. <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/friends-following-and-feedback-how-were-using-social-media/">New research by NM Incite</a>, a Nielsen collaboration between Nielsen and McKinsey Company, further explores the reasons U.S. social media users visit social networks a bit more. Below, you can find the top drivers for social media (not surprisingly, top drivers of social media use among social networkers are keeping in touch with family and friends (89% and 88%, respectively) and finding new friends (70%).  <span id="more-5482"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Nielsen-Social-used-for-TCM.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5485" title="Nielsen Social used for TCM" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Nielsen-Social-used-for-TCM.gif" alt="" width="550" height="578" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Other drivers of usage</strong><br />
Another driver of use is the desire to view and contribute to reviews of products and services, as 68% of social media users (71% of parents and 64% of non-parents) go to social networking sites to read product reviews and more than half use these sites to provide product feedback, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>According to Nielsen, the study also looked at the differences in use among social media users with children and those without, finding that parents are more likely than non-parents to use social media for almost every thing, with dating being the exception.  Parents are 26 percent more likely than non-parents to visit social networks to play games, 23 percent more likely to use as a creative outlet and 20 percent more likely to use for entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Wow!?</strong><br />
No, these statistics and numbers are not surprising. But they will help us in our journey of  better understanding the way social media is shaping the future of the internet, I guess <img src='http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/money-dollars.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5474" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="money dollars" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/money-dollars-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Ouch</em>: &#8220;The more I think about this &#8212; the more my brain hurts.&#8221; <em>Ohmy</em>: &#8220;Respectfully, this is complete nonsense.&#8221; <em>Jeez</em>: &#8220;This goes into my &#8220;Are you Kidding me with this crap&#8221; Hall of Fame!&#8221; <em>This is Hurting</em>: &#8220;The only thing more worrying than the content of this article is the fact that people are going to think that because it&#8217;s published on the HBR blog it must be true.&#8221; These are only the first few comments on this blog by HBR: &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/return_on_influence_the_new_ro.html">Return on Influence, the New ROI</a>&#8220;. Oliver Blanchard is leading the pack of people who are thinking the blogpost made no sense at all. You don&#8217;t see this that often, at HBR. The discussion is worth checking out.<br />
<span id="more-5467"></span></p>
<p>So what is al this criticism about (oh, sorry, I just love it when the first comment on a blog just KILLS the blogpost, it&#8217;s a tic)? The main point of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AmyJoMartin/">Amy Jo Martin</a> was that numbers help justify decisions, remove some risk, and limit accountability. And that there&#8217;s a distinction to be made (in the measuring of social media influence) between:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;cold metrics&#8221;&#8211;reach, frequency, page views, impressions, eyeballs captured.</li>
<li>&#8220;warm metrics&#8221;&#8211;engagement levels, viral factors, sentiment analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;I realized that social media provided a way to measure something fan affinity in a way a TV spot never could. Why? Social media communication is two-way. It&#8217;s a dialogue versus a monologue. Instead of promotions, it creates conversations, sometimes unprompted conversations that can be listened to, recorded, and measured. No longer did we have to say, &#8220;Trust us, our fans really like the team.&#8221; Suddenly I had data to show how fans really liked us&#8230;. Once you recognize that each entry into the social conversation is creating influence, you track it. A tweet is a transaction. So is a retweet. So is a purchase that results from a retweet. Unlike outdoor and TV advertising, say, marketers can track online behavior from a social channel from the initial marketing message all the way through to purchase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Oliver Blanchard, Martin is wrong in almost every point she tries to make. If you are in the business of calculating something, metrics are metrics, Blanchard notes. Math is math. Stick to empirical data. And, writes Blanchard: &#8220;&#8230;what you just did there is attempt to measure the average value of a fan (incorrectly at that). Where was the investment/cost figure in that equation? You only talked about revenue generation.&#8221; And he adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As for &#8220;influence&#8221; metrics, or even the concept of influence as a measurable phenomenon (cause and effect and/or correlation), when someone comes up with a legitimate unit of measure for it, then we can start talking about a Return on Influence equation. Until then, it&#8217;s simply not a plausible discussion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think of the discussion and the concept of Return on Influence? Do you think this is the measuring-way-to-go or do yoy think the remarks of Oliver Blanchard and the rest stand ground? Very curious!</p>

Some innocent couples want to take their seat, but the room is filled with 148 not-so- friendly gentlemen&#8230; The couples have to choose: will they join the grumpy bikers (2 seats left in the filled cinema) or will they leave the room? Some leave (&#8220;This is not what we paid for!&#8221;), some decide to hang in there and just act &#8220;normal&#8221;. And then&#8230;. the magic happens. Check out the video below (it&#8217;s been watched for 1.199.357 times in 4 days):<br />

<p>What do you think? Is the &#8220;That calls for a Carlsberg&#8221; slogan just right here? Personally I like the idea: it&#8217;s not that complicated, but it works. People are surprised, are confronted with the brand. They probably will tell about this at parties and birthdays. <img src='http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mond_op_mond_reclame.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5448" title="mond_op_mond_reclame" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mond_op_mond_reclame-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>We all know that conversations have an impact on consumer behaviour. Countless surveys (and books such as the <a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/about-the-book/" target="_blank">Conversation Manager</a> <img src='http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) have proven the link between positive mouth-to-mouth advertising and good sales results. Online conversations have added an extra dimension to this story.</p>
<p><a title="InSites Consulting" href="http://www.insites.eu" target="_blank">InSites Consulting</a> organised a survey in 35 countries in which 9,000 respondents participated to map the attitudes and the behaviour concerning social media. One of this survey’s elements is about the impact of online conversations on the offline purchase behaviour.<span id="more-5445"></span></p>
<h4>Positive feedback by other consumers has the biggest impact on purchase behaviour</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Positive.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5449" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Positive" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Positive-195x300.png" alt="" width="96" height="147" /></a>The survey concluded that positive conversations by existing customers have the biggest impact on the purchase behaviour of consumers. 83% of consumers change their decisions based on these conversations. The impact of negative conversations is much lower, 44% of people are influenced by it. A remarkable result is that the traditional ads have more impact than negative conversations. In other words: companies overrate the impact of negative conversations, but at the same time they underrate the impact of positive conversations.</p>
<h4>The consumer is always in a purchase phase</h4>
<p>McKinsey did research on the purchase behaviour of more than 20,000 people and concluded that consumers are always in a purchase intention phase. In a first phase the consumer considers a certain number of brands. This list is made based on past experiences. Even without being in a purchase phase, people are in touch with your company’s touch points. These contacts determine whether you will be on the short list or not. The second phase is an active evaluation of these companies. The third phase consists of the purchase. After the purchase, in the fourth phase, there is an evaluation of what will happen at the next purchase. The number of positive conversations and the future purchase intention are determined based on the post-purchase interactions with touch points.</p>
<h4>Role of the customer experience increases</h4>
<p>Therefore the art is to be conversation worthy throughout all touch points. Many companies focus on the pre-purchase phase. This is somehow logical since at that moment the consumer needs to be convinced to make the purchase. When the customer buys a product, the relationship with that company starts in the eye of the customer. For many companies however that is where it ends.</p>
<p>Given the major impact of positive conversations it is a missed opportunity to not be conversation worthy during and after the purchase. It is a good exercise for every organisation to map the entire consumer experience. Focus on the different touch points that play a part. Ask yourself the following question: is every touch point positively conversation worthy? If yes, your company is adding perfectly to the results of this survey. If not, then your company has a lot of under-used conversation potential.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spokesman.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5423" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Spokesman" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spokesman-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Every employee is a spokesman for his employer. Every time an employee talks to his friends about his work, this influences the public opinion about that company. These conversations take place on a daily basis. So far most of them were offline, but that is where the missed opportunity lies. Imagine what the effect would be if all employees of a company consistently talked positively about their employer …<span id="more-5419"></span></p>
<h4>People are proud but are not allowed to talk</h4>
<p><a title="InSites Consulting" href="http://www.insites.eu" target="_blank">InSites Consulting</a>’s <a title="Social Media around the World" href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/social-media-around-the-world-2011" target="_blank">&#8216;Social Media around the World&#8217;</a> survey shows that two out of three people are proud of their job. Most people also like to talk about their job, and frequently. Social media are an ideal platform to tell your friends about your daily life. Unfortunately many companies have decided that their employees are not allowed to talk on social media about their job, thus blocking out an important conversation stream. In Europe and the US less than 20% of employees talk about their company on social media, although half of the employees would like to share information on new products with their network. This is a huge part of under-used conversation potential.</p>
<h4>One in three has no social media access at work</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Block-social-media.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5424" title="Block social media" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Block-social-media-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The survey found that one European employee in three does not have social media access at work. 20% has limited access and about half can freely surf all websites. The strictest companies are in Western-Europe. 41% is denied all access. Scandinavian countries are the most progressive on the matter, since more than 6 out of 10 employees have full access to social network sites.</p>
<h4>When employees talk, it is extremely complementary to customers talking</h4>
<p>Internal (originating from the employee) and external (originating from the customer) conversations are very complementary. Your employees make your culture tangible. Everything they say and do shows what your company represents. Customers tell about their experiences with your company and products. Both sources of conversation influence public opinion and thus your company’s results.</p>
<p><a title="Internal and external conversations by stevenvanbelleghem, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevenvanbelleghem/6102982144/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6102982144_e856447970.jpg" alt="Internal and external conversations" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>In the meantime companies have become increasingly aware of the customer’s conversations. The role of their own employees is still highly underestimated. It is surprising that some marketers of large food companies are not allowed to share their own ad spots on their personal Facebook page. This is yet another one of those under-used sources of conversation potential.</p>
<h4>Avoid chaos and guide employees to optimise the conversation potential</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Guidance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5425" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Guidance" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Guidance-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>It makes sense that some companies become nervous when thinking about their employees talking freely about the shop floor. Explain clearly to your employees what is acceptable and what isn’t. If the culture is not yet strong enough, there is an increased need for a conversation policy. You need to guide your employees. It would be smart to launch an effective and well thought-out training programme for employees to feel comfortable in their conversations. If your company does not manage this source of conversations, on the one hand you miss out on a great opportunity and on the other hand you are under the illusion that you can stop them. People do as they please. The only way is to proactively facilitate the employee’s conversations.</p>
<p>I can see 3 levels to facilitate employees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>: Employees sometimes are not certain about what is permitted and not permitted by the employer. In spite of their positive intentions they do nothing, for safety’s sake. By giving clear guidelines and especially the necessary training you offer a sufficient level of comfort to employees to engage in online <a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Kodak.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5426" title="Kodak" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Kodak-300x151.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="91" /></a>conversations without fear. A mere 13% of European employees have so far been trained on social media behaviour. <strong>Kodak strongly believes in the power of its own employee’s conversations</strong>. The company counts several hundred active bloggers. These people are facilitated by their &#8216;chief blogging officer&#8217;. This lady coordinates all content. She ensures that their stories are in line with the company culture and objectives. Its employees are encouraged to blog. Kodak organises training sessions. It gives tips &amp; tricks on interesting content for a new blog. That is how it is turned into a blog programme with a vision and an objective.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong>: what to talk about, how to converse, how to react to criticism&#8230; If you guide your employees, your company is better prepared to use employees as spokespeople. That is how you create a comfort zone for employees to speak freely.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Provide the right software and hardware so that employees can participate in conversations. Certain companies are prepared to provide employees with the necessary hardware, for example. If someone can show that an iPad is important for his/her communication with customers, they are provided with an iPad.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are your thoughts on the subject? What actions could an employer undertake to help his employees to deal with social media in an impactful and correct way? I am looking forward to your reactions!</p>
<p>Should you wish to consult all the survey’s details, this presentation will give you all the facts, figures and research results.</p>

The research found, that they are struggling with measurement of social media and social media ROI and with human resources. A lot of marketers are having trouble getting budget approved for social media activities. Only 4 percent of the marketers says generating engagement and positive conversations are being prioritized in measuring ROI. And: because of the &#8220;bad measuring&#8221; marketers are having the biggest problems to adress the budget of social media compared to other channels.<span id="more-5421"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Forrester-Biggest-Challenges-Social-Media-Marketers.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5422" title="Forrester Biggest Challenges Social Media Marketers" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Forrester-Biggest-Challenges-Social-Media-Marketers.png" alt="" width="564" height="488" /></a>Ok, so measuring and reporting, the comparison between social media and other channels: it&#8217;s difficult. But don&#8217;t forget about the number 2: the uncertainty of success&#8230;. Yes, we live in uncertain times with economic downturns doing strange things at the commercial markets. When the prove of the pudding is far away, it&#8217;s maybe hard to convince management to push the button for more social media marketing. But let us also say that there&#8217;s a big blindspot here and that&#8217;s strategy (and philosphy if you want to).</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s possible to experiment with social media. But let&#8217;s not pretend that there&#8217;s absolutely NO evidence or casestudy that should get you on the right track and let you decide to go left or right in your social media efforts. And let us also not say, that there are no &#8220;oldschool&#8221; marketing tactics that you can use while &#8220;doing&#8221; social media. <a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/2011/09/19/a-food-pyramid-for-content-marketing/">Think only about content marketing</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Twitter-vs-facebook.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5391" title="Twitter vs facebook" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Twitter-vs-facebook-300x208.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="125" /></a>When we started with our<a title="Social Media around the World" href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/social-media-around-the-world-2011" target="_blank"> &#8216;Social Media around the World&#8217; study</a>, we had a few hypotheses about Facebook and Twitter. We&#8217;re happy to share these hypotheses and the answers we found.<span id="more-5385"></span></p>
<h4>H1. Heavy Twitter users will decrease their Facebook usage.</h4>
<p>We were wrong about this one. Let&#8217;s first look at the population. Only 13% of the social network users is not using Facebook and not using Twitter. Only 2% is Twitter only. 19% of the social network users are using Twitter and Facebook. We thought that heavy Twitter users would decrease their time spend on Facebook, but this is not the case. The conclusion is very simple: the more memberships on social networks you have, the more time you spend on each of these sites. People with a Facebook and a Twitter account are just more into social media than Facebook only people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Networks.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5388" title="Networks" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Networks.png" alt="" width="593" height="322" /></a></p>
<h4>H2. Twitter is more a male thing, Facebook more a female.</h4>
<p>This one is true. The adoption of Facebook is higher among women than men. On Twitter it is the other way around. Next to that, the average age on Twitter is lower. Twitter has a overall adoption rate of 16% versus Facebook 62%. The profile of the Twitter user is still that of the early adopter, whereas Facebook has the profile of the mainstream population.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Male-vs-female.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" title="Male vs female" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Male-vs-female.png" alt="" width="563" height="341" /></a></p>
<h4>H3. People spend more time on Facebook than on Twitter</h4>
<p>This one was confirmed as well. On average, people spend 37 minutes per day on Facebook, versus 21 minutes on Twitter. Most people have more friends than followers and have more interactions on Facebook. The social network site with the most intensive users is the Eastern European Vkontakte. On average, their users spend 49 minutes a day on this site.<br />
<a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Connection-time.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5387" title="Connection time" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Connection-time.png" alt="" width="568" height="263" /></a></p>

With this post I summarized the basics on social media to give you a heads up on social media usage around the globe.<span id="more-5363"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Augmented-reality.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5365" title="Augmented reality" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Augmented-reality-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Augmented reality</strong><br />
Augmented reality still is a niche application. 4% of smartphone users are familiar with it. Considering the fact that 38% of the online population owns a smartphone, this 4% of the total population is completely negligible at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions made based on positive rather than negative feedback</strong><br />
The impact of positive conversations concerning brands is more important than the impact of negative statements. Throughout the survey’s results, the power of the positive is obvious. People share more positive stories, they prefer to read them, and they base their decisions on them.</p>
<p><strong>Co-creation is a dream many consumers have</strong><br />
Almost half the people would like to share their ideas with a company they like. One out of three takes this further and wishes to be able to co-create with the company. It is by no means a niche group that is open to this. The main thing about co-creation is that people are interested in the category or company in question, which is their main motivation.</p>
<p><strong>Defriending is linked to an offline relationship, not to content</strong><br />
More than half of social network users have already eliminated someone from their virtual circle of friends. The main reason is the lack of offline contact. When the offline relationship between people is less positive, it has an impact online. Bad or irrelevant content has much less impact on the matter.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apps.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Apps" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apps-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></strong>Lonely apps</strong><br />
An average smartphone contains 25 apps, only 12 of which are used. Many applications are used only once. The social network apps are the most successful ones and are downloaded most frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Friendster is buried</strong><br />
The name of Friendster is huge in the US, China and India (up to 50%), but the network is dying slowly but gradually. The majority of this network’s users have indicated that they will no longer log into it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Average time on Facebook per day: 37 minutes</strong><br />
A Facebook user spends an average of 37 minutes on the site per day, which means Facebook is the second most intensively used site. The East-European site Vkontakte is the leader with an average usage duration of 49 minutes a day. Twitter comes in third with 23 minutes a day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hyves.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5366" title="Hyves" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hyves-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Hyves</strong><br />
Hyves still is the most popular social network site in the Netherlands. Half the online population has a Hyves profile. However Facebook is breathing down its neck, since no less than 44% of Dutch Internet users already have a Facebook profile.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody is involved in social networks</strong><br />
73% of Europeans use social network sites. Facebook undoubtedly is the main site in Europe. 73% means that about everybody uses these sites. The increasing adoption of mobile Internet will entail a further increase of the social network sites in the years to come. The survey shows that smartphone owners are much more active on social networks.</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong><br />
Japan is the outsider in this survey. Only 34% of all Japanese is member of a social network, which means their score is the lowest of the 35 countries. In Europe the adoption lies at 73%, in America at 76%, in Brazil at 86%, in India at 84%, in Australia at 67% and in China at 44%. Besides, Facebook does not perform well at all-in Japan; its penetration is a mere 13%. Twitter on the other hand does really well with a 29% adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Checking out what the others are doing</strong><br />
The main activity on social media is reading the status updates of friends. Sending personal messages obtains a higher score than reacting publically to someone’s status.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong><br />
A social network other than Facebook can only be successful if it brings a clear added value. LinkedIn is such an outsider. It clearly has a professional positioning. Because of its professional importance there barely is any ‘defriending’ on LinkedIn. The survey shows that LinkedIn is still rather unknown; only 32% of the European Internet surfers have already heard of it. On average 11% of Europeans is a member of LinkedIn. The Netherlands is the leader with a 17% adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Metcalfe Law</strong><br />
Metcalfe&#8217;s law is the law of network effects. This law defines the value of a network as the number of users square. The more members a network counts, the more appealing it becomes to others. This law explains the success of Facebook, but also shows the difficulties that other new initiatives face. It says that the big are getting bigger and the smaller are getting smaller. For sites such as Hyves and Netlog this could entail problems, unless another proposition is found; a proposition that is valuable enough to convince the members of a network to come and to stay.</p>
<p><strong>News about brands</strong><br />
Half of social network users are linked to a brand. People link to brands to get news about the company. Furthermore they also wish to be informed of events. And of course they are also looking for promotions and personal advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Offline experience entails online conversations</strong><br />
This survey shows that offline experiences are the main online conversation starters. The way one experiences a product, or one’s experiences in a shop, are the main subjects on social media when people talk about brands.</p>
<p><strong>Positive</strong><br />
I think this is one of the best conclusions of our survey. The positive wins from the negative. People tell more positive than negative experiences on social media. Furthermore, the positive stories spread easier than the negative ones. As indicated before, positive conversations have more impact than negative ones. And that’s when I’m thinking: just as well there is no &#8216;dislike&#8217; button on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Qzone</strong><br />
Qzone is the most successful social network in China. 7 Chinese out of 10 know it. The name is as big as Facebook in the country. 26% of all Chinese Internet users are a member of this site, which makes it a whole lot larger than Facebook (20%).</p>
<p><strong>Direct personal advantages remain important</strong><br />
In order to entertain people on a fan page it is handy to ensure personal advantages. 58% of the fans expect to get promotions or freebies when they are member of a fan page.</p>
<p><strong>Status quo</strong><br />
93% of social network users are satisfied with the current offer. The majority does not wish to get any additional profiles and is also not planning to stop their current platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong><br />
Twitter is an outsider amongst the social network sites. 80% of all Europeans know Twitter, but only 16% of them use the site actively.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit fans are less credible</strong><br />
Only 16% of social network users believe what a fan of a brand says. Once a person is too positive about a company, his credibility drops. One prefers to obtain information from neutral people who share their brand experience objectively.</p>
<p><strong>Vkontakte</strong><br />
Vkontakte is a very popular East-European social network site. The familiarity is 55% and 39% of Eastern-Europeans have a profile on it. Vkontakte is preceded in popularity however by Facebook, which is known in East-Europe by 94%; 57% have a profile on that site.</p>
<p><strong>Websites remain important</strong><br />
The majority of surfers wish to give feedback to a company via e-mail (80%) and via the website (62%). 24% prefer social media for contacting a company. This 24% is a rather important group, but this result proves that, despite the social media hype, companies should not neglect their classic online channels.</p>
<p><strong>Xing</strong><br />
Just like LinkedIn, Xing is a professional network. The network’s familiarity is increasing rapidly. 19% of the surfers are familiar with this site, which is mainly known in China and India (where LinkedIn also obtains excellent scores). The site’s usage however is still rather low: only 5% are a member of it. In China and India the usage is rather limited as well, contrary to LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>It is not only Gen Y</strong><br />
All the data from this research show that social media is used by all levels of the population. Even in BRIC countries social media obtain good scores. In certain countries, such as Brazil, their scores are even higher than in Europe and the US. The survey is the umpteenth proof that social media is not the new generation’s media but rather today’s media.</p>
<p><strong>Identical positioning sometimes missing</strong><br />
Companies do not always manage to realise the same image both online and offline. 12% of social network users see a difference between a brand’s online communication and its offline perception.</p>

Now that social media adoption has reached the mass market, it is clear that everything that happens offline has an impact on the online conversations.<span id="more-5358"></span></p>
<h4>Offline brand experience is the perfect online conversation starter</h4>
<p>Consumers become friends on Facebook becomes they know each other in the real world. People start to follow brands after they have used the specific product. 46% starts to follow a brand after they used the product. This real life experience is more important than any other communication form by the brand.</p>
<p>Further, offline shopping experiences are the main driver for online conversations. A few months ago, <a title="InSites Consulting" href="http://www.insites.eu" target="_blank">InSites Consulting</a> made an analysis of branded conversations on Facebook fan pages. The key conclusion was that what happens in the point of sales is the main topic of online conversations.</p>
<h4>Defriending: yes, but because of offline facts</h4>
<p>Defriending is a trend. Our study showed that more than half of the social network users already unfollowed or defriended someone. Their main reason was lack of offline contact. Other reasons to defriend are privacy concerns and not being a real friend anymore. Bad content is less important in the defriending process than the real life relationship.</p>
<h4>Online &amp; offline are two of a kind</h4>
<p>If we look at all data we captured about social media attitude and usage, it is clear that online media are a reflection of the offline world. Still, some brands see it as two different environments. Some even position their online brand differently than offline. These is confusing for consumers. 12% of consumers notices a clear difference between the online and offline brand positioning of certain brands.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pyramid.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5378" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="pyramid" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pyramid-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Overheard at a recent conference, &#8220;it&#8217;s not about content anymmore, but about context.&#8221; I believe there&#8217;s no context without content. And that there can be content without context. Euhm&#8230;. Very interesting, don&#8217;t you think? As we&#8217;re trying to be a conversation company here at Insites, adhering the conversation management philosophy, a lot of what I and we at the marketing department do, comes down to content marketing as a tactic. Last week, I saw this beautiful pyramid about just that: a pyramid of content marketing made by the <a href="http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/09/food-pyramid-for-content-marketing/">contentmarketinginstitute</a>. Check it out:<br />
<span id="more-5338"></span><a href="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Content-Marketing-Pyramid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5353" title="Content Marketing Pyramid" src="http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Content-Marketing-Pyramid.png" alt="" width="542" height="406" /></a>So, what do we see here? The three concepts curation, creativity and coordination form the base of the pyramid because without all of these elements your content marketing efforts will fail.  Then, there&#8217;s the middle section: &#8220;a huge part of any healthy content marketing menu,&#8221; Tracy Gold writes. Then, there&#8217;s the almost-top: Videos and case studies. And then, there&#8217;s the top:</p>
<blockquote><p>Content such as webinars and eBooks are essential for capturing leads. People are generally willing to submit their contact information in exchange for significant content like this. Once you have that, your sales team can contact any qualified leads. However, you’ll be hard pressed to get people to sign up to download a webinar or eBook if you haven’t already convinced them of your expertise by giving them quality content that is easily accessible as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>More context <img src='http://www.theconversationmanager.com/wp-cm48/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  in the initial blogpost by Tracy Gold. Wondering what you think about this pyramid. Is the sequence of importance right, or are there any changes needed in your opinion?</p>
