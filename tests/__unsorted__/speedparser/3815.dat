<p>@<a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html" target="_blank">Ted Dziuba</a> : your article on Node.js being cancer has brought many angry nerds with pitchforks to your door. You do make good points, and the best opinion is not one that everyone blindly agrees with, but one that gets everyone thinking — hopefully before they speak.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>I, too, would take issue with a statement like «Node.js is scalable because it is non-blocking» though not the same issue as you took. Being <em>non-blocking</em> does not help with <em>scalability</em> at all. Scalability is about how easily your system administrator can add a new machine to your web farm to soak up a heavier load than usual, and it&#8217;s all about two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you run multiple copies of your software in parallel</strong>? In-application sharing of data makes this harder. Some Java servers store the entire relevant state in application memory, so scaling is impossible. PHP stores session files on the disk by default, so scaling is only possible with server affinity (the same user always gets sent to the same server). A clean server with no in-application data sharing is easily duplicated, regardless of the language.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a shared resource with sequential access</strong>? If you run a hundred thousand web servers, but all of them have to read-write the same physical drive, then your application will be no faster than that read-write speed. If you access a database that involves heavy locking, then your application will be no faster than the locking sequence can allow.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are in any way improved or even affected by non-blocking semantics.</p>
<p>Node.js improves <em>performance</em> when serving multiple concurrent requests. It makes it no easier to scale, but it helps delay the point where scaling becomes necessary.</p>
<p>The typical explanation of how this happens is that if serving a request uses 10ms of processing things on the server («Work») and 10ms of waiting for database requests to complete («Wait»), then the ideal web server should be able to serve two concurrent requests in 10ms each by overlapping the processing time of one request with the database wait time of another. This is a pretty nice and simple idea, which is why everyone has been doing it for ages. The main difference is how it is done.</p>
<p>What the traditional UNIX world did is pop enough processes — that is the Unix answer to every problem, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb#Defusing" target="_blank">including having too many processes around</a>. If your Work-time is 10ms and your Wait-time is 40ms, then by allowing up to four processes you are effectively recycling all the wait-time in a high concurrent load situation. This is why every CGI- or FastCGI-enabled web server in existence provides a configuration entry for the number of concurrent child processes.</p>
<p>Node.js does the same. With that same Wait/Work ratio of 40/10, Node.js will be serving four concurrent requests at the same time, because it cannot create processing time out of thin air.</p>
<p>What Node.js brings to the table is an architecture that performs, at the server level, what the traditional UNIX world did at the kernel level: scheduling. Whether this approach is significantly faster than a properly configured FastCGI setup is still a matter of debate, and I believe the answer here is simply that, as long as the Wait/Work time ratio does not push the number of concurrent processes higher than what the available memory allows, there will be no significant difference between FastCGI and Node.js in terms of blocking.</p>
<h4>The UNIX Way</h4>
<p>I once agreed with your stated opinion on the matter, but I got better. Here&#8217;s the thing: today, being an HTTP server is no more of a «responsibility» than reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT. Make no mistake: being a production, internet-facing HTTP server <em>is</em> a responsibility, but that is not what Node.js is (or should be) trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Consider this: the production, internet-facing HTTP server must communicate with the actual application using one protocol or another. CGI is one such protocol, FastCGI is another, and HTTP is yet another — the fact that the same protocol is used for serving requests over the internet is not  a problem, it is actually a benefit because communicating through HTTP is a solved problem with a clean API in almost every single language out there.</p>
<p>There is now something I would jokingly call «The REST Way» which follows in the tracks of the UNIX Way in a cloudy fashion : small applications performing one task — dispatching internet requests, constructing responses, persistent storage, caching — running on any number of servers in any number of locations, and connected to each other through HTTP requests. In an nginx-Node.js-CouchDB stack, nginx is the dispatcher, Node.js constructs responses, and CouchDB provides persistent storage, and everyone «speaks» HTTP in the same way that Unix processes «speak» STDIN/STDOUT.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2543" title="cranes" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cranes.png" alt="" width="675" height="100" /><br />
One of my oldest memories harkens back to 1989 — I was a four years old boy in communist Romania. My mother has a PhD in biochemistry, and her father and brother both had a PhD in physics, so it might seem quite unsurprising that I followed in their rational and scientific steps, but it would be hard to put the proverbial finger on how, precisely, that happened. This is what that specific memory is about.</p>
<p>It all started with my frequent stays at my grandparents&#8217; house, a conventional second-floor flat in Bucharest, where my grandmother and grandfather took turns babysitting me while my parents were out hammer-and-sickling (well, laboratory-and-architecturing) the socialist ideal. My grandfather was intent on turning me into a bright scientific mind, so he asked my uncle to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">build me a computer</a>. Nothing fancy, mind you : it had no operating system worth mentioning, no hard drive, and depended on magnetic tapes and 8&#8243; floppies to actually work. My grandfather showed me a standard BASIC interpreter, and had me type in a program that displayed, line by line, an analog wall clock.</p>
<p>Fascinated, I started spending my days on that thing writing BASIC code, learning how to build increasingly complex programs, and starting my career as a programmer. Or so had my grandfather hoped. A few seconds after discovering computer programming, I discovered computer <em>games</em>, which were a far more fascinating novelty than displaying wall clocks on a screen. I promptly forgot about the BASIC interpreter and for nine long years, I assumed that programming computers was some sort of esoteric arcane art, invisible to the uninitiated, and remained entirely uninterested in it.</p>
<p>Instead, my <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com" target="_blank">breakthrough</a> as a rational mind was triggered by the close proximity of two unlikely catalysts : one was a frequent diet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoShogun" target="_blank">mecha anime</a> (the quality of the Romanian dubbing was hilarious), and the other was a cupboard drawer full of bits and pieces that could, to a child&#8217;s mind, be spare parts out of which a robot could be built : wheels, small electrical engines, cables, batteries, microprocessors, light bulbs&#8230; as a matter of fact, once I had the basic understanding of how a batteries + cables + engine setup worked, I <em>did</em> build small uninteresting contraptions.</p>
<p>I became intensely interested in building a robot myself. Obviously, I did not have the technical skills or the willpower to follow through with this plan, but I would listen, entranced, to any explanations I would receive that were related to robot-building. My grandfather was writing a book on semiconductors at the time, so he showed me a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29" target="_blank">digital circuit</a> and let me understand that this is what the brain of a robot would look like — only quite larger !</p>
<p>And so he started teaching me the elementary principles of digital circuits. We spent little time discussing the underlying technical details, and instead concentrated on the simpler abstractions of logical gates. This time, I was fascinated. I would grab a pen and paper and draw circuits for fun. The meaning of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XOR are imprinted in my brain ever since I was five years old&#8230; there are few concepts remaining in my brain that have been there for so long.</p>
<p>My circuits behaved like mathematical functions : I would mentally set the input bits, and the output bits would contain the result, so I could build the truth tables that mapped input combinations to output combinations. I experimented with basic arithmetic functions, learning binary as I went. And then one day my grandfather showed me a circuit that I could draw from memory to this day : the RS latch.</p>
<p>The fun thing about the RS latch is that it cannot have a truth table. It is an entirely different beast from arithmetic &#8220;write input bits, read output bits&#8221; circuits in that it has a <em>state</em>. If you write 1 to the S input bit, the output becomes 1 and remains 1 until you write 1 to the R bit, at which point the output becomes 0, and so on. To say things differently, the S input bit stands for &#8220;Set&#8221; and sets the output to 1, and the R input bit stands for &#8220;Reset&#8221; and sets the output to 0. When both R and S are set to 0, then the latch output bit is equal to whatever it was previously set to.</p>
<p>The RS latch is a versatile little thing. It can be used to implement RAM (one of the first things I did with it), or it can be chained to create an incrementing counter.</p>
<p>After a while, my interest in digital circuits faded, but the effects it had on my character were permanent : I now had experience applying abstract rules to abstract concepts, <em>and it was fun</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2539" title="error" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/error.png" alt="" width="675" height="100" />The jQuery UI datepicker does <em>strange</em> things with the DOM, which causes undocumented brittleness. For instance, consider the following operations on a page that contains a single input element:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">$('input').datepicker().attr('id','the-input');</pre>
<p>This will cause no error, and clicking on the input will correctly summon the date picking dialog, but clicking on a date in that dialog will fail with the following error:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">missing instance data for this datepicker</pre>
<p>The diagnosis is quite simple: the jQuery UI datepicker stores additional &#8220;instance data&#8221; based on the id attribute of the element, so changing the id attribute manually causes that instance data to be lost. This unexpected brittleness forced me to spend some time hacking my code so that the identifier is attributed <em>before</em> the datepicker is enabled, but at least this solved the problem.</p>
<p>Two related problems would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have several input elements with the same identifier, and apply the datepicker on the second element, the search-by-id will return the first element and cause the same error as above.</li>
<li>If you apply the <code>hasDatepicker</code> CSS class on an element, and then apply the datepicker plugin, it will assume that the instance data has already been initialized, and will fail.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2535" title="sunset" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sunset.png" alt="" width="675" height="100" /></p>
<p>Many blogs about technical hiring will at one point state something about buzzwords and programmer flexibility. One of the original trendsetters, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recruiters-who-use-grep, by the way, are ridiculed here, and for  good reason. I have never met anyone who can do Scheme, Haskell, and C  pointers who can&#8217;t pick up Java in two days, and create better Java code  than people with five years of experience in Java, but try explaining  that to the average HR drone.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is not only a point about elite languages like Scheme-Haskell-C versus mundane languages like Java-PHP-whatever : flexibility, the ability to switch languages and to adapt to new interfaces and libraries, is almost always presented as a prerequisite to being competent. John can perform miracles with PHP but cannot easily learn Ruby ? Then John is not a competent programmer, he is just a competent <em>PHP</em> programmer.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some truth to this characterization. Maybe there is indeed something about good programmers that lets them shine in a language-independent way, with languages as mere details of their day-to-day miracles. But I am vaguely uncomfortable with that notion. And not for personal reasons — my current language of choice is one of those elite functional languages that would hypothetically place me at the apex of the competence food chain.</p>
<p>I believe the critical element of programming competence is not <em>ability</em> but <em>passion</em>. What makes you a good programmer is how much you care about software development. Does John have a nine-to-five PHP programming job and hardly touch the computer outside of work, or does he do small projects on the side, or contribute to Open Source PHP software, or answer technical PHP questions on Stack Overflow, or perform any other number of PHP-related activities that do not have professional rewards as their main objective? Does he unconsciously try to <em>do the right thing</em> in his code, even though it will be harder than writing a dirty hack to make his boss happy?</p>
<p>I have seen people, many of them high-ranking academics, with the intellectual firepower to outgun me in any programming-related endeavor, but a striking lack of passion that let their applications crippled, hideous and unreliable. And I have no doubts that, had they cared about those things, they could have done better.</p>
<p>I have seen people, many of them students, with a genuine passion for software development, who would spend their free time hacking together video games or dynamic websites or clever hacks, who would notice after a while that their abilities were stagnating and, unable to improve, would give up programming rather than live with the frustration of writing software worthy of their expectations.</p>
<p>And when you care about programming, you tend to have strong opinions about how it should be done.</p>
<p>Some of these opinions are trivial. My hair stands on end whenever I have to read badly formatted code — I don&#8217;t care about the opening-brace-position flame wars, any convention is fine by me as long as it is consistently followed — and the authors often wonder why I would care about such a silly thing. I have a strong opinion about how code should look like, and I dislike working with people who do not share that opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, I am one of those Scheme-Haskell-C elite programmers, and I can pick up Java in a few days and outperform experienced Java-only programmers. I have done it several times in the past. And every single time I did so, I felt dirty and miserable, because Java goes against several of my opinions about what software development should be like.</p>
<p>In fact, I am not really surprised about the popular success of Python and Ruby on Rails — not in terms of how many projects are written, but in terms of how outspoken the technical advocates are. This is because those two have something that appeals to people who can become passionate about them : a clean core philosophy you can agree or disagree with.</p>
<p>Python zealots flock around the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">Zen of Python</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
Simple is better than complex.<br />
Complex is better than complicated.<br />
Flat is better than nested.<br />
Sparse is better than dense.<br />
Readability counts.<br />
Special cases aren&#8217;t special enough to break the rules.<br />
Although practicality beats purity.<br />
Errors should never pass silently.<br />
Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
There should be one&#8211; and preferably only one &#8211;obvious way to do it.<br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#8217;re Dutch.<br />
Now is better than never.<br />
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br />
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&#8217;s a bad idea.<br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />
Namespaces are one honking great idea &#8212; let&#8217;s do more of those!</p></blockquote>
<p>Ruby on Rails fanboys have a similar set of core beliefs, the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-is-rails" target="_blank">Rails Way</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>DRY – “Don’t Repeat Yourself” – suggests that writing the same code over and over again is a bad thing.<br />
Convention Over Configuration – means that Rails makes assumptions about what you want to do and how you’re going to d o it, rather than requiring you to specify every little thing through endless configuration files.<br />
REST is the best pattern for web applications – organizing your application around resources and standard HTTP verbs is the fastest way to go.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you happen to wholeheartedly agree with the Ruby on Rails way, then by using it you are certain to find both a technical environment in which you can feel happy, and a community that shares you strong opinions about software development. It is any wonder, then, that people <em>passionate</em> about the RoR values would flock to RoR and, inevitably, start advocating its use?</p>
<p>Going a little bit further, if you are hiring for your software company, would you rather hire someone with weak opinions on most topics because they are «flexible» or someone with strong opinions that match the strong opinions of your company? Given the choice, I would certainly hire the latter.</p>
<p>I have my own «core philosophy» that I apply to the way I write my own code. These would be, by order of decreasing importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is better to <strong>have a correct program with few features</strong>, than a buggy program with many features.<br />
<small>If possible, take the time to design your code and your interface so that errors cannot happen. If not, explicitly detect and display all errors as they happen. If possible, have a programming language and a programming style that can eliminate by design many errors, rather than a programming language or programming style that improves productivity at the cost of having more errors.<br />
</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>prove the correctness of a program</strong>, than to test for the existence of bugs.<br />
<small>Tests cannot prove that the software is correct, they may only prove the existence of bugs. A proven program contains no bugs, there is no worry about having enough code coverage and enough test cases. This is a special case of &#8220;fail early&#8221; : better to fail at the compilation stage, than to fail during tests or at runtime.</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>accept that code will have to be rewritten</strong>, than to future-proof a complex design.<br />
<small>Future-proof code will likely be larger, and contains more untested pieces, than normal code. This increases the probability of bugs, without completely eliminating the possibility of a completely unforeseen design change that still involves a rewrite. Preparing your code for a rewrite, by splitting it up into clean independent self-documenting modules and creating automated correctness checks for these, is the best way to make it flexible.<br />
</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>enforce data constraints through types</strong>, than to enforce it through code.<br />
<small>Attempting to store data that violates the constraints fails earlier if the type cannot represent that data, especially in a statically typed language. Doing things this way might take longer than just keeping a flexible data type and performing the constraint checks in the code, but the odds of it being correct are higher.<br />
</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>have the computer do work for you</strong>, than for you to do that work yourself.<br />
<small>Why write trivial unit tests when you can harness the type system to perform those checks? Why define or configure things by hand when your framework could define or configure them for you?</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>rewrite your code using new concepts</strong>, than to insist on using existing but ill-adapted concepts.<br />
<small>Concepts improve productivity and readability, and by design will prevent some kinds of incorrect usage, but only as long as they match what the software is expected to be doing. Otherwise, at best they will be a useless weight and at worst will have to be tediously worked around to achieve anything. The size of the refactoring is no obstacle: if half the application needs to be adapted to the new concept, then so be it.<br />
</small></li>
<li>It is better to <strong>repeat yourself from time to time</strong>, than to introduce too many concepts.<br />
<small>Any repetition can be eliminated by adding a new abstraction through refactoring. That abstraction is usually a mere application of an existing pattern or concept, but might sometimes give flesh to a new concept. While that concept arguably already existed in the non-refactored code, it is easier to understand uncommon concepts by looking at their repeated code, than to give them a sufficiently understandable name.</small></li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Maybe someone might agree with me one day.<br />

<p>As you might remember, we spent two nights at the <em>Cocosul Rosu</em> in Sibiu. On the whole, the stay was pretty pleasant, although the lack of a host-provided breakfast had us walk all the way to the town squares in search of a restaurant that would be open early enough to accomodate us (our final choice is Timi&#8217;s, in the southwest corner of the <em>Piata Mare</em>). Also, do not under any circumstances open the window past nightfall, or you will let in an entire menagerie of bloodsucking insects.</p>
<p>On day 10, we started with a quick visit to the Brukenthal museum of art. The exhibits were correct bordering on remarkable, but the maze-like layout of the museum (as with, it seems, all museums we&#8217;ve visited in Romania so far) is extremely frustrating. Indeed, navigating involves a fair bit of backtracking, and there are often several forks both within exhibitions and between exhibitions where you will require the assistance of a museum employee, because there are no useful signs or written hints available.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6056893180_9288b62f83_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Brukenthal Museum of Art</p></div>
<p>Our next stop was Brașov. As an interesting bit of trivia, the old name of the city was Corona, and so the modern beer brand Corona lavishly sponsors the city pubs, bars and restaurant terraces.</p>
<p>Near the city is the pass of Bran, overlooked by the castle of Bran, the kind of castle Bram Stoker would have chosen for count Dracula to live in. The castle was renovated, its walls were painted white, and flowers were planted everywhere, so whatever eerie gothic aspect Stoker could have seen there is probably gone, but the peddlers of vampire-themed trinkets right outside the castle doors are there to stay.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6056892252_cd22908728_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Entrance to Bran castle.</p></div>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6056342241_c70f8643cd_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Empty corridor inside Bran castle.</p></div>

<p>Bran castle is by all definitions a tourist trap. The roads that lead to the city are lined for miles with housing and restaurant advertising, and the city itself is drowned in far more traffic than its single road can allow. Everything here reaches prices beyond anything else in the country. The ice cream parlour in front of the castle serves ice cream that would be costly in a posh Parisian restaurant, though I have no reason to assume that it is actually worth it.</p>
<p>I am lucky to be two meters tall and be able to see above the heads of the hundreds of tourists navigating the (again, maze-like and frustrating) corridors of the castle, although the low ceiling in many of the rooms could prove quite unforgiving if you ever forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6056889046_48f6f08e45_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Our bed &amp; breakfast in Brașov.</p></div>
<p>On day 11, we visited Brașov itself. Before I post pictures, here&#8217;s some information about the layout of the city: most of the interesting pieces are in a valley in the Carpathes, with the south edge of the valley holding a cable car station and the name &#8220;BRASOV&#8221; written on the top, Hollywood-style, and the north edge of the valley holding two fortified towers (the white tower and the black tower). Inside the valley is the Council Square (<em>Piata Sfatului</em>) and the Black Church.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6056341501_f22393ac4b_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The cable car and southern ridge, seen from the Council Square.</p></div>
<p>Our first trip of the day involved the cable car. The view was so gorgeous, we forgot to take good pictures of it.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6056340049_f1ca92d76b_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking down through the letter B.</p></div>
<p>After we came back down, we visited the white and black towers.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6056339569_c21b77dd67_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">White tower seen from the southern ridge.</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6056886872_b55d3487c8_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Black tower.</p></div>
<p>Both towers contain museums. The Black tower museum was opened every day 9-6, and we arrived at around 1 pm, so the museum was obviously <em>closed</em>. I swear, all the museums we try to see are closed for unspecified or ridiculous reasons when we get there.</p>
<p>The White tower museum was open, and therefore much more amusing.</p>
<p>First, let it be known that the top floor of the White tower is the best sauna in the entire city, and that is probably unintentional. The top floor of the tower has a dark wooden floor and no ceiling (it burned down in the last city-wide fire) and so it is capped with an array of glass panels that turn it into a glasshouse of sorts. You can feel the heat wrapping from your scalp down to your toes as you climb the last flight of stairs, and five minutes later you can smell yourself roasting.</p>
<div id="attachment_2532" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 660px"><a href="http://www.hotel-stary-mlyn.com/images/sauna.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2532" title="sauna" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sauna.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="455" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I Wish.</p></div>
<p>The public employee in the White tower is responsible for selling tickets, but also has a small shop of various souvenirs, trinkets, postcards, audio CDs, pamphlets and other things that she <em>will</em> try to sell at any occasion, with unerring insistence. She offered me, in no more than two minutes&#8217; time, a presentation pamphlet of the White tower in French (which was actually Spanish) for 2 lei, an unfolding image book of the tower for 7 lei, two postcards for 3 lei, an audio CD about the region for 15 lei, and a small keychain trinket for 5 lei that I did not identify.</p>
<p>I wish I could sell my start-up product like that.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6056886308_044cc50663_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mountain river below the White tower.</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6056885804_0635499658_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Black Church.</p></div>
<p>The city is also home to the Black Church, so named because it was covered in soot after the aforementioned city-wide fire. The church contains several organs collected from surrounding churches in addition to its own beautiful 4000-pipe organ. We went to a concert in the evening, involving some quite elaborate Bach and Liszt pieces.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day 8, we drove from Târgu Jiu to Sibiu. Alix was driving for the first half, and I caught this on the side of the road:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6050725256_5db96d35a4_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Stork</p></div>
<p>We stopped for what we expected to be a quick visit at the Hurez monastery near Horezu. There were many people, as August 15th is a religious celebration. While we were visiting, three ladies came up to me, handed me a camera and asked me to take a picture of them. I obliged. We met again near the cloister, where the sisters were giving out some sweets and wine, and the three of them invited us to have lunch with them in the monastery. We agreed.</p>
<p>Lunch was served in the two communal dining rooms of the monastery. We ate in the smaller of the two along with maybe a dozen other people, who were all quite interested in hearing about my Romanian roots and a comparison with French culture. The food was simple: vegetable <em>ciorba</em>, exceptionally tender veal with mashed potatoes, and watermelon. </p>
<p>We were then invited to visit the private areas of the monastery &mdash; as one of the three women knew the mother superior quite well &mdash; and we enjoyed some coffee, sweets and some slices of delicious <em>telemea</em> cow cheese produced at the monastery, while enjoying this view:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6050725016_f32820e455_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking south</p></div>
<p>We were also allowed to visit the bell tower:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6050173751_faaf98861f_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking east</p></div>
<p>And we were also shown the private chapel where the Brâncoveanu family used to pray, when they lived in the monastery, as well as one of the first printed bibles written in Romanian.</p>
<p>We took our leave two hours and a half later than we had expected to, but with a better lunch that we could have hoped to find in <em>Râmnicu Vîlcea</em>. Still, this day brought us more than just free food: knowing that people are willingly and selflessly sharing with others, expecting nothing more than a few words in return; and that the best experience is not one you can buy.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6050173571_0761ec4d16_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Hurez monastery</p></div>
<p>The rest of the day was spent driving up the valley of the Olt river and reaching Sibiu. </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6185/6050173389_f2f55df982_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Had this on my right for around 50 km</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6210/6050172679_3c66c168e5_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bridge of Lies, in Sibiu</p></div>
<p>We are spending two nights at the <em>Cocosul Rosu</em> bed <strike>and breakfast</strike> (I kid you not, this means the <em>Red <strike>Cock</strike> Rooster</em>) before going to <em>Brasov</em>.</p>
<p>Sibiu is a Romanian city with a strong german-speaking community, beautiful medieval architecture and a much better shape than other cities we have visited so far. If I had to pick, I&#8217;d rather have Sibiu than Bucharest.</p>
<p>On day nine, we visited the city. The Brukenthal museum of arts was closed, but should be open again tomorrow. Instead, we visited the Brukenthal museum of history (which had a quite enjoyable exhibition about the city guilds), then toured the city under a blistering heat and unforgiving sun.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, the eye candy. This is how day seven ended:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6042572681_4ddc7a8eb9_z.jpg" alt="Coloana Infinitului" width="480" height="640" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Coloana Infinitului</p></div>
<p>On day 6, we started from Drobeta Turnu Severin and rented a car up to Baile Herculane, nested in a valley in the mountains. There, we had a late lunch at the Hotel Ferdinand restaurant, which is beautifully laid out as a series of terraces on a fairly steep slope.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6043115458_90095a720e_z.jpg" alt="Hercules" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hercules</p></div>
<p>The hot mountain springs at Baile Herculane were already known by romans (hence the name), and are still active. We tried them out.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/6043115012_0cc721529e_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Left: cold. Right: hot.</p></div>
<p>Then, we visited the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Gate_%28Danube%29" target="_blank">Iron Gates</a>, a beautiful gorge on the Danube river that separates Romania from Serbia. While driving along the Danube, I actually received a welcome SMS from the Serbian branch of my mobile provider&#8230;</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6202/6042569183_0fac1984ee_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Serbian side of the gorge.</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6042570057_8a2cb60cbc_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The penultimate narrowing on the Danube.</p></div>
<p>Sadly, the Drobeta Turnu Severin museum was closed, which included the last standing parts of Emperor Traian&#8217;s bridge (the one Romans used to bring over enough troops to seize control over Dacia).</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6207/6043112746_9ca6987944_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Closed for renovation.</p></div>
<p>Day seven started in Tîrgu Jiu, northeast of Drobeta Turnu Severin. We are staying at the Hotel Restaurant Europa, which happens to have a great restaurant with a great lemonade.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6042567905_3f7d26ae12_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Demand to see life's manager!</p></div>
<p>We drove west from the city to explore Constantin Brâncuş&#8217;s home town of Hobiţa.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6043116270_099fb26134_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Museum Sign</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6150/6043111214_69b7da40e6_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wooden church erected by Constantin's grandfather.</p></div>
<p>We pushed further west to Baia de Aramă, visiting the Tismana monastery along the way, where we were caught by rain in a forested valley.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6130/6043111560_4c3efc304a_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sun + Rain + Forest</p></div>
<p>Back in Târgu Jiu, we visited the scluptural ensemble by Constantin Brâncuş dedicated to the solders who died in the Great War. It is composed of the <a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masa_t%C4%83cerii" target="_blank">Table of Silence</a> (twelve stone chairs around a large round stone table) followed closely by the <a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poarta_S%C4%83rutului" target="_blank">Gate of the Kiss</a> (a large stone gate), then the Path of Heroes (an empty path, about 1300 m long) and finally the Column of the Infinite.</p>
<p>The artist designed the Path of Heroes so that a visitor sitting at the Table of Silence and looking through the Gate of the Kiss would see the Column of the Infinite in the distance. This was planned in 1935-1938. However, in 1937, king Carol II authorized the building of an orthodox church in the middle of the Path of Heroes, completely breaking the perspective.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of the article is one of the Column of the Infinite.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/6043117280_8e0bef64c9_z.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My Hat of the Infinite</p></div>

<p>The Caru cu Bere is a beautiful location. It&#8217;s also extremely loud and filled with cigarette smoke, and the food is not significantly better than other restaurants we sampled. As its name implies, it probably serves good beer, but I did not try.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We cannot seem to find tea &mdash; the local &#8220;Ceai&#8221; always seems to be some kind of fruit- or leaf-based infusion without actual tea, even though it is labeled as &#8220;Thé&#8221; or &#8220;Tea&#8221;. I have resorted to Pepsi for my morning caffeine.</p>

<p>We dined at the Monte Carlo in the Cişmigiu gardens. The food is absolutely excellent, and waiters are orders of magnitude more polite than the ones we have in Paris.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the crippling heat of the last few weeks turned to freezing downpour tonight, but we managed to stay inside most of the time. In front of the National History Museum, a team of workers that were restoring the pavement did not work yesterday because of the heat, and did not work this afternoon because of the rain. I wonder whether the pavement will be done by the time we leave.</p>
