Aside from lobbying, they also employ private investigators to track down and bust copyright infringers. Today, one of them spills the beans. Gavin "Tex" Warren reveals how he was instructed to boost statistics, link piracy to drug trafficking, and manipulate the police in order to secure more interest for the war on piracy. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/private-anti-piracy-investigator-spills-the-beans-111003/">Private Anti-Piracy Investigator Spills The Beans</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood goes to extremes to protect its interests worldwide. By now it&#8217;s public knowledge that MPAA-funded groups are lobbying at the highest political levels, but when it comes to law enforcement they have their ways of being heard too. </p>
<p>In the U.S. the MPAA was the outfit that <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/us-government-made-painful-mistakes-in-torrent-finder-seizure-101217/">tipped</a> the authorities off on many of the &#8216;rogue&#8217; sites that had their domain names seized in the last year. Similarly, in the U.K. the MPAA-funded group FACT carried out most of the investigative work in cases against the operators of the BitTorrent community <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/court-drops-filesoup-bittorrent-case-administrators-walk-free-110224/">FileSoup</a> and the streaming site <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tv-links-triumphs-with-landmark-e-commerce-directive-ruling-100212/">TV-Links</a>. </p>
<p>Today we talk to <a href="http://web.me.com/gavin.warren/TexxasHQ/About_Me.html">Gavin &#8220;Tex&#8221; Warren</a>, a private investigator who worked for the Hollywood backed group <a href="http://www.afact.org.au/">AFACT </a>in Australia. While he mostly worked on offline piracy, his inside view allows us to learn more about how the anti-piracy agenda is sold to the outside world. </p>
<p>Warren became a private investigator in 2000, and prior to that he served as a detective in the Australian Federal Police for twelve years. From 2003 until 2008 he worked as an investigator, undercover operative handler and then lead investigator for AFACT. When AFACT moved their priorities from offline piracy to ISPs, they eventually let Warren go.</p>
<h3>The Big Score</h3>
<p>&#8220;Initially AFACT was called the Australasian Film and Video Security Office and was run out of Sydney by Mr Steve Howes,&#8221; Warren says, explaining how it all started for him in 2003. &#8220;The lead investigator here in Melbourne was another former AFP officer, Greg Hooper.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I had an undercover operative who worked for me (name withheld) that I shall refer to as &#8220;Short Round&#8221;. We were contracted to make purchases of DVDs and back then, VHS tapes of copyright infringing movies. In our first operation which lasted about six months, we had infiltrated a manufacturing &#8220;laboratory&#8221; and the dodgy sales team at the local trash and treasure market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren&#8217;s team then made so-called &#8216;trap purchases&#8217; and all the evidence they gathered was then presented to the Victoria Police. The operation resulted in the execution of three simultaneous search warrants, netting about fifteen thousand exhibits, $30,000 cash and a dozen computer towers. It was a great success that was quickly communicated to the media. </p>
<p>&#8220;The press were informed and all was tied up in a neat bundle. Column inches were filled, sound bites were created and everyone was happy, except the pirates,&#8221; Warren recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;This success ensured that Short Round and I had ongoing work.  The AFVSO was subsumed by AFACT soon thereafter. Steve Howes was replaced by Neil Gane, a former British Hong Kong Police Inspector who had been working in Malaysia with the MPAA against piracy.&#8221;  </p>
<h3>Boosting Statistics</h3>
<p>&#8220;At this time, Short Round and I were trotted out to meet Neil and to show him our equipment and discuss tactics. Mr Gane gave the impression of being very committed to stopping the evil scourge of piracy and was far more media savvy that his predecessor.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;He was adamant that we needed to boost our statistics to make the media sit up and take notice and that the large numbers would make it easier to get the local Police interested.  This was especially difficult to do as local police had no jurisdiction over copyright infringing product and the AFP were desperately short on manpower. We were encouraged to find links to drugs and stolen goods wherever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We discussed the formula for extrapolating the potential street value earnings of &#8216;laboratories&#8217; and we were instructed to count all blank discs in our seizure figures as they were potential product. Mr Gane also explained that the increased loss approximation figures were derived from all forms of impacts on decreasing cinema patronage right through to the farmer who grows the corn for popping.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Gane understood that the media was an essential tool towards AFACT&#8217;s goal of getting tougher copyright legislation in place. And for this purpose, it was a good idea to bend the truth a bit. The results of this recalculation are quite amazing.</p>
<p>&#8220;2002 impact estimates were $100 million to today&#8217;s figure of $1.36 billion in nine years&#8230;. That&#8217;s a lot of extrapolating,&#8221; Warren says.</p>
<h3>Courting the Police</h3>
<p>Aside from influencing lawmakers with creative statistics, Warren and his colleagues also had to court the police on a regular basis. AFACT worked with both local law enforcement and the attorney general&#8217;s office where they delivered evidence and information to, based on their own investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funded solely by MPAA, AFACT lobbies hard for changes to Australian law and enhance the sexiness of their case by making vague references to links to terrorism. Sometimes not so vague. I was instructed to tell police officers that the profit margins were greater than dealing heroin. It was bizarre. A twisted logic that AFACT spewed out with monotonous regularity,&#8221; Warren says.</p>
<p>One of the examples Warren gives is that they assumed that all burners and DVD replicators would run 24/7, making these operations appear very lucrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each burner cranking out ten discs an hour, multiplied by ten dollars per disc is potentially a hundred dollars an hour, multiplied by number of burners by hours in a year gives a yearly potential&#8230;. Very pumped up statistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the local police were convinced about the to need to follow-up on the case, Warren delivered them all the evidence they would need on a silver platter.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my time at AFACT we developed relationships with various police officers (detectives) and would work our cases up to a stage where we could present them with enough information, intelligence and evidence that most of the work was done. This is called a &#8216;walk up start&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Police on the other hand would sometimes find large quantities of copyright infringing material whilst executing warrants, eg: drug warrant executions would invariably turn up some dodgy DVDs and I would get a call to come and identify the product and prepare a brief of evidence for prosecution.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;It was a matter of educating the police officers what to look for. In this vein, I would regularly deliver half day seminars to police on their training days.  It was a good system and had the effect of increasing their prosecutions and my investigations statistics.  Collaboration had such a dark overtone. Cooperation is my preferred term,&#8221; Warren says.</p>
<p>Like many other private investigators Warren is a former police detective. And although the statistics may have been pumped a little, Warren was always careful to act within the boundaries of the law when it comes to his investigative work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PI license is relatively difficult to obtain and easy to lose, therefore we tend to shy away from any activity that would jeopardize our livelihood. The key to efficient and effective investigations is to know all aspects of the various legislations that cover things such as Surveillance Devices, hidden cameras etc. At no time did I authorize or condone the breaking of any laws or rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undercover operations, to be used in evidence, need to be squeaky clean.  The last thing any investigator needs is to have evidence thrown out of court because of the breach of legislation, or compromise by way of entrapment,&#8221; Warren told TorrentFreak.</p>
<h3>Bye Bye PI</h3>
<p>At the end of 2007 Warren had a meeting with Neil Gane, who just returned to AFACT after serving as the Australasian Operations Manager for the MPAA for a brief while. Gane told Warren that AFACT would be focusing more on ISPs and online piracy instead of the street work Warren did. </p>
<p>Warren was still welcome to submit a tender for piecemeal work at an hourly rate, instead of daily. However, he later learned that his partner and former friend, Short Round, had undercut him, and was working on an as-needed basis for AFACT.</p>
<p>This ended Warren&#8217;s &#8216;career&#8217; in the anti-piracy business. In the years that followed he continued to monitor what AFACT was up to, and he still can&#8217;t help but crack a smile when he reads about the disastrous piracy statistics AFACT tells the media about.  And so do we.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[If we have learned anything from the wars over the copyright monopoly, it is that the high court and low court have returned. Being equal before the law is a key cornerstone of our society that people don't even pretend is reality anymore.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/return-of-the-high-court-and-low-court-111002/">Return Of The High Court And Low Court</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/trial-pig.jpg" align="right" alt="trial" />In the Middle Ages, there were sometimes two sets of justice systems. </p>
<p>A &#8220;high court&#8221; for nobility, where people would be sentenced to pay a fine, issue a formal apology, or to lead armies into would-be colonies for ten years and return as rich as dragons. And a &#8220;low court&#8221; for the common folk, where people would be sentenced to branding, have their hands cut off, or sometimes just thrown in jail if it was a petty offense; like killing another commoner, which was a lesser offense than stealing from merchants.</p>
<p>When I grew up, school taught me that democracies in the West are proud of how everybody is equal before the law. It was not until I became a full-time politician that I realized what a joke this is.</p>
<p>In reality, the high courts and low courts have been reintroduced in silence. When Sony BMG&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal">broke into</a> millions of computers worldwide in 2005, rootkitting them to disable their ability to run instructions that would violate Sony&#8217;s own interpretation of its copyright monopoly, Sony was sentenced to send out marketing material for its own products and no individual executives were charged. When LulzSec members were arrested for breaking into systems in the singular, they get the low court treatment.</p>
<p>When a commoner is accused of violating the copyright monopoly, in some draconian countries like France, they can be sent into social exile without even getting a trial in the low court. In contrast, the noble Voddler (a video-on-demand service) violated the GPL <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voddler#GPL_violation_controversy">egregiously</a> by using free software to build its service &#8212; but without resharing the code, thus violating the copyright monopoly that GPL builds on, and for thoroughly commercial purposes. They were never prosecuted. In contrast, they are now speaking at hearings in parliaments on how successful they are.</p>
<p>As a politician, <strong>I have learned that the rights of the commoners are never enforced against the noble, but that the monopolies of the noble are always enforced against commoners.</strong> This is not being equal before the law. When did this division of people happen? How did some become more equal than others?</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on how the copyright nobility sat at the tables of the ACTA drafting, but where the rest of us creators &#8212; who only hold just as strong monopolies in theory &#8212; were mere commoners who should not interfere with the regulations of the monopoly on truth and culture.</p>
<p>There are many more examples. In Sweden and several other countries, commoners have to pay a fee to the copyright nobility just to play their own music &#8212; as in their singlehandedly composed and performed music &#8212; in their own hair styling salon.</p>
<p>This is just a symptom. The high and low courts go well beyond the scope of the copyright monopoly.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it about time we <strong>reconquered</strong> democracy and <strong>abolished</strong> the high and low courts? <strong>Again?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/fmc.jpg" align="right" alt="free music contest" />Royalty collection agencies are known for going to extremes as they go about their business claiming money on behalf of artists and music composers. </p>
<p>They target <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/uk-copyright-cops-target-kids-schools-community-centers-081015/">schools</a> and kids’ community centers, charge charities for the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/charity-forced-to-pay-copyright-police-so-kids-can-sing-071209/">singing</a> of Christmas carols without a license, and even <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/spanish-rights-org-breaks-laws-081225/">crash weddings</a> if they have to.</p>
<p>While these copyright collectors are very strict in forcing their rules onto others, they often <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/copyright-group-prosecuted-for-failing-to-pay-artists-090722/">fail to live up</a> to their own standards. This attitude was brilliantly exposed by the Belgian TV-show Basta when it <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/music-royalty-society-collects-money-for-fake-artists-bathroom-equipment-and-food-110308/">exposed</a> local music royalty collecting agency SABAM for charging people to pay non-existent artists.</p>
<p>This week, German royalty collecting agency GEMA made the headlines with a similar mistake. The  group is claiming money from  the nonprofit organization <a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/">Musikpiraten</a>, for releasing a compilation CD featuring the winners of its Creative Commons competition &#8220;<a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/fmc/2011/en/free_music_contest_winner">Free! Music! Contest</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musikpiraten received a 350 euro invoice for five tracks listed on the CD, a false claim for which the pirates are considering filing a copyfraud complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;GEMA&#8217;s claim that they hold these rights is demonstrably false. All artists have explicitly declared that they are neither members of GEMA nor of any foreign royalties collection society. The demands are therefore clearly a copyfraud,&#8221; Christian Hufgard, chairman of Musikpiraten <a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/pressemitteilung/2011/09/29/musikpiraten_ev_prueft_strafanzeige_gegen_gema-1241">explains</a>.</p>
<p>The false claim appears to have been sent because some of the authors have names similar to registered GEMA members. But even then, the mere notion that the CD features work from a Creative Commons competition should have made GEMA reconsider their claim. That didn&#8217;t happen though. </p>
<p>According to the Musikpiraten chairman, GEMA and other royalty collectors simply assume that all artists fall under their wings. This is an outdated assumption, especially in the digital era where many artists allow people to share and redistribute their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Internet portals like Jamendo.com with more than 52,000 albums published under Creative Commons license are a proof that the principle of &#8216;all rights reserved&#8217; is outdated. If an artist verifies to us or to another publisher that he or she is not a member of GEMA, this certainly must have more weight than the blanket assumption that every author is a member of GEMA or a similar society,&#8221; Hufgard says.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a royalty collection agency has filed a false copyright claim, and some artists have even cancelled their membership because they do more harm than good. Michael Koch, singer and guitarist of &#8220;<a href="http://www.theprincessandthepearl.de/">the.princess.and.the.pearl</a>,&#8221; one of the bands who GEMA falsely claimed royalties for, is one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think highly of GEMA. I used to be a member, and our band actually lost a couple of gigs, because the organisers of small festivals were unable to afford the GEMA fees, of which hardly anything flows back to the band in terms of royalties,&#8221; he says. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we, as non-members, must prove that our music has not been composed by a GEMA member, demonstrates that the society has too much power – and that it abuses it ruthlessly,&#8221; Koch adds. </p>
<p>A testament to the ruthless stance of GEMA is the fact that they didn&#8217;t immediately send a credit note when the mistake was pointed out to them. Instead, the royalty collecting agency suggested that the artists probably forgot to register the tracks with GEMA, and they asked Musikpiraten to convince them that the identical names are a pure coincidence. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[A few days ago Siegfried Kauder, Chairman of the Legal Committee of the German Parliament, announced a plan to introduce a two-strikes model for persistent pirates. After two warnings, Internet users would lose their Internet access to protect the interests of copyright holders. However, it now turns out that the politician himself might be the first to be disconnected as his website features copyrighted photos that were lifted without permission.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/politician-violates-his-own-two-strikes-anti-piracy-plan-111001/">Politician Violates His Own Two-Strikes Anti-Piracy Plan</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/kauder.jpg" align="right" alt="kauder" />We see it time and time again. Copyright is a double edged sword, and those who sharpen one side often get cut by the other.</p>
<p>When the German politician Siegfried Kauder introduced a two-strikes model to beat online piracy a <a href="http://www.gulli.com/news/17201-bundestag-vorsitzender-des-rechtsausschusses-will-gesetzentwurf-fuer-2-strikes-2011-09-26">few days ago</a>, his own actions with regard to copyright were weighed carefully. </p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long before people spotted Kauder&#8217;s first infringement on his personal website, which was quickly followed by another one.</p>
<p>In what has now been dubbed Kaudergate, the pro-copyright politician was hosting at least two photos on <a href="http://www.siegfriedkauder.de/">his website</a> which were taken from a photo sharing site <a href="http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/siegfried_kauder-575-37692--f312709.html#q312709">without permission</a> (<a href="http://www.panoramio.com/photo/12937120">1</a>, <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/photo/2012137">2</a>).  </p>
<p>When blogs and news sites <a href="http://www.gulli.com/news/17227-wirft-sich-siegfried-kauder-bald-selbst-aus-dem-netz-only-one-strike-to-go-2011-09-29">picked up</a> this &#8216;mistake&#8217; the photos were quickly removed, but by then it was already too late. </p>
<p>Confronted with the blatant copyright infringements, Kauder tried to turn the tables in an attempt to use his failure to support his plans. He <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,789073,00.html">told </a>the German news outlet Der Spiegel that this is a perfect example of how effective a two-strikes policy would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that I got the opportunity to show how the warning model works. The use of the two copyright-protected photographs was brought to my attention. The photos were then removed, so the warning model works,&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p>An interesting attempt at spinning things around, if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that the copyrighted photos are still hosted on the server of Kauder&#8217;s website. So even after being outed by hundreds of blogs and the mainstream press two days ago, the politician &#8211; who is also a lawyer &#8211; continues to infringe copyrights (<a href="http://www.siegfriedkauder.de/Kauder2010/03_Wahlkreis/Fotos/ds_schloss.jpg">1</a>, <a href="http://www.siegfriedkauder.de/Kauder2010/03_Wahlkreis/Fotos/Hornberg_Burg.jpg">2</a>). </p>
<p>Even worse, Kauder claimed in the press that he had somehow &#8220;licensed&#8221; the photos after he realized his mistake. However, the photographer who owns the rights <a href="http://piratig.de/2011/09/30/kaudergate-2ndstrike-sehr-geehrter-herr-kauder/">denies this</a> and commented that the politician hasn&#8217;t been in contact at all.</p>
<p>One has to wonder that when a politician who wants to introduce a two-strikes anti-piracy system doesn&#8217;t even know how to stop breaking the law, how can he demand that others should?</p>
<p>Needless to say, the public is now demanding that he will be disconnected from the Internet. That would probably set a good example.</p>

According to a report from one of the country's leading ISPs, thousands of Australians will soon be receiving pay-up-or-else letters for allegedly sharing movies using BitTorrent.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/mass-bittorrent-lawsuits-set-to-plague-australia-111001/">Mass BitTorrent Lawsuits Set To Plague Australia</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/movierightsgroup.jpg"><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/movierightsgroup.jpg" alt="" title="movierightsgroup" width="180" height="71" class="alignright size-full wp-image-40771" /></a>By now it&#8217;s a well-trodden path. Partner up some law firm with a film, music or game studio who aren&#8217;t bothered by negative publicity. Hash together a piece of software, throw it into a BitTorrent swarm, harvest some IP addresses and obtain the real identities of the individuals behind them from their ISPs.</p>
<p>From there threaten legal action, but offer to settle for less money than it would cost to defend. Profit.</p>
<p>And now this controversial plague has spread to Australia.</p>
<p>According to John Linton, chief of ISP Exetel, his company has been approached by US film distributor <a href="http://www.lightningentertainmentgroup.com/">Lightning Entertainment</a> who were brandishing a list of some 150 IP addresses from where their movie &#8220;Kill The Irishman&#8221; is said to have been shared. This is reportedly just part of the 9,000 Australian-based infringements the company is said to be pursuing.</p>
<p>As is normal for studios working in this area, Lightning have commissioned a front company to carry out the controversial business of extorting money from alleged infringers. According </a>to Renai LeNay of <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/10/01/us-style-mass-piracy-lawsuits-come-to-australia">Delimiter</a> who contacted TorrentFreak this morning, that outfit is called &#8216;Movie Rights Group&#8217;.</p>
<p>In common with other so-called rights groups in this area, <a href="http://www.movierightsgroup.com">Movie Rights Group</a> (MRG) aren&#8217;t forthcoming about who they are and their domain WHOIS has been anonymized. However, LeNay did manage to track down their vice president of sales and marketing <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/gordon-walker/5/60/887">Gordon Walker</a> who appears to have been very open about the company&#8217;s motives.</p>
<p>“Everybody knows that the Internet is the ultimate unkillable beast,” he told LeNay.</p>
<p>Going on to describe Movie Rights Group as “a commercial solution” to what had previously been seen as a legislative problem, Walker adds that on a chaotic information superhighway “You’ve got to have policemen and women in cars&#8221; dealing with infringement.</p>
<p>MRG, it seems, will be handing out the speeding tickets via their friends at <a href="http://www.lloyds.com.au/">Lloyds Solicitors</a> law firm. Question is, will Australians roll over and pay their fines, or stand strong and call their bluff? Time will tell.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/icesmall.jpg" class="alignright" width="205" height="154" />Mid-2010, nine sites connected to movie streaming were targeted by the U.S. government. They included NinjaVideo.net, at the time one of the Internet’s most prominent video streaming sites.</p>
<p>This &#8216;first round&#8217; in the ongoing “Operation in Our Sites” resulted in five people connected to NinjaVideo being  indicted by a federal grand jury this month. One of those indicted was site co-founder Hana Beshara.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Beshara &#8211; who is better known online by her pseudonym Phara, and affectionately referred to by NinjaVideo members as their &#8220;Queen&#8221; &#8211; pleaded guilty to her role in the founding of NinjaVideo during 2008.</p>
<p>The guilty plea of the Las Vegas-residing 29-year-old was made before U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga in the Eastern District of Virginia. For crimes of conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement, Beshara faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. </p>
<p>According to court documents, Beshara admitted negotiating agreements with online advertisers and together with the other defendants receiving revenue and donations totalling some $500,000. Of this amount, Beshara admitted personally receiving $200,000.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/phara.jpg" alt="Phara" /></center></p>
<p>&#8220;As part of her plea agreement, Beshara agreed to forfeit assets seized by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in June 2010, including cash, an investment brokerage account, two bank accounts, a Paypal account and one Internet advertising account,&#8221; reads a statement from the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Online, Beshara was a larger-than-life character who attracted both praise and criticism for her colorful management style as the most public-facing administrator of NinjaVideo.</p>
<p>But with this profile came enemies and at least one site dedicated to revealing her real identity. When photographs and details of her personal life appeared on the Internet in 2009, it was a question of when, not if, the site would eventually be brought down.</p>
<p>Beshara&#8217;s guilty plea follows that of co-defendant 23-year-old Matthew Smith, who <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ninjavideo-founder-faces-jail-time-following-guilty-plea-110924/">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement last week.</p>
<p>Smith will be sentenced 16th December and the remaining three defendants will face a jury trial beginning 6th February 2012.</p>
<p>Beshara will be sentencd 6th January 2012, where she faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/hurt-locker-dead.jpg" class="alignright" width="200" height="162" />Working alongside Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver law firm (better known as the U.S. Copyright Group), Voltage Pictures have been in the headlines time and again this year. Not for their movie-making skills, but for the copyright settlement shakedown built around their products.</p>
<p>Their most successful movie, the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker, attracted much of the attention when earlier this year it became the subject of a <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/hurt-locker-makers-target-record-breaking-24583-bittorrent-users-110523/">record-breaking lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>According to court documents filed this week, Voltage Pictures have voluntarily <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66928562/Progress-Report-Dismiss">dismissed</a> around 90% of the original 24,583 Doe Defendants from The Hurt Locker lawsuit. They were dismissed without prejudice, so in theory they could be filed again at a later date. A full list of the IP addresses dismissed from the case can be found embedded below.</p>
<p>In excess of 2,300 potential Does remain in the suit from a range of ISPs including Atlantic Broadband, Bresnan Communications, Charter, Comcast, Mediacom, Midcontinent Media, Qwest, RCN, Sprint, Verizon and Windstream.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the documents Voltage have homed in on a number of now-named defendants; Claudio Vazquez, Modern Classics Inc, Sergio Sapaj, Roy McLeese, Kelechi Lane, Shyam Madhavan, Susan Glass, Daniel Bremer-Wirtig, Michael Sein, Elena Ditraglia, Iride Ceccacci and J Barry Harrelson.</p>
<p>Defendants Vazquez, McLeese, and Ceccacci were dismissed, Glass was served and has filed an answer, Harrelson was served and is yet to file a response. Defendants Lane and Modern Classics have been served but have not responded &#8211; Voltage are going for a default judgments against these. </p>
<p>Voltage say they have been unable to serve some of the other named defendants above, and have not yet received identifying information for 2,278 IP addresses, mainly due to ISPs stalling due to &#8220;motions purportedly filed by the Doe Defendants.&#8221; For this reason they request extra time from the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plaintiff requests at least an additional 60 days in which to effectuate service on Defendants Bremer-Wirtig, Ditraglia, Madhavan, Sapaj, and Sein and to name and serve, or voluntarily dismiss without prejudice, the remaining Doe Defendants,&#8221; the court papers read.</p>
<p>How many of the original 24,583 defendants settled with Voltage Pictures for thousands of dollars remains unknown.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN has won its landmark court case against News-Service.com, one of the leading Usenet providers. The Amsterdam court ruled that the Usenet provider, which offers its network to Binverse and Usenext among others, has to delete all infringing content from its servers. This decision is similar to the one that effectively shut down the BitTorrent site Mininova, and it could mean the end of one of the leading providers of Usenet access.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/major-usenet-provider-ordered-to-remove-all-infringing-content-110929/">Major Usenet Provider Ordered to Remove All Infringing Content</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/news-service.png" align="right" alt="news service" />Two years ago BREIN, representing the movie and music industries, took News-Service.com (NSE) to court. </p>
<p>The group demanded that the Usenet provider delete all infringing content from its servers, and today the Court of Amsterdam sided with the copyright holders. </p>
<p>In an unprecedented <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66860179/BREIN-NSE">verdict</a> the court ruled that NSE has to remove all copyrighted content within four weeks, or pay 50,000 euros  ($68,000) in fines per day. The court states that NSE willingly facilitates copyright infringement through its services. </p>
<p>NSE argued that are simply transmitting content, much like an Internet provider does. However, the court rejected this defense, adding that a notice and takedown procedure is insufficient to protect the rightsholders. </p>
<p>The decision could have far-reaching consequences for many other Internet services, starting with NSE resellers such as Binverse and Usenext.. </p>
<p>“We are very disappointed with the Court&#8217;s verdict. It is technically as well as economically unfeasible to check the contents of the 15 to 20 million messages that are exchanged on a daily basis. Added to which, there is no automated way of checking whether Usenet messages contain copyrighted material or whether permission has been obtained for the distribution of such material,&#8221; NSE CEO Patrick Schreurs said in a comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see no way of complying with this verdict. Furthermore, the verdict endangers our very existence as a company, and is thus a threat to Usenet itself, as the facilitation of Usenet services has become impossible on the grounds of this verdict. The exchange of messages by means of this oldest of Internet services has de facto become impossible,” he adds.</p>
<p>The Usenet provider is currently considering whether it should appeal the decision.</p>
<p>BREIN is delighted with the verdict of the court, which is <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/mininova-ordered-to-remove-all-infringing-torrents-090826/">very similar</a> to the one that signaled the end of the BitTorrent site Mininova two years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a breakthrough step to further dismantle the availability of illegal content on Usenet,&#8221; director Tim Kuik responded.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the verdict of the Amsterdam Court is going to have a huge impact on the Usenet market, and the question has to be asked where it will stop. Could file-hosting services like MegaUpload and RapidShare be next? And what about other cloud hosting services such as Dropbox?</p>
<p>For now, however, NSE is faced with the impossible task of finding a way to identify and delete all copyrighted files from its servers. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[The popular cloud gaming service OnLive has been active in the U.S. for more than a year, and last week it launched in the U.K. OnLive works by rendering and storing games on remote servers, which are then streamed to users' computers or TVs. It appears though, that not all ISPs were prepared for the launch as P2P throttling systems also make it impossible to play OnLive games.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/talktalks-p2p-throttling-kills-onlive-games-110929/">TalkTalk&#8217;s P2P Throttling Kills OnLive Games</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="http://www.onlive.com/">OnLive</a> finally launched in the UK last week, thousands of people were eager to give it a try. The proposition of playing high-end games wherever you are, and on any machine, appeals to a wide audience. Unfortunately, however, the launch turned out to be a huge disappointment for many new OnLive subscribers. </p>
<p>As soon as the new service went live TalkTalk subscribers were noticing some strange behavior. During the day they were able to play games just fine, but after 6 in the evening, they were all of a sudden unable to connect. Then, after midnight the connection problems suddenly disappeared and games were loading just fine.</p>
<p>Initially some thought it could be that OnLive couldn&#8217;t keep up with the demand, but when the same pattern repeated during the following days it became apparent that something was seriously wrong. This was confirmed by OnLive&#8217;s support desk, who observed that the users with problems were facing excessive packet loss on their connections. </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here? </p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>OnLive the unintended victim of throttling</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/onlive-talk.jpg" alt="onlive talktalk" /></center></p>
<p>Based on the systematic problems between 6 PM and 12 AM, it appears that TalkTalk&#8217;s P2P throttling application is also cutting off OnLive. TalkTalk are very open about their traffic management practices, and they do indeed <a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk/legal/broadband-traffic-management/">limit P2P traffic</a> during the exact times OnLive users are facing problems. </p>
<p>OnLive uses UDP connections to transfer game data, and it seems that TalkTalk&#8217;s traffic shaping equipment mistakes this for P2P traffic. </p>
<p>TorrentFreak reached out to TalkTalk to find out more about the issue, as users in the ISP&#8217;s support forums were <a href="http://www.talktalkmembers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=45009">unable</a> to find out more. Yesterday we got a response and TalkTalk acknowledged the problem, but a fix is yet to be found.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been raised with our network team and we are currently investigating,&#8221; a TalkTalk spokesperson informed us. Meanwhile, TalkTalk subscribers are growing impatient as they feel that they are being ignored. </p>
<p>&#8220;I basically feel that my money spent on OnLive is being wasted. Working from 8:00 till 16.30 I have no use for this service as I would have wait until midnight to have access. Which is unrealistic, people need to have a good sleep, right?&#8221; OnLive user and TalkTalk subscriber Dawid told TorrentFreak. </p>
<p>And somehow we feel that OnLive is not very happy with the issue either, as they may lose customers who think that the cloud gaming platform is simply offering a bad service. A few users of other ISPs have been reporting issues as well, but only at TalkTalk are they still persisting more than a week after OnLive launched. </p>
<p>While we understand that problems can always occur, the above clearly illustrates the dangers of traffic shaping. There&#8217;s always going to be collateral damage. In the case of OnLive it is significant enough to be noticed and (hopefully) fixed, but what happens if a smaller company is affected? Hopefully TalkTalk will come forward with an official apology and more details on their UDP throttling, so this debacle can be prevented in the future. </p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/hurt-locker-dead.jpg" class="alignright" width="200" height="162" /></p>
<p>Since last year, Voltage Pictures, the makers of Hurt Locker, have been working with the Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver law firm (better known as the U.S. Copyright Group) to target Internet users who allegedly shared their Oscar-winning movie online.</p>
<p>Give us thousands of dollars in settlement, they say, and we won&#8217;t ruin your life with an expensive lawsuit.</p>
<p>Last month Voltage exported their scheme north to Canada and through the Federal Court in Montreal the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/hurt-locker-lawsuits-hit-canada-isps-ordered-to-reveal-bittorrent-users-110909">obtained an order</a> which forced three Canadian ISPs – Bell Canada, Cogeco Cable Inc. and Videotron GP – to hand over the personal details of subscribers Voltage claim infringed their copyrights.</p>
<p>Following a review of the IP addresses provided to the first ISP, Bell Canada (shown below), an eyebrow-raising nugget of information has come to light.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/bell-locker.jpg" alt="Bell Locker" /></center></p>
<p>The third IP on the list &#8211; 207.61.47.217 &#8211; looks much like any other. It is accused of sharing the movie using uTorrent v2.2.1.0 on May 4th 2011, and in itself that is nothing unusual. But further investigation shows that this particular IP address has a rather famous owner.</p>
<p>As shown <a href="http://www.ntunhs.net/cgi-bin/whois20_1_allip2.cgi?HPLang=EN&#038;IP=207.61.47.217">here</a>, not only is the IP provided by Bell Canada it can also be traced back to the Bell Centre. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s operated by none other than the <a href="http://canadiens.com">Montreal Canadiens</a> hockey team.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/canadiens1.jpg" alt="Canadiens" /></center></p>
<p>The big question now is whether Goudreau Gage Dubuc LLP, the law firm hired by Voltage to carry out their Canadian shakedown, will send their usual settlement demands to Montreal Canadiens. If they do, this could get very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that many individuals are able to obtain Internet access via 217.canadiens.com, the domain from which the infringement was allegedly logged. The problematic issue of pinning an infringement to an individual on a multiple access IP was highlighted perfectly in the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/movie-institute-feels-pain-of-ip-address-only-piracy-evidence-110922/">Swedish Film Institute case</a> recently. Furthermore, Montreal Canadiens have very, very deep pockets and lawyers on tap.</p>
<p>Hockey fans and opponents of these copyright shakedowns will be hoping that this particular Hurt Locker timebomb is dealt with by Canadiens via a boarding or their enforcer, rather than being subjected to an empty net goal, as Voltage might prefer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A new report looking into online music consumption habits shows that since 2009 the number of people who pirate music has dropped by 25 percent in Sweden. The sharp decrease coincides with a massive interest for the music streaming service Spotify. One of the main reasons why people switch to legal services is the wider range of material they can find there.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/music-piracy-continues-to-decline-thanks-to-spotify-110928/">Music Piracy Continues to Decline Thanks to Spotify</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/spotify.jpg" align="right" alt="spotify" />When Spotify launched their first beta in the fall of 2008, we <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/spotify-an-alternative-to-music-piracy-090102/">branded it</a> “an alternative to music piracy.”</p>
<p>Having the option to stream millions of tracks supported by an occasional ad, or free of ads for a small monthly fee, Spotify appeared to be serious competitor to music piracy. Data just released by the Swedish Music industry appears to support this theory.</p>
<p>Through quarterly surveys researchers have polled the music consumption habits of thousands of Swedes between the age of 15 and 74, and in their most <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66658516/Musiksverige-Svenskarnas-Internet-Van-Or-Q2-20111 ">recent report</a> they find that music piracy continues to drop. </p>
<p>Since 2009 the numbers of people who download music illegally has decreased by more than 25 percent, and over the last year alone it dropped by 9 percent. The data further suggests that this downward trend is caused by the availability of improved legal services such as Spotify. </p>
<p>When Spotify opened up to the public early 2009, it took only three months before the number of Spotify users had outgrown the number of music pirates. In the months after that the number of downloaders continued to decline while Spotify expanded its user base.<br />
<center><em>playing in Spotify..</em><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/riaa-spot.jpg" alt="riaa spotify" /></center></p>
<p>Streaming services such as Spotify are now the most popular way to consume music. More than 40 percent of the participants in the survey now use a music streaming service, compared to less than 10 percent who say they download music legally. </p>
<p>About 23 percent continue to pirate music, but this number is dwindling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long-term trend is a sharp increase in legal streaming while we see a reduction in illegal file sharing and downloading,&#8221; Music Sweden&#8217;s CEO Elizabet Widlund said commenting on the results. </p>
<p>&#8220;When 800,000 Swedes are willing to pay for streaming music, there is clearly a market for more legal players in the digital music market. We encourage diversity of music services as it will provide better conditions for both those who create music and those who listen to it,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Looking at the motivations for people to switch to legal services, participants in the survey cited &#8220;the range of music that&#8217;s released&#8221; as the primary reason (40%). Other explanations were the absolute increase in available music (30%), and the fact that legal services have become cheaper (24%) and simpler (24%).</p>
<p>Although the above is certainly good news for the music industry, it has to be noted that the &#8216;change&#8217; to legal services is &#8216;fragile.&#8217; The survey shows a slight change in the ongoing trend during the second quarter of 2011, exactly when Spotify announced that its free service would have some <a href="http://www.spotify.com/se/blog/archives/2011/04/14/upcoming-changes-to-spotify-free-open/">new limitations</a>.</p>
<p>Although this change motivated some (15%) to sign up with a paid Spotify account,  the majority (31%) said they would leave Spotify to turn to other streaming services, like YouTube, or file-sharing sites. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that, unlike music industry bosses have claimed in the past, there are indeed ways to compete with free. However, time is needed to find the right balance between giving music fans what they want, and secure a healthy revenue stream.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[After being threatened with a lawsuit by the Hollywood-funded anti-piracy outfit BREIN, a Dutch payment provider has handed over the personal details of a torrent site owner. The anti-piracy group is targeting payment providers in order to reveal the identity of site owners, as the information owners give to hosting companies is often false.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/payment-provider-hands-over-name-of-torrent-site-owner-110927/">Payment Provider Hands Over Name of Torrent Site Owner</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/brein-new.png" align="right" alt="brein" />Hundreds of torrent sites, private BitTorrent trackers in particular, allow their users to donate money in exchange for extra features. In part, the site owners use this money to keep their sites afloat, but if it&#8217;s up to anti-piracy watchdog BREIN, this type of funding will become their downfall.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://www.anti-piracy.nl/index.php">BREIN</a> announced that it would query payment providers such as PayPal for the personal information of account holders connected to &#8216;illegal&#8217; sites. BREIN <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-group-will-sue-pay-processors-if-they-dont-name-site-admins-110916/">threatened</a> to take these payment providers to court if they refused to cooperate, and it now appears that they were serious.</p>
<p>BREIN contacted a currently unnamed payment provider for the name and address of a torrent site owner who <a href="http://tweakers.net/nieuws/77014/brein-krijgt-naw-gegevens-via-betalingsprovider.html">accepted donations</a>. Initially the company declined to cooperate, but when BREIN scheduled a court case to obtain a preliminary injunction, the payment provider eventually caved in.</p>
<p>In the past BREIN succeeded in obtaining the personal details of torrent site owners from hosting providers, but since these are not always accurate his outfit is always looking for additional options. Going after payment providers seems to be their next logical step.</p>
<p>&#8220;The name and address information that illegal sites give to hosting providers are mostly false, but luckily financial service providers are required to verify the identity of their customers,&#8221; BREIN director Tim Kuik  said in a comment. &#8220;This gives us the ability to still find out the identity of managers of sites that earn money from their illegal activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there are various concerns about this process from a privacy point of view, it appears that BREIN&#8217;s request could fall within the boundaries of the law. Arnoud Engelfriet, lawyer with the Ictrecht law firm, explains that service providers may have little option than to cooperate.</p>
<p>“Dutch case law (in particular the Pessers/Lycos case) has held that in certain cases internet providers and other intermediaries are indeed required to hand over identifying information if a customer is likely committing a tort. A court intervention is not necessary according to our High Court,” he previously told TorrentFreak.</p>
<p>“The legal requirements are that it is without serious doubt that this customer is committing the tort, that releasing the identifying information is relevant for the case *and* that an evaluation of customer privacy versus the interests of the third party reveals ultimately that privacy must give way to those interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this particular case the payment provider was convinced that the actions of the torrent site were severe enough to give up the private information. One has to question though if the &#8216;evidence&#8217; presented by a party that has a clear stake in a dispute will be objective.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak asked BREIN director Tim Kuik whether he could provide more information regarding the nature of the torrent site they went after, but Kuik declined to release any additional information at this point. </p>
<p>What BREIN plans to do with the information they received from the payment provider is not clear either. The anti-piracy outfit has obtained this type of information from hosting companies <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/forced-exodus-of-bittorrent-sites-071122/">in the past</a>, but we&#8217;re not aware of any legal action that was taken against these torrent site owners.</p>
<p>For now, however, BREIN  is free to contact payment providers with further requests, which they have already indicated is their intention.</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lawyers-embarrassment-to-creative-rights-industry-100302/">reported</a> by TorrentFreak in March 2010, Golden Eye (International) Ltd, a company connected with the Ben Dover porn brand in the UK and one that had already been pursuing alleged file-sharers in Germany, decided to import their file-sharing settlement scheme to the UK.</p>
<p>Golden Eye, having already obtained the identities of file-sharers and retained the services of lawyers Tilly Bailey &#038; Irvine (TBI), must&#8217;ve thought that the cash would come rolling in, but things quickly went wrong. Alongside client MediaCAT, the now-defunct ACS:Law was in the process of destroying the marketplace for would-be profiteers, and it all got too much for TBI, who <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bad-publicity-forces-lawyers-out-of-anti-file-sharing-cases-100410/">announced</a> they were pulling out.</p>
<p>But what do you do if you&#8217;re Golden Eye, and you&#8217;re in possession of a paid-for list of names of people who may, given the right pressure, send you several hundred pounds to settle a file-sharing case? The answer appears to be &#8220;keep trying&#8221;.</p>
<p>Readers will be familiar with His Honour Judge Birss QC of the Patents Country Court, the judge who narrowly missed becoming <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-boss-is-internet-villain-of-the-year-110708/">2011&#8242;s Internet Hero</a> after bringing ACS:Law&#8217;s scheme to an end. According to court documents, a trio of cases filed by Golden Eye against alleged file-sharers have caught his attention.</p>
<p>The first, filed in the Northampton County Court against a Mr Maricar, sets out the picture as follows:</p>
<p><em>On 27th November 2009 the Claimant [Golden Eye] believes the defendant unlawfully made all or part of the film [Fancy an Indian?] available from his IP address for downloading by third parties.</p>
<p>On 29th September 2010 the Claimant sent a letter before action to the Defendant setting out in full its claim for breach of copyright. The Defendant failed to reply. The Claimant sent another letter to the Defendant on 8th November 2010 to which no response was received. The Claimant claims £700 for breach of copyright.</em></p>
<p>Judge Birss notes that the particulars in a second case against a Mrs Vithlani (whose identity was handed over by her ISP BSkyB following a Norwich Pharmacal order made by Mr Justice Vos on 4th February 2010) are essentially the same, some details aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away it will be seen that these claims bear some striking similarities to the claims in the litigation concerning the company Media CAT Ltd, the subject of my judgment Media CAT v Adams [2011]..,&#8221; Birss writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;However I should also make clear that there may very well be important differences between the present cases and the Media CAT cases. At this stage I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Birss did not elaborate, one of the key reasons that the ACS:Law/MediaCAT cases collapsed was that MediaCAT were not the rightsholders of the copyright material in question. From the details available it seems that Golden Eye aren&#8217;t the rightsholders of &#8216;Fancy an Indian?&#8217; either, Ben Dover Productions are. The latter would need to be joined with Golden Eye as claimants for the case to proceed.</p>
<p>But, yet again, the path to judicial scrutiny in these file-sharing cases has been hindered by the claimants. After discovering that against their will the case would not be heard in a county court but at the Patents County Court under Judge Birss, on 8th August 2011 Golden Eye tried to discontinue the case against Mrs Vithlani. The status of the case against Mr Maricar is uncertain, but it too has been transferred to the Patents County Court.</p>
<p>Defendant Mrs Vithlani has now applied for Ben Dover Productions to be joined to the proceedings and then allow the case to be struck out &#8211; but with costs awarded to her. In this event, those costs, and they could already be substantial, would have to be met by Ben Dover Productions.</p>
<p>When Sheptonhurst/Darker Enterprises, the original copyright holders in the ACS:Law/MediaCAT partnership refused to join their proceedings, MediaCAT went bankrupt to avoid picking up the bill. ACS:Law decided on the same fate.</p>
<p>Judge Birss also notes there is a third case on file against a Mr Rajan. After travelling through the county courts, it too ended up at the Patents County Court during March 2011. Shortly after Golden Eye filed to discontinue the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, since it is apparent that the claimant has commenced and is pursuing copyright infringement proceedings in the county courts arising presumably from information provided as a result of the order of Mr Justice Vos, the claimant is invited to consider and make submissions as to how any other of its pending cases arising from that order might be dealt with conveniently,&#8221; Judge Birss concludes.</p>
<p>So, cards on Judge Birss&#8217; table then for Golden Eye and Ben Dover, for all subscriber identities obtained so far.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sneaky feeling that, given Judge Birss&#8217; experience in this field, the outcome won&#8217;t be favorable for Golden Eye and it will be them and their settlement partners who will have to bend over, not the three targets of their scheme.</p>

Now, sidestepping an uncooperative judge in Columbia, the team are hoping to get more joy from one of his counterparts in Maryland, but they still haven't learned their lesson. Tests by TorrentFreak reveal that 98% of 4,165 potential defendants in the case are being sued in the wrong jurisdiction.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/98-of-bittorrent-users-in-copyright-shakedown-filed-in-wrong-jurisdiction-110926/">98% of BitTorrent Users In Copyright Shakedown Filed in Wrong Jurisdiction</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/mechanic.jpg"><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/mechanic.jpg" alt="" title="mechanic" width="180" height="239" class="alignright size-full wp-image-40603" /></a>For more than a year, Dunlap Grubb &#038; Weaver &#8211; aka the United States Copyright Group (USCG) &#8211; have sued tens of thousands of individuals who allegedly shared films using BitTorrent. Their aim: to extract cash settlements in order to make supposed lawsuits go away.</p>
<p>According to papers just filed, USCG will again partner with The Expendables creator Nu Image to chase down yet more BitTorrent users, this time those who allegedly obtained and distributed the Jason Statham movie The Mechanic.</p>
<p>The filing lists 4,165 IP addresses that were allegedly making the movie available between July 1st and August 8th this year. The number of ISPs targeted is small &#8211; Charter, Comcast, Cox, RCN and Windstream. Absent are Verizon and Time Warner, ISPs that have previously put limits on their levels of cooperation in these cases.</p>
<p>In recent months USCG have suffered major setbacks when submitted IP addresses were found to be located in the wrong jurisdictions, but you wouldn&#8217;t guess it from confident statements in their most recent filing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the true identity of each Defendant is unknown to the Plaintiff at this time, on information and belief, each Defendant may be found in this District and/or a substantial part of the acts of infringement complained of herein occurred in this District,&#8221; it reads.</p>
<p>Yet, in tests carried out by TorrentFreak, we discovered that of 4,165 IP addresses filed, just 2% can be traced back to the correct jurisdiction, in this case Maryland. The biggest group, 13.1%, are IP addresses in California. Columbia represent just 0.4% of the total.</p>
<p>This problem over jurisdiction is nothing new. In August, USCG and Nu Image voluntarily <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-expendables-makers-dismiss-massive-bittorrent-lawsuit-110825/">dismissed</a> their lawsuit targeting 23,322 U.S. Internet users who allegedly shared The Expendables.</p>
<p>The suit, at one time the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/23322-expendables-downloaders-accused-in-bittorrents-biggest-lawsuit-110510/">biggest ever</a> of its type, was crippled when District Court Judge Robert Wilkins decided that Nu Image could only go after those individuals who were reasonably likely to be living in the District of Columbia, the district where the suit was filed. In that case, 99% of the IP addresses filed were out of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>With Judge Wilkins ruling unfavorably, shortly after USCG also <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lawyers-retreat-drop-another-mass-bittorrent-lawsuit-110902/">dumped their lawsuit</a> filed on behalf of Cinetel Films, the makers of the horror flick “I Spit on Your Grave”, which listed 1,951 BitTorrent users as defendants. That too had been filed in Columbia.</p>
<p>USCG have now chosen the District of Maryland to file the papers for The Mechanic&#8217;s settlement shakedown. Time will tell what the presiding judge there will have to say on the issue of jurisdiction, but if he or she has had an eye on the cases in Columbia, our findings above &#8211; that 98% of IP addresses relate to the wrong district &#8211; should prove of great interest.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A 32-year-old man from Salisbury, England, pleaded guilty to several movie piracy related charges last Friday. The man, going by the nickname SilentNinja, admitted to camming several movies at a local cinema as well as distributing films that ended up on The Pirate Bay. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/uk-movie-cammer-silentninja-pleads-guilty-110926/">UK Movie Cammer &#8216;SilentNinja&#8217;  Pleads Guilty</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/cinema.jpg" align="right" alt="cinema" />In the morning of September 23 last year, a team of 8 police officers, assisted by a member of the Hollywood-backed Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), raided a house in Salisbury, England. </p>
<p>They arrested a then 31 year-old man, known online as SilentNinja, and seized all his computers, mobile phones, cameras, memory cards and hundreds of DVD backups. The raid was the result of  an investigation carried out in the months before. </p>
<p>The investigators found several of SilentNinja&#8217;s releases on The Pirate Bay, but it was CCTV footage of the local movie theater that eventually led to the arrest. Aside from improving releases from other groups, SilentNinja also camcorded several movies on his own, and copies of those eventually ended up online.</p>
<p>After his arrest SilentNinja was taken to a police station where he was interviewed and released some 12 hours later. In the months that followed the police searched the seized equipment for further evidence and the Salisbury man was eventually charged with several copyright-related offenses. </p>
<p>Last Friday, during a hearing at the Salisbury court, SilentNinja plead guilty to distributing and selling several copyrighted movies. </p>
<p>For three movies &#8211; Repo Man, I Love You Phillip Morris and Ninja Assassin &#8211; he made adjustments to existing pirated movies which were then uploaded to The Pirate Bay by others. Four other movies &#8211; Resident Evil 3D, Devil, Going The Distance and Piranha 3D &#8211; he cammed himself at a local cinema and sold the copies to interested parties. These cams didn&#8217;t appear online, as far as the defense was aware.</p>
<p>Talking to TorrentFreak, SilentNinja said that financial and mental health issues drove him to sell pirated movies for profit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only did the camming myself for financial gain, due to personal circumstances at the time. If the situation wasn&#8217;t as bad as it was, I would have  never sold content as we are here to share and not profit. This is the main regret of the whole thing because of my mental state, I went against what it&#8217;s all about and that&#8217;s what pisses me off,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The arrest and the investigation that followed led to some dark months for SilentNinja, full of mixed feelings. During talks with TorrentFreak it became apparent that he still feels a strong connection to his old habit, and we were told that he plans to release some guides on how people can put the video editing skills he learned to use for legal purposes.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks SilentNinja will meet with the probation service to discuss his personal health issues, and they will send a letter of notification to the courts along with sentencing proposals. SilentNinja is then expected to receive his sentencing in four weeks.</p>
<p>Although rare, this is not the first time that someone from the UK will be sentenced for camcording and subsequently distributing movies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year 25-year-old Christopher Clarke from Scotland was <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/first-ever-scottish-anti-camcorder-piracy-conviction-110701/">sentenced</a> to 160 hours of community service for camming and uploading several movies. And September 2010, then 22-year-old Englishman Emmanuel Nimley was <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/uk-movie-cammer-faces-jail-sentence-100814/">sentenced</a> to 6 months in jail for a similar offense.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/vuze-2010.png" align="right" alt="vuze" />Vuze is one of the most recognized BitTorrent brands. Their client is used by millions of people each day and has a steadily growing user-base.</p>
<p>In recent years Vuze’s BitTorrent client has evolved into an all-in-one download solution. With <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/vuze-reinvents-its-bittorrent-client-081013/">built in search</a>, DVD-burning capabilities and <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/vuze-integrates-with-itunes-xbox-360-and-ps3-090323/">device integration</a> the Vuze team has set itself aside from other popular BitTorrent clients.</p>
<p>Last year Vuze announced that device integration in particular is a highly appreciated and frequently used feature among users. <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/vuze-device-playback-serves-over-100-million-videos-100527/">Millions</a> of people have already hooked up their Xbox 360, PS3, iPhone and Android devices to Vuze, and the developers have been working hard to support as many devices as possible. </p>
<p>This week Vuze made a giant step forward by adding DLNA support, which makes the BitTorrent client compatible with thousands of new devices. <a href="http://www.dlna.org/home">DLNA</a> is a networking standard supported by all major consumer electronic brands. It can be found in <a href="http://www.dlna.org/products/">many</a> of the newer TVs, set-top boxes, tablets, NAS devices and more. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we’re continuing this crusade to unleash your content on your mobile and TV screens by adding all DLNA-supported devices, a few additional Android devices, and more,&#8221; the Vuze team announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this release, most DLNA-supported devices should now show up in your Vuze Sidebar &#8211; assuming they’re connected to the same home network as Vuze &#8211; making it possible to stream directly from Vuze to the DLNA device of your choice.  Once you spot your device name under Device Playback in the Sidebar, simply drag-and-drop.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/vuze-dlna.jpg" alt="vuze dlna" /></center></p>
<p>With this update Vuze users can now easily stream movies to their DLNA supported TVs. It also makes it very easy to copy downloaded files to external hardware such as NAS storage devices, tablets, game consoles and laptops. A drag-and-drop is sufficient to transfer or stream the files.</p>
<p>The timing of the new Vuze release appears not to be totally coincidental. Earlier this week Vuze&#8217;s main competitor uTorrent introduced device integration in an <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-adds-android-ios-ps3-and-xbox-integration-110922/">early alpha release</a>, supporting a handful devices. Vuze delivered their announcement sortly after, emphasizing that they&#8217;ve had this feature for more than two years already, and that Vuze is now compatible with tens of thousands of devices. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we launched these features years ago, unlike some other very tiny clients that are just getting around to it now ;),&#8221; the Vuze team teased.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we take a look at a tangled web of copyright trolls who have set their sights on thousands of BitTorrent users. More specifically, the law firm Steele Hansmeier, the BitTorrent tracking company led by Hansmeier's brother and the mysterious company MCGIP, which sued BitTorrent users for movies they didn't make. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/who-are-mcgip-and-why-are-they-suing-for-other-people%e2%80%99s-movies-110925/">Who are MCGIP (and Why are They Suing for Other People’s Movies?)</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81342178@N00/47749096/"><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/ids.jpg" align="right" alt="ids" /></a>Our story begins at the IDS tower in downtown Minneapolis, a city known for its wholesome values and that special kind of crazy known as “Minnesota Nice”.</p>
<p>Number 900 in this tower is an exceptionally busy place these days as the home office of <a href="http://mediacopyrightgroup.com/">Media Copyright Group, LLC</a> (MCG).  </p>
<p>MCG is the technology company behind <a href="http://wefightpiracy.com/">Steele Hansmeier, PLLC</a>, and the affidavit of this firm’s “technicians” have formed the basis of countless motions seeking the identity of IP address owners. It wasn’t the contents of the technician’s affidavit that interested me initially, however, it was his identity – Peter Hansmeier. Hansmeier?  Hmm.  That name rings a bell.</p>
<p>A look at the LLC filings available from the Minnesota Secretary of State reveals that Media Copyright Group is managed by Peter Hansmeier from #900 IDS tower. Notably, Paul Hansmeier (attorney for Steele Hansmeier) is the registered agent for the LLC. In a way, then, the sole evidence submitted in favor of many of Steele Hansmeier’s subpoenas is a statement by one brother that his other brother really should be able to get this information. And the fact that the websites of the two companies are hosted on the same server doesn&#8217;t add to the claimed objectivity either.</p>
<p>But wait, it only gets worse from here. Media Copyright Group proudly proclaims on their website:</p>
<p><em>“The cost of our services is paid out of the damages that are collected on your behalf.  In other words, you do not pay us any money up front, and we are paid only out of the damages that are collected…”</em></p>
<p>Peter Hansmeier appears then to be more than merely a witness, and more than just a witness and the brother of an involved attorney, but appears to be an interested party to the lawsuit himself. As the website makes clear, the witness against a John Doe defendant does not get paid unless damages are collected. If this alarms you then it’s time to buckle up, because we’re about to take a trip way down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hole is MCGIP, LLC, a company which hired Steele Hansmeier to file multiple lawsuits against hundreds of Doe defendants in the last year. As another peek at Minnesota’s Secretary of State website reveals, MCGIP’s registered office address is #900 in the IDS, the same bustling office as Hansmeiers’ Media Copyright Group. It also lists its c/o as Alpha Law Firm, yet another business registered to #900 in the IDS tower.  </p>
<p>Notably, Paul Hansmeier’s LinkedIn Profile lists him as “Partner” at Alpha Law Firm. This tangled web has several potential implications and leaves me wondering if MCGIP is Steele Hansmeier’s baby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righthaven">Righthaven</a>, with all of Righthaven’s fatal flaws.</p>
<h4>1.	“Exclusive Licenses” and Potentially Defective Standing</h4>
<p>As noted above, MCGIP <strong>does not own the copyrights</strong> to the allegedly infringed works, but instead acquires an “exclusive license” for the rights at issue.  MCGIP says in its complaints that the work is publicly available, but only to “bone fide purchasers.”   In a way MCGIP is right &#8211; the works are publicly available.  Unfortunately for MCGIP, the works aren’t being offered by MCGIP.  MCGIP does not have any web address where its purportedly licensed works are available, nor does it have any website at all.  </p>
<p>Take the heartwarming coming-of-age tale, “Blacks on Blondes – Mariah Madysinn,” for example.  This movie is the title at the center of MCGIP, LLC v. John Does 1 – 55 in the Northern District of California (3:11 &#8211; cv – 03312).  This film is registered to Directech, Inc. d/b/a Dog Fart Productions (keepin’ it classy), but copyright.gov makes no mention of MCGIP, LLC.  The video is presently available only from the original owner’s website.  </p>
<p>Another blush-worthy example is “Well Hung Amateurs 5,” the movie at issue in MCGIP v. John Does 1-18. This situation is even more interesting, and the “exlusive” license even more questionable. This film is registered to Xplor Media Group and again the registration info makes no mention of MCGIP. It appears that this movie was created in 2006, has been consistently distributed by multiple online outlets in the time since, and continues to be available through multiple (apparently) legitimate adult vendors including Spice and Homegrown Video.  </p>
<p>Copyright.gov notes that the registration date for this movie was in April 2011, and MCGIP’s lawsuit based on it’s “exclusive” license alleges infringements in Mid-March of 2011. All of this made the Righthaven alarm bells start ringing in my head, and they haven’t stopped since.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar, Righthaven appears to be doomed by its business model, which relied on purportedly exclusive licenses from the copyright owners that allowed Righthaven to do <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/09/righthaven-assets-targeted/">little more than sue</a>. Sound familiar?  </p>
<p>In Righthaven’s case, suit after suit was dismissed for lack of standing. You see, copyright law only allows the owner or exclusive licensee of a protected right to bring suit to enforce that right. Righthaven repeatedly failed to convince courts that they had the requisite exclusivity, and the cases were dismissed. Righthaven was sunk. This doesn’t seem like an ideal business model to copycat, but it appears that Steele Hansmeier might have done just that.</p>
<p>The case for MCGIP’s standing doesn’t seem any stronger than Righthaven’s and the status of these purportedly exclusive licenses needs to be scrutinized. It seems unlikely that the actual owners of these movies gave MCGIP the exclusive right to distribute the works, especially in light of the fact that the actual owners and/or numerous internet distributors continue to offer the works themselves. This makes the license seem, by definition, non-exclusive.  </p>
<p>Some of MCGIP’s filings seem to indicate that they are only the exclusive licensee of the right to distribute the movie on BitTorrent. This would be astounding, if true, and highlights the highly illusory nature of these licenses. A large section of Steele Hansmeier’s filings are devoted to explaining how a single user only exchanges bits of information through BitTorrent, and the entire structure of the network makes an exclusive BitTorrent license ridiculous and potentially impossible.  </p>
<p>It is <strong>a disguised license to sue, and little more</strong>. And if MCGIP’s licenses don’t support standing, all of the MCGIP cases should be dismissed and all of their collection efforts should cease.</p>
<h4>2.  Potential Failure to Disclose Interested Parties</h4>
<p>You might be asking yourself, “didn’t Righthaven get in trouble for its litigation practices?” Indeed they did.  Specifically (and most pertinent to this discussion), Righthaven was <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110715/02122715100/another-day-another-smackdown-righthaven-told-to-pay-up-misleading-court.shtml">fined $5,000</a> for failing to disclose that the actual owner of the copyrighted work was entitled to 50% of settlement proceeds from its suits. </p>
<p>I have not seen the purported assignments from the owners to MCGIP, but I find it hard to believe that they would give their reproduction rights to a company that does not appear to be in the movie business (but is certainly in the lawsuit business), and failed to retain at least some interest in the outcome of the litigation. What incentive would they have to participate? The Northern District of California Local Rule 3-16 (b)(1) explicitly requires disclosure of:</p>
<p><em>“Any persons, associations of persons, firms, partnerships, corporations (including parent corporations), or other entities other than the parties themselves known by the party to have either: (i) a financial interest (of any kind) in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding; or (ii) any other kind of interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.”</em></p>
<p>Beyond the interest of the actual copyright owner, Media Copyright Group is fairly explicit in its own claims to an interest in the lawsuit. If they collect their fees only out of damages (as the website claims), aren’t they BY DEFINITION a firm with a financial interest in the litigation?  Peter Hansmeier’s sworn declarations (which are publicly available from a number of sources online) and the MCG website lead me to believe that they are heavily involved in the Steele Hansmeier suits, yet to my knowledge this interest has never been disclosed in any of Steele Hansmeier’s filings.</p>
<h4>The Takeaway</h4>
<p>MCGIP has received little to no discussion in the ongoing debate about mass copyright practices. This needs to change. Their entire business model seems to be built on shifting sands, and I’m not sure if ANYONE has brought this to a court’s attention. Steele Hansmeier has declined to comment on this article.</p>
<p>If you are a defendant, make sure that your attorney is following up on all of the potential angles for your defense. If you don’t have an attorney and you or your case is in California, call me, or visit my <a href="http://www.ranallolawoffice.com/practice-areas/california-and-new-york-p2p-copyright-defense">website</a>. If you are a defense attorney or anyone else with something to add to this discussion, I’d love to hear from you too.  </p>
<p>In the words of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, sunlight is the best disinfectant, and I’m happy to add a bit of light to this debate. This article now qualifies as attorney advertising.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Little over a year after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement started "Operation In Our Sites," the authorities have announced their first conviction. Yesterday, the first site owner targeted by the operation pleaded guilty. The 23-year old Matthew Smith, admitted to conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement charges for his role in the video streaming and download site NinjaVideo.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ninjavideo-founder-faces-jail-time-following-guilty-plea-110924/">NinjaVideo Founder Faces Jail Time Following Guilty Plea</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/icesmall.jpg" align="right" alt="ninjavideo" />At the end of June last year, nine sites connected to movie streaming were targeted by the U.S. government, including NinjaVideo.net, one of the Internet&#8217;s most prominent video streaming sites.</p>
<p>It was the first round in the ongoing “<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/operation-in-our-sites-will-continue-seizing-domains-110407/">Operation in Our Sites</a>” through which more than 100 domain names have been seized to date. </p>
<p>In NinjaVideo&#8217;s case, the authorities not only seized the site&#8217;s domain names, but also launched a full-fledged criminal investigation into the people involved.</p>
<p>As a result, five people connected to the movie streaming site <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ninjavideo-admins-and-uploaders-indicted-by-grand-jury-110910/">were indicted</a> by a federal grand jury two weeks ago. All are suspected of conspiracy and several copyright-related offenses. One of the five,  23-year old Matthew Smith, <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/USDHSICE-13cb8d">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement yesterday.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66205505/Plea">guilty plea</a> results in an automatic conviction and the court documents further reveal that Smith has waived his right to appeal. </p>
<p>The NinjaVideo founder plead guilty to two of the six counts, including conspiring with the other defendants to willfully infringe the rights of third parties for profit. Smith admitted that the site generated more than $500,000 from advertising and donations during the two-year period the site was active.</p>
<p>Four of the five criminal copyright charges were dismissed by the court; these all referred to specific movie titles (2012, Iron Man 2, Avatar and The A-Team). Smith did, however, plead guilty to the more general copyright infringement charges below, as stated in the original indictment.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Smith] Did willfully, and for purposes of private financial gain, infringe the copyrights of copyrighted works, that is, motion pictures, television programs, and software, by the reproduction and distribution over the Internet, during a 180-day period, of ten or more copies of one or more copyrighted works which had a total retail value of more than $2,500.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maximum penalty for both counts Smith plead guilty to is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He will be sentenced in December, and considering his cooperative stance it seems unlikely that he will receive maximum punishment.</p>
<p>The four other NinjaVideo defendants, including co-founder Hana Beshara, are scheduled for a jury trial February next year.</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-10-settlement-offers-the-entertainment-industrys-new-copyright-tactic/P1/">PaidContent</a> published a report on Digital Rights Corp, an LA-based firm who monitor file-sharing networks for infringements and contact alleged pirates asking for money. It&#8217;s 2011, what&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>However, rather than asking for around $3,000 like many in this field, Digital Rights Corp are strictly at the budget end of the market. When they contact you there&#8217;s no need to panic since they request a measly $10.00 to settle their complaint. It&#8217;s a system that&#8217;s been <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/automated-legal-threats-turn-piracy-into-profit-090628/">used before</a> by <a href="http://payartists.com/">PayArtists.com</a>.</p>
<p>To the die-hard file-sharer, the fact Digital Rights Corp (DRC) have asked for just $10.00 will probably carry some comedy value. By only asking for such a small amount the company sends the message that they aren&#8217;t serious about pursuing infringers.</p>
<p>And the reality is, they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>First off, DRC have no idea who the recipients of their claims are and have absolutely no intention of finding out. Instead of going through the lengthy and expensive process of going to a court to force ISPs to hand over the names and addresses of their customers, DRC short-cut the system. </p>
<p>DRC contacts ISPs with a DMCA takedown notice (which they are obliged to pass on to subscribers) which contains a link to their website. Follow that and the target gets an offer to settle for $10.00, payable by credit card. It is only after people have responded to their email that DRC even know who they are.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/digitalrights.jpg" alt="DigitalRights" /></center></p>
<p>But if we look at the current landscape, scarred by the punitive actions of the U.S. Copyright Group and the dozens of porn companies and their aggressive lawsuits demanding several thousands dollars in settlements, perhaps this $10.00 deal doesn&#8217;t look so bad, at least in comparison. It&#8217;s a couple of beers, a couple of sandwiches. What it clearly is not is a life ruiner.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, DRC have to go and spoil it.</p>
<p>The rhetoric in their emails and on their website consists of the same old anti-piracy scare tactics. Even though the company have absolutely no intention of suing, they give the impression they will, stating that: &#8220;The user who receives the notice, is liable for $150000 in damages, but if they click on the link supplied, they can enter a credit card and we will settle the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, bearing in mind that there is already a deal with the major US ISPs and the big music and movie studios to begin sending warnings which may, possibly, after more than half a dozen strikes, lead to the suspension of an Internet account, DRC lay it on thick in this department too.</p>
<p>Their initial email warnings state that the recipient risks having their internet cut off but their FAQ section on their website takes it a whole lot further.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Internet service has been shut off, how do I get it restored?&#8221; says the page&#8217;s <a href="http://digitalrightscorp.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=73&#038;Itemid=465">first question</a>. The supplied answer is simply ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you pay your settlement fee on this website or over the phone, we will notify the ISP that you have settled the matter with the copyright owner and they will restore your service,&#8221; is the response.</p>
<p>The notion that an ISP will cut off a subscriber based on the allegations of company like this following a simple, unsubstantiated DMCA notice, is unlikely to say the least. To suggest that the ISP would then switch that service back on after being notified that a $10.00 fine had been paid takes the statement to the absurd.</p>
<p>Another attempt at misdirection comes with the final statement on the page which declares: &#8220;Your ISP has verified that at the time your computer was used for copyright infringement, it was using the IP Address stated in the notice.&#8221; The implication here is that the ISP has verified that the email recipient has been infringing. They haven&#8217;t, they have simply forwarded an email.</p>
<p>The other problem is that these settlement companies, whether they ask for $10.00 or $3,000, is that they always try to give the impression their work is about reducing piracy. According to figures quoted by PaidContent, &#8220;&#8230;unauthorized sharing of one client’s song decreased from 20,000 to 4,000 in the month after its settlement offers were issued.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is that achieved with a system like this? Until now there has been almost zero publicity for this company or its business model. So, how does sending emails quietly to individuals that have already supposedly shared or downloaded the material in question reduce the uptake of new people doing the same? In fact, the entire model relies on new people coming aboard or the revenue simply dries up.</p>
<p>So if there is no reason to pay these people, why are people doing so?</p>
<p>Well, as shown by the type of artist in the DRC client list, it could very well be that the older, more-easily scared generation is being targeted here, rather than the young and tech-savvy. The good news is, however, that most of the artists being &#8216;protected&#8217; by DRC won&#8217;t have been hurt by any infringements.</p>
<p>Because they&#8217;re dead.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The ever-rising costs of textbooks is an unavoidable nightmare for many students and hot-topic to those who see the system as corrupt. Now, a site with a mission to dismantle what they say amounts to a publishing monopoly has come up with another solution to bring cheap and free textbooks to students. The publishers are going to hate it but the site doesn't care. They insist that it's students that are being abused by publishers, not the other way round.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-service-makes-textbook-rentals-last-forever-110923/">Pirate Service Makes Textbook Rentals Last Forever</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During August, just before the start of the new school term, we reported on <a href="http://librarypirate.me">LibraryPirate</a>, a site with a mission of providing college students with an alternative to continuously rising textbook prices. Bemoaning what he sees as <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/free-textbooks-for-students-will-break-greedy-monopoly-110816/">greedy profiteering</a>, LibraryPirate&#8217;s admin says the year-old site&#8217;s aim is clear.</p>
<p>“Our mission is simple and specific,” he told TorrentFreak. “To revolutionize the digital e-textbook industry and change it permanently.”</p>
<p>Now the site is stepping up its assault against &#8220;textbook monopolists&#8221; by offering a brand new service to not only reduce the costs of digital textbook rentals, but to turn that temporary access to an educational necessity into permanent ownership.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/librarypirate.jpg" alt="Library Pirate" /></center></p>
<p>The initiative the site is running is called &#8220;Hire-a-Pirate&#8221; and the publishers aren&#8217;t going to like it one bit. Many students, on the other hand, won&#8217;t share their view. This is how it works.</p>
<p>First, the student lets LibraryPirate know the title of the book they&#8217;re looking for. Then, site staff locate the product on eTextbook rental services and advise the student of the current rental price. An example shown to us was a book costing $200, but with a time-limited digital rental copy also available at $118.50.</p>
<p>Participating students are then asked to purchase a gift certificate from the official seller for the full amount ($118.50 in our example) and send the gift code to LibraryPirate. Site staff then rent the book on the student&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a little bit of this and a little of that, we strip the DRM from the PDF and contact the user letting them know the book is ready via torrent,&#8221; says LP&#8217;s admin. &#8220;The student can now carry the textbook with them anywhere for as long as they want, allowing the PDF to be easily read on any device.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is that not only does a rental copy get turned into the unrestricted real thing, but students can choose to split the cost of obtaining a book between friends &#8211; 10 friends contributing means just $11.85 each. For future students, however, the cost of obtaining the same book reduces to zero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every textbook purchased through the Hire-a-Pirate program will be added to the LibraryPirate torrent database. If you do not have time to scan books, this is an excellent way to help the cause and save money at the same time,&#8221; adds LP.</p>
<p>However, for those who have hard copies already, the time to take a few photographs and a desire to share, LibraryPirate have just released a new tool to make eBook creation a lot more simple.</p>
<p>LPBR is a piece of software created by LP member RiddleRiot which turns any digital camera into &#8220;a lean mean textbook scanning machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>After placing the book on a black background and photographing its pages, a couple of clicks later and an eBook comes out the other end. </p>
<p>&#8220;LPBR will crop, sharpen and re-size the entire folder of camera scan images into one easily readable PDF book,&#8221; says TP&#8217;s admin. &#8220;It&#8217;s so easy to scan a textbook now, even a college student can do it. During our testing, we were able to scan and convert one 500 page book in under 2 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, with both the Rent-a-Pirate service and the LPBR software, what we&#8217;re looking at here is copyright infringement, but LP&#8217;s admin insists that since students are being abused by a broken education system that leaves them no other option than to spend ridiculous sums of money on textbooks, there is only &#8220;one path to moral high ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;private theft of education” must be combated, he concludes, and that can only come about by striking the monopolies where it counts &#8211; in their pocketbooks.</p>
<p>So, is ripping DRM from textbooks and sharing them for the purposes of gaining an education more morally acceptable than doing the same with movies, music and games? Or is it just an elaborate excuse to frame copyright infringement in a righteous manner?</p>
<p>What comes first, the rights of the publishers or the need for a fairer system towards educational enlightenment?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting point for debate, and one we encourage in the comment section below.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[EZTV is arguably one of the largest BitTorrent communities, so any downtime immediately leads to all kinds of horror stories about raids and seizures. This is especially true when the downtime coincides with the start of the new TV-season. However, the site's users can rest assured as the site will make a comeback soon after its hardware issues are out of the way.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/eztv-goes-down-in-preparation-for-big-return-110923/">EZTV Goes Down In Preparation For Big Return</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/eztv-logo1.jpg" align="right" alt="eztv" />Two days ago the website of the popular TV-torrent distribution group EZTV went down without explanation. Although this by itself isn&#8217;t that unique, the timing is unfortunate to say the least as the new TV-season is just starting up. </p>
<p>The beginning of the new TV-season is generally speaking the busiest time for EZTV, as over a million people flock to the site every day to catch up with their favorite shows. So when they found that their preferred TV-torrent index wasn&#8217;t loading, some people started to worry. </p>
<p>Luckily for them, there is not much to be concerned about. </p>
<p>EZTV’s NovaKing informed TorrentFreak that the downtime is due to hardware issues. They are currently working on replacing old servers with new ones, and when this is done the site will come back. This could take a few more hours up to a few days, depending on how much time the volunteers can free up. </p>
<p>&#8220;We recently got new servers to help with the increase in visitors we are getting to the site. With the new setup EZTV and sister sites like ezRSS will be more stable,&#8221; NovaKing said.  </p>
<p>In recent months EZTV has seen quite an increase in usage, and since the old servers couldn&#8217;t keep up this often resulted in downtime. And aside from better up-time, there&#8217;s more for EZTV&#8217;s users to look forward to. </p>
<p>&#8220;The new version of the site is almost complete as well which we hope most people will like and find more useful,&#8221; NovaKing told us.</p>
<p>One of the new features currently in development is the integration of ezRSS (which is also down) with EZTV’s “my shows” feature. This means that users can setup an RSS feed for their favorite shows on the EZTV website, and use this feed to automatically download new shows.</p>
<p>The upcoming iteration of the site will also have a revamped forum, improved usability, more detailed show information and an updated TV news system. When these new features will be rolled out is unknown at this point. </p>
<p>Unlike other torrent sites, EZTV is completely advertising free and run entirely by volunteers. All the people working on the site also have real jobs to attend so site maintenance and upgrades sometimes take longer than with other sites. Still, that doesn&#8217;t mean that EZTV isn&#8217;t publishing content elsewhere.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/utorrent_logo.png"align="right"  alt="utorrent" />With more than <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-breaks-100-million-monthly-users-110817/">100 million</a> active users a month and a market share of nearly <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-keeps-bittorrent-lead-bitcomet-fades-away-110916/">50 percent</a>, uTorrent is without doubt the most-used BitTorrent client. </p>
<p>Despite the success story that it is, the uTorrent development team hasn&#8217;t been sitting still in recent years. The user interface is continuously being updated and new features are launched on a frequent basis, such as the BitTorrent App studio.</p>
<p>Today we can add another feature to the list, as BitTorrent quietly rolled out support for external devices in the <a href="http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=105596">latest</a> uTorrent alpha release. Aside from the usual bug fixes, the new release allows users to drag and drop downloaded files to Apple and Android devices, as well as the PS3 and Xbox 360 game consoles. </p>
<p>In addition, the latest alpha also shows the option to convert files into the appropriate formats supported by the various devices. However, TorrentFreak has learned that this tease was put in by mistake and that it will be removed in the next update.</p>
<p>While the device integration will become part of the stable uTorrent release in a few months, conversion will only be available for people who upgrade to the premium uTorrent version, the upcoming <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-to-launch-paid-bittorrent-client-110715/">uTorrent Plus</a>. </p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>uTorrent adds support for devices</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/utorrent-plus-minus.jpg" alt="devices" /></center></p>
<p>As is the case with all change, not all users are happy with the multitude of developments uTorrent has gone through in recent months. Some complain about bugs, others don&#8217;t like the new interface, and there are users who are not charmed by all the new additional features.</p>
<p>The uTorrent developers, however, believe that they are on the right track to making their software appeal to a wider audience. TorrentFreak was informed by BitTorrent Inc. that a lot of users specifically demanded device integration, as well as other changes that were implemented recently. </p>
<p>That there indeed is a demand from BitTorrent users for integration with mobiles and game consoles has been shown by uTorrent&#8217;s main competitor, Vuze. A year after Vuze added device integration millions of users had turned on this feature, and together they converted more than <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/vuze-device-playback-serves-over-100-million-videos-100527/">100 million</a> videos. Whether people are as excited when they have to pay for the conversion remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The latest 3.1 alpha is available <a href="http://download.utorrent.com/beta/utorrent-3.1-latest.exe">for download</a> now, for those who are interested in giving it a spin.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Swedish Film Institute (SFI) is in the middle of a crisis after an anti-piracy company revealed that it had tracked several leaked movies on The Pirate Bay back to its servers. Desperate to deflect the accusations, today the SFI made a long statement. It turned out to be a perfect illustration that allegations of piracy based on an IP address and nothing else, simply must be backed up by something more solid.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/movie-institute-feels-pain-of-ip-address-only-piracy-evidence-110922/">Movie Institute Feels Pain Of IP Address-Only Piracy &#8216;Evidence&#8217;</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/tpb.jpg" class="alignright" width="175" height="188" />Early September it came to light that the Swedish Film Institute (SFI) was being sucked into <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-movie-leaks-traced-back-to-swedish-film-institute-110907/">a scandal</a>. </p>
<p>While monitoring movies leaked to The Pirate Bay, anti-piracy company DoubleTrace said it had discovered that IP addresses in the BitTorrent swarms belonged to none other than the SFI. The drama only escalated when Sweden&#8217;s Ministry of Culture and angry movie-industry figures became involved.</p>
<p>After first playing down the news, SFI managing director Bengt Toll later made an announcement which indicated that following an internal audit of firewalls and other logs, no wrong-doing could be found.</p>
<p>Considering the embarrassment of becoming the focus of movie piracy allegations and the importance of dealing with them effectively, some might look at SFI&#8217;s initial denial and say, &#8220;Well they would say that, wouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s slow down and take a look at information made available today by the Institute.</p>
<p>Although SFI acknowledge that the IP address (or addresses) logged by DoubleTrace does indeed belong to them, they reveal that it&#8217;s hardly trivial to discover the real-life person behind it. Not only do all of SFI&#8217;s staff share that IP, but several tenants (such as film and TV producers) do too. And visitors to their library, and visitors to some of their cinemas, and diners in the restaurant, not to mention those using the open WiFi in the cafe and foyer areas.</p>
<p>As indicated by the way they have been proactive in this case by calling in the police, the SFI really seem to want to get to the bottom of the allegations. They say they have firewall logs that could show when and from where in their infrastructure the movies were being shared.</p>
<p>But &#8211; and little surprise here &#8211; DoubleTrace, the anti-piracy company behind the allegations, aren&#8217;t being forthcoming with their evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The week before the incident became public we carried out  intensive work in which we asked the information technology company DoubleTrace AB and production company Strix to show us the data that they claim to have, to get a chance to see if the sharing actually took place here, and if so, from where,&#8221; the SFI explains. &#8220;Since we are being denied the material it means that we can not verify whether the information is correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an effort to show how it has attempted to find the source of the problem, SFI goes on to list a whole range of activities carried out to locate any infringement including searching all PCs, servers, networks and logs, calling in auditors, advising the Ministry of Culture and engaging the wider film industry.</p>
<p>As previously detailed, the police were also called in to investigate and are apparently concentrating on the illegal distribution of four films. Their focus is said to be on the illegal activities, not the SFI themselves, yet because the SFI&#8217;s IP address was allegedly used to carry out the uploads, they are getting all the bad press.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s certainly <em>possible</em> that the SFI person who handles the Internet account could be responsible for the uploads, but equally a passing Pirate Bay fan with access to the free cafe WiFI could have carried out the offenses too. Maybe it was more than one person, maybe DoubleTrace&#8217;s systems screwed up &#8211; who knows?</p>
<p>The important thing here is that when it comes to the allegations against SFI, and the refusal of the anti-piracy company to make their &#8216;evidence&#8217; available, SFI should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>But, unlike the hundreds of thousands of other <em>ISP account holders</em> around the world who receive letters claiming that <strong>they</strong> illegally uploaded a movie or song and therefore should pay compensation or, increasingly, be disconnected from the Internet, they are treated more respectfully, quite simply because of who they are.</p>
<p>An IP address is <em>not</em> a person, and unless anti-piracy companies want to let their &#8216;evidence&#8217; be seen and tested in public, perhaps it&#8217;s better if they keep their allegations to themselves.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In recent years Italy has taken several far-reaching measures to thwart online piracy, including a nationwide block of The Pirate Bay and BTjunkie. Building forth on this tough stance, lawmakers are now proposing several new measures that will put Internet users at risk of losing their connection after one alleged infringement. Even worse, these copyright complaints can be sent by anyone, not just the copyright holder in question. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/italy-proposes-draconian-one-strike-anti-piracy-law-110921/">Italy Proposes Draconian One-Strike Anti-Piracy Law</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduitor/2511935701/"><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/flag-italy.jpg" alt="" title="flag-italy" width="200" height="188" class="alignright size-full wp-image-40399" /></a>In recent years the entertainment industry has been lobbying extensively for tougher anti-piracy legislation. So-called three-strikes policies, where repeat copyright infringers are disconnected from the Internet, are particularly high on their agenda.</p>
<p><a href="http://torrentfreak.com/france-tracks-down-18-million-file-sharers-110714/">France</a> and <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/new-zealand%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9C3-strikes%E2%80%9D-anti-piracy-law-starts-110901/">New Zealand</a> have already signed this three-strikes approach into law, and a <a href="http://punto-informatico.it/3275364/PI/News/italia-isp-diventeranno-sceriffi-legge.aspx">recent proposal</a> from the Italian government shows that they are considering doing the same. However, unlike we&#8217;ve seen thus far, the Italian plan is not exactly the <em>graduated</em> response that other countries have adopted. </p>
<p>One accusation is all it takes to lose your Internet connection.</p>
<p>The lawmakers suggest two articles that will amend current copyright legislation. Although some of the text is open to interpretation, it is clear that the draft <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/d62gmb">suggests</a> far-reaching anti-piracy measures.</p>
<p>One of the most worrying changes for the public is that Internet providers have to disconnect subscribers upon receiving a single infringement notice. The legitimacy of the notification is not verified and the appeal options appear to be limited. In addition, the proposal also allows &#8220;interested patries&#8221; who are not the copyright holder to file complaints. To prevent pirates from sneaking back online, ISPs are further required to keep a blacklist of all copyright offenders. </p>
<p>The one-strike disconnection proposal and the backlist are obviously worrying for Italian consumers, but the draft legislation also targets online service providers. For instance, the proposal specifically requires ISPs to censor content deemed to be copyright infringing. If they fail to do so, they face both civil and criminal liability. </p>
<p>In addition, all companies that provide services or sell goods online would have to actively prevent direct or indirect copyright infringement. This could spell trouble for Google, which refers users to a lot of copyrighted material through its search engine and hosts this content on YouTube. Also, it would require companies like eBay to check if users own the copyrights to the goods they sell online.</p>
<p>Needless to say, news of the proposed law has many Italians worried and has also reached Member of European Parliament Marietje Schaake <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110920/11360716031/eu-parliament-member-asks-eu-commission-what-it-will-do-if-italy-approves-one-strike-copyright-law.shtml">who asked</a> the EU Commission if Italy is allowed to go this far. </p>
<p>&#8220;Via the press it has come to my attention that the Italian Parliament is currently considering a draft law by which internet users can be disconnected and blacklisted if they have been accused on an intellectual property infringement. The accusation does not necessarily need to originate from the rights holder of the work in question,&#8221; she writes. </p>
<p>Schaake then explains that since the Italian proposal violates several EU laws and principles, she wants to hear the European Commission&#8217;s opinion on the issue. Schaake further asked the European Commission whether it&#8217;s possible to prevent member states from disconnecting citizens from the Internet.</p>
<p>Earlier this year a report from the UN’s Human Rights Council labeled Internet access a <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/un-disconnecting-file-sharers-breaches-human-rights-110603/">human right</a>, arguing that laws which allow for the disconnection of Internet users are disproportionate and should be repealed. Nevertheless, it appears that the Italian lawmakers are determined to push their plan forward. </p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/newzbin.jpg" class="alignright" width="170" height="170" />Last week, in response to a High Court judge&#8217;s decision to order UK ISP BT to block Usenet indexer Newzbin2, the operators of the site delivered on their promise to neutralize the looming threat.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, TeamRDogs – the group behind the site – released Newzbin Client 1.0.0.127, their first software release designed to circumvent BT’s Cleanfeed online censorship system. Our tests revealed that encryption is one of the main tools being used to circumvent the system.</p>
<p>Following the release, TorrentFreak caught up with Mr White from TeamRDogs, a character far more colorful than his monochromatic name might suggest. He told us that being forced to create this software was not only a waste of their time, but a sad testament to the state of the open Internet dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having to write a client program like this is an admission that the open web is in the process of failing. The ability of vested interests to choke the Internet with a vinculum woven from malevolent law and technology is very depressing,&#8221; Mr White told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;TeamRDogs would rather spend its time in titty bars drinking whisky and snorting lines than hacking the MAFIAA&#8217;s Client of Doom (hmmm, CoD &#8211; we may call it that), but they&#8217;ve made it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Newzbin2 anti-blocking software, which was updated with a new release just before the weekend followed by a brand new OSX version this week, is said to include &#8216;Agility Technology&#8217;. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;This is simply a mechanism that will allow the application and its configuration to be modified to adapt to the new web censorship techniques that we can envisage arising,&#8221; Mr White explains. &#8220;The App can also &#8216;Phone Home&#8217; for a friendly message if Newzbin2&#8242;s Intarwebs is cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Newzbin2 could indeed become the first victim of the pro-copyright web-blocking movement in the West, if the lobbyists get their way it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. But by picking on a site like Newzbin2, which has already shown it is prepared to fight technology with technology (a route to failure in itself), the prospect of successful future web blocks has already been reduced.</p>
<p>Mr White told TorrentFreak that rather than keep their toys to themselves, in the spirit of sharing Newzbin2 could adjust their code to assist other victims of web-blocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could adapt it to help out other websites so if, for example, the MAFIAA start to go after NZBMatrix [another Usenet indexing site] or torrent sites we&#8217;d be happy to help them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not all plain sailing. We&#8217;ve already had pessimists point out that since TeamRDogs obtained the original Newzbin database by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/newzbin-resurrection-interview-with-the-mysterious-mr-white-100529/">unconventional means</a>, their software should be viewed with caution. But that notion is dismissed by Mr White.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people will worry that [the client] will have adware/malware etc: given the heuristic examination that it will inevitably be subject to that would be dumb on a Sony scale,&#8221; says Mr White referencing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal">Sony CD rootkit</a> fiasco. &#8220;It&#8217;s clean, we swear this on Ron Jeremy&#8217;s manhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr White says that in addition to the new client, TeamRDogs also recommends tools offered by 3rd parties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the App we reckon that <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/firefox-add-on-undoes-u-s-government-domain-seizures-110414/">MAFIAAFire</a> will also be a good bet for most for now but we believe in having options,&#8221; he concludes. &#8220;And doubles all round.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The anti-piracy lobby group AFACT just championed a study which claims that nearly all of the popular files on BitTorrent point to infringing material. Although the study in question is probably not far off, the press-release of the anti-piracy group has been met with more doubt than ever before. Slowly journalists are starting to reflect on the ongoing propaganda stream from anti-piracy outfits, and some are even brave enough to call them out on it.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/press-starts-to-doubt-anti-piracy-propaganda-machine-110920/">Press Starts to Doubt Anti-Piracy Propaganda Machine</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/the-media.jpg" align="right" alt="bittorrent" />Last week the MPAA-supported lobby group AFACT released a study claiming that 72 percent of people would stop downloading infringing content if their Internet provider warned them. </p>
<p>The results claimed to support the effectiveness of a 3-strikes system for copyright infringers, but those who took a closer look saw that this was not the case.</p>
<p>As we <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lobby-misleads-aussie-press-for-three-strikes-campaign-110912/">pointed out</a>, the results could also show that none of the current file-sharers would be deterred, as the question was also answered by the 78 percent of people who don&#8217;t even use file-sharing software.</p>
<p>The press release was nothing more that a cheap and misleading marketing stunt and it&#8217;s tricks like this that are causing the anti-piracy lobby to lose credibility at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago AFACT came out with another press release. This time they plug the results of a study they appear to be unrelated to, conducted by  the University of Ballarat’s Internet Commerce Security Laboratory (ICSL). These are the same researchers who released some rather <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/incompetent-bittorrent-researchers-strike-again-101211/">incompetent reports</a> in the past, but their latest study shows signs of improvement.</p>
<p>As AFACT is happy to point out, the researchers <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/65607116/Report-August-2011-Final">conclude</a> that 97.2 percent of the <em>most popular</em> files on BitTorrent are infringing (and that a lot are faked). Although this conclusion is probably not too far off, not all journalists are eager to pick it up as some are starting to see that AFACT has a habit of twisting the truth. </p>
<p>In a piece titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/65606740/A-Fact-Oped">Fooling some of the media, some of the time</a>,&#8221; <a href="http://www.canberratimes.com.au/">Canberra Times</a> journalist Myles Peterson explains his concerns.</p>
<p>When Peterson received the three-strikes study press release last week he couldn&#8217;t help but notice that News Corp newspapers received the details before &#8216;regular&#8217; journalists did. Yes indeed, that is the same News Corp organization that is a partner of anti-piracy groups such as IPAF, DEAA and AFACT.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last Monday, The Australian ran a full-court press in print and online dubbed &#8216;Piracy, the disease that’s crippling our creative industries&#8217;, comprising a number of articles from various angles, all attacking the scourge of online file sharing. Articles also appeared in News Corp tabloids The Adelaide Advertiser and The Daily Telegraph,&#8221; Peterson writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s odd, I thought. The avalanche of coverage seemed to disproportionately reference the new study. Would a media outlet co-operate with a lobby group to generate mass coverage of a topic, I wondered.&#8221;</p>
<p>While following up on the study, Petersen noticed that various Australian anti-piracy outfits are conveniently sharing personnel. This, added with the recent Wikileaks revelation that the MPAA is the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/wikileaks-mpaa-secret-pusher-of-trial-against-aussie-isp-110830/">driving force</a> behind these groups, lead to further doubts. They were only heightened when the obvious flaws in the &#8216;independent&#8217; study were pointed out by us. </p>
<p>Using journalists in a propaganda war orchestrated by foreign companies wasn&#8217;t a very pleasant thought to Petersen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The story behind the stories, both those that appeared in News Corp media and TorrentFreak’s balancing rebuttal, stayed with me, as did a series of worrying questions. Are AFACT, the DEAA and IPAF being co-ordinated by the same group of people? Are these people being directed by the Motion Picture Association of America, as the WikiLeaks cable suggested? &#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What stuck with me most was a similar concern to one uttered recently by Australian Greens leader Senator Bob Brown. Did a group of journalists put together a press campaign based on a biased study supplied by a lobby group that represents their own employer?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not bad enough, in a few days the anti-piracy outfits have a meeting at the Federal General Attorney&#8217;s office to push their agenda at the highest level. The fear is that this talk will be far from balanced, and we can only hope that the hosts will be able to see through it. </p>
<p>&#8220;When our federal lawyers host these lobby groups at the end of the week, I hope they cast a more critical eye over any research presented than certain media outlets did. I also hope they are able to work out which person in the room represents the ACIG, AFACT, DEAA, IPAF, MPA, MPAA or all of the above,&#8221; Petersen concludes.</p>
<p>The good news is that the piece in the Canberra Times shows that not all journalists are indirectly working for the MPAA. Increasingly, we see skepticism towards the continuous stream of anti-piracy propaganda and more room for a sensible discussion about the topics at stake. Perhaps the tide is turning?</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to New Zealand Police, a teenager will appear in court tomorrow after posting a video to the Internet earlier this month.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old, who is reportedly an opponent of New Zealand&#8217;s just-introduced &#8220;3 Strikes&#8221; Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act 2011, allegedly took his anti-legislation demonstration too far, by announcing that websites were going to be hacked and that government buildings had been rigged with explosives.</p>
<p>The man from South Auckland was subsequently tracked down by local police with the assistance of  the National Cyber Crime Centre and the Electronic Crime Laboratory.</p>
<p>He was charged with making Threats of Harm to People or Property under the Crimes Act 1961, an offense carrying a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such threats are taken very seriously by Police and this investigation demonstrates Police has the expertise and resources to trace those who make such threats on the internet,&#8221; said Acting Detective Inspector Pete Jones.</p>
<p>Under the new anti-filesharing legislation, those who are discovered uploading copyright material are first sent two warnings via their ISP. On receipt of a third, copyright holders can take Internet account holders to the Copyright Tribunal where they will face fines of up to $15,000 and disconnection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the evidence gathered by rights holders is only accurate enough to identify an ISP account from where an infringement took place, and is unable to identify actual infringers. The New Zealand government dealt with this eventuality by making account holders responsible for infringements even if they didn’t carry them out.</p>
<p>This has annoyed a wide cross-section of New Zealand society and generated a number of both peaceful and law-abiding protests. Inevitably though, in highly-charged situations and with a backdrop of the &#8216;Anonymous&#8217;-style direct action cyber-protests of recent months, some people will overstep the mark.</p>
<p>The facts of the case will be heard tomorrow when the 18-year-old appears in court, but considering the charges it seems clear the authorities believe that he had no intention of carrying out any threats.</p>
<p>On this basis it will be interesting to see how the man is dealt with. A man who made a <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&#038;objectid=10747005">6 minute-long call</a> to police in August claiming that an airplane passenger was carrying a bomb was said to be only facing a bill for the call and a charge of wasting police time.</p>
<p>An interesting footnote is that since the anti-filesharing legislation was introduced earlier this month, not a single warning has been sent out to Internet subscribers, reportedly because rightsholders <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&#038;objectid=10752653">haven&#8217;t paid up</a> the required $25 per notice admin fee.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Pirate Bay founder Gottfrid Svartholm deepened today. After failing to turn up for 2010's hearing to appeal his 2009 conviction for criminal copyright infringement, the court decided he would be dealt with at a later date. Today, however, Svartholm failed to appear at the Court of Appeal.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-fails-to-appear-at-court-of-appeal-hearing-110919/">Pirate Bay Founder Fails To Appear At Court of Appeal Hearing</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/tpb.jpg" class="alignright" width="175" height="188" />At the end of September 2010 the appeal of  The Pirate Bay Four began, but one of the most important cases of its type began with just three defendants present.</p>
<p>Due to him being hospitalized in Cambodia, Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm was unable to travel to Sweden.</p>
<p>Such was her concern, Gottfrid’s mother said she would travel to Asia to support him. The Court decided that the hearing would continue without him.</p>
<p>In late November the Appeal Court found founders Fredrik Neij and Peter Sunde, and businessman Carl Lundström <a href=" http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-appeal-verdict-101126/">guilty</a>, although it did decrease the lengths of their prison sentences. The damages they have to pay to the entertainment companies were increased.</p>
<p>Although the trio announced they would appeal to the Supreme Court, one of their team had been left behind. Gottfrid Svartholm&#8217;s appeal would have to be dealt with separately at a later date, throwing their processes out of sync.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/anakata.jpg" class="alignright" width="100" height="120" />However, setting a date for the hearing was proving difficult since Svartholm&#8217;s location could not be determined, not even by his lawyer Ola Salmonsson.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a hearing was eventually scheduled for today at the Svea Court of Appeal. In common with the previous hearing, Svartholm failed to appear.</p>
<p>He now has just 3 weeks to apply for his appeal to be reopened or it seems that the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417/">District Court&#8217;s ruling</a> of 2009 &#8211; a year in jail and his share of 30 million kronor ($4.48m) in damages &#8211; will stand.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Cybernorms research group at Sweden’s Lund University partnered with The Pirate Bay earlier this year to carry out the largest survey among file-sharers in history. 75,000 people from all over the world participated in the study, and today the researchers revealed some of the initial results. Girls don't fancy The Pirate Bay, most pirates download movies, and they are increasingly worried about their anonymity.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/girls-are-not-into-the-pirate-bay-or-bittorrent-110919/">Girls Are Not Into The Pirate Bay, Or BitTorrent</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-girl.jpg" align="right"  alt="tpb girl" />In April, The Pirate Bay renamed itself to The Research Bay to conduct the largest ever survey among file-sharers <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-joins-academic-cybernorms-research-group-110418/">together</a> with the Cybernorms research group at Lund University.</p>
<p>The Cybernorms group researches how the Internet creates new social norms in society, and to what extent these norms are or should be reflected in relevant legislation. Ultimately, the researchers hope the collated knowledge and insights will help legislators to draft more sensible laws. </p>
<p>The Pirate Bay supported survey was a great success and in just a few days 75,000 people responded. Although the final results wont be made public before November, the researchers are already <a href="http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/nastan-inga-tjejer-laddar-ned-pa-the-pirate-bay">teasing</a> some key figures. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly perhaps, the researchers find that only 5 percent of the respondents are female. Although it could just mean that girls/women are less likely to fill in surveys on their file-sharing habits, the result certainly suggests that BitTorrent is still very much a boys/men thing. </p>
<p>If we look at some other data sources, such as Google&#8217;s site <a href="https://www.google.com/adplanner/planning/site_profile#siteDetails?identifier=thepiratebay.org">profiles</a>, females are indeed underrepresented.  Although the percentages are higher than in the survey, most popular torrent sites get approximately 20 percent female visitors. BTJunkie is the most appealing to girls with <a href="https://www.google.com/adplanner/planning/site_profile#siteDetails?identifier=btjunkie.org">26 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Going back to the survey results, the researchers report that the majority of the respondents are young men between the ages of 18 and 24. Within this group the download habits don&#8217;t vary much between cultures. Whether they come from India, Africa, the United States or Europe, when it comes to file-sharing they are very much alike. </p>
<p>Perhaps more surprisingly, there&#8217;s no difference between men and women when it comes to the content they download. Both men and women download the same amount of porn, and the same is true for sports. The only gender difference comes from games, which 60 percent of men download compared to 25 percent of the women.</p>
<p>Content-wise, movies are by far the most sought after. More than 80 percent of all respondents say they&#8217;ve downloaded movies. This is more than twice as much as the people who&#8217;re interested in music. </p>
<p>According to the researchers it wont be easy to stop people from sharing files. Aside from seeking more ways to download torrents <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/5-ways-to-download-torrents-anonymously-100819/">anonymously</a>, the respondents are also increasingly seeking alternative sharing options, such as swapping USB-sticks and sharing files directly with friends via mobile phones.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks the researchers will delve deeper into the data and the full results are expected to be released in November. Aside from the lack of girls, some interesting patterns should emerge from the file-sharers&#8217; brains. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[For the first time in history a Pirate Party has managed to enter a state parliament. With an estimated 9 percent of the total vote the Pirate Party exceeded the 5% floor needed to enter the Berlin parliament with several seats. For the international Pirate Party movement this is the second major success after the European elections of 2009.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-party-enters-berlin-parliament-after-historical-election-win-110918/">Pirate Party Enters Berlin Parliament After Historic Election Win</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirateparty.gif" align="right" alt="piraten" />The German Pirate Party has scored a massive win in the elections for the Berlin state parliament today. Two hours after the voting booths closed the first results show the Pirates achieving 9 percent of the counted votes. This translates into 15 parliament seats.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2006, the German Pirate Party has already booked several successes in its relatively short existence. Before today, the party had over 50 members in elected offices across Germany, which is more than in all other countries combined. However, today&#8217;s election win trumps all previous ones. </p>
<p>Never before has a Pirate Party been elected into a state or federal parliament. And with the 5 percent floor that was required to enter,  the achievement at the Berlin elections is all the more impressive.</p>
<p>The initial results show that <a href="http://berlin.piratenpartei.de/">the Pirates</a> received the most support from younger voters. 15 percent of people under 30 voted for the Pirate Party, but even among voters aged 60 years and up, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/images/vote-by-age.jpg">a few percent</a> voted for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg was the first region to finish counting, and the Pirate Party got 14.7 percent of all votes there. With all votes counted in the state the Pirates are at 8.9 percent.</p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>8.9% with 100%% of the votes counted</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/piraten-2011.jpg" alt="piraten" /></center></p>
<p>TorrentFreak asked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Nerz">Sebastian Nerz</a>, Chairman of the German Pirate Party, what this success means for the party. He told us that due to an increase in funds and influence the Pirate Party will have a greater chance to make its mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment the Pirate Party of Germany does not have any paid employees,&#8221; Nerz says. &#8220;Everyone working for the party &#8211; including myself &#8211; is working in an honorary capacity. In contrast, Members of Parliament are paid for their work. In addition they receive state money to pay for assistents and co-workers. This will enable those Pirates to work full-time for the party, thus giving us much more work force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another very important benefit is, that citizens and media are taking parties with access to the parliament much more seriously. A number of times i&#8217;ve heard, &#8220;Your party is not relevant because it does not have members of parliament.&#8221; Following this weekend&#8217;s successes, in this respect the party&#8217;s position will be greatly improved.</p>
<p>In addition the Pirate Party expects that their heightened profile will lead to an increase in members and more people working for the party. As for the party&#8217;s ideals, they want to be as transparent as possible, secure the privacy of citizens, abolish patents and limit the ever growing control of copyright exploiting organizations. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to demonstrate that it is possible to conduct a transparent approach to politics. Traditionally politics are a secret &#8216;no trespassing&#8217; area. Meetings are held behind closed doors, agendas and protocols are closed, treaties are not being published,&#8221; Nerz told TorrentFreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will demonstrate that it is possible to openly and truthfully inform the citizens what is going on, what alternatives are possible and why a certain path has been chosen. We will demonstrate that citizens can be integrated into the fact-finding and path-choosing methods. Why not ask citizens about their opinion before you decide? Its well worth a try!&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing&#8217;s for certain. The German Pirate Party scored a sensational win today. As a result, the Berlin state parliament will undoubtedly notice the fresh wind coming from the most technology-friendly and privacy preserving party out there. All the Berlin candidates are ready and eager to start according to the chairman.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short: We are going to demonstrate that politics can be reformed,&#8221; Nerz says.</p>
<p>The election win is currently being celebrated by hundreds of Pirate Party enthusiasts in Berlin, including the founder of the Swedish and first Pirate Party Rick Falkvinge. Rick already predicted the massive win <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tomorrow-pirates-write-history-again-110917/">yesterday</a> and shared a picture of the festivities with TorrentFreak.</p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>Party like it&#8217;s no longer 1984</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/election-win.jpg" alt="null" /></center></p>
<p>&#8220;Pirates of Berlin, thank you for your fantastic work in making tonight happen. We all stand shoulder to shoulder in fighting for the next generation — one of succeeding is all of us succeeding. Tomorrow, people will look to your success, and the movement will grow yet more. You are the source of inspiration for the next wave of civil liberties activists,&#8221; Falkvinge <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/09/18/pirate-party-of-berlin-wins-enters-parliament/">adds</a> in a blog post.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[While mass settlement lawsuits filed against alleged BitTorrent users have the potential to bring in millions in revenue, recent rulings in US District courts are going to severely cut into potential profits. Has the tide turned? It looks like a distinct possibility.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-economics-of-killing-mass-bittorrent-lawsuits-110918/">The Economics of (Killing) Mass-BitTorrent Lawsuits</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/dollar-money.jpg" align="right" alt="money" />Some US District Court judges have entered rulings that might bring the lawsuits to a screeching halt. How? By crippling the ability to abuse the US legal system to extort BitTorrent users en masse. This article explains those rulings and provides an economic analysis to show why.</p>
<p>Why do so many of these lawsuits aggregate thousands of John Does into a single suit? The first answer is often, “More potential victims means more settlements, which means bigger profits.” That is true, but there is an equally important reason for bringing a mass lawsuit. Filing fees. The filing fee in most US District Courts, and indeed the courts where 90% of these cases have been filed, is $350. Every separate case filed costs $350. </p>
<p>Although filing fees can be recovered if the plaintiff wins, that only applies if the cases are taken to trial. With the recent surge of BitTorrent lawsuits, none have gone to trial, and it is unlikely one ever will. So the costs of filing eat directly into the profit margins of these lawsuits. Additionally, each case will require other form-related fees, such as subpoena fees. </p>
<p>When judges refuse to allow many BitTorrent users to be joined in a single lawsuit, these cases become much more cost intensive. That is exactly what is happening.</p>
<h3>The Roadblocks</h3>
<p>Below we discuss three rulings and a procedural rule that vitally impacts the costs inherent in these lawsuits. They could spell doom for the profitability of the mass BitTorrent lawsuit scheme, bringing an end to a travesty of justice that has seen a grandmother, a blind man, and a dead person sued for alleged copyright infringement.</p>
<p>First, Judge Ryu of the Northern District of California<a href="http://houstonlawyer.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/judge-ryu-rules-suing-multiple-bittorrent-swarms-in-one-copyright-infringement-lawsuit/"> ruled</a> that defendants cannot be joined when they are from different swarms. Where two defendants downloaded the same copyrighted work, but did it via different torrents or on different trackers, they cannot be joined.</p>
<p>Second, Judge Zimmerman, also of the Northern District of California, ruled that BitTorrent users in the same swarm can only be joined if they are present <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/judge-decimates-bittorrent-lawsuit-with-common-sense-ruling-110907/">in the swarm at the same time</a>. If a defendant comes along a week later when another defendant is no longer part of the swarm, those defendants cannot be joined.</p>
<p>Third, multiple judges have raised<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/23238-alleged-expendables-downloaders-walk-free-110802/"> the issue of jurisdiction</a>. While jurisdiction is not a ruling, it requires adherence to certain laws of legal procedure. A US District Court can only hear cases concerning defendants that fall within its jurisdiction. Many judges have questioned how an IP-address from another part of the country could fall within the power of their district. This issue has prompted multiple judges to dismiss vast chunks of these BitTorrent lawsuits.</p>
<p>Fourth, Judge Baker of the Central District of Illinois ruled that an <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/ip-address-not-a-person-bittorrent-case-judge-says-110503/">IP-address does not constitute a person</a>.  He decided this in ruling on the issue of “good cause”, which is required for the court to issue a subpoena that allows the plaintiffs to discover the subscriber’s personal information associated with the IP address.  This is vitally important because without the information the plaintiffs have nowhere to send the settlement letters.  </p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Baker stated that many of the IP addresses before his court could be associated with institutions like universities, or even public wi-fi hotspots. Additionally, he expressed doubt that a subscriber was the likeliest person to be the infringer – “[it] might be…someone in the subscriber’s household, a visitor with her laptop, a neighbor…”</p>
<h3>The Economics</h3>
<p>Let’s do a little economic analysis to illustrate the impact of these rulings.  </p>
<p>Before the rulings a plaintiff filed suit against 6,000 John Does, all joined together, in the Northern District of California.  <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/courtfees">Filing cost</a> – $350.  Subpoena cost – $150.  Since it is just one lawsuit, a single lawyer working part-time can handle it.  The lawyer works 20 hours per week for 16 weeks at $300 per hour.  This lawsuit costs $100,000.  If a third of the John Does settle at $750 each, the revenue is $1.5 million. </p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  The potential profit? $1.4 million.</strong></p>
<p>After the rulings, a plaintiff files the same suit against 6,000 John Does. However, because of the rulings on swarms, only 12 Does can be joined in a single suit. Therefore, 500 suits must be filed. Filing cost – $175,000.  Subpoena costs – $75,000. Because of the rulings on jurisdiction, we must bring the suits in 20 jurisdictions. This amount of work will require 4 lawyers working full-time, 40 hours per week, for 16 weeks at $300 per hour.  </p>
<p>This lawsuit costs $1.01 million (lawyer fees plus filing/subpoena costs). Because of Judge Baker’s ruling, one third of the Does are dismissed for lack of “good cause.” One third of the remaining 4,000 Does settle for $750 each for revenue of $1 million. The potential profit?  None. </p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The plaintiff actually loses $10,000.</strong></p>
<p>The specific numbers above are just an illustration. Maybe less or more lawyers are needed, less or more Does are dismissed, and the number of Does joined in a single suit might be greater or less than 12.  In the face of declining profits and increasing court costs the plaintiffs may also choose to increase the minimum amount per settlement.  But, a higher settlement price doesn&#8217;t guarantee higher profitability.</p>
<p>However the numbers might vary, the underlying points remain the same. </p>
<p>Currently filed BitTorrent lawsuits aren&#8217;t suddenly going to disappear, at least not for solely financial reasons.  But the rate at which thousands of John Does are being hailed into court?  That will certainly decline.  Before those rulings, the return on investment (ROI) for the lawsuit would be well over 10,000%.  After these rulings, the ROI drops to, at best, single digits. At worst, the plaintiff will lose money attempting a mass BitTorrent lawsuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the mass settlement lawsuits are now being <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/hurt-locker-lawsuits-hit-canada-isps-ordered-to-reveal-bittorrent-users-110909/">filed in Canada</a>?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Tomorrow, Sunday, the German Pirate Party is expected to be voted into Parliament in Berlin. This is the second time the nascent political movement will be felt worldwide -- the first being in 2009, when the Swedish party took seats in the European Parliament.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tomorrow-pirates-write-history-again-110917/">Tomorrow, Pirates Write History Again</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirateparty.gif" align="right" alt="pirates" />One thing you learn very quickly when dealing with politics is that it&#8217;s on another timescale than the rest of our work. We are used to hacking up a solution to a problem in a 24-hour coding session or a weekend. The time between elections, four or five years, are glacial in comparison.</p>
<p>But politics moves slowly. It&#8217;s part of what it is. Having successes on this scale two years apart is rapid succession. It takes decades for new values to gain mainstream acceptance, but only a few major successes to turn the tide.</p>
<p>The polls for the German Pirate Party &#8212; the <em>Piratenpartei</em> &#8212; vary a bit ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s election, but one thing is clear; they are well above the five-percent limit needed for parliamentary representation. Newspapers in Berlin had the news of Piratenpartei entering Parliament <a href="http://www.berliner-kurier.de/image/view/2011/2/2/7587204,7247028,highRes,Titelblatt+BK+aktuell+%2528nicht+l%25C3%25B6schen%2521%2521%2529.jpg">all over the front page</a> yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>So what does this mean?</strong> What is the Parliament in Berlin, anyway?</p>
<p>Germany is not so much a country, as it is a federation of countries (<em>l&auml;nder</em>). Berlin is a country about the same size as Oregon or New Zealand, with roughly four million people. But being the capital of Germany, it has a certain clout &#8212; in particular internationally.</p>
<p>It is the Parliament in the state of Berlin that the Piratenpartei is about to enter (and not the German Parliament at the federal level, the <em>Bundestag</em>; those elections are in 2013.)</p>
<p>Then again, what does this mean <strong>in practice?</strong></p>
<p>It will teach the copyright industry that the success of the Swedish <em>Piratpartiet</em> in 2009 was not an isolated phenomenon. I have frequently said that the Pirate movement is for this decade what the Greens were in the 1970s; it is a worldwide grassroots movement present and growing everywhere. The copyright monopoly and security theater pundits will definitely not like seeing this coming true, and political analysts worldwide know that Berlin tends to be an international political trendsetter.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>we succeed together</strong>. The Swedish success in the European elections in 2009 was a tremendous boost for the Pirate Party movement worldwide. Tomorrow will have the same effect. We fight for civil liberties together, shoulder to shoulder, and we succeed together. News outlets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&#038;hl=en&#038;gl=us&#038;tbm=nws&#038;btnmeta_news_search=1&#038;q=%22pirate+party%22">are already</a> talking about the Berlin election and the Piratenpartei worldwide &#8212; Taiwan, Africa, Ireland, United States. And that&#8217;s still before the election itself.</p>
<p>If you had any doubt and live in Berlin, join in creating history tomorrow. <strong>Vote Pirate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow, the 18th of September, the German Piratenpartei enters the Berlin Parliament.</strong></p>
<p>And the day after the elections, the 19th of September, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">International Talk Like A Pirate Day</a>. Isn&#8217;t that fitting. I&#8217;m sure many politicians will.</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tenenbaum.jpg" class="alignright" width="200" height="150" />Joel Tenenbaum&#8217;s fight with the RIAA has been dragging on now for six years. In 2009, a jury found Tenenbaum guilty of “willful infringement” and awarded damages of $675,000.</p>
<p>But in July 2010, the severe punishment handed out to the Boston student was in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Judge Nancy Gertner ruled in Sony BMG Music Entertainment v. Tenenbaum that the awarded damages were both excessive and unconstitutional. She slashed the jury-awarded damages by 90% to $67,500 &#8211;  $2,250 for each of 30 infringed works.</p>
<p>Unhappy, Tenenbaum lodged an appeal, as did the RIAA, and in April this year both parties were back in court before Chief Judge Sandra L. Lynch, Judge Juan R. Torruella, and Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson at the 1st Circuit Court of Appeal in Boston. </p>
<p>In its decision released yesterday, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals reversed U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Gertner’s decision. Although the appeal court did not necessarily disagree with the response to the constitutional question, it found that Judge Nancy Gertner should not have considered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Citing the doctrine of &#8216;constitutional avoidance,&#8217; which dictates that courts should avoid tackling constitutional issues unnecessarily, the court found that Judge Gertner should first have considered using a procedure called &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittitur">remittitur</a>&#8216;,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/09/appellate-court-send-tenenbaum-case-back-another">explains</a> EFF Intellectual Property Director Corynne McSherry. </p>
<p>&#8220;Under this procedure, she could have lowered the damages amount, but, if the record companies chose not to accept the new amount, they could have asked for a new trial.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;A decision on a constitutional due process question was not necessary, was not inevitable, had considerable impermissible consequences, and contravened the rule of constitutional avoidance,&#8221; wrote Chief Judge Sandra L. Lynch in her decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;That rule had more than its usual import in this case because there were a number of difficult constitutional issues which should have been avoided but were engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that this has been a difficult case, the Court found against Tenenbaum and in favor of the plaintiffs, Sony BMG.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have, inter alia, rejected Tenenbaum&#8217;s arguments that the Copyright Act is unconstitutional under Feltner, 523 U.S. 340, that the Act exempts so-called &#8216;consumer copying&#8217; infringement from liability and damages, that statutory damages under the Act are unavailable without a showing of actual harm, that the jury&#8217;s instructions were in error, and his various trial error claims,&#8221; wrote Judge Lynch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We vacate the district court&#8217;s due process damages ruling and reverse the reduction of the jury&#8217;s statutory damages award. We reinstate the jury&#8217;s award of damages and remand for consideration of plaintiff&#8217;s motion for common law remittitur based on excessiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>So yet again, in common with the case against <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/riaa-appeals-following-latest-jamie-thomas-file-sharing-ruling-110823/">Jamie Thomas</a>, Joel Tenenbaum&#8217;s case grinds on while serving no obvious purpose.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fresh data on the market share of BitTorrent clients shows that uTorrent remains the client of choice for most BitTorrent users in the West. A sample of more than half a million unique peers further shows that Transmission is gaining ground, while the once so popular BitComet client slowly fades away. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-keeps-bittorrent-lead-bitcomet-fades-away-110916/">uTorrent Keeps BitTorrent Lead, BitComet Fades Away</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/utorrent_logo.png" align="right" alt="utorrent" />With millions of people using BitTorrent every day, the protocol has been the leading P2P technology from more than half a decade.</p>
<p>To gain more insight into BitTorrent&#8217;s usage we&#8217;ve previously looked at the market share of various BitTorrent clients to spot emerging trends, and today we revive this initiative. To see where things stand two years after our <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-userbase-grows-vuze-takes-a-dive-091018/">last report</a>, TorrentFreak asked  the <a href="http://www.tribler.org/trac">Tribler</a> P2P research team at Delft University of Technology to find out which clients are being used in various popular BitTorrent swarms. </p>
<p>Although the new results show some interesting shifts in market shares, uTorrent remains firmly in the lead. Nearly half of the 557,536 unique peers (48%)  that were spotted in the sample were using a version of uTorrent. The mainline client, also developed by BitTorrent Inc., came in at third with a market share of 13 percent.</p>
<p>Vuze, formerly known as Azureus, secured second place with 22 percent of the total users. This is an all-time high for the client which had just 14 percent market share in our last report. One of the factors that contributed to this rise is <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/frostwire-kills-gnutella-to-go-all-bittorrent-110627/">FrostWire&#8217;s move</a> to become a BitTorrent-only client based on the Azureus code base. This means that a few percent of the downloaders that identify as using Azureus, are in fact FrostWire users.</p>
<p>Another client that gained popularity is Transmission, which doubled its market share in recent months and is now at 7 percent. A respectable figure, especially because Transmission doesn&#8217;t have a native Windows client. BitComet, on the other hand, continued its downward spiral and is now stuck at little over one percent, down from the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-dominates-bittorrent-client-market-share-090624/">6 percent</a> it enjoyed two years ago. </p>
<p>We have to note that the comparisons above are relative. The number of BitTorrent users has grown significantly over the past two years, so in absolute numbers Transmission&#8217;s user base may have even quadrupled, or more. </p>
<p>Below is the full list of all clients that have a market share over 1 percent. Some clients were not identified by libTorrent (rakshasa) and those ended up in the unknown ‘category’. As before, the research focuses on popular swarms listed on English language BitTorrent sites, which means that &#8216;foreign&#8217; clients such as Xunlei are underrepresented.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hollywood-funded anti-piracy group BREIN says it will pursue a similar strategy to its counterparts in the United States and UK by pressuring payment processors like PayPal to stop doing business with file-sharing sites. But BREIN says the processors must go further. Either they can voluntarily hand over the names of the admins behind the site accounts, or they will go to court and sue them into submission.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-group-will-sue-pay-processors-if-they-dont-name-site-admins-110916/">Anti-Piracy Group Will Sue Pay Processors If They Don&#8217;t Name Site Admins</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/paypal1.jpg" class="alignright" width="200" height="69" />No matter if there are pop-up and pop-under adverts on every page, or a single discreet button where someone can pledge a five dollar donation, thousands of file-sharing related sites need a mechanism by which to convert money into spendable funds.</p>
<p>For many the payment processor &#8211; PayPal and other similar services &#8211; provide their financial lifeline. After years of ignoring this Achilles&#8217; heel, anti-piracy companies are taking steps to exploit this weakness and this week another group announced their plans &#8211; and they&#8217;re controversial to say the least.</p>
<p>“We are in talks with the Dutch payment providers and are working towards partnerships,” <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/brein-wants-paypal-to-cut-payments-to-file-sharing-sites-110912/">says</a> Tim Kuik, chief of anti-piracy outfit BREIN.</p>
<p>Kuik says that by offering payment solutions to file-sharing sites, services such as PayPal are doing business with unlawful entities and therefore contributing to their &#8216;crimes&#8217;.</p>
<p>The idea isn&#8217;t new. In the United States the forthcoming PROTECT IP Act will oblige payment processors to stop doing business with &#8220;rogue sites&#8221; and in the UK the IFPI have similar but more <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/paypal-ifpi-and-police-collaborate-to-strangle-pirate-music-sites-110723/">private deals</a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>With BREIN, the ball is already rolling. The Hollywood-funded group has written to an unnamed selection of payment processors seeking cooperation with the issue in hand &#8211; strangling the finances of sites that BREIN, not a court, deem to be illegal.</p>
<p>But BREIN also sees the payment processors as potentially useful in another highly controversial area.</p>
<p>“We are often faced with services that operate anonymously and have given their hosting provider false information,” Kuik said. “We suspect that the payment providers have a good track, because the money they send has to go somewhere.”</p>
<p>Of course, BREIN have a job to do and will do whatever they can to achieve their goals, but when Kuik elaborated further in a <a href="http://www.futureofcopyright.com/home/blog-post/2011/09/15/dutch-brein-foundation-counts-on-payment-providers-to-tackle-illegal-file-sharing-sites.html">discussion</a> with Future of Copyright this week, it became clear that controversy is not something the group shies away from.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have requested several payment providers to give BREIN the name and address of illegal file sharing sites,&#8221; Kuik explained.</p>
<p>Now, BREIN hasn&#8217;t been to court on order to obtain specific permission to obtain this data, yet Kuik says that the payment processors can simply hand over the private details of account owners to his company. Unsurprisingly, the targets of BREIN&#8217;s affections aren&#8217;t yet falling over themselves to comply.</p>
<p>&#8220;The payment providers do not seem very willing to cooperate yet, but are deliberating on a response,&#8221; says Kuik. But he says they better respond positively &#8211; the pleasantries won&#8217;t last forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there will be no response, BREIN will sue them and refer the matter to court,&#8221; he warns.</p>
<p>Arnoud Engelfriet, a lawyer with Ictrecht law firm, believes that the law could be on BREIN&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dutch case law (in particular the <a href="http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/38504/hoge-raad--lycos-moet-identiteit-klant-onthullen.html">Pessers/Lycos</a> case) has held that in certain cases internet providers and other intermediaries are indeed required to hand over identifying information if a customer is likely committing a tort. A court intervention is not necessary according to our High Court,&#8221; he told TorrentFreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legal requirements are that it is without serious doubt that this customer is committing the tort, that releasing the identifying information is relevant for the case *and* that an evaluation of customer privacy versus the interests of the third party reveals ultimately that privacy must give way to those interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if I am a whistleblower, my privacy would be very important and my employer wouldn&#8217;t easily get my identifying information with this ruling,&#8221; Engelfriet adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;For banks and payment processors the same requirement would apply. They have to evaluate how likely it is that their customer is violating third party rights and that handing over this data is more important than protecting the privacy of their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Engelfriet says that given the sensitivity that banks normally apply to customer details, he would be surprised if they handed over this information without a fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freely handing over details would set a big precedent for them: anyone with a complaint could demand customer information. E.g. you buy something on eBay and you feel duped, you would demand bank information. Besides, banks have big pockets so I&#8217;m not too worried,&#8221; Engelfriet concludes.</p>
<p>Kuik won&#8217;t say which payment processors he&#8217;s contacted thus far, but says that should BREIN sue them their identities will quickly become public.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year U.S. lawmakers proposed a draconian anti-piracy legislation known as the PROTECT IP Act. When the proposal becomes law, U.S. authorities and copyright holders will have the power to seize domains, block websites and censor search engines to prevent copyright infringements. But file-hosting service RapidShare have a lot to lose by its introduction and are now spending a great deal of money countering the views of pro-copyright lobbyists.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/rapidshare-lobbies-lawmakers-against-protect-ip-act-110915/">RapidShare Lobbies Lawmakers Against PROTECT IP Act</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/rapidsharelogo.jpg" align="right" alt="rapidshare" />Late last year both the MPAA and RIAA informed the Office of the US Trade Representative that RapidShare is a piracy haven, a so-called rogue website. </p>
<p>In the hope of correcting this and other misconceptions surrounding their operations, RapidShare then took the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/rapidshare-shows-mpaariaa-we-can-lobby-lawmakers-too-101228/">unprecedented step</a> of hiring the lobbying firm Dutko Worldwide, who also work for Google. </p>
<p>Initially, little was known about the priorities of RapidShare in Washington, but the most recent lobbying report filed by Dutko <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/65110903/Rapid-Share-Lobby">reveals</a> that the PROTECT IP Act is high up the list. For good reason, because if the bill becomes law RapidShare could be one of the first to be put out of business, in the United States at least.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_IP_Act">PROTECT IP Act</a>, authorities (and copyright holders) will have a  broad range of tools to censor sites they deem to be facilitating copyright infringement, starting with domain seizures.</p>
<p>In case a domain is not registered or controlled by a U.S. company, authorities can order search engines to remove the website from their search results and order ISPs to block the website.</p>
<p>Although the above measures are already quite far-reaching, the bill also allows for private copyright holders to use some of the same tools as the Government. Without due process, copyright holders can obtain a court order to prevent payment providers and ad-networks from doing business with sites that allegedly facilitate copyright infringement. </p>
<p>One of the many problems of such a law is who gets to decide what the definition of a &#8220;rogue website&#8221; is. In common with other file-sharing platforms, RapidShare is often labeled as seriously problematic, despite the fact that they&#8217;ve been found to <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/rapidshare-not-guilty-of-copyright-infringement-us-court-rules-100520/">operate legally</a> by a U.S. federal court. This could lead to a situation where hundreds of legitimate businesses are virtually shut down because the entertainment industry sees them as a threat. </p>
<p>To make lawmakers aware of these threats and to improve their image in Washington, RapidShare has already spent $260,000 in lobbying efforts during the first half of 2011. </p>
<p>The PROTECT IP Act, currently placed on hold by Senator Ron Wyden, is crucial in this regard as the RIAA and MPAA have already labeled RapidShare as a rogue website. This means that when the bill is signed into law the file-hoster could be one of the first companies to be targeted.</p>
<p>Whether RapidShare&#8217;s lobbying efforts in Washington will pay off is yet to be seen. It is no secret that entertainment industry groups are <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-lobbies-for-wall-street-reform-110815/">lobbying extensively</a> in favor of  the PROTECT IP Act, with much bigger budgets. That said, it&#8217;s certainly better than standing idly by. </p>
<p>In the coming months RapidShare is expected to continue their lobbying efforts at the White House Office, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Not only against the PROTECT IP Act, but to improve the image of their company and protect their rights and those of other file-hosting services. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[It's one of the longest existences in the entire file-sharing space and bar none it has been the most eventful. We're talking about the life of The Pirate Bay, the world's most resilient BitTorrent site. Today the site celebrates its 8th birthday, a massive achievement which may not ever be bettered in terms of longevity, sheer volume of members and material distributed.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/happy-birthday-pirate-bay-youve-just-turned-8-years-old-today-110915/">Happy Birthday Pirate Bay, You&#8217;ve Just Turned 8 Years Old Today</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/tpb.jpg" class="alignright" width="175" height="188" />By now the story of The Pirate Bay (TPB) and its humble Swedish-only beginnings is a well worn tale. The site&#8217;s roots can be traced back to Piratbyrån (The Bureau of Piracy), a pro-piracy organization founded in August 2003.</p>
<p>With the legendary BitTorrent indexer Suprnova riding high but with no significant file-sharing network in Sweden at the time, Piratbyrån decided to fill that gap. For TPB founders TiAMO, Anakata and Brokep, the relatively new BitTorrent protocol would be the weapon of choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We and Piratbyrån wanted more Swedish and Scandinavian content. So we started a big library, and that is The Pirate Bay,” recalls Brokep, aka Peter Sunde.</p>
<p>By the end of 2004, a year after the site launched, the tracker was already tracking a million peers and over 60,000 torrent files. What followed in the years to come was both dramatic growth and turmoil on a grand scale, as The Pirate Bay became a media distribution monster, loved by its users but despised by the mainstream entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Over the years The Pirate Bay was hosted in several countries and its founders subjected to both civil and criminal lawsuits and prosecutions. Despite seemingly overwhelming odds, the site refused to give in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall defend our Internets, whatever the cost may be,&#8221; is the site&#8217;s latest mantra. On past performances of sheer defiance, few will doubt them.</p>
<p>So here we are, in 2011, exactly 8 years on from the site&#8217;s creation. Well, perhaps not exactly 8 years. The Pirate Bay commemorated its 5th birthday in November 2008 amid a haze of uncertainty over when the precise celebrations should take place. But for the site&#8217;s millions of followers, a month or two here or there will be of little concern.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb8th.jpg" alt="TPB 8th" /></center></p>
<p>&#8220;So it has become our 8th birthday! Time flies huh?&#8221; the site&#8217;s new owners, whoever they are and wherever they may be, declared today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8221;ll say it again. This would not have happened without you! Outside of the bay a lot of stuff has happened during these 8 years. A lot of good and some bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;We admins are positive dudes and dudettes who like to think that the world is moving forward and not backwards. That&#8217;s partly what the site is about. Spreading culture around the globe so that maybe people will understand each other a bit more,&#8221; they add.</p>
<p>Traditionally that &#8216;spreading of culture&#8217; &#8211; the exchange of digital files online &#8211; would have taken place among fairly niche, need-to-know file-sharing circles. One of The Pirate Bay&#8217;s biggest legacies will be that it cast aside those elitist chains, successfully penetrated the mainstream media and psyche, and achieved spreading of culture on a biblical scale.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not over yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heading in to our 9th year we are preparing some huge news. We can&#8217;t really tell yet but it will be huuuuuge!&#8221; the site&#8217;s operators promise.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay has given the file-sharing world much, and quite possibly its Concorde-moment. By definition there&#8217;s both happiness and sadness there &#8211; the bittersweet taste of an era that has provided so much but may never be repeated. But better to have lived and loved, than to have lived and never loved at all.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Pirate Bay, we&#8217;ll stick around for next year&#8217;s celebrations. We know you will.</p>

Unsurprisingly, the letters come with an offer to settle for thousands of dollars.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/canadian-police-issue-file-sharing-scam-letters-fraud-warning-110915/">Canadian Police Issue File-Sharing Scam Letters Fraud Warning</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/scam.jpg" class="alignright" width="180" height="173" />Just under a week ago we reported that mass-lawsuits targeting BitTorrent users had migrated from the United States to Canada.</p>
<p>Having met resistance on home soil, the makers of The Hurt Locker are now <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/hurt-locker-lawsuits-hit-canada-isps-ordered-to-reveal-bittorrent-users-110909/">sending out letters</a> to Canadian Internet users saying they have been caught sharing the Oscar-winning movie. Settle now for a few thousand dollars, the letters say, or face an expensive legal battle in court.</p>
<p>While opponents of these settlement schemes label them as a &#8216;scam&#8217;, they largely operate within the law. After all, they&#8217;re being run by lawyers. However, where there&#8217;s money to be made there&#8217;s always the chance of an illegal scam riding on the same wave, as Canadians are just finding out.</p>
<p>According to an official public fraud warning from West Vancouver Police Department, Canadian seniors have been targeted recently in a fake pay-up-or-else style &#8216;file-sharing&#8217; settlement scheme.</p>
<p>The letters, which claim to be from Artisan International License, Compliance and Investigations, state that the recipient has been caught downloading porn movies. In common with their &#8216;legal&#8217; counterparts, the scammers offer to make the whole sorry episode go away for a few thousand dollars. If they don&#8217;t settle, further legal action is threatened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I opened an interesting letter today from &#8216;Artisan International&#8217;. The letter accused me of downloading several pornographic movies via &#8220;Bittorrent / P2P,&#8221; <a href="http://bolt.cd/board/daily-chit-chat/656069-scam-alter-artisan-international.html">says</a> a letter recipient who identifies himself as Sandworm. </p>
<p>&#8220;The letter demands 3000$ by September 24th. I won&#8217;t go into my professional background, but let&#8217;s just say I know the law and am no idiot when it comes to internet technology. In fact I regularly publish articles covering filesharing technology,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are messing with the wrong person. I took the letter straight to the local police. It turns out they have already received hundreds of complaints about these letters already. That is hundreds of complaints in my neighborhood. Their advice: &#8216;rip it up&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movies listed in the fake settlement letters include Paris Porno (1976), Retired Porn Stars (2010), Real Big Boobs 2, Volume 2 (2006), White-Hot Nurses (2002), Reality Pron Series 1 (1995), Les Affames sont tombles sure la tete (1994) and Rammin&#8217; the Rear Gate 2001 (2001).</p>
<p>Targeting the elderly with any scam is a despicable act, made even worse by the potentially embarrassing payload employed in this case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you or anyone you know has been a recipient of this letter or has personal knowledge of who may be responsible for sending these letters, please contact the West Vancouver Police at 604-925-7300 quoting file number 11-11341 or if you wish to remain anonymous, please call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 ,&#8221; the police conclude.</p>
<p>Scams of this nature aren&#8217;t new. Criminals in Germany tried the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/scammers-want-file-sharers-to-pay-cash-fines-101021/">same thing</a> last year.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Two brothers from Brisbane, Australia who operated the popular private BitTorrent tracker MovieX have barely escaped a jail sentence. The two were arrested late 2008 for facilitating copyright infringement and both pleaded guilty. Speaking to TorrentFreak, one of the sentenced brothers says he regrets his wrongdoings, but also wants to refute many of the false claims that are currently being spread by the media.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/moviex-bittorrent-tracker-founders-escape-jail-time-110914/">MovieX BitTorrent Tracker Founders Escape Jail Time</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/moviex.jpg" align="right" alt="moviex" />With a claimed 400,000 registered users, MovieX.info was one of the largest semi-private BitTorrent trackers on the Internet in 2008.</p>
<p>Although the site&#8217;s operations were <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/moviex-leeches-from-bittorrent-community-071201/">frowned upon</a> by a part of the BitTorrent community, its members saw MovieX as their prime source for fast downloads. This high-profile site didn&#8217;t go unnoticed by the Australian anti-piracy outfit AFACT, who launched an investigation into the site&#8217;s operators.</p>
<p>During December 2008, AFACT&#8217;s efforts resulted in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/moviex-bittorrent-tracker-busted-by-australian-police-081204/">the arrest</a> of two brothers from Australia, the then 27-year old Hitesh Rama and his 23-year old brother Moneel Rama. The two were accused of facilitating the unauthorized transfers of 14 million movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>This week the case against the two brothers finally came to an end. Hitesh Rama was sentenced to 18 months in jail and his brother Moneel Rama received a 15 month jail sentence. However, Judge Richard Jones sent the two home on a $3000 good behavior bond, replacing the jail time with community service of 200 and 125 hours respectively.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak spoke to Moneel, who says he is glad that they escaped jail time, which he credits to the excellent work of their lawyers. But, at the same time he&#8217;s also very disappointed with how their case is being  presented in the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to point out that me and my brother have learnt our lesson. However, half the things said in the press are untrue and the media has a way to blow these things out of proportions,&#8221; Moneel told TorrentFreak.</p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>Hitesh Rama (left) Moneel Rama ( right)</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/moviex-bros.jpg" alt="moviex" /></center></p>
<p>Aside from technicalities, such as the claim that the website was hosted at their home address instead of in a data center in The Netherlands, most of the inaccuracies deal with money related issues.  </p>
<p>In common with many other private BitTorrent trackers,  MovieX offered VIP memberships to its users in return for certain privileges. However, <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/no-jail-for-pirate-movie-pair/story-e6freoof-1226136172646">reports</a> in the media suggest that people could only download files if they paid for a membership, which is certainly not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never forced anyone to give us money or sign up for a &#8216;subscription&#8217; service as described in the press. If we were to go back and ask any VIP member of the website if they were ever forced to give us money the answer would be a simple &#8216;no&#8217;,&#8221; Moneel said.</p>
<p>This is supported by the court papers which show that 6,000 transactions were made by MovieX members, totaling more than $110,000 in revenue. A large sum of money, but 6,000 transactions with more than 400,000 members means that less than 1.5% of all members paid money to the site.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the claims that <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/brothers-made-50000-from-selling-pirated-dvds-over-the-internet/story-e6freoof-1226136529946">huge profits</a> were made from the website.  If we deduct the $50,000 that was frozen and confiscated by the authorities, a healthy revenue still remains. However, according to Moneel nearly all of the revenue went back into the site.</p>
<p>Moneel explained that the server costs added up to $1000 a month, and that they spent several hundred dollars each month on premium RapidShare and Megaupload accounts for the site. Also, the &#8216;owner&#8217; of the site &#8211; better known as Loder &#8211;  received a share of the donations for his work on the site. The rest of the money was kept in the brothers&#8217; personal bank accounts, but would be invested in the site at a later stage.</p>
<p>According to the brothers there was never any intention to cash in at the expense of its users, or steal the money and run away. There were issues, and not everyone may have been a fan of the site, but the site was not setup as a business at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;MovieX was simply a hobby and we never had any intention of bringing the torrent community and my families name to shame. Obviously we had a lot of issues with our <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/moviex-leeches-from-bittorrent-community-071201/">tracker problems</a> and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/moviex-bittorrent-tracker-vipdonations-stolen-090110/">stolen VIP funds</a> however that is the past, and the truth will always be out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the brothers the end of the case closes a controversial chapter in their lives. Both hold a steady job and they are ready to move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to end this by saying I respect the Judge&#8217;s decision on our sentencing. Me and my brother can only go in one direction and that is forward and this will be something that is left behind,&#8221; Moneel concluded.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/newzbin.jpg" class="alignright" width="170" height="170" />Following a complaint from the Motion Picture Association, earlier this year a judge at London’s High Court <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-forces-uk-isp-to-block-newzbin-usenet-site-110728/">ordered</a> leading UK ISP BT to block subscriber access to Usenet indexing site Newzbin2.</p>
<p>Although the blocking measures aren&#8217;t expected to be put in place until after mid-October, a breakdown in one of Newzbin2&#8242;s DNS servers during the last few days led to fears that it had been implemented early.</p>
<p>The fault was quickly fixed, and Newzbin2&#8242;s operators said the problem encouraged them to work harder on their promised anti-blocking solutions.</p>
<p>Today, TeamRDogs &#8211; the group behind the site &#8211; released Newzbin Client 1.0.0.127, the first public piece of software designed to circumvent BT&#8217;s Cleanfeed online censorship system, the tool which the MPA hopes can neutralize Newzbin2 in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to announce the first Newzbin2 client software,&#8221; said Newzbin2&#8242;s Mr White.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is targeted at UK users who are likely to get blocked in October. This first version is a bit rushed and so not very polished. As time goes by we shall improve it and add features.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/newzbin2client2.jpg" alt="Newzbin2client2" /></center></p>
<p>The software provides a basic web interface for the Newzbin2 site but while OSX and Linux versions are planned for the future, the client (which downloads in a 2.4mb installer) is currently only available for Windows users. So how does it work?</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t say how our client application works but it uses a number of techniques to utterly defeat Cleanfeed,&#8221; said Mr White in an email. </p>
<p>&#8220;The application also has Agility Technology to break any updated web censorship methods or anti freedom countermeasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using network protocol analysis software, TorrentFreak ran some basic tests on the Newzbin2 client today which revealed that it does indeed defeat known features of Cleanfeed in a number of ways. </p>
<p>Initially the client tries to resolve the site&#8217;s domain name to an IP in the usual manner via DNS, but from there, and without going into too many details, an encrypted session is initiated between the client and the Newzbin2 site in a way that Cleanfeed won&#8217;t like, rendering blocking impractical and snooping more or less impossible.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/newzbin2client.jpg" alt="Newzbin2client" /></center></p>
<p>As can be seen from the screenshot above, the client also provides some other features such as accessing the Newzbin2 website via the TOR anonymity network. Other useful links to online resources such as IMDb and common search engines are also provided.</p>
<p>The client is in the early stages of development and will need a few features updating if it wants to be near bulletproof. We&#8217;re sure Newzbin2&#8242;s Mr Violet, the guy who put in much of the work, has all that covered &#8211; and more.</p>

The man, an actor, has now agreed to plead guilty and potentially faces three years in prison. There were claims he could've been connected to a release group but as his amateurish online actions show, nothing could be further from the truth.<p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/how-the-fbi-caught-an-actor-uploading-movie-screeners-to-pirate-bay-110914/">How The FBI Caught an Actor Uploading Movie Screeners To Pirate Bay</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com//images/fbilogoub0.gif" class="alignright" width="145" height="150" />In mid-April, Screen Actor’s Guild (SAG) member Wes DeSoto had his premises <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/fbi-bust-hollywood-insider-over-pirate-bay-uploads-110425/">raided</a> on suspicion of uploading several pre-release movies to the Internet.</p>
<p>As Google&#8217;s cache at the time revealed, DeSoto uploaded torrents to The Pirate Bay including The King’s Speech, Rabbit Hole, 127 Hours, The Fighter and Black Swan, all between January 23 and January 29. As a member of the Guild, DeSoto had access to DVD quality screeners which were delivered to him via the use of special codes on the iTunes store.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/09/pirate-bay-screener-seeding/">Wired</a>, DeSoto, who had a bit-part in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, agreed Monday to plead guilty to one count of breaching the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 for uploading the movie Black Swan to BitTorrent.  He faces a maximum of 3 years in prison although the state is seeking three years probation.</p>
<p>So how did DeSoto find himself in the arms of the FBI? According to the affidavit, that was made easy by an almost unbelievable series of amateurish mistakes.</p>
<p>After being hired by Paramount Pictures to monitor online piracy for the movie The Fighter, on January 28th Deluxe Webwatch discovered a high-quality screener version being made available by release group TiMPE. </p>
<p>Politely the group indicated that the source of the file as being a &#8220;720p SAG screener (mf34inc)&#8221;, but unfortunately this courtesy was to set the ball rolling in DeSoto&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>After downloading the movie but failing to find a previously implanted watermark, nor any evidence to show the movie had come from iTunes, Deluxe went back to Paramount. It turned out that the studio had indeed put specific marks into the iTunes version of the movie.</p>
<p>Rather than hunt down TiMPE, Deluxe was told to find &#8220;mf34inc&#8221; and for this they rolled out one of the world&#8217;s most powerful detective tools &#8211; Google. Their search led them to The Pirate Bay where they found a user of the same name who had uploaded The Fighter plus 127 Hours, The Kings Speech and Black Swan.</p>
<p>While Deluxe were clearly too late to find the IP address of mf34inc when the previous movies were uploaded, all they had to do was remain patient for more uploads. On January 28th they struck gold, as the same user began to upload another screener, this time of the movie Rabbit Hole. His IP address had been logged and the chase was on.</p>
<p>The next pieces of evidence against DeSoto came thanks to him responding to criticism in The Pirate Bay&#8217;s comment section. After several users questioned the authenticity of the file, mf34inc weighed in with &#8220;SAG now send out iTunes download codes for screeners&#8221; and the utterly priceless &#8220;I&#8217;m a SAG member and thought i&#8217;d share these.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armed with mf34inc&#8217;s IP address and a timestamp from the Rabbit Hole upload (allocated to Time Warner Cable / Road Runner), investigators asked the ISP to show who was using the resource at the time. It led directly to one of their subscribers &#8211; one Wesley DeSoto of Los Angeles. But it gets worse.</p>
<p>According to iTunes, the account name registered to the download of The Fighter was &#8220;wes@mf34.com&#8221;. Furthermore, the IP address used to download The Fighter from iTunes matched the IP address used to upload Rabbit Hole to The Pirate Bay.</p>
<p>From here DeSoto&#8217;s details were cross-referenced with the California Department of Motor Vehicles Database and his photo was obtained. But the simple username mf34inc was to prove an even more fruitful source of evidence for investigators.</p>
<p>By using Google again, Deluxe discovered that mf34inc was a reference to a clothing company called m34, short for <a href="http://www.mf34.com/">The March Forth</a>. When searching YouTube, Deluxe found an account for the company with the name of &#8211; you&#8217;ve guessed it &#8211; mf34inc.</p>
<p>In a video uploaded to the account, a BMX rider on The March Forth&#8217;s racing team said: &#8220;Wes over there is a really cool guy, takes care of all of us.&#8221; Wes, it transpires, is the owner of The March Forth.</p>
<p>A visit to DeSoto&#8217;s Linkedin profile yielded another photograph. It matched the one on his driving license.</p>
<p>After all the dots had been joined, DeSoto had a visit from the FBI. Following his arrest he said he was a &#8220;nobody&#8221; in the file-sharing world and denied being a member of a release group. From DeSoto&#8217;s catalogue of errors, which if anything seem to suggest that he didn&#8217;t even attempt to cover his tracks, no one will be disputing his version of events.</p>
<p>DeSoto is expected in court next month.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of July 2011, the admin of XtremeSpeeds.net, a private BitTorrent tracker, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/xtremespeeds-bittorrent-admin-busted-110730/">reported</a> that his house had been raided by the authorities. He said that he was questioned under suspicion of being part of IMAGiNE, one of the leading P2P release groups.</p>
<p>Although the XS admin denied begin connected, he did admit renting out a server to &#8220;a guy who rented it out,” a suggestion that he perhaps had suspicions about potential connections, intended or otherwise.</p>
<p>XtremeSpeeds then disappeared completely and a promised August update from the site&#8217;s admin never materialized. What followed was an information black-hole, a common feature of ongoing piracy investigations where authorities aren&#8217;t yet ready to shout about their achievements and lawyers advise their clients to keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>Now the rumor mill is turning again. According to reports, IMAGiNE &#8211; one of the P2P scene&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vcdq.com/browse/1/0/3_2/10_9_21_22_23_24_6_28_32_19_11_3_2/imagine/2011/0/0/0/0/0">most prominent</a> release groups &#8211; have been busted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The reports, which have proven impossible to confirm from any official source at this stage, state up to nine arrests.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/unleashthenet.jpg" alt="Unleashthenet" /></center></p>
<p>Last year, IMAGiNE launched their own &#8220;secret&#8221; private BitTorrent tracker that remained under the radar for roughly 10 minutes. The site, UnleashTheNet, also known by its acronym  UtN, was hosted in Canada but in the last few days it simply disappeared.</p>
<p>This morning TorrentFreak spoke with the site&#8217;s host who informed us that they haven&#8217;t heard anything about any raids or arrests. A traceroute timed-out at the site&#8217;s IP address.</p>
<p>However, there is one person who claims to know the details of IMAGiNE&#8217;s fate and he spoke with us just a few hours ago. So, has IMAGiNE really been busted?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; says DiGiTALiNK, founder of P2P release group EP1C. &#8220;ICE joint operation got them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an email to TorrentFreak, DiGiTALiNK went on to say that 9 people were arrested including IMAGiNE members Spunky, HoD, Jason, Tank, TheStash and Spangy, all of them within the United States. [See update below]</p>
<p>If these words do indeed turn out to be true, this latest development marks yet another event in a turbulent few months for EP1C, IMAGiNE, and associated sites and individuals.</p>
<p>In June this year, IMAGiNE published a warning on their site which declared that EP1C members had been banned and that anyone inviting them back would share their fate. It was claimed that DiGiTALiNK, EP1C&#8217;s founder, had &#8220;turned in one if not more of his members to the feds&#8221; and that a private FTP site of his was being watched by the authorities.</p>
<p>In the hugely political world of private trackers, claims like this are not unusual. In many file-sharing circles paranoia reigns supreme but, as they say, just because you&#8217;re paranoid it doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t out to get you.</p>
<p>When EP1C&#8217;s DiGiTALiNK delivered his response to IMAGiNE&#8217;s claims, the focus was on escalating the conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;They crossed paths with the wrong person, they lie, cheat, steal and have a fake identity to make people think they care about there [sic] safety, but in fact many of there [sic] source providers have been busted because they have no regard for your safety, only want the fame of that release,&#8221; the response began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within the next few releases I will be providing proof of all this to the public and including all there [sic] personal identification information.. haha if I was a snitch they would have already been busted. IMAGiNE, are [expletives removed].&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately some details related to the identity of one IMAGiNE member were released followed by the locations of others along with the words: &#8220;Get ready for a War.&#8221;</p>
<p>But those hoping to learn more from future EP1C revelations would be left disappointed. EP1C made their final releases on <a href="http://www.vcdq.com/browse/1/0/3_2/10_9_21_22_23_24_6_28_32_19_11_3_2/ep1c/2011/0/0/0/0/0">June 14th and 15th</a>, dates which to within a week coincided with the accusations made by IMAGiNE.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak pointed out the history of bad-blood between EP1C and IMAGiNE to DiGiTALiNK and asked if he had a comment. We also asked how he came by the more specific details of the alleged arrests. At the time of publication we&#8217;re yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>After making releases of high-profile movies every few days for the last few months, last week on September 9th IMAGiNE made their most recent release &#8211; The.Guard.2011.DVDSCR.XViD.AC3-IMAGiNE. Nothing has been heard from them since.</p>
<p>The group did not respond to correspondence sent to a secure account so only time will tell if this release turns out to be their last.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fresh sources confirm that four people were visited by ICE</p>

For Copyright Fraud and Abuse</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/warner.jpg" align="right" alt="warner" />Earlier this year five major Hollywood movie studios <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/hotfile-ordered-to-share-user-data-with-the-mpaa-110830/">sued</a> <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-largest-file-sharing-sites-110828/">the popular</a> file-hosting service Hotfile for several copyright-related offenses. The case is ongoing and two weeks ago the MPAA studios scored a victory when Hotfile was ordered to share detailed information on the site&#8217;s users and affiliates.</p>
<p>Hotfile, on the other hand, is fighting back hard <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/hotfile-to-sue-warner-bros-for-abuse-of-anti-piracy-tool-110726/">as expected</a>. Yesterday the company filed a counterclaim accusing movie studio Warner Bros. of fraud and abuse. According to the complaint, Warner systematically  misused the anti-piracy takedown tool (SRA) Hotfile had built for them.</p>
<p>Hotfile alleges that Warner has willingly taken down files without holding the copyrights, game demos and even open source software. The false takedowns continued even after the movie studio was repeatedly notified about the false claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only has Warner (along with four other major motion picture studios) filed this unfounded and contrived litigation against Hotfile employing overly aggressive tactics, Warner has made repeated, reckless and irresponsible misrepresentations to Hotfile falsely claiming to own copyrights in material from Hotfile.com.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse, Warner continued to make these misrepresentations even after Hotfile explicitly brought this rampant abuse to Warner’s attention, ruling out any possibility that its wrongful actions were accidental or unknowing,&#8221; Hotfile writes in its complaint.</p>
<p>Hotfile explains that Warner&#8217;s Special Rightsholder Account (SRA) is assigned to Michael Bentkover, Manager of Anti-Piracy Internet Operations at the movie studio. Hotfile developed this tool to allow rightsholders to remove an unlimited number of files, as long as they hold the rights to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time Warner used the SRA tool it expressly certified &#8216;under penalty of perjury that [it is] the owner or an authorized legal representative of the owner of copyrights&#8217; and it &#8216;has a good faith belief&#8217; that use of this material is not authorized by the copyright owner,&#8221; the complaint explains.</p>
<p>However, Warner also took down files that they didn&#8217;t own the rights to, and for many of these they never verified their nature by actually downloading the contents. This, while Warner specifically certified  “under penalty of perjury&#8221; that it was the rightful owner. In part, these errors seem to originate from an automatic script Warner used to find infringing content. </p>
<p>For example, while claiming to remove files that are copies of the movie The Box, Warner removed several files related to the alternative cancer treatment book  &#8220;Cancer: Out Of The Box,” by Ty M. Bollinger. Another title deleted by Warner was “The Box that Saved Britain,” a production of the BBC, not Warner.</p>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/hotfile1.jpg" align="right"  alt="hotfile" />Hotfile claims that hundreds of files were taken down wrongfully, including open source software.</p>
<p>&#8220;The single file deleted by Warner that had been most frequently downloaded by Hotfile users—five times more frequently than any other file—was a freeware software title wrongfully deleted by Warner. The software publisher that uploaded the file used Hotfile.com as a means for distribution of its open source software. Warner was not authorized by the software publisher to delete the file,&#8221; the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Hotfile has repeatedly notified Warner about this issues, but instead of improving the takedown system the number of fraudulent takedowns only increased.</p>
<p>Hotfile suspects that the overbroad takedowns were not only an attempt to prevent copyright infringement, but also a scheme to make profits. Warner proposed to Hotfile an affiliate deal where content that was taken down would be replaced with links to movie stores where users could buy Warner movies. More takedowns thus means more potential revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warner had an economic motive to make these misrepresentations. As noted above, in early 2010, Warner proposed a business arrangement with Hotfile whereby Warner sought to present ecommerce links to Hotfile users who might purchase a Warner file for Warner’s profit in place of links that Warner had deleted using its SRA.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By increasing the number of links it was taking down with Hotfile’s SRA, and indeed falsely inflating these numbers, Warner was increasing the number of times it could present ecommerce links to Hotfile’s users for its own enrichment,&#8221; Hotfile argues in the complaint.</p>
<p>Summing up, Hotfile accuses Warner on three counts. Violation of the DMCA, intentional interference with a contractual or business relationship and negligence.</p>
<p>To get to the bottom of the issues Hotfile demands a jury trial, and asks the court to compensate the company for the losses they&#8217;ve suffered,  including loss of accounts and goodwill. In addition, Hotfile seeks a permanent injunction requiring Warner to individually review all the files they take down.</p>
<p>Definitely a case that will be worth following.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Undeterred by a stream of negative PR from recent Wikileaks revelations, the anti-piracy lobby machine once again scored favorable headlines in Australia today. In its push to get ISPs onboard for a three-strikes system to warn copyright infringers, lobby group IPAF released a study that reveals how immensely effective this would be. However, the entire press release is a cheap marketing trick with mispresented research results that actually prove the opposite. <p>Source: <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lobby-misleads-aussie-press-for-three-strikes-campaign-110912/">Anti-Piracy Lobby Misleads Aussie Press for Three-Strikes Campaign</a></p>
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MPA(A) is trying to get a tight grip on piracy in Australia, mainly through affiliate groups such as AFACT. Recently published cables by Wikileaks <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/wikileaks-mpaa-secret-pusher-of-trial-against-aussie-isp-110830/">revealed</a> how Hollywood is secretly pushing their agenda down under.</p>
<p>After the <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tag/iinet/">failed attempt</a> at making ISP iiNet responsible for the copyright infringements of its file-sharing customers, the anti-piracy lobby groups are now once again calling for a three-strikes system. Today a new study surfaced which, on the surface, suggests that these warnings would be very effective as a deterrent.</p>
<p>&#8220;ISPs hold the key to reducing online movie and TV theft by 72%,&#8221; the headline of the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/64670756/Ipaf-Media-Release-12-9-11-Isps-Hold-the-Key-to-Reducing-Online-Movie-and-Tv-Theft-by-72">press release</a> reads. </p>
<p>The research in  question was commissioned by AFACT&#8217;s sister outfit the Intellectual Property Awareness Foundation (<a href="http://www.ipawareness.com.au/">IPAF</a>), which also lists the MPAA on its board. As we&#8217;ve <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/secrecy-and-darkness-surround-mysterious-900m-piracy-report-110314/">seen before</a>, the &#8220;independent&#8221; company that carried out the research has no web presence and no other known clients aside from IPAF. </p>
<p>Suspicious? Yes. But let&#8217;s skip that part for once and look at what the actual research results are. </p>
<p>As the headline suggests, the majority of the 1,644 participants indeed said they would stop downloading if they were notified by their ISP, 72 percent to be exact. This figure would be even higher (74%) should the ISP also threaten to terminate the Internet connection.</p>
<p>These numbers are nowhere near what we&#8217;ve seen in other surveys. A recent poll in France, where Internet users can actually lose their connection, revealed that <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/french-anti-piracy-law-doesnt-stop-pirates-110117/">only 4%</a> of the polled file-sharers said they stopped sourcing music from illegal services out of fear of detection. In the UK, a recent survey by an ISP revealed <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/isp-survey-three-strikes-wont-deter-pirates-110628/">similar results</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this percentage so high in Australia? The answer is easy, and shows how grossly manipulating the headline of the press release is.</p>
<p>Those who take the time to read the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/64670850/IPAF-2011-Research-Summary">actual results</a> will see that the 72 percent is based on all the people who were surveyed. This includes the people who have never even used file-sharing software, so for them this was merely a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>According to the report, 22 percent of the respondents said they used file-sharing software in 2011, and 16 percent of the total group used it at least once a month. This puts the effectiveness of the warnings in a totally different perspective. The numbers actually show how ineffective the warnings would be.</p>
<p><center><br />
<h5>Question asked to ALL, but only 22% use file-sharing software</h5>
<p><img src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/n1644.jpg" alt="misleading" /></center></p>
<p>If 72 percent say they would stop sharing after a warning, then 28 percent didn&#8217;t agree with this statement. And since only 22 percent of the people said they used file-sharing software in 2011 (the only people who would be affected by a three strikes system), this means that warnings from ISPs wouldn&#8217;t even deter people who aren&#8217;t the target of this system in the first place. </p>
<p>Or put differently, it could very well be that <strong>none of the 22 percent file-sharers indicated that they would stop doing so when notified by their ISP</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s an entirely different conclusion isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>It is unbelievable how the anti-piracy lobby has managed to spin such a negative outcome into a story that appears to support their call for a three strikes system. Perhaps even more worrying is the fact that many news outlets picked the story up without critically reviewing the results. </p>
<p>Luckily, not all Aussie journalists are buying it. A reporter from a large newspaper informed TorrentFreak that he is highly skeptical of everything released by these organizations now. Also, he pointed out how the press release was conveniently sent in advance to papers owned by News Corp. (Fox), which is a  partner of anti-piracy groups such as IPAF, DEAA and AFACT.</p>
<p>Whether IPAF and partners have made the right choice by releasing their study is doubtful though. They might fool some of the public, but the actual data shows that a three-strikes system may do nothing at all to deter people from sharing movies and music online.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/evan-stone.jpg" class="alignright" width="250" height="163" />Texas lawyer <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/confessions-of-a-bittorrent-pirate-chasing-lawyer-110422/">Evan Stone</a> is one of the more colorful characters in the U.S. file-sharing settlement sphere.</p>
<p>The self-described programmer, filmmaker and musician, who when speaking of his pirate-chasing lifestyle says “I was born to do this shit,&#8221;  is perhaps best known for his attacks on BitTorrent users sharing anime. But like many of his counterparts, Stone also dabbles in pornography.</p>
<p>Last year, Stone filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on behalf of Mick Haig Production, which targeted 670 BitTorrent users who <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/producer-sues-bittorrent-users-but-doesnt-own-copyright-100924/">allegedly shared</a> the movie Der Gute Onkel. Now his behavior in the case has drawn the ire of District Court Judge David C. Godbey.</p>
<p>Earlier, Judge Godbey had denied Stone&#8217;s request to start sending subpoenas to the ISPs. Stone had wanted to start straight away on matching his collected IP addresses with real-life identities. Instead, Judge Godbey ordered the ISPs to store the information for a later date and the EFF were brought in to represent the interests of, by definition, the as-yet unnamed &#8216;Does&#8217; in the suit.</p>
<p>But events had already taken a turn for the strange. Internet users started to receive letters from Stone requesting cash settlements, despite the fact that only their ISPs knew their identities and Stone had not yet been given permission to access the information.</p>
<p>Soon the situation became clear. According to the EFF, despite the Judge&#8217;s earlier refusal to allow the sending of subpoenas to ISPs, Stone had contacted them anyway. Without a court order, ISPs had been handing over information on their subscribers to Stone and he had been contacting them for cash settlements.</p>
<p>Then in January 2011, Stone and his client dismissed the entire case with prejudice, which brought it to a complete conclusion. Their justification was that there was no &#8220;meaningful opportunity to pursue justice in this matter&#8221; because there was &#8220;little chance of discovery in sight,&#8221; this, despite already receiving settlements.</p>
<p>The pair also took the opportunity to bemoan the EFF&#8217;s involvement in the case, describing them as a group &#8220;renowned for defending internet piracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In court papers dated last Friday, District Court Judge David C. Godbey is scathing of Stone&#8217;s conduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that the subpoenas imposed an undue burden on their targets fails to capture the gravity of Stone&#8217;s abdication of responsibility,&#8221; writes the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Stone obtained information that he had no right to receive, the subpoenas falsity transformed the access of the Does&#8217; information from a bona fide state-sanctioned inspection into private snooping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court appointed the Ad Litems [EFF and Public Citizen] to argue whether Stone could send the subpoenas. Stone argued that the Court should allow him to – even though he had already done so – and eventually dismissed the case ostensibly because the Court was taking too long to make a decision,&#8221; Judge Godbey continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the while, Stone was receiving identifying information and communicating with some Does, likely about settlement. The Court rarely has encountered a more textbook example of conduct deserving of sanctions.&#8221;</p>
<p> But for this clear and gross misconduct, the Judge fine Stone a mere $10,000. Texas lawyer Robert Cashman, who defends individuals targeted by file-sharing lawsuits, says he&#8217;s not impressed by the amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems like pennies to an attorney who is bringing in $2,500 per settlement at what he claims is a 45% settlement rate. Ten thousand dollars is merely the equivalent of FOUR settlements,&#8221; Cashman <a href="http://torrentlawyer.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/evan-stone-sanctions-mick-haig-torrent-case/">writes</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the hundreds of letters that went out, even if he is lying about the settlement rate, don’t you think he made at MANY TIMES that amount? Think about it. There is nothing punitive about this order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assume Evan Stone merely sent out 100 letters and had only a 20% success rate at $2,500 per settlement. This alone amounts to $50,000. The Mick Haig Productions case had *670* defendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, while $10,000 may be a lot to a starving attorney, my opinion is that the sanctions wouldn’t even cover the IRS’ federal income taxes Mick Haig Productions would pay on the settlements they received from this misstep,&#8221; Cashman concludes.</p>

<p>Thinking about what hurts and doesn&#8217;t hurt sales misses the point entirely. A corporation&#8217;s profits must never be at the center of policymaking, much less the center of determining what fundamental civil liberties we have as free citizens.</p>
<p>You remember Blackwater Security? The wet-jobs security firm that the US military hires for jobs abroad, jobs that violate the military&#8217;s own regulations to the moon and back?</p>
<p>When Blackwater Security was playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Libya">Grand Theft Auto</a> among civilians in Iraq in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, with which Iraq had nothing to do, how would you react if they had issued the following statement?</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Our profits are being hampered by the civilians&#8217; rights. It is not fair. In all fairness, we demand that torture should be allowed preemptively to find suspects or people that we find interesting, or because it can boost our profit. Also, we demand the right to detain civilians at will and indefinitely, because we could charge Uncle Sam for that too, boosting our profits even further.&#8221;</p>
<p>How would you react to that?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take another scenario from Blackwater in Iraq:</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Our profits are being hampered by the rights of the people. It is not fair. Our profits are falling. In all fairness, we demand the introduction of wanton censorship, allowing us to discover and prevent people from talking about subjects we don&#8217;t like. Also, we demand to hold messengers responsible to some amount of punishment we determine if they carry sealed letters containing something we don&#8217;t like. That way, our profits could perhaps be restored to their former glory. After all, it&#8217;s only fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would this demand from Blackwater Security in Iraq perhaps seem reasonable? They&#8217;re asking for the dismantlement of rights on the same level as the right to not be tortured, not to be detained without due cause, and similar rights.</p>
<p>Well, this is exactly what the copyright industry is <a href="http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/pipa_letter/">demanding</a>. <strong>Exactly this.</strong></p>
<p>The rational emotional reaction to this is an immediate desire to personally kick the living shit out of these pretentious bastards. After proper impulse control has been applied to this desire, the proper official poker-faced response &#8212; if any &#8212; is that the world owes them nothing, preferably coupled with sharp reductions in existing monopoly privileges.</p>
<p>If somebody had written a dystopic novel in the 1980s illustrating how some subjects had been forbidden, and if you would speak about them on the phone, a voice would pop in and say, &#8220;You have mentioned a forbidden subject. This has been noted. Please refrain from discussing forbidden subjects&#8221; &#8212; if somebody had written this, people would have dismissed it out of hand as being too dystopic, too unrealistic. This could never possibly happen, people would have said, shaking their heads. </p>
<p>Try posting a link to a torrent on The Pirate Bay on your wall on Facebook and see what happens. People in the 1980s would have been horrified, people on both sides of the Iron Curtain. All in the name of protecting profits for a cartelized industry with monopoly benefits.</p>
<p><strong>The job of any entrepreneur is to construct a use case and a business case that allow them to make money, given the current constraints of society and technology. They do not get to dismantle civil liberties, even if they can&#8217;t make money otherwise</strong>. That goes for Blackwater Security as well as the copyright industry as well as every other entrepreneur on the planet.</p>
<p>When our parents sent a letter in the mail, nobody was allowed to open it to check if it contained a copied poem, which would infringe on the copyright monopoly. When our parents sent a letter in the mail, they and they alone determined if they identified themselves as sender on the outside of the envelope, inside the envelope, or not at all. When our parents sent a letter in the mail, the mailman was never held responsible for the contents of that letter, regardless of if the contents infringed a particular copyright monopoly or were even downright illegal.</p>
<p><strong>It is entirely reasonable to demand sternly that our children have the same rights as our parents and grandparents had.</strong> A particular corporation&#8217;s profitability does not factor into it.</p>
