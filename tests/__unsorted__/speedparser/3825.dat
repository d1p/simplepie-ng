This one is from Pokki. You have until November 15th to submit your HTML5 app and have it approved for posting on their app store. Pokki is a desktop app platform that combines an interface, a development framework and an app store together into one package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams of up to three developers can band together. Apps will be scored on utility, appearance, user experience, and quality. There are three prize purses: first place wins $30,000, second wins $13,000 and third wins $7,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the details, the judging panel, sample Pokki apps &lt;a href="http://www.pokki.com/contest/"&gt;and other information here&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;

         <title>OpenStack Leader: Open Source Needs to Rethink Its Priorities</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Josh McKenty, Piston Cloud (150 sq).jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/Josh%20McKenty%2C%20Piston%20Cloud%20%28150%20sq%29.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;Philosophically, the open source concept borrows some selected elements from socialism.  It upholds a notion of the "common good," it eschews the appearance of authority or hierarchy, and it often frowns upon capitalizing on one's own work, insofar as being exclusive.  In practice, however, open source projects may look less like Big Brother from &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; and more like Big Brother from reality TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua McKenty's still-young career is, compared to those of other capitalist executives, surprisingly replete.  He's led development teams for the Netscape browser, and is intimately familiar with Netscape's successors at Mozilla.  His next stroke of luck was with the space program, helping to create and then lead one of the world's most successful cloud computing projects, NASA Nebula.  His work with NASA spawned the open source community's most successful - and perhaps most important - project in the last few years, the &lt;a href="http://openstack.org"&gt;OpenStack cloud operating system&lt;/a&gt; - and he sits on that project's governing body.  In-between jobs, he just happened to pioneer &lt;a href="http://secondmuse.com/portfolio/view/GEM/"&gt;an earthquake modeling system for the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What McKenty's learned from a life that may not be one-third of the way over yet, are the lessons you'd expect to tell your grandkids.  &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/09/the-dream-of-openstack-in-a-co.php"&gt;Now he's the CEO of Piston Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, the first commercial vendor dedicated to OpenStack.  Already, he has a boatload of life lessons for the open source development community at large, and he's not about to wait for grandkids to come along to start sharing them.  With a notable degree of eagerness and enthusiasm, Josh McKenty shared his insights with RWW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Open source vs. customer focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKenty's story begins with Netscape.  His time there began with the somewhat confused period late in the company's existence as a division of AOL.  Immediately he learned that "open" comes in many shades and colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calls the late period of Netscape 8 and 9 "probably the most complicated and nuanced open source environment you can imagine.  Netscape was released as the Mozilla code base, and so everyone thinks of Firefox being to the benefit of Netscape.  But &lt;a href="http://mpl.mozilla.org/scope/tri-license-and-the-gpl/"&gt;the code is a tri-license&lt;/a&gt; that allows Netscape to close it and develop it for proprietary [purposes] afterwards.  Then you have the fact that Firefox, which everybody thinks of as being a Mozilla project, was actually a fork of Mozilla by a sole individual that Mozilla then reverse-forked back into their organization and turned into a $300 million-per-year business, which they did not share."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's ownership and licensing schemes such as this, McKenty says, that make personal politics more prominent in open source projects than philosophies and governance models.  He believes one of the Google Chrome project's greatest strengths comes from the insistence by the Chromium development team - to which Google appears to be adhering - that the code base remain "fully open-sourced, in the open."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at about this time when Mozilla began mitigating what the community described as "the tooltip bug" (typically with an amalgam of punctuation attached), and what the organization officially recorded as dozens of related bugs (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218223"&gt;just one culmination was recorded here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a bug that was recorded and watched and re-reported and duplicated 460 times over 7 years," McKenty relates.  "And the response from the Mozilla developer community was always the same:  'If you really cared, you would learn how to code and fix it yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="super-pullquote"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are an open source company, and every open source company lives or dies by their ability to balance their interaction with the community with their interaction with their customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:8px"&gt;Joshua McKenty&lt;br /&gt;CEO, Piston Cloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It has always been the worst part of many open source projects, but I think Mozilla's more guilty of it than anyone else: the attitude that the developers tend to develop over time that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the important users of the product," the &lt;a href="http://www.pistoncloud.com/"&gt;Piston Cloud&lt;/a&gt; CEO continues.  "And this has never really been true.  That's what's interesting about most open source software:  The developers who are really deeply engaged in building it may have started out solving their own pain.  But if they're really successful, there are usually two or three orders of magnitude more people using it than actually building it.  So the disconnect between what it is and what it needs to become, gets larger and larger.  This is why the open source projects that really survive in the long term figure out how to build that bridge back to the end user's requirements.  And those are often commercial entities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stage fright&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Netscape, McKenty went on to be a software architect and business developer for Flock, Inc., whose product was a socially-oriented Web browser built on the Mozilla code base.  While there, he tells us, "we would hire new developers turn them loose, and say, 'Every commit that you make is going to be looked at by other people in the world.'  That's a terrifying experience, especially if you're a young coder or you're new to the code base... It has nothing to do with the philosophy of open source.  It has to do with a sense of embarrassment or nervousness to have your daily commits be scrutinized by folks that maybe you think of as being more experienced than you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKenty points to the very project he oversees now - OpenStack - as one example where important components are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; produced in the open: for example, support for IPv6 contributed by NTT Data of Japan.  "[Of] the 260-odd folks who are actively contributing code, as opposed to design features or documentation or localization or whatever else... about a third of them are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; building in the open.  They all &lt;i&gt;design&lt;/i&gt; in the open; that's the community requirement.  But then they go home and they code for a couple of months until they have something that they can show, and then they make a big code drop, and then we attack it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Next page: To space and beyond...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To space and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the earliest Mercury astronauts credit their good fortune with having been at the right place at the right time.  By virtue of being teamed with just the right group of consultants in 2009, Joshua McKenty found himself as a lead architect on a project launched at NASA.  &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/from_a_basement_to_the_stars_how_the_openstack_clo.php"&gt;Called Nebula&lt;/a&gt;, it was America's most significant government-funded computer research facility since the heyday of the supercomputer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, McKenty worked with a firm called Anso Labs.  He soon learned that doing any kind of government project involved a separation of what you see in reality from what's on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Josh McKenty, Piston Cloud (Chicago garb).jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/Josh%20McKenty%2C%20Piston%20Cloud%20%28Chicago%20garb%29.jpg" width="245" height="245" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /&gt;"Despite whatever retrospective history has been applied to it, [Anso] was simply, at the time, a maneuver to deal with NASA internal politics around contracting," McKenty tells RWW.  "The Nebula Project itself was built inside a larger IT contract that employs a couple of hundred people, and we were two or three subcontractors down from NASA proper at the time.  So we were just trying to guarantee that we could keep our developer team together working on Nebula, while NASA went through a re-compete on the contract."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anso made it possible for Nebula to continue for as long as it did, keeping the project open and sharing its benefits with other developers through OpenStack.  But that was only for so long.  Eventually Nebula was de-funded, and the operation was folded back into NASA's existing supercomputing projects.  There, McKenty says, outright opponents to cloud computing have taken full advantage of the opportunity to do next to nothing with Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="super-pullquote"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo; It has always been the worst part of many open source projects, but I think Mozilla's more guilty of it than anyone else: the attitude that the developers tend to develop over time that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the important users of the product.  And this has never really been true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:8px"&gt;Joshua McKenty&lt;br /&gt;CEO, Piston Cloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Anso Labs was acquired by cloud service provider RackSpace.  While some sources &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/10/rackspace_buys_openstack_partner/"&gt;played the acquisition as though it were a conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, McKenty tells us that RackSpace's motives are purely genuine: to see OpenStack succeed, and to continue what their own people, essentially, started.&lt;br /&gt;
"I think what Rackspace has done with the contribution of Swift to OpenStack is really unprecedented in their market segment," says Piston Cloud CEO Joshua McKenty.  "But RackSpace does not want to be a software company, and they don't really even want to be an open source software company.  They want to be a fanatical support company; that's who they are, that's their DNA.  Now they have this core open source project... around which they can provide their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But to my mind, OpenStack isn't finished," he continues.  "We haven't finished changing the world yet, and I wanted to stay focused on building out OpenStack to what it really needs to be."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spinout from the Nebula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of McKenty's personal best friends went with Anso to RackSpace, he stayed out to pursue his own dream.  Exactly what that was hadn't quite formed yet, even as late as the fall of 2010.  He took a six-month sabbatical, during which he found time for that little earthquake modeling project for the World Bank.  He joined a working group on the role of governments and organizations in building technology infrastructure, along with a handful of friends and associates - Vint Cerf, Sergey Brin, and Vivek Kundra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"None of those environments actually gave me the same opportunity to understand the requirements that I've gotten out of being the CEO of a startup," McKenty tells us.  "The reason to be Piston Cloud right now - aside from the fact that it's going to be the best business ever - [is] to be in the room with the people who are going to use the product, and actually talk to them about what they need.  It's very hard to get in the room with the folks who will be most impacted by the technology without being a vendor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Thumbnail image for Thumbnail image for Thumbnail image for OpenStack logo" src="http://rww.readwriteweb.netdna-cdn.com/cloud/assets_c/2011/03/openstack_logo_0111-thumb-150x150-26160-thumb-150x150-27180-thumb-150x150-28472.png" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" width="150" height="150"&gt;Despite the most honest and thoughtful community outreach, says McKenty, a non-commercial or semi-commercial open source project simply does not garner the level of confidence from its customers that a commercial project does.  Almost immediately upon building Piston Cloud, McKenty found himself in direct communication with existing OpenStack users who had never been in contact with anyone representing OpenStack in the past.  Being a CEO makes one more accessible than being a committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example:  A disaster risk reduction facility is headquartered in Indonesia, but has OpenStack-based cloud services in Australia and customers in Australia.  It wanted to expand its cloud to Jakarta, and needed Piston Cloud's help.  It's the type of customer contact Anso Labs would have only dreamed about, and now it's coming directly to the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nobody in the OpenStack community even knew that the Australian government was evaluating it, let alone had pushed it into production," remarks McKenty.  "In one phone call from an inbound request, I ended up on the phone with the folks in Australia who had been operating OpenStack at scale, and was able to talk to them about &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what their needs were, and what they wanted to see in the next release.  And there was no way they were going to make it to Boston in person to talk about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The property of being a vendor, and the property of being in the press, as odd as that sounds, gives us this amazing opportunity to really understand what people need," he continues.  "The commercial side of this has an amazingly crystalizing effect on people's priorities of what they want built.  We are an open source company, and every open source company lives or dies by their ability to balance their interaction with the community with their interaction with their customers...  Can we present ourselves in ways that are understandable to those two different communities without ever becoming two-faced, or engaging in a dichotomy?  It has to be, honestly, &lt;i&gt;this is who we are&lt;/i&gt;, in all cases."&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hack Your Help Files</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mindtouch-logo150.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/mindtouch-logo150.png" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;You probably have lurking around your company a collection of moldy compiled HTML files, left over from another era when those were the cat's meow and the latest and greatest in online help technology. Well, this week &lt;a href="http://mindtouch.com"&gt;Mindtouch&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to help you convert them  over into a more social setting and bring those dusty help files into something that can be more useful today. I am talking about help files that were designed by Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe RoboHelp, XMetal and several Microsoft products too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company offers a SaaS-hosted help system called TCS that starts at $180 a month and goes up from there. Included is a new feature with the ability to do the compiled HTML conversions and import into TCS. Hierarchies, cross-link references, image and page formats are all maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When brought into TCS, they are searchable, indexed, and a Web-based knowledge base that instantly gives you the ability to do analytics on their content.  Think of this as instant liberation for your legacy help desk software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this isn't all that sexy, it is a very utilitarian function and something worth investigating. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A New Hub to Generate Income for App Developers </title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sponsoredpost_intel093011.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/sponsoredpost_intel093011.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;While your app might have started out as a cool side project you created for your friends, the feedback has been great. Why not use your app development talents to bring in some additional income? That's the idea behind the Intel AppUpSM developer program, which provides developers with tools and resources to create and sell their apps across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style="float: left; width: 150px;"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://thirdparty.fmpub.net/placement/437266?fleur_de_sel=[timestamp]"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div style="float:left; width: 445px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://altfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/12124-135312-15250-11?mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]"&gt;Intel AppUp Developer Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Now you've got a way to market your app beyond just your blog or word of mouth. Another option is to earn some ad revenue, by integrating advertising into your app. Intel AppUp(SM), in collaboration with Mocean Mobile, gives developers the ability to incorporate in-app mobile advertising, and will keep track of the revenue stream. In other words, even if you intend to offer your app for free, you can still earn money for all of your hard work through mobile advertising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also makes Intel AppUp appealing is its user-friendly set up. Simply download the SKD from the program Component Catalog, and register with Mocean Mobile. From there, choose from over 50 ad networks to find ones that fit best with your customers. Once you're all set up, all you have to do is login to your dashboard to track performance, revenue, click-through, and demographic information of your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to start earning some money for your app? Head to &lt;a href="http://altfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/12124-135312-15250-11?mpt=%5bCACHEBUSTER%5d"&gt;Intel AppUp&lt;/a&gt; to join the developer program and submit your application for the app store. &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sencha Likes IE10: A Native Apps Library for JS is Coming</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sencha (150 sq).png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/Sencha%20%28150%20sq%29.png" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;The big question among Web developers has been whether browser and platform makers are simply leveraging HTML5 as an open-ended means to a closed end: specifically, as a standard language for producing native apps for multiple platforms, as opposed to a single, cross-platform app that plays for all.  That question may very soon be rendered moot if and when the leading producers of JavaScript libraries render native-looking content using cross-platform code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day may be drawing very close.  Last week, Michael Mullany, the CEO of Sencha - whose Ext JS library renders spectacular content on multiple browsers regardless of platform - gave an early nod of approval to Internet Explorer 10, the HTML5 rendering engine for Microsoft's forthcoming Windows 8.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Simply put, (and with the caveat that we were running on the notably overpowered developer preview hardware) the IE10 HTML5 experience is one of the best we've seen on any platform to date.  After a decade of Web neglect, Microsoft is back with a vengeance," Mullany wrote for his company blog.  Listing the various HTML5 components IE10 will support, he added, "Remarkably, particularly for developers trained to look out for Microsoft platform tie-ins, there are none on this list.  Microsoft simply implemented the draft standards with no extensions or gotchas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the forthcoming &lt;a href="http://www.sencha.com/company/events/senchacon-2011/"&gt;SenchaCon conference in Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt; in late October, Sencha is expected to unveil (or have already unveiled) the first public beta of its &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/09/sencha-updates-html5-framework.php"&gt;Sencha Touch 2 JavaScript library&lt;/a&gt;.  Its purpose will be to present a normalized set of tablet-oriented functions, enabling the same apps to play on iOS and Android platforms.  It's a touch-sensitive version of Ext JS, which normalizes the processes of event handling and layouts, and fills in some of the gaps between what HTML5 is expected to support and what these platforms actually do support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That public beta was expected to go live sometime this week, but was postponed.  We've known for some time Sencha is working toward Windows Phone 7 support.  Could the development team be planning an early experimental round of support for the Windows 8 Developers' Preview as well, and could that be behind the delay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RWW put that question to Sencha's senior director for product management, Aditya Banson, who gave us this response:  "We're excited about Microsoft's focus on HTML5 and touch-based interfaces.  We'll be adding support for Windows 8 in the future as a part of our roadmap.  In the nearer term, we'll be adding support for Windows Phone 7 in the Sencha Touch 2.x family of products, and then Windows 8 at an appropriate time in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banson's careful distinction between version 2.x and Windows 8 support points to the likelihood of Windows 8 being supported in version 3.  Since Touch 2 also promises native app packaging - the ability for a cross-platform app to be distributed on native app stores like iTunes App Store and Android Market - outright Windows 8 support will have to wait for Microsoft to construct both the operations and the polices around its Windows 8 distribution outlet, currently called just "Store."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, the probability is now great that a plug-in-free JavaScript library will enable a class of mobile apps that can run on multiple mobile platforms as native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engine Yard Adds JRuby, Heroku Adds Python and Django</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jruby.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/jruby.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;There must be something in the air. &lt;a href="http://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.engineyard.com/"&gt;Engine Yard&lt;/a&gt; are beefing up their platforms today. Engine Yard put &lt;a href="http://www.engineyard.com/company/press/2011-09-28-engine-yard-announces-general-availability-of-jruby-on-engine-yard-cloud"&gt;JRuby into general availability&lt;/a&gt; today after &lt;a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/engine-yard-adds-jruby-support/"&gt;several months in testing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.jruby.org/2011/09/bringing-jruby-to-the-cloud/"&gt;years of development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be left out, Heroku expanded its service to add &lt;a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/"&gt;Python and Django&lt;/a&gt; as part of its "&lt;a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/"&gt;polyglot platform&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What About Focus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar, Heroku and Engine Yard offer Platforms as a Service (PaaS). Engine Yard started off focusing on Ruby on Rails, but recently &lt;a href="http://www.engineyard.com/company/press/2011-08-23-engine-yard-joins-forces-with-orchestra"&gt;acquired Orchestra and added PHP support&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/09/coming-soon-to-engine-yard-mon.php"&gt;announced support for MongoDB and PostgreSQL 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku started as a PaaS for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_(web_server_interface)"&gt;Rack&lt;/a&gt; compatible projects, but has added support for Java, Clojure, and Node.js applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the picture? Heroku and Engine Yard started with a pretty sharp focus on one area, and have been expanding pretty steadily as they've grown. As they expand, you have to wonder if it will dilute their focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku founder Adam Wiggins says no. "Heroku is a true polyglot platform. Our general-purpose runtime is completely language-agonistic. Support for each new language is a very thin adapter that invokes the build process specific to that language's tool chain.  This makes it trivially easy to add new languages (which is how we've been able to roll out five new languages in the last two months, with many more coming) without diluting our single, unified platform."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Piech, vice president of product management and marketing for Engine Yard says that while the company is expanding its scope, it's keeping its focus on expertise. "Deep expertise in building a world-class platform as a service, deep expertise in helping developers use the platform, and deep expertise in the platform stack &amp;ndash; initially Ruby, and now including PHP. Much of our platform orchestration technology is stack agnostic. The stacks we choose to support are ones where there is significant market opportunity and where we provide compelling value that is substantively backed by deep expertise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days of the single-language/single-focus PaaS seem to be drawing to a close, though. If you look at Heroku, Engine Yard and Red Hat's up-and-coming &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/08/red-hat-expands-openshift-plat.php"&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, it's all about providing a huge toolset. Is this a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Look at Phabricator: Facebook's Web-Based Open Source Code Collaboration Tool</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="phabricator.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/phabricator.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;It's been out for a while, but hasn't gotten a lot of attention. Facebook &lt;a href="http://phabricator.org/"&gt;released Phabricator&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer, an open source collaboration tool for development teams. It's an early release, but already in use by more than 500 engineers at Facebook for normal review, development and sharing of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of Phabricator is spearheaded by Facebook's Evan Priestley and is being done on (where else?) &lt;a href="http://phabricator.org/"&gt;the Phabricator.org&lt;/a&gt; Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Phabricator?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phabricator is Facebook's in-house suite of Web applications for its engineers to write, review and share source code. It includes workflow tools, utilities and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Phabricator does go beyond the Web with a set of command-line tools called &lt;a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Arcanist_User_Guide.html"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;. Developers can use it to run unit tests, merge changes, check for syntax errors in code and even extend Arcanist to add new commands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the noteworthy components in Phabricator include Maniphest, Herald and Diffusion. Maniphest is a take on bug tracking that might be a bit more user friendly than entrenched open source tools like Bugzilla. &lt;a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Herald_User_Guide.html"&gt;Herald&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that allows developers to create filters to notify them when objects are created or updated. For example, if you want to be notified of revisions even if you're not on the CC list. Diffusion is Phabricator's repository browser for exploring Git and SVN repositories, and it may be adding Mercurial support in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="phabricator-tasks-1.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/phabricator-tasks-1.jpg" width="600" height="397" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that's interesting, however, is that Phabricator has no real-time chat features at all. Instead, developers are directed to IRC to discuss issues with Phabricator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phabricator is self-hosting, so if you want to jump into Phabricator development you can just log into Phabricator.org with a GitHub or Facebook account. This also lets interested developers get a look at Phabricator without actually having to install it themselves. But if you really want to dig in and host your own, &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/phabricator"&gt;it's on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; now. It is in an early release state, however. Phabricator is under the Apache 2.0 license, so companies should be able to use it for nearly any project without much worry over licensing issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="changes-phabricator.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/changes-phabricator.jpg" width="600" height="357" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question on my mind about Phabricator is &lt;em&gt;where is it going?&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Roadmap_and_Status.html"&gt;roadmap and status&lt;/a&gt; document on Phabricator.org tries to answer that. According to the roadmap, the current focus is feature buildout. This includes things like adding support for Mercurial, and improving Maniphest, Phriction and Projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farther out, there's consideration for building importers to grab information out of other bug trackers and code review tools. While it could make adoption of Phabricator easier, it also could be "a massive timesuck." Why is lowering the barrier to adoption easier? There's some consideration of Phabricator's mission in the roadmap &amp;ndash; and whether Facebook might eventually want to develop a revenue model around it. There's not a long-term vision for Phabricator yet, beyond improving the tool, but don't be surprised if you start hearing a lot more about it as it matures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3scale Expands its API Manager Offerings</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3scalelogo.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/3scalelogo.png" width="150" height="130" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;This week &lt;a href="http://www.3scale.net/"&gt;3scale &lt;/a&gt;is increasing the breath of its services by adding three collections of APIs that it can handle with its API management platform.  Until 3scale, companies needed to put their API infrastructure as a proxy layer in front of their CDNs, slowing if not completely disrupting the API provider quality of service, architecture and business model. The three collections include user management APIs for portals and integration with CRM services, billing APIs, and analytics for push and pull data analysis. These add to their existing traffic management APIs that have been used by &lt;a href="http://developer.skype.com"&gt;Skype &lt;/a&gt; for nearly two years and other customers include Softonic and FullContact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/3scale%20apis.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="3scale apis.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/assets_c/2011/09/3scale apis-thumb-610x481-33980.png" width="610" height="481" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The company offers two different versions of its services. Free Connect can handle up to 10 million calls per day. There is also an enterprise paid version available for larger volumes and automatic failover and premium 24/7 customer support. Pricing starts at $2,500 per month and increases with volume.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/08/the-new-api-movement-may.php"&gt;Here is an article that we wrote last year about common API management mistakes&lt;/a&gt;. They compete with Mashery and others to have policies and rules for handling APIs. But you lose cost and controls. 3Scale has APIs for managing your APIs, as it were. If you have large data volumes you can manage this without having all the data flowing through 3Scale's Web site, you can direct these calls to an appropriate infrastructure and scale it up as needed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.3scale.net/products/connect-vs-enterprise/"&gt;Documentation on the new services can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Microsoft Makes the Case for More jQuery, Fewer Dependencies</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jQuery logo 150x150" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/images/jquery_logo_1210.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;In a Best Practices online advisory to browser-based Web site developers published last week, Microsoft paints a compelling picture for favoring JavaScript libraries - especially jQuery - for rendering client-side UI, over the use of plug-ins.  If Microsoft is to score a blow against Adobe Flash, it has to strike at plug-ins' very reason for existence, arguing that jQuery is faster, easier, cheaper, and prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's patterns and practices team had been advocating the use of its Silverlight plug-in for composite applications since 2008, with a project it calls Prism.  That project remains ongoing, though the emphasis in recent months has shifted to Project Silk, which focuses on what the company describes as "building cross-browser Web applications with a focus on client-side interactivity.  These applications take advantage of the latest Web standards, including HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript 5, along with modern Web technologies such as jQuery, Windows Internet Explorer 9, and ASP.NET MVC3."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's support for jQuery &lt;a href="http://betanews.com/2008/09/30/new-microsoft-support-for-jquery-makes-part-of-its-platform-open-source/"&gt;began three years ago, almost to the day&lt;/a&gt;, certainly in earnest though overlapping considerably with the company's Silverlight plug-in project.  While Microsoft isn't abandoning Silverlight outright (it touted the forthcoming version 5 just last April), &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/09/build-2011-microsofts-scott-gu.php"&gt;it is certainly de-emphasizing its own plug-in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer in Microsoft's forums, the company has responded to developers' inquiries about the relative precedence of Silk over Prism by assuring Silverlight developers that there remains a place for Silverlight in line-of-business applications - programs deployed in-house for employees and knowledge workers, rather than public-facing Web sites.  But that was before the Build conference two weeks ago, when the spotlight for Silverlight was pretty much turned off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two project teams share many of the same members, and thus are not in competition with one another.  But in recent days, the two projects have been sharing more than common members, but &lt;i&gt;language&lt;/i&gt; as well.  For example, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648465.aspx"&gt;a November 2010 description of the "composite application"&lt;/a&gt; in the context of Prism, which does involve Silverlight, reads as follows:  "Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but which can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application.  These types of applications are known as composite applications."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of modularization has come to define the composite application in much of Microsoft's training.  But now, take a close look at this sample from the latest "drop" of the Silk developers' model app:  "Within a browser-based application, a module can add or remove user interface (UI) elements, add or enhance functionality (or behavior) already available in the UI, or enhance the user experience (UX).  Modules can be built independently of one another but still communicate with each other in a loosely coupled fashion.  Modular applications can make it easier for you to develop, test, deploy, and extend your application.  Modular designs also have well-understood benefits that help you unit test your applications and make them easier to maintain over time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silk project team is suggesting that many of the same goals previously attributed to Prism are attainable using JavaScript and libraries such as jQuery, through Silk best practices.  One independent developer who definitely perceives this trend is Poland-based &lt;a href="http://bartekszafko.pl/2011/07/19/project-silk-subjective-review-part-1/"&gt;Bartek Szafko, who wrote last July&lt;/a&gt;, "When you look side by side on new Win8 shots and silk they look quite similar.  I believe Silk guidance will be to Windows 8 just like Prism was to WPF and Silverlight."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="height:288px;width:512px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Project-Silk-Mileage-Stats-Application/player?w=512&amp;h=288" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September drop of Silk features the latest update to the project team's model app, originally called "Mileage Stats" but which has evolved into an interactive (or, judging from this video, &lt;i&gt;overactive&lt;/i&gt;) monitor of all monetary investments in one's vehicle.  The idea here is to show how a modular app can generate statistics and update only the statistics that have changed, or only the changes the user has directly requested, without reloading the entire page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt="110926 Mileage Stats app test.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110926%20Mileage%20Stats%20app%20test.png" width="600" height="572" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silk documentation refers to a certain word you'll be hearing a lot from Microsoft in the coming years.  Referring to the division of on-screen components into widgets as shown in the above figure, the documentation reads:  "Mileage Stats uses the &lt;b&gt;tile&lt;/b&gt; widget to animate the position of all boxes horizontally and vertically, because both the vehicle boxes and the &lt;b&gt;Add Vehicle&lt;/b&gt; box need that behavior.  The vehicle widget expands and collapses the vehicle boxes, because only they need that behavior."&lt;br /&gt;
Modularization in the Silk model is accomplished through a concept that the original HTML frame elements tried to achieve, but couldn't: subdividing the screen into regions that can not only be addressed independently, but shifted and resized when necessary without disturbing their contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="110926 jQuery widget screenshot.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110926%20jQuery%20widget%20screenshot.png" width="610" height="479" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simpler example of modularization for cross-browser apps from the Silk project (which may be more familiar to jQuery veterans), is this example of a jQuery function that's wrapped around a set of elements bunched together from HTML.  In this case, those elements are keywords from a paragraph tagged with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPAN&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with each element given the name &lt;code&gt;data-tag&lt;/code&gt;.  A function, triggered whenever the mouse points to one of these tagged spans, looks up the contents of the span on the Delicious Web site, and posts the textual results of that search in an infobox.  The jQuery function which does the wrapping appears below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; (function ($) {&lt;br /&gt;
  $('body').infobox({&lt;br /&gt;
    dataUrl: 'http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/json/popular/'&lt;br /&gt;
  });&lt;br /&gt;
  $('span[data-tag]').tagger();&lt;br /&gt;
} (jQuery));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function attaches the infobox directly to the span.  Although that infobox has no instructions for its own appearance in this function, it's given a place in the DOM by the creation function for the infobox element, which in jQuery is called &lt;code&gt;_create&lt;/code&gt;.  The principle demonstrated here is &lt;i&gt;dynamic tagging&lt;/i&gt;.  Here, not only can the destinations of &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; hyperlinks be updated and made more relevant, but the events that are generated as a result of pointing to the tagged span, and the appearance of the box or other gadget displayed on mouse over, are generated entirely on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing has been happening with jQuery-endowed Web pages for the last handful of years, though perhaps not all Web users are appreciating the breadth of the architectural changes embodied here.  If you're wondering, what Microsoft technologies does Silk specifically promote, the answer is server-side ASP.NET MVC, whose latest versions make liberal use of jQuery.  The Silk philosophy is a relatively new one for Microsoft: an ideal that the purpose for promoting Microsoft-brand technologies on the server side does not have to be the subsequent promotion of Microsoft technology on the client side.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>"Testing" Your Code With Myers-Briggs </title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MyersBriggs150.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/MyersBriggs150.png" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;Many of you are familiar with the Myers-Briggs personality tests. The tests grew out of personality theories first formulated by psychoanalyst Carl Jung and are used by human resources people to predict group behavior and team composition. But what if we could give similar tests to our programming and network operations, to figure out ahead of time how to match up our personality with our code? The more you think about this idea, the less far-out it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual Myers-Briggs test consists of a series of questions. There are various versions, ranging from the &lt;a href="http://www.keirsey.com"&gt;traditional one offered here&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="http://www.haleonline.com/psychtest/"&gt;shorter four-question test here&lt;/a&gt;.   Chances are you already know your own personality type, but my thought is that if you are going to be truly happy in your position, you need to know if you are a match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have come up with my own short four-question quiz that will help you figure this out. Answer the following about your network, keeping track of the initial letter that best describes your situation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What influences your network and development operations: internal users' actions (I) or external events and upper management (E)? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you manage problems when they occur with your code: with tools and carefully scripted techniques (S) or with scrums and agile methods (N)?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you purchase your IT and development products: thinking through the implications and a rigid set of standards (T) or laissez-faire attitude and by letting users buy pretty much what they want (F)?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your IT department have rigid mobile device management purchasing policies (J) or are they more flexibly and allow bring your own devices to work (P)?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All right, now you can assemble your shop's "personality type" into one of the 16 different combinations of the four letters. (See below.) Ideally, your personality and that of your shop should match on all four metrics. If not, then you might consider finding another company or another job within the company that will more closely match your personality. Alternatively, you might consider ways you can alter your shop's personality to bring it more closely in line with your own. &lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_07ZCTLt21Co/S38XTNOv9hI/AAAAAAAAEDc/HCb7pgT_psg/s400/MBChart.gif" class="mt-image-none" style="" &gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's consider two possibilities. &lt;b&gt;INFP shops pretty much are organic, reactive kinds of things&lt;/b&gt;. Your network and production code never seems to be in a finished state, and crises happen pretty much on a daily basis. Since users rule and buy pretty much anything they want, you can't ever predict what each day will bring. You never really get out of fire-fighting mode to be able to do some planning, but that is okay if you are the similar personality type and enjoy this more intuitive approach to your job. INFP shops are usually found in high-growth companies, such as dot-coms, where every day is a chaotic blend of new hires, departmental moves and staff changes, and new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ESTJ shops are the exact opposite: users here have little say in things&lt;/b&gt;, and if a piece of gear isn't on your approved list, it doesn't get purchased, plain and simple. Every day is structured programming and pretty much predictable, and your code drops run according to a fixed schedule and rarely vary. ESTJ shops are usually found in more traditional centralized IT businesses, such as financial services and government, with long-range budget cycles and careful attention paid to staffing and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you can come up with characteristics for the other network personalities as well, but I given that I am an ISTJ, I am out of the time I planned for writing this article. Good luck typing your shop, unless you are an ESFP and don't enjoy doing these sorts of things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Microsoft's Non-Response to the Secure Boot Problem</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="win8.jpeg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/win8.jpeg" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx"&gt;put up a post about secure boot&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/09/windows-8-spells-trouble-for-l.php"&gt;concerns about its effects on Linux and other operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has provided a very detailed explanation of what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface"&gt;UEFI secure boot&lt;/a&gt; is, and what its benefits are. What Microsoft &lt;em&gt;hasn't&lt;/em&gt; done is to actually respond to concerns raised by Matthew Garrett about its secure boot policies. In short, while Microsoft is requiring secure boot to be enabled, its policies &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; require that users be able to turn the feature off. As Garrett says, "end user is no longer in control of their PC."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's post is fairly lengthy and most of it is spent discussing the actual nuts and bolts of the secure boot features. I've included a few of the diagrams from the post to show how it works, but you should go read it. As a layperson's overview of UEFI secure boot, it's great. As an actual response to the issues that Garrett has raised? It almost completely avoids the topic, and certainly does little to address the issue. &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft, through its PR firm, has also declined to comment citing the fact that Windows 8 is still in pre-beta.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="osloaderdiagram.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/osloaderdiagram.jpg" width="576" height="187" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue at hand is this: Will users and businesses have control over their PCs? The answer is a firm &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;if OEMs choose to support it&lt;/strong&gt;. Microsoft's Tony Mangefeste says that "the customer is in control of their PC," but then says "OEMs are free to choose how to enable" turning off secure boot. He also doesn't address the issue of adding other OSes to secure boot at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major problem is that OEMs &lt;strong&gt;may not choose&lt;/strong&gt; to expose a way to disable secure boot at all. &lt;a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/5850.html"&gt;Says Garrett&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end user is not guaranteed the ability to install extra signing keys in order to securely boot the operating system of their choice. The end user is not guaranteed the ability to disable this functionality. The end user is not guaranteed that their system will include the signing keys that would be required for them to swap their graphics card for one from another vendor, or replace their network card and still be able to netboot, or install a newer SATA controller and have it recognise their hard drive in the firmware. The end user is no longer in control of their PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett also notes that the secure boot problem isn't a recent discovery. "We became aware of this issue in early August. Since then, we at Red Hat have been discussing the problem with other Linux vendors, hardware vendors and BIOS vendors. We've been making sure that we understood the ramifications of the policy in order to avoid saying anything that wasn't backed up by facts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read why this matters on page 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/09/windows-8-spells-trouble-for-l.php"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, some commenters have questioned whether this is really an issue. It is, and for a number of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some suggest that consumers can simply choose to buy machines that have the ability to disable UEFI secure boot, and that the market will sort things out. This has several problems. First, it assumes that consumers will actually be aware of the ramifications when buying a new PC, laptop or tablet and know to shop for a system that allows disabling secure boot. It also assumes that it will be readily obvious whether a system has the ability to shut this off or not. Neither of these are guaranteed, to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and more importantly, it ignores the after-market for PCs. A company that acquires several thousand PCs on lease may decide that it's perfectly fine that the systems have no way to turn off secure boot. However, those PCs ultimately end up being re-sold (after having their disks wiped) and someone else is going to want to install a new OS on them. Maybe a different release of Windows, maybe a Linux distribution, maybe something else entirely. (Who knows what will be available three to five years after the first PCs ship with secure boot?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="windows-8-platform-integrity-architecture.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/windows-8-platform-integrity-architecture.jpg" width="581" height="414" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also making no provision to allow others to sign their OSes. Garrett says, "there's no central certification authority for UEFI signing keys. Microsoft can require that hardware vendors include their keys. Their competition can't. A system that ships with Microsoft's signing keys and no others will be unable to perform secure boot of any operating system other than Microsoft's." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="super-pullquote"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The end user is not guaranteed that their system will include the signing keys that would be required for them to swap their graphics card for one from another vendor, or replace their network card and still be able to netboot, or install a newer SATA controller and have it recognise their hard drive in the firmware. The end user is no longer in control of their PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If secure boot is desirable, it shouldn't only be up to Microsoft and the OEMs to be able to load keys onto a system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's Not Just a Linux Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett is writing from the perspective of a Linux developer, so this has unfortunately been cast as a Linux versus Windows issue. It's really not, at least not exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly poses a problem for Linux users, but not only Linux users. As stated previously, this poses a problem for anyone who wants to load an operating system onto a machine without the ability to sign it using the OEM signing key. But even if you assume that the PC will have the same copy of Windows throughout its life, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; poses a problem. It affects the ability to swap graphics cards. It affects the ability to install a new network card. It potentially affects the ability to upgrade Windows at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me be very clear, &lt;strong&gt;I don't think that Microsoft is pursuing this feature as an anti-Linux effort.&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft's motives are actually unimportant, it's the technical effect of the program that concerns me. But if I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to guess at Microsoft's motives, I'd suggest that controlling unauthorized Windows is the first order of business. The second, and more publicly palatable, gain is the perception of enhanced security with Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long tried to squash not only "pirated" versions of Windows, but also "grey market" Windows. For example, buying a cheaper copy of Windows intended for system builders rather than a retail release of Windows. Does Microsoft love desktop Linux? No, but it's also well past the days when the specter of a mainstream Linux desktop kept Microsoft execs up at night. Microsoft is now a company that needs to protect its core markets and wring out every penny to keep its investors happy, and part of that is ensuring that people pay up for Windows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm disappointed that Microsoft has taken the approach of appearing to reply to the issue, while not actually doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>E.U. Sets 2013 Deadline for Open Source Public Data Mining Portal</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Neelie Kroes (150 px).png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/Neelie%20Kroes%20%28150%20px%29.png" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;Sticking with her original deadline announced last year, European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes told a European interoperability standards forum yesterday that a public portal for access to government and public data from across the continent is on track to go online in Spring 2012.  Following that, the next stage in Comm. Kroes' agenda includes an ambitious project to launch a community-built, crowd-sourced public data platform for all of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kroes told the OpenData Forum in Brussels she expects for a pan-European forum for public data mining to go live no later than 2013.  "Will she really be able to pull off all that?" the commissioner asked rhetorically, referring to herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Commission report last November (&lt;a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/content-knowledge/docs/report-ws-pan-eu-dat-porta_en.pdf"&gt;PDF available here&lt;/a&gt;) produced by a technical workshop convened in Luxembourg of data standards experts, including W3C, painted a very broad picture of the types of data the government is looking to federate.  A new data portal would need to include a small group of very interesting datasets first, the report stated, to attract citizens' interest early.  But then these early datasets would need to be stitched together with bigger datasets, the ownership of which may be indeterminate.  Goal #2, the report said, would be to "deeply integrate a small set of very high quality datasets demonstrating immediate value and, in time, capable of acting as a scaffold for the integration of many other datasets. Candidates in this second role are geospatial, transportation, statistical and financial datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Comm. Kroes narrowed and focused the definition of these datasets somewhat:  "Making good use of public data can make your life better.  Whether it's route planning using public geo-information or public transport data, a local community crowd-sourcing its maintenance priorities, decision-making built on statistics of all shapes and sizes, or data journalism that helps explain our world," she told attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Research in genomics, pharmacology or the fight against cancer increasingly depends on the availability and sophisticated analysis of large data sets," the commissioner continued.  "Sharing such data means researchers can collaborate, compare, and creatively explore whole new realms.  We cannot afford for access to scientific knowledge to become a luxury, and the results of publicly funded research in particular should be spread as widely as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sharing such data may not be the intention of some member countries that may have had intentions to license that data commercially.  For them, the commissioner implied, she would not be against imposing new rules compelling member countries to license their data at low or no rates:  "In particular, we'll be looking at the way data is disclosed - the formats and the way data licenses operate to make re-use straightforward in practice.  We'll also be looking at charging regimes because expensive data isn't 'open data.'  In short, getting out the data under reasonable conditions should be a routine part of the business of public administrations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kroes envisions private citizens being able to develop their own applications around this publicly available data.  When the Commission submitted a tender last April for freelance and open source programmers to build the data portal, initial reaction from developers - &lt;a href="http://www.crowdsourcing.org/document/eu-to-launch-tender-for-open-data-portal-/3690"&gt;as told to CrowdSourcing.org&lt;/a&gt; - included statements implying that if governments were as open as Kroes envisioned, projects such as WikiLeaks would be rendered unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think one of the biggest excitements is a really radical move to open up all spending and to be fair," said Cambridge, U.K.-based &lt;a href="http://okfn.org/"&gt;Open Knowledge Foundation&lt;/a&gt; founder Rufus Pollock.  "The U.K. Government isn't too corrupt, but imagine places where corruption is a problem.  Imagine that all over the world!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OKF is one of the leading organizations behind the Data Hub, an open effort to build a data portal around public data sets.  The Data Hub's initial store consists of 83 datasets provided by the W3C Linking Open Data Interest Group, including the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas - a record of gene expressions recorded from genome images of mouse brains; the CIA World Factbook; and the Freebase RDF Store which includes topics gleaned from Wikipedia.  The challenge for developers now may be to demonstrate how mashups may be created to link all this data together in some meaningful fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the challenge for the E.C. will be to find an inexpensive way to open up more meaningful data.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mozilla Proposes Half-Hearted Extended Release Cycle for Enterprises</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mozilla2.gif" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/mozilla2.gif" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;The accelerated Firefox release cycle may be great for many users, but enterprise IT folks were not thrilled. To their credit, the folks at Mozilla &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/08/mozilla-chair-acknowledges-ent.php"&gt;eventually took the complaints seriously&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/07/19/announing-mozilla-enterprise-user-working-group/"&gt;founded a working group&lt;/a&gt; to address enterprise desktop needs. However, it seems clear that the Extended Support Releases (ESRs) will be second-class citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working group has &lt;a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/09/21/update-on-mozilla-enterprise-user-working-group/"&gt;made progress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Enterprise/Firefox/ExtendedSupport:Proposal"&gt;come up with a proposal that would provide an  ESR&lt;/a&gt; for Firefox. If it's accepted, ESR's will have life cycle of nearly one year, and a 12 week overlap between the ESR releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current assumption is that the first ESR would be Firefox 8 or 9, and Mozilla would commit to backporting "critical" and "high" level security bugs. Security issues with lesser severity would be included "at Mozilla's discretion." The ESRs would have their own update channel, and point releases for the ESR would follow the Firefox six-week cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody can use the ESRs, but Mozilla doesn't plan to go out of its way to advertise them to consumers. According to the proposal, "the ESR will not be marketed through Mozilla.com properties other than the Enterprise wiki page and/or staging servers." Firefox 3.6, which is still seeing updates, would stop seeing updates 12 weeks after the introduction of the first ESR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Risks and Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this applies only to Firefox on the desktop, so mobile users are not going to see any changes. Mozilla also warns that the ESR won't get the same kind of widespread testing that its nightly and beta groups provide, since it would be a different channel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="esr-schedule-firefox.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/esr-schedule-firefox.jpg" width="600" height="344" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Mozilla will be issuing some security updates for the ESRs, it warns that ESRs will be "less secure" than the stock Firefox. New features that make Firefox more secure won't be backported, and "only high-risk/impact security patches will be backported." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working group also notes that maintaining an ESR will "consume resources" that might impact the regular release of other products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grudging Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One one hand, you have to give Mozilla credit for trying to address enterprise problems. However, it's clear that &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/07/it-poll-do-you-support-firefox.php"&gt;Mozilla isn't focused on the enterprise&lt;/a&gt; and it's arguable that enterprise demands are a distraction. Mozilla is a project trying to meet the needs of hundreds of millions of "regular" users. Enterprises that want rigorous testing and long product life cycles typically have to pay for the privilege, even when you're talking about open source software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the effort required to support enterprises or other large organizations that demand longer product lifecycles is disproportionate to the benefit that Mozilla will derive from offering the ESRs. Accordingly, the ESR looks like it's a half-hearted attempt at addressing criticism rather than full-on attacking a problem as Mozilla does with mainstream Firefox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="esr-fig2.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/esr-fig2.jpg" width="600" height="240" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that Mozilla won't make a best-effort attempt to deliver what it's promising with the ESRs. However, ESR releases would clearly be second-class citizens. Love or loathe Internet Explorer, enterprise users and consumers get the same product. That won't be the case with Firefox ESRs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla seems to be between a rock and a hard place here. Unlike Microsoft and Google, there's little upside for Mozilla in engaging enterprises. There's no set of enterprise products for Mozilla to sell to large and slow-moving organizations, but it faces added costs and development burden to be dealt with to keep enterprises happy. Ceding the enterprise desktop to Microsoft, however, weakens Mozilla elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Mozilla should consider a Red Hat-like model for its enterprise channels? Even a token subscription fee would at least demonstrate that organizations are serious about supporting Mozilla in exchange for addressing their specific needs. What do you think? Is the ESR proposal a reasonable solution, or should Mozilla be trying a different approach with this audience?&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Armed with a Win8 Tablet, YoYo Games Marches Toward HTML5</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="110922 YoYo Games 03.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110922%20YoYo%20Games%2003.jpg" width="486" height="326" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week in Anaheim, in amongst the crowd of developers at Microsoft's Build 2011 conference assimilating the news about Windows 8, was a team from a London, U.K.-based company called YoYo Games.  In 2000, that company released an interesting entry-level game development and distribution platform called, quite simply, GameMaker.  Following in the hallowed footsteps of the great computer game platforms of the 1980s and '90s, it introduced a stand-alone interpreter whose language borrowed a bit from Pascal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the modern era, stand-alone interpreters mean plug-ins; and the handwriting on the wall from Build 2011 was that &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/09/build-2011-what-is-winrt-and-i.php"&gt;plug-ins like Silverlight are yesterday's news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="110922 YoYo Games 04.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110922%20YoYo%20Games%2004.jpg" width="610" height="367" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by what they've seen, YoYo is moving full-ahead today with a public commercial release of a beta of a new version of the GameMaker platform that makes the full transition to HTML5.  There's no plug-ins and no interpreter or managed code; instead, there's JavaScript.  And the games this IDE produces runs in everyday Web browsers without embellishment... and perhaps most importantly, without Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="110922 YoYo Games 01.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110922%20YoYo%20Games%2001.jpg" width="610" height="367" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a limited extent, it's a move away from the platform that put YoYo in business.  But in &lt;a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/YoYo+Games+news/feature.asp?c=33636"&gt;an interview for PocketGamer.biz published today&lt;/a&gt;, YoYo CEO Sandy Duncan said it was time to take advantage of what he perceives as a decline in the popularity of Flash-based games.  With competitors such as Zynga having already made fortunes from the Facebook Platform (YoYo has a presence there too with enticing titles such as "They Need to Be Fed"), Duncan said HTML5 could give games that had already been developed for Flash "a new lease on life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I expect we'll see a resurgence of existing browser game Web sites such as Miniclip as well as the emergence of new 'stores' which will deliver HTML5 content," Duncan told PocketGamer.biz.  "Facebook is the company to watch in this area; we believe it can rival any platform.  However, it needs to get its act together providing a much better consumer and developer experience by supporting discovery in a more imaginative way."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By "discovery," Duncan means the ability for the platform on which apps and games are built, to reveal their wares to potential users in an interesting manner.  Up until very recently, HTML5's ability to provide discovery was perceived as poor.  Game portal sites such as Miniclip remained devoted to Flash, while HTML5 counterparts struggled for recognition on app stores where users have to peruse multiple tiers of menus to find anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="110922 YoYo Games 05.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/110922%20YoYo%20Games%2005.jpg" width="610" height="456" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's prototype of the Windows 8 Start Screen has changed that analysis, and quite quickly.  However you perceive its implementation (I'm already on record as believing it can and should be reworked), the Start Screen's bright, bold tiles are giving HTML5 developers new cause for hope.  Metro tiles can update their own content based on fresh feeds from the Web.  Imagine a big tile that scrolls itself to reveal new HTML5 games in the queue.  They wouldn't necessarily have to be directly installed on the Start Screen to be seen - or rather, to be &lt;i&gt;discovered&lt;/i&gt; by users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta testing for &lt;a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/html5"&gt;GameMaker:HTML5&lt;/a&gt; is officially closed to new applicants now, although the beta platform is available from YoYo Games for a discounted price of $99.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gatherspace Make Requirements Management Easier</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gatherspace150.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/gatherspace150.png" width="150" height="150" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;Today the cloud-based vendor &lt;a href="http://www.gatherspace.com/requirements_management_solution.html"&gt;Gatherspace&lt;/a&gt; announced upgrades to its online requirements analysis service. If your tech team is having trouble getting the other stakeholders in your company to specify their requirements for your next software development project, you might want to look at what they have to offer.  As you all know, having the best set of requirements going into a project makes for happier engineers and better software design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service has been available for several years; this is its first major update. New features include a powerful requirements search drill-down, allowing users to instantly view specific and high-priority items; an at-a-glance activity tab for improved collaboration and workflow; and added fields for enhanced importing and exporting of data including ability to instantly publish on-demand web-based reports. The UI has been refreshed and reports have been specially designed for iPad consumption too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/TourScreenshots_02.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="TourScreenshots_02.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/assets_c/2011/09/TourScreenshots_02-thumb-610x466-34079.png" width="610" height="466" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The site offers extensive product screenshots (click the example above to enlarge) and a video tour to give you an idea of whether this service will work for your team. There is a free 30-day trial. Monthly plans begin at $29 per user, or an enterprise plan for $300 per month for unlimited users should that be more attractive.    &lt;br /&gt;
