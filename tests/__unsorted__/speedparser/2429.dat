			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ellis" target="_blank">Warren Ellis</a>. I write comics, graphic novels, books, journalism and anything else that people pay money for. Sometimes I even go out in public. I live in south-east England.</p>
<p>I’m the writer of the graphic novel RED, <a href="http://www.red-themovie.com/" target="_blank">the film version of which</a> (starring Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman &amp; Helen Mirren) came out in October 2010. (A sequel is apparently due next year.)  I’m the writer of the GRAVEL graphic novels, under development for film by Legendary Pictures. I also wrote the novel CROOKED LITTLE VEIN. I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warren-Ellis/e/B001IGQKDG/">an Amazon.com page here</a>. (Ignore anything it says about LISTENER, that book was lost and cancelled years ago.)</p>
<p>My next novel, GUN MACHINE, is due from Mulholland Books in autumn 2012.</p>
<p>A collection of the writing I’ve done here and elsewhere on the internet, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/shivering-sands/7799924" target="_blank">SHIVERING SANDS</a>, was published in 2009.</p>
<p>Sometimes I speak at conferences, or do other kinds of talks and appearances.</p>
<p>The easiest way to contact me in the first instance is probably to message me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/warrenellis">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Official-Warren-Ellis-Compound/108842602472863" target="_blank">an Official Warren Ellis Page on that Facebook thing</a> , which mirrors this site as well as my <a href="http://ubergrid.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and a few other things.</p>
<p>You can also find me on Instagram as warrenellis.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Random and ultimately conclusionless jottings on the notion of rhetorical comics.</p>
<p>Which is an inexact and probably not useful term, but polemical comics seems even worse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an idea I&#8217;ve been interested in for years, but somehow never had the time to fully develop.  It comes from having grown up with the extended televisual essay, also sometimes referred to as rhetorical television.  The first one that really impacted me was James Burke&#8217;s CONNECTIONS:</p>
<p><object width="640" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OcSxL8GUn-g?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OcSxL8GUn-g?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="480" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>You can throw THE ASCENT OF MAN into that bucket too, and probably COSMOS if you feel like it.  And, most recently, the work of Adam Curtis, including this summer&#8217;s ALL WATCHED OVER BY MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/I6EBpLfLHCA?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/I6EBpLfLHCA?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="480" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>The text overlaid on the image is termed a super, for superimposition.  A fusion of the intertitle, the text card between sequences in the silent movie, and the lower third or chyron, the explanatory text overlays most often found in the lower third of the screen in news broadcasts.  (&#8220;Chyron&#8221; comes from &#8220;Chyron Corporation,&#8221; the company most associated with their generation.)</p>
<p>I have a habit of staring at things until they unpack in my head.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7V42"/></center></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awkward tool to adapt for comics, because it kind of relies on the motion behind it to ensure the whole thing doesn&#8217;t stop dead.  I tried floating supers on a Marvel comic called ULTIMATE HUMAN once, just because these things should be used to try stuff out on.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6200669866_f8ebb8f6c9_z.jpg"/></p>
<p>When there&#8217;s a moving image behind the supers, running time isn&#8217;t necessarily being eaten.  We can process the events behind the super as well as the super itself.  Serial comics can&#8217;t match that easily.  Real estate gets eaten.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6200213821_d42691ca34_o.jpg"/></p>
<p>Fraction and crew try supers in CASANOVA: AVARITIA 1.  The super&#8217;s on a repeated image.  They match the super with a hard change in visual tone, a stringed soundtrack descending for half a bar into a doom metal chord.  It fits the general warm, organic, analogue feel of a CASANOVA comic, but to me it also opens up the path to the adoption of <em>visual glitch</em> for a similar effect.</p>
<p><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7V4M" width=640/></p>
<p><a href="http://abstrakt.vade.info/?p=181">[x]</a></p>
<p>Matt&#8217;s not going for a rhetorical feel: it&#8217;s narrative-diegetic, if you like.  It&#8217;s in the same bucket, as, say, the end of ANIMAL HOUSE:</p>
<p><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7V4H"/><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7V4I"/></p>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;m going to correct myself.  Fiction-diegetic, perhaps.  Because a rhetorical piece obviously has its own narrative.  The lyric essay, as pushed a year or two back by REALITY HUNGER, uses all the tools of fiction without being fiction.  Which, again, isn&#8217;t a million miles away from the tenets of the New Journalism.  The supers in CASANOVA don&#8217;t pop you out of the story.  They serve the story.</p>
<p>In something that is broadly non-fiction, the expectations of being immersed in the text are a little different.  A story is being told, but you don&#8217;t enter it with the desire to be wrapped up warmly in the internal logics of a new little world.  Which is one reason why so many darlings get killed, in the writing of fiction: you can&#8217;t always brake to talk about something interesting to you without bringing on that business of &#8220;readers being thrown out of the story.&#8221;  You can&#8217;t draw attention to the fact that the backdrop to the car journey really is just two stagehands winding a long paper mural to create the illusion of travel through the landscape.</p>
<p>Except, of course, when you can.  </p>
<p><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7V4Q"/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomasriggs.net/blog/index.php/2009/10/these-books-are-totally-glitchin/">[x]</a></p>
<p>The essay has a different pact with the reader or viewer.  The pact is that you&#8217;ll be taken from A to B and that there will be a point to the trip, but also that you&#8217;re probably going to get to B via C through Z.  And not necessarily in abecedarian order.  </p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6200156471_6478d1ba62_o.jpg"/></p>
<p>Fusing that approach with fiction presumably loses you a lot of readers.  People being taken out of the story.  People who want the story to be the point.  I guess an early Thomas Pynchon novel would kill those people stone dead.  The thing to bear in mind is that those people already have lots of other books to read.</p>
<p>(A dozen years ago, I did a comic that was nothing but art and dialogue and brief supers, with the explicit intent of keeping people &#8220;inside&#8221; the book.  No internal monologue, no box captions where I could possibly help it.  Some of you will be more familiar with that style from Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;Ultimate&#8221; line, particular &#8220;The Ultimates.&#8221;)</p>
<p>There is a space where the narrative is the point, and the &#8220;story&#8221; is just one of the things that keeps it moving.</p>
<p>The examples I&#8217;ve used aren&#8217;t the only ones, of course.  Just the ones that occur to me this afternoon, sitting out in the garden writing this.  And there will probably be a few people I&#8217;m completely unaware of, working in webcomics or minicomics who&#8217;ve solved all these tools.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all unlikely to be something I&#8217;ll ever get to fully develop, unless something very unusual happens, like the perfect trusted collaborators appearing out of nowhere and sometimes materialising with open funding.  And also a few more hours in every day.  But, with all the talk about commercial comics going back to the Nineties, or pricing themselves out of the market, or all the other shit-smoke that gets blown every day to stop people thinking about what their next move really *could* be&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;well, it&#8217;s just a pleasant thought to me, that a few people might say, &#8220;well, these old paradigms are all well and good, but maybe I just want to find new ways to talk about the things that are interesting to me, and people can either come along with me or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rough ride.  I don&#8217;t think, for instance, that as many people are as interested in old Smoky &#038; The Bandit flicks as Joe Casey, but I love that Joe&#8217;s just saying fuckit and doing BUTCHER BAKER anyway.  That said, BUTCHER BAKER intercut with a visual representation of the backmatter essays Joe&#8217;s writing, story interleaved with rhetorical comics, or even studded with supers about what Joe&#8217;s *really* talking about&#8230; that would have been something to see.</p>
<p>Most of us descend into the pop stuff, like BUTCHER BAKER or CAPTAIN SWING or whatever, because it&#8217;s where most of us came from.  But it always comes with the auctorial request to the rest of the pop medium, I think: please be less boring. Please be less interested in your rules about what comics can and can&#8217;t do.  Please just say something interesting.</p>
<p>How the hell did I end up there?</p>

<p>*&#160; I’m attempting to use last.fm again.&#160; <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/warrenellis">This is me on last.fm</a>.</p>
<p>*&#160; I put together an hour-long music podcast for somebody else – basically just a mixtape of stuff – that I guess will be out in a few weeks.&#160; And it really gave me the itch to podcast again.&#160; I may just stick with doing 8tracks pieces more often, because 8tracks are at least licensed, and I don’t think I have the time or energy to do another The 4am run… but.&#160; Geezer needs a hobby, right?</p>
<p>* I’m also trying out Goodreads.&#160; I can be found there at <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/warrenellis">http://www.goodreads.com/warrenellis</a> .&#160; I do have a novel coming out next autumn, after all.</p>
<p>*&#160; And it seems that Dame Helen Mirren announced that <strong>RED 2 is go for next year</strong>. I haven’t been cleared to say anything, but, well, <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/09/25/helen-mirren-says-shes-on-for-red-2-next-year/">no-one’s going to argue with Dame Helen</a>.</p>

For example, a survey of 151 slum settlements in Mumbai conducted by Mahila Milan/NSDF found that there were 3,433 municipal toilet seats, 80 percent of which were not working, to serve one million people &ndash; a ratio of one toilet for every 1,488 people4.

<h2>Anyone remember Siri?</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Siri was a voice-activated “personal assistant” for iOS, made by an independent developer.&#160; It was last year, I think.&#160; It was the beginnings of something very interesting.&#160; Voice-driven search agent.&#160; “Siri, call me a cab,” you’d say, and it’d do it.&#160; “Siri, book me a table at my favourite restaurant,” you’d say, and if it had that information and web service details, it would.&#160; Like I say, the beginnings.&#160; It might have wound itself deeper into iOS itself, as well as broading its search and action agency.</p>
<p>And then Apple bought it, a year ago, and it went away.</p>
<p>I bought myself a little bluetooth earpiece, a Jawbone Shadowbox, to make it easier for me to listen to podcasts.&#160; So today I’m sitting at my work table in the back garden, and decide that I want to send a voice memo to someone while I’m working.&#160; I hold down the button on my Shadowbox that activates voice control on the phone, and say “voice memo.”</p>
<p>It redials my last-used number.</p>
<p>I try again.&#160; It dials into my phone provider’s voicemail service.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>The hell with it, I think, and, while voice control’s on, I tell it to play a Grouper album I have on the phone.</p>
<p>Terrifyingly, it dials the mobile phone of an executive at 20th Century Fox. </p>
<p>I decided that this was annoying.&#160; And then I thought, wait, Apple bought Siri a bloody year ago.&#160; Siri was apparently capable of telling me the weather in New York City and booking me a ticket to go and see Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.&#160; But the bloody phone voice control tries to wake up a movie studio VP at 530 when I ask it to play a record.</p>
<p>All of which are beyond trivial, as problems go.&#160; I can, of course, just pick up the phone and make it do what I want.&#160; But if you’re going to put voice control on there, and allow third-party devices to access it, isn’t there an onus on you to make it a bit more useful?&#160; Especially when you’ve had Siri in-house for a year?&#160; Maybe this is what’s coming with iPhone 5.&#160; I’ve read that Android voice control is better.</p>
<p>But – at least in my head – there’s a broader point.&#160; People are beginning to come to terms with the idea of the phone screen as ghost box, as viewer and mediator of the invisible world of informational connection and flow.&#160; Augmented Reality is helping that along, in certain quarters.&#160; I am, however, amused by the idea that Apple, whose general design policies seem mostly informed by <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> (and note how the design of the <em>new</em> Star Trek film evoked nothing so much as an Apple Store with added LEDs and lens flare), let something as obviously Eighties-science-fiction as voice interface get away from them.&#160; Which is why I nodded sagely, as is my wont, when they bought Siri.</p>
<p>(Also amused by the idea that, in an era of voice interface, <a href="http://www.riglondon.com/blog/2011/05/06/the-new-aesthetic/">New Aesthetic</a> would become No Aesthetic overnight.&#160; Or, at least, would have to somehow become audial.&#160; Would audio glitch even be possible in voice interface?&#160; Maybe activation pings would become the basis for next-gen chiptunes.)</p>
<p>Noise-cancelling technologies make voice interface more feasible by the day.&#160; If you already have a voice control system, why not tie it deeper into your OS, rather than keep it as a part-functional appendage?&#160; Right now, it’s sort of a vestigial tail on iOS.&#160; And, while I don’t want to seem entitled or pushy – Apple moves slow with iPhone, and, hell, the phone didn’t become a useable device until the 3GS iteration as far as I’m concerned – they bought Siri a year ago, and voice interface is right in the wheelhouse of a company that makes Star Trek goods.&#160; And not everybody wants to look at a screen for <em>everything</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6172394468_37c7520e53_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In January 2011 my wife, our son, and I moved out of a flat in Toxteth into a house of our own, just a mile or so from that of my parents. My mum and dad still live in the same 1930s semi they moved to shortly after I was born. My sister and her family live a mile or so further on, just a fraction over the border of Liverpool. A circle drawn on a map with my parent’s house at the centre, my home marking one edge of the diameter and my sister’s marking the other, would cordon off an area in which I attended Nursery school, Infant school, Junior school, Secondary school and Sixth Form College. Within that circle I learned to ride a bike; I had my first kiss; I got served in a pub for the first time.</p>
<p>Inside that circle my grandparents met while air-raid sirens droned panic and fire rained down from above. Within its bounds they courted, and were married in the very same church whose Italianate bell-tower casts an afternoon shadow across my back garden. Inside that circle, six doors down from where my parents live today, my grandparents set up home and raised their children. There they stayed long enough for the children to leave and the grandchildren, and then great-grandchildren to arrive. Inside that circle their bodies were cremated – gran’s last year, granddad’s this &#8211; their ashes scattered partly in their own back garden, partly on the grave of gran’s parents who are themselves buried inside that same imaginary circle.</p>
<p>And as easily as these words connect those events so too do physical paths link their settings. The hypothetical circle is divided up not just by modern streets and roads but also by more ancient thoroughfares. Narrow brier choked, ivy curtained corridors that might be faerie paths, or corpse roads, link the abundant cemeteries, parks, playing fields and hidden green-spaces that wait impatiently for the moment when they can reclaim the circle. Centuries old roots ripple through tarmac, absorb railings and bow walls. Stop-motion brambles wind cunningly around fallen sandstone slabs, spider-walk through skull-socket knotholes, cascade over weatherworn fence panel and post in a prickled, black-fruit foamed spray. Looking out from the crest of a suburban hill where an Iron Age fort once stood, the thin veneer of civilisation can be seen, almost heard, crumbling one driveway-fracturing dandelion at a time.</p>
<p>Pre-adolescent weekends and school holidays were spent exploring the circle with friends: clambering over ornate iron railings into the overgrown grounds of a Victorian Convalescent home to eat square crisps in its long abandoned chapel while dust motes danced in its ruined-roof sunbeams. In a deserted factory two streets behind my parent’s home: the words NO DOG FIGHTS spray-painted in two foot high dripping red letters on an inner wall; a flight of concrete steps leading directly down into the inky waters of a flooded cellar. Racing mountain bikes through a two-hundred-and-thirty-three acre cemetery, slaking our thirst at the taps meant for filling memorial vases while headless angels knelt beside us in prayer. In the cricket pavilion of a closed down secondary school &#8211; a row of showers turning themselves on. One. By. One. A black collie sleeping peacefully on its side next to a railway track turning out  to be only the matting of indigestible fur covering a skeleton picked clean by creatures from the dark, damp earth below. All of it terrifying, all of it wonderful, seen now not so much through rose-tinted spectacles as Instagram or Photoshop filters. Add Dust &amp; Speckles. Add Grunge. Fuzzy focussed, faded edged, and un-really vintage.</p>
<p>Nightmarish is the right word for such pre-adult horrors – like nightmares, though ominous and threatening, they could never have harmed despite all appearances to the contrary. Bikes lead to cuts and bruises, and early onset anxiety about theft. Kisses begin a cycle of want, and need, and heartache. Beer turns to hangovers, to lost time and borrowed money. All those supposed pleasures summoned so eagerly from within the circle so many summers ago had their costs, but consequences are an adult’s neurosis.</p>
<p>Back there, at the very cusp of adolescence, as the days of let’s pretend drew to an end and genuine fear and risk became reality, the meshing of the child and proto-adult psyche created something incredibly powerful and truly beautiful. Knowing just enough, understanding just enough to take things seriously but still not knowing exactly what it is you’re supposed to be taking seriously &#8211;  allegorical fears flickered temporarily into un-deconstructed, un-questioned existence.</p>
<p>Here tonight inside the invisible circle an ancient oak creaks gloomily in the wind  just beyond the floodlights of a pub car park; a tattered black tracksuit top caught in a cemetery brier hedge flaps frantically; a car’s headlights flash momentarily in the eyes of a fox, or cat, skulking in the roadside shadows. Everything crackles with potential unreality like a two day old acid trip on the tip of the brain.</p>
<p>This is the place where my son is already growing up day by day – family, as always, at the circle’s centre. Here his mum and I will teach him to ride a bike; here his first kiss sleeps soundly somewhere close by; here half a dozen struggling pub landlords are already counting on him buying his first pint from them. And here inside this circle where his great-grandparents lived and died, for an all too brief time, my son will have the most wonderful nightmares that will stay with him the rest of his life.</p>

The current prototype has a silicon base and could not be used in a human body. Longer term, however, a biocompatible version could be implanted directly in living things to monitor, or even control, certain biological processes directly.&quot;<br />(tags:<a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:sci">sci</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:tech">tech</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:comms">comms</a>  )</li>

schools had been out of business for more than 10 years, say starting<br />
around 1990, the wars were more like Lord of the Flies with pickup<br />
trucks, automatic rifles, light and heavy machineguns, and mortars&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;Illiterate 20-somethings leading uneducated armed bands of teens and children across the countryside, enticed by rice and magic. And some drugs, it&#039;s true, but chiefly rice and magic. These were hungry children empowered by an AK-47 and some sadistic charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;Funny how quickly a new generation will believe in the power of magic in as few as 10 or 12 years after the schools close.&quot;<br />(tags:<a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:war">war</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:pol">pol</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:cult">cult</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:magic">magic</a>  <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:warrenellis/t:edu">edu</a>  )</li>
