<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To which mailing lists do you belong? I can tell you right off the bat that I am a member of 15, none of which have ever had any success converting me on anything &#8211; from yet another terrible <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blshE_TSbmg" target="_blank">PLR content-generated ebook</a> to offers claiming that I&#8217;ll be rich overnight without leaving my couch. And yet, I stay a member of these super-secret online societies. Maybe it&#8217;s because I like to see what others are doing wrong, and maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m waiting for that one offer that changes my life with cheap car insurance.</p>
<p>But in the midst of a sea of special offers I don&#8217;t need, I have learned one thing. You absolutely must maintain a healthy relationship with your list in order to make it worthwhile. Keep in mind, though, this is not a matter of hiring an expert copywriter or abandoning all hope of ever selling anything through <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/aweber" style="" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="self.status='http://www.sitesketch101.com/aweber';return true;" onmouseout="self.status=''">email</a>. There are five ways that you can keep your emailing list healthy and keep your messages from being forever designated to the bottomless pit of woe known as spam folders.</p>
<h3>Create Content That Requires Action</h3>
<p>Think back to all of the advertisement emails you&#8217;ve ever received. What was one thing most of them had in common? They were actionable. Email marketers do this for a very good reason &#8211; it works. Actionable phrases accomplish the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>They create urgency &#8211; &#8220;Act now to take advantage of this limited time offer!&#8221;</li>
<li>They give the reader something to do &#8211; &#8220;Grab your copy of my new book today!&#8221;</li>
<li>They make the reader feel special &#8211; &#8220;Exclusive to my members only, take an extra 15% off your next purchase!&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Actionable text doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to lead to a sale. In all reality, new members of your list might need time to trust you before taking action. You can sort your list based on how long your recipients have been on it and consider action they&#8217;ve taken in the past before sending them offers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose you are emailing a list of people and you want to get them to <a href="http://www.halloweenexpress.com/" target="_blank">buy Halloween costumes</a> (I bet you didn&#8217;t click that link because you don&#8217;t trust me yet). Consider using the first few emails to butter up your list with some valuable content, like how to alter normal Halloween costumes for our plus sized friends, or a list of the 15 most creative Halloween costumes ever. Once your new readers trust that you have some valuable information, you can start sending some actionable links for them to click.</p>
<h3>Finding the Right Email Frequency Balance</h3>
<p>The amount of emails you send to your list depends entirely on the people on the list itself. But not emailing your list enough can make them forget that they ever signed up for your list, resulting in some potentially costly spam complaints. On the other hand, emailing your list too often can be just as costly, especially if you&#8217;re not providing valuable content. The best way to find this balance is to do some testing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split your mailing list into several different groups, but try to group people based on how long they&#8217;ve been on your list and their previous responses to your emails.</li>
<li>Create around five emails that you plan to send in the near future.</li>
<li>Set a different schedule for each group. You might send one group an email every month, while you send another an email every week.</li>
<li>Monitor your conversion rates with each group (and other email data like whether the recipients open the email, delete it right away, or mark it as spam).</li>
</ol>
<p>After a month or two, you should have enough data to set a permanent schedule for your list. If the data is inconclusive, you might need to extend the testing period &#8211; or even keep the testing schedule the same if it seems to be working just fine with each group.</p>
<p>As far as gathering this data goes, there are a variety of different programs that can help you out. Most Internet marketers tend to stick with the following four:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">Mail Chimp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bronto.com/" target="_blank">Bronto</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey (for survey data)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://madmimi.com/" target="_blank">Mad Mimi</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Choosing the Right Offers to Pitch</h3>
<p>One of the trickiest parts of maintaining a healthy relationship with your list is choosing the offers that you pitch. There are several easy and important rules that you should follow when choosing pitches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never try to pitch something from a different niche (trying to sell $250 watches to a baking list).</li>
<li>You can, however, pitch across horizontal niches (pitching a Thai cookbook to a Chinese cooking list).</li>
<li>Try to push products that you would buy yourself (your genuine interest will show).</li>
<li>Better yet, push products you already bought because you liked them so much.</li>
<li>Support your pitches with real, valuable content &#8211; not just other pitches.</li>
<li>Try a variety of different products (like ebooks, physical products, and exclusive videos).</li>
</ol>
<p>Just keep gathering data about your list&#8217;s spending habits and activities after receiving your emails. Eventually, you&#8217;ll naturally know what your list likes to purchase.</p>
<h3>Use an Autoresponder</h3>
<p>This tip is especially for those who have an enormous list (even those among you that might have bought your 100,000 email list from a spam company, you sneaky buggers). Especially in the early contact phases, it&#8217;s important to keep in touch with your list, even if it becomes a nightmare to respond to complaints, questions, and comments. Using an autoresponder with prewritten messages can help you seem like you are getting back to your list members right away, even though you aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Using this tool isn&#8217;t an end-all method for not having to respond to anything your list sends you, but it does help cut time spent responding to the same questions &#8211; giving you the time to come up with your next email. A popular email tool that has some good options for autoresponding is <a href="http://www.aweber.com/" target="_blank">AWeber</a>.</p>
<h3>Act Like a Real Person</h3>
<p>If you skipped right over the last tip because you want to truly be in touch with your list, congratulations. If not, read carefully. You will not realize your true conversion potential until you build yourself into a trustworthy and credible brand.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to create entirely custom emails, even little things can make a difference. Use a mass emailer program to put members&#8217; first names in emails, for example. You might even surprise a few members by sending an entirely customized email once in a while, especially ones with a long conversion history, offering a special deal only for them.</p>
<p>Part of this involves making absolutely sure that your list knows that you are a human. This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to send them each a hand-drawn Christmas card every year &#8211; use stories from your own life in your emails to relate to a product. Use a badge system to give list members an incentive to keep responding to your emails and buying the products you pitch. Above all, be as personable and real as possible, and you will find the members of your list that are willing to convert, even if that cuts your list down by thousands. After all, I&#8217;ll take a list of 100 that convert after every email over a list of 1,000 that <em>might</em> buy something down the road.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/html5">HTML5: Up and Running</a> is appropriately subtitled, <strong><em>Dive into the Future of Web Development</em></strong>. It allows readers the opportunity to jump head-first into the world of design by drawing a historical picture demonstrating how the web has evolved into what we currently experience while at the same time exploring in vivid detail the newest features being rolled out by the development community today.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is its ideal blend of brevity and thoroughness. In just 200 pages, Pilgrim covers in great detail all the new features and aspects of the next generation of HTML including semantic elements like <strong><em>&lt;header&gt;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&lt;footer&gt;</em></strong>, offline capabilities, geolocation, non-third-party embedded videos, enhanced web <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/gravity_forms" style="" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="self.status='http://www.sitesketch101.com/gravity_forms';return true;" onmouseout="self.status=''">forms</a>, and everything else that HTML5 entails. Anyone looking for a thorough crash course on web design will find everything they need in this book.</p>
<p>In a writing genre plagued with nerdy jargon and gobbledygook, Pilgrim’s writing style lays the perfect foundation for an easy read. Even while exploring advanced features, he presents examples, stories and background that allow a reader to gain a broader picture of each feature and how those features interact with other new features. A reader would be hard-pressed to find a book with this much technical detail that still maintains such clean and fun style of writing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/html5"><img class="size-full wp-image-14411 aligncenter" title="HTML5: Up and Running" src="http://www.sitesketch101.com/wp-content/uploads/HTML5-5-future-browser.png" alt="HTML5: Up and Running" width="570" height="285"/></a></p>
<p>Pilgrim makes it easy to validate his information by providing resources for additional reading at the end of each chapter. Whether you need more information about that chapter’s topic or if you want to confirm some of the information that he presented, he makes it incredibly easy to do.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, although the book is a print book available in all major physical bookstores and online at <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/html5">Amazon</a> and other retailers, he’s also <a title="Dive Into HTML5 by Mark Pilgrim" href="http://www.diveintohtml5.org">published the entire book online</a> and made it available for free under a creative commons license.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/html5">HTML5: Up and Running</a> is an amazing resource for anyone interested in learning the quick and dirty details of modern design. Its refreshing style, short page count, and thorough approach to the subject makes this book an excellent read.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the massive boom of the World Wide Web, many companies have started taking their brands online. The allure of reaching out to a bigger market is too much for even small companies to pass up. With millions of internet users, business owners understand that once they gain respect in the online front, their businesses would take one step higher in the ladder of success.</p>
<p>Building a website though is an arduous task. While one can get away with a bare-essentials website back in the early days of internet marketing, the same cannot be said in these modern times. Apart from making it standout from the millions of sites on the Internet, it is also the duty of internet marketers to make sure that their brand is imprinted in the minds of every visitors of their website.</p>
<h3>#1<br/>
The Logo</h3>
<p>One of the first things that you need to take care of is your brand&#8217;s logo. If you are not good at drawing a logo from scratch, you can easily find freelancers to do it for you. Once you have that done, or if you already have one used in your offline business, make sure that it is prominently displayed in all pages of your website. The top left of each page is the best place for it as internet users are used to seeing the name of the website displayed in that space.</p>
<p>By having your logo in all pages of your website, you ensure that every visitor to your website, no matter what page they land in would instantly know where they are. An eye-catching logo would further pique their interest to learn more about your company which brings me to the next web design tip.</p>
<h3>#2<br/>
The Footer</h3>
<p>Have a uniform footer that would be displayed in all pages of your website too. In the footer, make sure that there is a link to your &#8220;About Us&#8221; page. By doing this, once you have grabbed the attention of website users, they can easily navigate to that page to learn more about what you do or what products you are offering.</p>
<h3>#3<br/>
The Tagline</h3>
<p>A tagline is also strongly recommended. Big name brands have always used taglines to tell people what they are about. Think of it as your &#8220;About Us&#8221; page compressed into a phrase of a few words. Your tagline should be catchy and at the same time have something to say about your business.</p>
<h3>#4<br/>
The Favicon</h3>
<p>Since we are talking about web design, it is also a great idea to have your own favicon. A favicon is that small graphic that appears next to the URL in the address bar of browsers. This is an easy way for people to check what sites are open in what tabs. While it would entail making another design, usually a smaller version of your brand&#8217;s logo, it goes a long to ensure that your site users would have an easier time looking for your website especially today where multi-tabbed browsing is the norm.</p>
<h3>#5<br/>
The Color Scheme</h3>
<p>Pick a good color that would match what your company does and use it as a theme for your site. When picking the color, make sure that it would be easy on the eyes. Stay away from loud colors as it could be straining to the eye, an inconvenience that could drive potential customers away.</p>

If you answered yes to any of the above question then this article will help you t&#8230;]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking of starting a blog? Or do you want to create another blog? Or do you already own a Blog?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of the above question then this article will help you to develop a master strategy for creating your dream blog.</p>
<p>Just like you need various traps for catching fish, bear, rabbits and any other animals, you will need various strategies for creating a successful blog. There are, however, a few steps that are the same no matter which forest you are hunting in.</p>
<h4>Getting Started with the Hunt</h4>
<h3>Decide what you want to Catch:<br/>
Find your Niche</h3>
<p>Just like in any other hunt, the first thing you need to do when starting a blog hunt is to decide what exactly it is that you are trying to catch.</p>
<p>It is very important that you have a clear idea of the kind of blog you are trying to create. It will be your foundation for the whole blog creation process from start to finish.</p>
<p>Here are a few Questions to help you figure out what you will be hunting for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my current career field?</li>
<li>What kind of Activities do I enjoy doing the most in my Daily life?</li>
<li>What are my Interests and Hobbies?</li>
</ul>
<p>You answers to these questions will help you to find topics you should create a blog about.</p>
<h3>Prepare your Traps</h3>
<p>As a hunter, once you know the animal you want to hunt, it&#8217;s time to prepare you traps.</p>
<p>As for bloggers, when you have found your niche, its now time for you to prepare your blogging equipment. You will need a few key items to succeed in creating your perfect blog.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things you should get before starting out:</p>
<ul>
<li>A laptop Computer or better still a Desktop Computer (Desktop is what I use).</li>
<li>A web hosting service and a <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/affiliates/godaddy" style="" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="self.status='http://www.sitesketch101.com/affiliates/godaddy';return true;" onmouseout="self.status=''">domain</a> (You may try <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/affiliates/godaddy">Godaddy</a>, <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/bluehost">Bluehos</a>t or <a title="Host Gator" href="http://www.hostgator.com">HostGator</a>).</li>
<li>An Internet Connection.</li>
<li>A network of people who could potentially help you in your endeavors. This is easy. All you have to do is read from top blogs in your niche.</li>
<li>Register on social networks especially Facebook and Twitter (I don’t believe much in G+, IMAO).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Set up Your Blog/ Trap</h3>
<p>Now that you may have prepared your traps, its now time to set up your blog.</p>
<p>Setting up your blog is quite easy; you can easily install WordPress automatically from your hosting Cpanel in just a few minutes. Virtually all host company have a Cpanel, you can access it usually through www.cpanel.yourdomain.com or www.yourdomin.com/cpanel.</p>
<p>After installing WordPress, the next thing to do is to find a suitable theme. For beginners, a free theme might just do the job for now, but finding a perfect free theme is a little bit difficult, but all you have to do is keep on experimenting with the free themes until you get a suitable one or until you get a premium theme like the <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/genesis_framework">Genesis Framework</a> for Your Blog.</p>
<h3>Content and SEO</h3>
<p>After you have done your blog set-up and you have that lovely theme installed, the next thing to do is to start writing articles for your blog, and don’t just write for writing&#8217;s sake. Write quality and unique content.</p>
<p>Content creation is not an easy task especially for beginners, but I believe practice makes perfection. The more you write, the more writing become easy for you.</p>
<p>There is no way you will start a blog and not write junk post at your early blog days. I have some on my blog too. I wrote them when I was just getting started and I was much more eager to get content on my blog. But the most important point of this is that you should be improving your writing.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot of writing tips at <a href="http://www.problogger.net">Problogger</a> and <a href="http://www.youngprepro.com">Youngprepro</a>.</p>
<p>After writing articles and hitting the publish button you need to do a bit of search engine optimization in order to get targeted traffic to your blog. For more on this, you can read the post <a href="http://www.josylad.com/2011/08/6-powerful-tips-for-promoting-your-blog-for-free">6 Powerful Tips for Promoting Your Blog for Free.</a></p>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>The joy of a hunter is to catch the prey or animal he desires, just like the joy of a Blogger is to build that great blog.</p>
<p>I know these tips will surely help you to kick start your blogging career.</p>
<p>Just for reminder all you have to do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide what you want to catch: Find you niche.</li>
<li>Prepare your Trap: Get the necessary Equipment.</li>
<li>Set up your blog.</li>
<li>Create content and search engine optimize.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Backlinks (other pages on the web that link to your website or blog) are extremely important to your search engine optimization and search marketing strategy. A key part of search algorithms includes checking the number of backlinks and their sources to determine the sites importance. Therefore it is important to not only create backlinks to your site but to also have relevant sites linking to yours.</p>
<p>In addition to the SEO and SEM benefits, when your site appears on another site you then receive traffic from visitors of the linking site. When those links appear on related sites you already know the person has an interest in your particular subject matter.</p>
<p>There are tons of methods (and scams) that people use to create lots of backlinks and traffic to their sites. One simple approach that has become a key part of my backlinking strategy is to comment on blogs and discussion forums regularly.</p>
<p>I’ve recently become a tea drinker, tea has amazing healing properties and health benefits in an 8 oz of cup of yummy deliciousness. I start my morning off with a hot cup of a kamiya papaya oolong and silver needle white tea blend which gives my body antioxidants, improves my skin, speeds my metabolism, and has anti-aging properties among other things.</p>
<p>Not only does my morning routine provide health benefits for my body, I couple my cup of tea with my RSS feed making it a healthy morning for my website and my business as well. Here’s my routine and how using it can benefit your business as well:</p>
<h3>Follow Blogs &amp; Forums Relevant to Your Target Audience</h3>
<p>I follow twelve or so blogs that share content around marketing, social media, SEO, content management, consulting, and other subjects that are relevant to my target audience. You want to choose enough sources that you have a variety of content to read and share, but not so many that you never have time to read them. You also want to choose sources that post regularly and have a solid following.</p>
<h3>Read &amp; Reply to Add Value</h3>
<p>Spend 15-20 minutes each morning (which is the amount of time it takes to enjoy a cup of tea) reading the blogs and forums that you’ve selected to follow. As you are reading if you have feedback, additional information to add, or questions for the author add your responses and include the link to your website.</p>
<p>The key here is to add value by include something more than “great post”. Approach it as you would a business conversation, you interject when you have something to say that adds to the discussion and not just to hear yourself speak. Also, be courteous; the comments section of another writers blog is not the place to self-promote.</p>
<h3>Share the Post with Your Networks</h3>
<p>Because you found the post of great value and have contributed to the discussion you want to make sure to share the resource with your social networks. Most blogs and forums have share buttons within the post that allow you to easily share the resource with others. This not only gives you additional content to share with your followers but furthers establishes you as an expert in your field who stays abreast of relevant topics and discussions.</p>
<h3>Measure the Response</h3>
<p>As with any marketing effort it is important to measure your results. My choice tools for measuring my linking strategy is using <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Through the “Links to your site” section of Google Webmaster Tools you can view sites linking to yours and how many incoming links they are creating. These are updated periodically and not in real time so it may take some time for this section to populate.</p>
<p>However, if over time you have commented on sites repeatedly and they aren’t showing up you may want to choose other sites to be more active on. The Google Analytics “Referral Traffic” report also shows web traffic that was referred to you from other sites. This allows you to see how much traffic each site is sending to yours to assess which blogs and forums you should be most active on. Together these tools allow you to achieve the greatest results from your efforts.</p>
<p>So tomorrow morning grab a cup of tea, log into your favorite RSS reader and give your SEO strategy a boost through effective link building.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been blogging for almost 5 years and in that time I have seen more bloggers come and go than I care to mention. The reality of blogging for profit is it’s incredibly difficult. A tiny percentage ever get to the point where they’re making sufficient income to cover their expenditure, never mind getting to the stage where they can upgrade from Ramen Noodles to filet mignon.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to share with you 7 mistakes that I regularly see new bloggers make and that are relatively easy to avoid.</p>
<h3>#1<br/>
Thinking It’s Going To Be Easy</h3>
<p>I really don’t care how many books you have read about 6-figure blogging, what forums you’re a member of, or how good a writer you are, blogging is still phenomenally difficult if you want to make a good income. And it’s only getting harder.</p>
<p>If you set off thinking it’s an easy way to quick cash, unless you are an SEO genius with lots of time on your hands, you’re going to get very frustrated, very quickly.</p>
<p>Of course some people have gone from zero to a highly profitable blog in a matter of a few months. But by the same token quite a few people have run a sub 10 second 100m, but that doesn’t mean you can.</p>
<p>That’s not a reason not to do it, but it is a reason not to quit your day job on a wave of enthusiasm brought on by getting 15 retweets for your second ever blog post.</p>
<h3>#2<br/>
Having The Same Plan As Everybody Else</h3>
<p>If you want to spend hours on end running around commenting on every blog under the sun, be my guest. If you want kiss some ‘A’ list booty, be my guest. If you want to spend half your waking day on Twitter or Facebook pimping your material, be my guest.</p>
<p>Just be aware you are one of tens of thousands doing exactly the same thing and it’s unlikely to get you where you want to be. Not that there is anything wrong with doing any of that stuff in moderation (and with a plan), but temper your expectations of the return on your investment.</p>
<p>Having the same plan as everybody else is effectively having no plan at all.</p>
<p>Do different stuff. Do unique stuff. Do stuff that gets people talking about you.</p>
<h3>#3<br/>
Asking For Help</h3>
<p>I follow everybody back on Twitter that talks to me. I have notifications turned off, but the minute somebody responds to me in any way I follow them back.</p>
<p>That is until I get a DM 10 minutes after I followed them asking me to retweet one of their posts or read their latest ebook. Seriously? We only just met and you want me to help you promote your business, a business that I don’t even know? Sometimes I patiently explain etiquette, sometimes I just unfollow them.</p>
<h3>#4<br/>
Not Asking For Help</h3>
<p>Ok, so I know I said asking for help was a mistake, but bear with me here, all will become clear.</p>
<p>I get an e-mail this morning from another Life Coach who’s just starting out asking me if I would mentor him. I said yes. I’ve just finished mentoring another coach and his timing was impeccable.</p>
<p>The thing is I already knew this guy. I considered him somewhat of a friend and I have been interacting with him for well over a year. I can, and do, say no regularly to people I know, but I NEVER begrudge them asking me. Isn’t that what friends are for?</p>
<h3>#5<br/>
Being Scared Of The Competition</h3>
<p>You have to have faith that you’re the best, or at the very least, one of the best, at whatever niche you’re in. I have no problem running guest posts from other Life Coaches or recommending their blogs to clients and potential clients. In fact Nicholas regularly runs guest posts here from people that some may consider competitors.</p>
<p>I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but it really isn’t. Mixing with, getting to know and then helping your peers demonstrates confidence and also builds up trust with your audience because they can see it’s not just about you.</p>
<h3>#6<br/>
Being Thin-Skinned</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend you go and read some of my early blog posts, but if you were so inclined you’d notice they all had one thing in common. They were crap.</p>
<p>Writing is a practice and it is something you will get better at the more you do it. When you first start it’s ok to publish some stuff that you’re not sure about.</p>
<p>Firstly, you won’t have too many readers to lose, but more importantly, what readers you do have will then be able to offer feedback. The key to this is if you get criticism to never, ever, take it personally!</p>
<p>Your readers don’t know you and when they respond to a post they are responding to what you’ve written and not YOU. I never ever delete comments criticizing me, in fact I welcome them because that’s how I learn and grow both as a coach and a writer.</p>
<p>Roll with the punches and you’ll learn a lot more quickly than if you get all defensive every time somebody disagrees with something you say.</p>
<h3>#7<br/>
Not Focusing On Keywords</h3>
<p>If you look at the link back to my site you will see it is under the term Life Coach. That’s because <a title="Professional Life Coaching" href="http://adaringadventure.com/" target="_blank">I’m a Life Coach</a> and when Google crawls this site I want it to stop and think “Hmm, this site is telling me that site is about Life Coaching, maybe I should send people looking for a Life Coach there?”</p>
<p>Inbound links are the life blood of successful sites. Why do you think Wikipedia is at the top of almost anything you search for? It’s because millions of other websites link to it and Google knows it will supply answers and therefore it’s highly relevant.</p>
<p>Work out how you want people to find you and focus on that keyword or keyword string. You may have to be a bit creative with this bit in avoiding coming up with search terms that aren’t insanely competitive. Deciding you want to be found under the term ‘Blogger’ aint gonna work, trust me.</p>
<p>Decide on your niche and stick to it. Ruthlessly.</p>

<title>3 Ways Social Media Can Get You Out In Front</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re launching a new business or want more customers for your current business. Or perhaps you are a book author who wants more fans to buy your books or eBooks.</p>
<p>You’ve heard about the power of social media for businesses, and you do have a Facebook profile to connect with your friends. But you’re not sure how you can use social media to connect with potential customers or book buyers.</p>
<h3>Blogging can help establish your expertise</h3>
<p>Blogging is social media – you write a blog post and people can comment about the post. Definitely a social experience.</p>
<p>Now for business purposes the topic area of your blog is very important. For example, if you sell handmade bedspreads, it is not a good idea to continually blog about the problems in your hometown with building restrictions unless you can think of a seamless way to include handmade bedspreads in the subject of each blog.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can stretch your creativity to come up with blog post topics that can include references to your business or book. In fact, thanks to John Locke’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Sold-Million-eBooks-Months/dp/1935670913/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314575651&amp;sr=1-6">”How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months”</a>I came up with a way to write blog posts about current events and include references to my eBook novel <a href="http://www.molliesanders.com">“Lt. Commander Mollie Sanders”</a>.</p>
<p>You definitely want to use blogging to showcase your expertise in connection with your business or book. And when you meet people at in-person networking groups, you can follow up by sending them a link to a specific post that addresses something they mentioned.</p>
<p>Another great reason to blog is that you then have good content to share on other social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook Pages, LinkedIn and now Google+. By using helpful tools such as HootSuite.com, you can send the links to your posts through to several social media sites without having to individually visit each of those sites.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also the advantage of encouraging others to share your blog posts via sharing applications, as Nicholas does here.</p>
<h3>Join forums such as LinkedIn groups that enable you to showcase your expertise</h3>
<p>Leaving insightful comments on blogs is a good way to get known – especially if you frequently leave comments on the same blog.</p>
<p>But let’s say you frequently leave comments here because you love what Nicholas says about online business as you sell dog beds via a company website. Now while several of the people reading Nicholas’ posts might be potential dog bed buyers, it is a very good idea to interact directly with people who have dogs.</p>
<p>For example, you can go on LinkedIn and do a search in groups for topics related to dogs. Then join the groups with the most members (the search results are returned with the groups in descending member numbers) and start participating by sharing good information on the questions dog owners ask.</p>
<p>You can put your website URL at the end of each comment so that people can learn more about your interest in dogs without you “selling” dog beds in the group. (Tip: You must put http:// in front of any URL you share on LinkedIn in order for it to be a hot link.)</p>
<h3>Participate on sites such as Twitter where you don’t need permission to connect with others</h3>
<p>I personally love Twitter for two main reasons:</p>
<p>1) I really like the limit of 140 characters, which forces people to be succinct instead of rambling on and on and on.</p>
<p>2) I can follow people who might be interested in what I have to offer without, for example, waiting for approval of a Facebook “friend” request or a LinkedIn “connection” request.</p>
<p>And while everyone I’d like to connect with may not follow me back (and many won’t), I have complete freedom to share good content connected to my interests.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14289" title="twitter" src="http://www.sitesketch101.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter4.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="100"/></p>
<p><strong>Secret tip:</strong> It doesn’t actually take as much time a day to be active on Twitter as those not yet on Twitter often fear. What it does take is a strategy so that you share worthwhile content in a small amount of time. (For example, you can tweet this post through this site’s tweet button and that’s one Twitter update “done for you.”)</p>
<p>In conclusion, for the above three ways as well as the many other ways that social media can help you get in front of your target audiences, just remember the difference between sharing personal (social) info and private info. Personal might be that you attended a concert; private is a fight you had with your boss. Personal is good; private is not!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some of you have hopefully noticed, I&#8217;ve been working on adding some animations to Site Sketch 101 when some of the navigation links are clicked to browse the site.  If you haven&#8217;t noticed them yet, simply click the home link at the top of this page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your feedback in the comments below. Do you like it, love it, or hate it? What do you think would be a neat animation to see at Site Sketch 101?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently been pushing myself to learn jQuery, the write less, do more Javascript library, and along with that study has come the discovery of the amazing power of jQuery. I feel like I&#8217;ve been living in a bomb shelter since I was born and this week I&#8217;ve climbed out the hatch and discovered the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. <strong>jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript. Taken from <a href="http://juery.com" target="_blank">jQuery.com</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve designed the animations at Site Sketch 101 to degrade gracefully in older browsers. In other words, the animations are built so that when a user loads the site and their browser doesn&#8217;t support all of the features that I&#8217;ve included, then it simply doesn&#8217;t show up. When a user running Internet Explorer 6 clicks a link at Site Sketch 101, they simply won&#8217;t see that animation and the click should go through as usual&#8230; At least that&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been working on adding these animations, I&#8217;ve grown to feel sorry for folks who use antiquated browsers. If you&#8217;re not using a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer 9 then you&#8217;re missing the full online experience.</p>
<p>If you like what you see at Site Sketch 101 and would like to have an animation, a functionality or some other customized experience or feature at your site, please get in touch with me. I&#8217;d be happy to help.</p>
<p>As an additional bonus, I have a bit more spare time since my discharge from the Army just over two months ago, so I&#8217;m also willing right now to work on your budget. Don&#8217;t worry about what I normally charge for a service. If you need coaching, banners, or anything mentioned above, let me know your budget and let&#8217;s make it work. In fact, I might even be willing to allow the barter system if you have some links, tweets or something else of value.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short, clear and concise. No matter what you’re writing, that should be your goal.</p>
<p>Back when I was a journalism undergrad (we&#8217;ll just skip over exactly how far back that was) one of my professors made it her personal goal in life to eliminate the phrase &#8220;in order to&#8221; from my writing. She had good reason. I used the phrase everywhere, and it weighed down my pages. The phrase is deadwood, word clutter that can be cut out and thrown away because it doesn’t add anything but length.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to cut out the deadwood, you just have to learn how to spot it.</p>
<h3>In the amount of&#8230;</h3>
<p>Take, for example, the phrase <em>in the amount of</em> — put more simply, you say <em>for</em> (ie, “in the amount of $20” or “for $20”). Instead of four words, you’ve only used one. How about <em>in the event of</em>? I see that phrase in a lot of writing, but instead, try <em>if</em>. Again, one word for four. A lot of people are fans of <em>advance planning</em> which, is also just <em>planning</em>. You can also <em>ask a question</em> or you can simply <em>ask</em>. I can <em>continue on</em> with examples, or I can just <em>continue</em>. Phrases like in <em>my opinion, as a matter of fact, type of</em> — just for example — can usually be cut entirely without changing the meaning of your sentence.</p>
<p>Deadwood isn’t the only way writing can get weighty. A lot of writers sprinkle modifiers — adjectives and adverbs — throughout their copy, thinking it will make their writing sparkle. Instead, it only dulls. Don’t take my word for it. Mark Twain once wrote in a letter, commending a friend’s writing style, that he shouldn’t “let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in. When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don&#8217;t mean utterly, but kill most of them &#8211; then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together.”</p>
<h3>Adverbs and Adjectives</h3>
<p>It’s true. One specific, vivid adjective or adverb will do a better job communicating than two or three dull ones. Better still are precise nouns and verbs in the place of adjectives and adverbs. Take “He slowly walked.” Slowly is an adverb and, no, there’s nothing technically wrong with that sentence, but did he walk slowly, or did he saunter? Maybe he ambled? Meandered? Don’t those words feel a little more lively and clear than the original? Worse yet is “He walked <em>very</em> slowly.” Very is a very favorite of new writers and it’s almost always unnecessary clutter.</p>
<p>The same goes for adjectives. We really don’t need to read more sentences about the “hot, bright sun” because, frankly, we know the sun is usually hot and bright. If you feel you must use an adjective, tell us the sun is chilly or searing or something out of the ordinary (and even searing isn’t that unusual) and you might pique my interest.</p>
<p><em><strong>The rule is simple:</strong> always strive to pick words that will convey your meaning in the clearest, most concise and simplest way.</em> You’ll be glad you did. My professor went at my writing with red pen gusto, and I thank her for it because today, I can barely stand to type the words &#8220;in order to&#8221; in this post without hitting the backspace key. We should all feel that way.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know what writer&#8217;s block is, and most of the time we are not happy about this experience. I battled with this issue for 3 months because mine was getting out of hand. Each time I tried to write something that was on my head, I went blank &#8211; the ideas are buried within my brain cells but no strategy to vomit them unto my book and then to my PC.</p>
<p>But I discovered a way to eliminate 95% of the factors that contribute to this. You will discover that the more content you have out there, the more influential and productive you will be. It&#8217;s not a good writer that wins in this blogging game, it&#8217;s the best writer.</p>
<p>If I have 200 guest posts on A-List blogs and you have 50 on the same type of blog, there is no way you can get more traffic than me. It&#8217;s just so simple and obvious.</p>
<p>Alright, here are the steps needed to eliminate writer&#8217;s block and set your writing in ablaze.</p>
<h4>1. Set A Writing Goal</h4>
<p>How many bloggers set goals before writing? I asked my readers one time and was shocked with the honest feedback. 70% of bloggers don&#8217;t even write down their goals and that is the problem. Until you set it out, make it a top priority, you&#8217;re not going to enjoy writing. It all boils down to what you love doing (passion). When I started out in this blogging game, I fell into this deadly trap and that was the beginning of my doom.</p>
<p>But today, I admonish you to write down your goals on paper and ink. Set out how many article you would write every week. For me, I write on my blog on Mondays and Thursdays. The remaining days are used for guest posting. But that&#8217;s mine, look at your Calendar and set your priorities right.</p>
<h4>2. Every Idea Is Worth It</h4>
<p>Does your idea seem worthless? Well, it does happen to every writer and blogger out there. You have that lovely idea but it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Here&#8217;s what I recommend: Don&#8217;t neglect that idea. It could be the best idea ever that encourages higher comments and tweets. Ideas usually drop on our brain like an egg in a nest. Write it down and later on, dig deeper into it and you would discover some hidden gems.</p>
<p>Remember: In every nonsense, there is sense. Mathematically:</p>
<p>Non + Sense = Nonsense<br/>
Therefore: Nonsense &#8211; none = sense.</p>
<p>I hope you like my tiny funny equation but look at it critically. It can transform your blogging career and make your write ups unique.</p>
<h4>3. Write With Your Own Voice</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ll continue to struggle with writer&#8217;s block until you find your own voice. Every blogger out there has their own writing voice, that is what differentiates you from the teaming crowd. Don&#8217;t try to be like any other writer out there &#8211; you can learn from them, read their blogs to get ideas but don&#8217;t follow their style. You&#8217;re unique and that is what sets you writing continuously, without any fear of accuracy or conciseness. Follow your voice, it pays great dividends.</p>
<p>Are you humorous, teasy and fun, let your words show it. Don&#8217;t be overly serious with your write up and if need be, tell a short story and your readers would love it.</p>
<h4>4. Use Acronyms To Get Writing Ideas</h4>
<p>I have been using acronyms to write my posts, it helps. It&#8217;s so simple but you&#8217;ll never lack ideas or concepts to produce interesting content.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I mean: You can write an article post on 7 tips to <a href="http://www.blast4trafficnow.net/increase-traffic-to-blog/">I.N.C.R.E.A.S.E traffic </a>to your blog. Each letter from that word &#8220;increase&#8221; is going to form a vital factor in increasing your blog&#8217;s traffic. First write down the meaning of those letters in your own way, your style and start writing. It&#8217;s the best adventure for writers.</p>
<h4>5. Read Blog Comments</h4>
<p>I have written several of my posts and guest posts from the ideas on comment section. There are helpful ideas when you go through concise comments. I don&#8217;t mean those spammy comments like &#8220;thank you,&#8221; I mean those bloggers that actually commented frankly.</p>
<p>Beginners can also ask intelligent questions and this could stand as your writing pivot. Don&#8217;t neglect this idea generation secret. It can help you in so many ways &#8211; e-book writing, article writing, public speaking, webinars and what have you.</p>
<p>With the above 5 steps, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll still have problems fighting writer&#8217;s block. But there is something that makes this possible and that is: action. Step out today, and practice what you have learned. See you at the top!</p>
