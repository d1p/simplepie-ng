I have been asked to create a student vs. Alumni vs. Teacher/Engineer/Mentor dodge ball game. This event will be used as a fundraiser and as an anger management tool. So far I have done nothing, but i need to gage how many people would be interested in coming before a location is decided. As far as a date goes (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LET ME KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU!!!</span></strong>) I was thinking sometime in May, maybe the 7th or 8th (Saturday or Sunday). As usual everything is subject to change and your input matters so feel free to respond via facebook or through the Alumni website or by email jkeith227@yahoo and let me know.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.hyperalumni.org/blog/rss-comments-entry-10705333.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Thank You!!</title><dc:creator>swmm1924</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2010 14:54:11 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.hyperalumni.org/blog/2010/12/27/thank-you.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">398387:5190205:9840891</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I just want to say Thank You to all those HYPER Alumni who volunteered at this years Lego League Competition.&nbsp; It was a successful event and a great day, we could not have done it without the help of all of our volunteers.</p>

Although there will probably be another meeting or two after LEGO League In my mind, it always serves two purposes, one is to of course Give back to the FIRST and Local Communities, and the other, The Reminder The season is about to Begin.</p>
<p>Our LEGO League even is always around a month before the Robotics Competition Kick-off and, due to the Holidays, is the last big act of the Pre-Season. There is Build up for weeks ahead of time, Preparation, Planning, organization, and then..what always ends up being a twelve hour long adrenalin rush. It is the spectacle that ends the year, and at the same time starts the next.</p>
<p>But I feel like it holds a new and different purpose for all us old timers, it is the one thing we can all still come back and do as good, if not better then we did when we were in high school. If my memory is correct we started holding these when I was 17, and now I'm 26. But this is the only thing I get to do now that is the same job I had then.</p>
<p>When I was a high schooler that first year I ran the pit I was scared,  no doubt about it. I don't even know how I ended up with it come to  think of it. But I took it as an Honor, and have ever since. And every  time I go back and do it...it always feels like I just did it last week.  Every time. But now I'm not scared at all when I think about it, now it  always puts a smile on my face, and so few things do that at just  thought thought of it.</p>
<p>I look forward to Collins and Geno doing there thing in front of the crowd, the kids always being ten times more polite then there parents, Charlie in kitchen, the familiar faces doing odd jobs or just stopping in, and even the loud music from 6am till close, and that team that missed two matches cause they never heard there number get called cause they were in the stands and now I need to find a way to get them in before the end of the day. I look forward to everything, the whole thing.</p>
<p>So I'm here for you Collins, I'm here for you Geno, For Michelle, Zach, and the Alumni, For Eddie, and for the Team. Very little gives me as much pleaser as getting to be a part of this does. And for that I think you. Lets Give them one Hell of a show.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.hyperalumni.org/blog/rss-comments-entry-9582906.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Lego League!</title><dc:creator>Chefbrianc</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2010 23:54:47 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.hyperalumni.org/blog/2010/9/26/lego-league.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">398387:5190205:9012796</guid><description><![CDATA[<p >Lego League is coming soon.... time to get ready and prepared for it.

<p>Hello one and all,</p>
<p>As you may or may not know I have been elected to be a sort of "fundraising cheerleader". My main responsiblity of this position is to encourge and suggest fund raising ideas that we can do as an alumni association both as our own and apart from the team. I myself am working an upcoming fundraising event. (Details to follow soon).</p>
<p>One of the goals we have decided to to set for ourselves this year is to raise $1000.00 to provide two $500 scholarships this year for two students. The best way we can reach this goal if through fund raising.</p>
<p>If there is anyone out there interested in fund raising please bring your ideas to the attention of the association. While all ideas are welcome we strong encorage you to lead a fund raising project of your own. It can be anything from a simple as coin collecting in local shops or as involved as charity ball. Anything and everything under the sun is possible with enough intuition and manpower.</p>
<p>So in closing please feel invited to start particpating in fundraising events for the HAA.</p>
<p>Below are a few ideas that have been kicked around. Feel free to use one of these or come up with your own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Halloween Costume Party</li>
<li>Casino Night</li>
<li>Flamingo Lawn Orniments</li>
<li>Team Mixer</li>
<li>Bingo Night</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the phrase though in reference to Alumni. Although not its original intention, the direct translation still plays&hellip;I was what you are, you will be what I am. At one point we were the students and the students will be addicted and unable to let go of the team just like we are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to join me in a little exercise I use to do before the start of the season. Ask yourself why the hell you&rsquo;re coming back. Why deal with the late nights, the possibly of injury, the sometimes bordom, the blood pumping adrenaline, the fact that three-weeks of your life could get scrapped at any second because of weight. The whole robot you&rsquo;ve worked on could get scrapped because it doesn&rsquo;t work, no one signing up for your part of the team, the kids who have no Idea what they are doing, Why do it&hellip;why?</p>
<p>I had so many reasons for coming back each year. From feeling only at home on that concrete floor of the CTE, only feeling alive the first time you see the robot turn on, or when it gets destroyed in a bad practice session two hours before it ships. Running only on adrenaline and no sleep for days on end, the thrill of hearing the team called for anything in the awards ceremony. I came back for all those things early on.</p>
<p>The last few years I got to volunteer I mellowed out some. I actually did have knee problems now, partially from the concrete floor I called home. When I filled out health forms and listed all the things I was frequently exposed to, I started to realize the long term health problems from the amount of things I&rsquo;ve likely breathed in. I had a job that kept me away most nights. When I was living in town it would slow me down most weekend mornings. My friends who didn&rsquo;t understand robotics would invite me out weekend nights so after working on robots I&rsquo;d go out all night. My life to be sure would have been easier without it. Trying to balance School, Life, Making a living, and Robotics was becoming difficult. If it was just the old reasons, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough; the old reasons, were gone. What remained were Family, Friends, and a love of the game.</p>
<p>It came with a strong realization; The Team didn&rsquo;t need me, never has. If you think you play a vital role to the team, you&rsquo;re right. If you think the team can&rsquo;t go on without you, you&rsquo;re wrong. Look at me, Active Team member for years, Helped train kids, teach skills, machine parts, set up events, MC events, run events, inspire students, and every so often get to build something. I up and left. The team did fine the next year.</p>
<p>So then I did I come back? The reason was because I wanted to be there and celebrate the victories with the team when they won, help get over losses, and cheer them into the fight to win again. I wanted to help these kids learn the skills I have, to become <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as good as I was</span> better than I am. To live in that thrill of five minutes before a match when the machine still won&rsquo;t work, and then to get it going as you push it on to the field. When tools won&rsquo;t do and you have to brute force and will to get something to work. I once saw a man on another team&hellip;Smash his hand with a mallet to put a gear in place. I saw that and thought&hellip;I&rsquo;d do that if I thought that&rsquo;s what it takes. I had to come back to see us get to the finals with a robot that we thought couldn&rsquo;t win. I needed to be a part of the group of people who would do that, and maybe, be one of the people who would do it too not for my own glory, but for there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If you look back at your times and feel like you were in the limelight then, I have a message for you now isn&rsquo;t the time for glory seeking. Now is the time to Help these Kids find their path, help them reach their goals. Because we know what it&rsquo;s like to be in there shoes, to want the win, to want to taste victory, to want to be the one people point to and say, they are the best there ever was.</p>
<p>So to All Alumni who go back, I wish to remind you this is not your time, this is there time, think back to what you needed in High School, what kind of person could have helped you achieve the goal and dreams you wanted and become that person for someone else, Help them seek out their own glory. Because they are what you were&hellip;and if you do your job right&hellip;they will be what you are.</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Well it&rsquo;s been a while since my last update and I can&rsquo;t say too much has happened since then. But just because it&rsquo;s the off season doesn&rsquo;t me nothing is going on. The AA is continuing to improve and evolve in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">At out last few meetings we have any a steady growth of attendance. I can remember during the build season and the first few months afterwards there would be only a handful of people there. Now I seen new faces, and more and more people each meeting. Recruiting new members is one of our goals so if you haven&rsquo;t been to a meeting before come to our next one or the one after that if you&rsquo;re busy. There really aren&rsquo;t any specific procedures or regulations that would make a newcomer feel out of place.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">I as said earlier the AA has decided upon a few new goals to work on. The first of which was attendance. I believe we agree that we should try to get 2-4 new people at each event that hadn&rsquo;t been to that event previously. For anyone interested you can find more information about events on the &ldquo;Events&rdquo; section of this web page. Our two next events are the team cook out and Junkyard wars.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">I happened to be on the winning team at the first Junkyard wars and let me say I don&rsquo;t mean to not bring the ruckus again this year. So watch out to anyone looking to dethrone me. Based on some of the entries last year I don&rsquo;t think it will be a problem. I think our biggest fear was the team (not saying any names here) that tried to sink a power tool case in the water. For those of you unfamiliar with power tool cases, they are usually made out of molded plastic and have lots of air pockets in them that are only accessible through tiny holes. I think in the end it took that team about half an hour of sitting on the case in the water to turn it into an anchor.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Enough about junk yard wars we&rsquo;ll see who the ultimate winner is on Aug 14. Our other main goals for the AA were to raise money and to provide at least 5 team dinners during the year.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Personally I think the dinner&rsquo;s thing is a really simple and attainable goal. Thinking about all the meals I ate back when I was on the team and realizing the amount of generosity and effort that went into them makes me feel very grateful and humble. So anyone one out there who wants to just give back in a big way but doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of free time to donate every week here&rsquo;s your chance.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">As for the fund raising Matt Ryan and myself have sort of taken over the planning of the bowl-a-thon fund raiser. No details yet but keep checking for them soon.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">In closing I would like to say that I hope anybody reading this that is a member of the AA will continue to be active with association and take on new challenges. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never been to a meeting and would like to attend. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never posted a comment or a blog item on the website. Maybe you haven&rsquo;t been to a robotics event in a long time and would like to return. Whatever it is you decide to do please do it and make sure your presence is know in some fashion.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Thanks!</span></p>

But the most devastating failure, the biggest pit crew fail, is a story not often told and is something that was so fast paced and emotionally painful to me that I have actually blocked the fine details of it from memory. We failed, and because we failed we didn&rsquo;t win the next match. We were in the finals, subject to elimination, with arguably the best &ldquo;robot to game&rdquo; match we made up to that point.</p>
<p>A little background, the Wedge bot was as its nickname suggests, wedged shaped. It was small, 30 inches wide, 32 inches long and only 11.5 inches tall. We went over max weight and had to cut several &ldquo;lightning&rdquo; holes in it to bring it down. It had the most pneumatics I think we ever used on a robot and was the last robot to use the old drill motors to power its drive train. These systems were rock solid. When we left to compete we had a small air leak that Will Wong solved using the power of his mind, not doing what I was doing and foolishly searching for the leak by touch, sound, or sight. But purely by thinking were the most likely place the leak would be. But there was a fatal flaw, The Tape Drive.</p>
<p>Our robot would open up and extend a ramp down; the only thing we had at our disposal to use in this case was the now archaic tape drive. &nbsp;Tape drives are a beast I&rsquo;m glad to say the current generations of Robot engineers do not deal with in FIRST. They jam, they stick, they burn out; It&rsquo;s a high maintenance system. Geno and I had lots of tape drive experience from the previous year, the Cherry Picker&hellip;The crowd pleaser. A 17 foot tall arm on wheels that was so off balance it needed to latch on the field to keep its self, upright. Two feet of its high were generated by a telescoping midsection that was run by two tape drive motors and two, five foot lengths of tape. This was a system that took an hour or two to replace before we shipped. We had to rebuild it so often that both pit crews got so use to replacing the whole system between matches that we could do it in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The Tape drive was only one of many issues on the Cherry picker, but it was the system to wait to die on the Wedge. Just sit, and watch, and wait. We managed to win the New England regional with very little maintenance, very few problems, and no major system failures. Compared to the previous year we felt like the robot was babying us. We went to the Nationals and were treated to the same thing. We were making balloon animals in the pits we had so much extra time. Then the division finals rolled around. Disaster struck.</p>
<p>The Ramp got jammed up, we often times didn&rsquo;t even use it, but the strategy for the division series required it. We tried to fix it between rounds, need to get it to work, trying to pry the tape out, yanking pulling, ramming the ramp back into the machine. There wasn&rsquo;t time, there weren&rsquo;t parts&hellip;</p>
<p>Defeat.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get it running in time. We went back on the field with a sub-par machine and we lost it. We had a shot for title, we could have made it. Here we were at the pinnacle of our sport, in Disney the happiest place on earth, and for a little bit I felt like I could just die or shame and failed. That was a pivotal moment for me, and I can&rsquo;t remember all the details. For the first time, I truly felt like I had failed and not just myself, but my brothers, my friends, my team; I failed them all. I wasn&rsquo;t alone trying to fix the problem; in my mind&rsquo;s eye I see Zach, Geno, Will, Zhang, and Pappy there (I&rsquo;m sure there were others there too). These are the guys I would call to solve any problem I have with anything, my dream team, and we all failed together.</p>
<p>That was our baptism under fire. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when I stopped thinking of these guys as friends, and started thinking of them as brothers, thinking of the Team as a family. We failed, but we still supported each other. No blame was laid, only thanks. Chernicki shock my hand and thanked me for doing a great job, when I felt it wasn&rsquo;t enough, Mr. Joyce patted us on the back, and acted like nothing was different, just another lost match.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, we all shook it off. We sucked it in, walked it off, and together silently vowed to do better next time.</p>

How can you keep the kids informed, how do you keep them interested when there is nothing to have them do.</p>
<p>This is truly our first off season as an organization and while I&rsquo;d say I spent the last two months not working directly on the website. I&rsquo;ve had more conversations about Team HYPER and the 69AA (Zach said it to my on Sunday morning and I have to say I like the phrase) then I think I&rsquo;ve had in a year.</p>
<p>I feel like we are gearing up for a fight, we are getting ready, having brainstorming sessions, re-organizing, focusing in on our jobs and tasks, and I have to say I&rsquo;m more excited than I have been in a long time about the group as a whole. I feel like we are trying to be a team of our own. It is all cause for excitement.</p>
<p>But then you look at the website&hellip;almost no updates in a month. The Junkyard wars info will get posted when we have a time (date is August 14th) but otherwise, not a lot going on here. I have wound down on my posts because as much as I love talking about my glory days it has done little to encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>So given that we are both in a slump of things to talk about, and rebuilding and trying to make things better I come to you with what I hope to do for you in the blog:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Griff Grifferson facade is grinding on Marc Griffin, and the self-aggrandizing of the greatest generation is starting to bother even myself. I was hoping it would start a war, a conflict, people saying no&hellip;we did great things, better things. Get the discussions going about the greatest things there group did&hellip;But no one has done it in the public forum. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll start talking more in generalities about things I&rsquo;ve seen on the team and be slightly less bothersome and hopefully people will write more often. Myles saved June on the blog, and I hope I&rsquo;m not the one to save July. This page has been up for a year, and I&rsquo;d like to consider that year my childhood; much like my time as a student on the team. It&rsquo;s time for me to enter back into being more Idealistic, cerebral, analytical, and helpful.</p>
<p>I hope that in the coming year I am more of the Griff you know as the Idealistic, stubborn, and helpful person and not the egotist you&rsquo;ve seen write.</p>
<p>This page will get better, and we are working to make it great. I will work to be great for you as well.</p>

<p>After the team dinner and awards ceremony last Thursday I have done some reflecting. As I watched the speeches giving by many members of our team I thought back to the team dinners of my years.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a separate day for our dinners they usually were one night during a competition. We&rsquo;d listen to visiting higher ups from Gillette, most of whom we didn&rsquo;t know, stand and speak to us about how much the team meant to us and how important it was to have young people involved in science and technology. After some unrememberable dinner there would usually be a photo slideshow/montage. As per tradition that year&rsquo;s seniors were heavily pictured. Then it was off to &ldquo;mandatory fun night&rdquo; which usually took place in the same banquet all. All but a few adults would leave us and a room with very little to do. Sure a few amenities like board games or a TV were provided but all and all it was usually pretty frustrating.</p>
<p>In those times I can remember feeling like Steve McQueen in the great escape or Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke, watching the exits and the adults as they patrolled back and forth. I was just waiting for the chance to break out and have my own moment of utter freedom similar to Tim Robbins tumultuous escape climax in The Shawshank Redemption. But alas, no such fantasy came true.</p>
<p>The team dinners of today are of a different breed. Gone are the hyper polo shirts and we were all forced to wear. Replaced by shirts and ties. I think this lends a level of professionalism to the team. Each and every senior their looked like they were ready to enter the adult world and embrace what was a head of them.</p>
<p>No longer do we have our team dinner at competition. Gone is the feeling that the entire event only took place in order to occupy 30-40 kids for evening in a different city where the teachers were responsible for their well being. Now it truly does feel like an evening of thanks and reflection.</p>
<p>The biggest difference of all is the awards and recognitions. In my day we didn&rsquo;t have these nor did we ask for them. It&rsquo;s tough to say whether or not I feel as though we should have had them or not. In my day the biggest honor you could get was being selected for pit crew or drive team. And, as it still is today, it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Knowing that when everything was on the line at competition we few, we happy few, were the one&rsquo;s responsible for match&rsquo;s lost or won was something to be proud of.</p>
<p>I cannot say if this feeling still exists. I&rsquo;ve caught brief glimpses of it during the year and I hope that the members of the pit crew and drive team know what it is that I am talking about, because it was a special feeling that I have found difficult to find anywhere else in life.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I can think of many students who came and went on the team totally unrecognized. Perhaps they were on chairman&rsquo;s or animation. Areas we&rsquo;ve always competed in but have yet to win. They worked hard as well and deserved recognition as much as the rest of the team. There were even students whose so function was just to be and odd job filler, supporting the team when and where it needed it. Their names should not be forgotten either.</p>
<p>I guess it would have been nice if we had a way to recognize those members then. But such is life. We have lived and learned and I have no doubt that new traditions and protocol will be born in the years to come that we&rsquo;ll look at and say &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we do this earlier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s cliqued but I still would have loved to have heard Greenday on one of those photo montages, I had it in my day and probably in days before me. But a clique or not the words still ring true, especially for the seniors:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something unpredictable, but in the end it&rsquo;s right. I hope you had the time of your lives.</p>
