All countries who are fully fledged members of the European Union. But not all of these people are originally from these countries they call home. One of them is actually a holder of a S-Korean passport and another has a family that traces its routes to Russia. Now based on the propaganda from the &lt;a href="http://www.heimssyn.is/"&gt;anti-EU camp&lt;/a&gt; here in Iceland. This sort of thing should be impossible. Apparently as soon as Iceland signs up to the European Union. All foreign relations will be closed. Except to countries within the EU. It's like we wouldn't be able to attract any foreign investment or foreigners to Iceland. Except from countries within the EU. We'll become part of this. Hold on a second. I'm not even going to use this metaphor. Because it's so incredibly stupid that it's like a white person trying to argue that using the "N" word is just part of "open and frank discussion on racial issues". So I won't say it. But &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Europe"&gt;here's a link to it&lt;/a&gt;. Just don't say I didn't warn you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I'll have to admit that I was surprised to learn. That Poland has been a magnet for foreign investment since it joined the EU. I actually shouldn't have. After all the Polish have a great central location. Actually right in the middle of Europe. Once the Soviet block collapsed. The Poles started to draw in foreign investors. I'm sure the foreign investors liked the fact that wages were low. But I don't think it was just that. I'm sure that they also liked the fact that Poland was quick to apply for both EU and NATO membership. After all, when you are thinking about how to invest your money, you'd rather not invest it somewhere without a clear legal environment. You'd also want to be able to get to your money when you need it. You'd prefer a location with a well educated population. Somewhere with a political system that wasn't corrupt. A location that offered good transportation options to your key markets. Now I'm thinking how well Iceland seems to measure up to these requirements. How well does your own country do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough with the political stuff. I've seen some fantastic movies lately. Saw &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1069238/"&gt;Departures&lt;/a&gt; the other day. Departures is a 2008 Japanese film by Yōjirō Takita. It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2009 Oscars. Fantastic movie. If you have some time and know how to find this movie. Do yourself a favor and get it and watch it. It's such a refreshing experience to see such a good movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MOar08f-OnI&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MOar08f-OnI&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-6689724905887498885?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/6689724905887498885/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=6689724905887498885&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/6689724905887498885'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/6689724905887498885'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/08/foreigners-in-iceland.html' title='Foreigners in Iceland'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-3892592780094730673</id><published>2010-07-13T19:47:00.005Z</published><updated>2010-07-14T00:41:12.754Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Icelandic culture'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='culture'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='patriotism'/><title type='text'>Isolationism Isn't Patriotism</title><content type='html'>I’m becoming less tolerant of xenophobia and isolationism than I’ve been in the past. Doesn’t mean that I believe that every culture under the sun is equal. I’m actually quite proud of my Nordic cultural roots. There’s something to be said for societies that seem to have managed to find a way to make their kids &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2010/0511/1224270129062.html"&gt;the smartest in the world&lt;/a&gt;. To have governments with some of the &lt;a href="http://www.norges-bank.no/templates/article____12330.aspx"&gt;lowest debt ratios in the world&lt;/a&gt; (and no it’s not my own). To create societies that guarantee everyone access to basic (and quite extensive in some cases) health care, education and social services. To create societies with some of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index"&gt;the best living standards in the world according to the UN&lt;/a&gt;. It really irritates the right wing nutters in the US that for some strange reason the Nordic countries seem to manage to offer both generally high levels of wealth creation and some of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model"&gt;best social welfare structures&lt;/a&gt; in the world. I’m quite proud of this fact and I think there’s a lot here that others could learn from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason why I’m so proud of my background is because I’ve actually had an opportunity to contrast it with other places. Yesterday I was listening to a program on the BBC. &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071p9d"&gt;Jeremy Hardy Speaks To the Nation&lt;/a&gt;. The subject was what it means to be British. Again and again I found myself nodding in agreement with Jeremy. One of the things he mentioned. Was the fact that Britain might actually have been ruled by the Scandinavians instead of being invaded by the Normans (which shouldn’t be confused with the Norwegians, but actually come from Normandy). One of the great things about Britain. One of the things I like the most about Britain. Is how multi cultural it is. They’ve actually managed to be fairly successful in creating a multi cultural society. I really love this fact. Like Jeremy put it: “I can honestly say that I can be the only white person on a bus and not even notice. Conversely, if I’m on the bus and everybody is white, I’m thinking; blimey there really are a lot of Polish people in the country”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDzMsDYJCVI/AAAAAAAAAZs/wahESElNifE/s1600/interracial-dating.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 325px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDzMsDYJCVI/AAAAAAAAAZs/wahESElNifE/s400/interracial-dating.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5493490702678034770" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because Iceland managed to be isolated, have a fairly homogenous culture and a language that hardly changed for hundreds of years. Isn’t in my view any reason why we should fight to keep it that way. After all, the more isolated we were, the poorer Iceland was. Our most prosperous period. Is the modern period. We’ve never had it so good in our entire history. Does anyone really want to go back to a situation that saw Iceland being isolated from the rest of the world? Does anyone really think that it makes sense to only export stuff and not import anything? Anyone want to live just on “pure” Icelandic products? Anyone seriously want to argue that too many people in Iceland? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been lucky enough to live abroad for more than a couple of weeks on vacation. That’s when I really started to appreciate people with varied backgrounds. Because I’m not trying to argue that you don’t have stupid and ignorant people evenly spread out around the world. I think on the whole you do. But what I really could appreciate was the fact that there were spices beyond just salt and pepper. That you could do something else with fish than boil it and serve it with potatoes and butter. That cheese didn’t just come in one size and a single flavour. I was exposed to various cultures and I survived it just fine. I actually realized that Iceland was poorer for not being exposed to these influences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still remember one incidence. We have lots of really nice swimming pools here and I was babysitting my sisters oldest. He loved the water and this was the best fun you could offer him. I’m not sure exactly how old he was. Somewhere between knowing how to talk and not having started elementary school. And we were chilling along with a number of other people in one of the small hot pots when this dark skinned guy came into it. My cousin was really surprised and I think this was probably the first time he had seen someone who wasn’t a white caucasian. Because he came to me and asked: “How come he didn’t take a shower and get clean”? Which I thought was extremely funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m going to make the words of Jeremy Hardy my own this time around “I’m actually very fond of our land and it’s people. But I believe that patriotism like religion and flatulence should be private”. Your idea of what makes your home country great could be quite different from mine. Doesn’t mean that your brand of patriotism is any less genuine than mine. So show me the same respect. I just don’t accept that those who want to keep Iceland isolated, have any claim to a superior brand of patriotism.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UoL_tR5nARg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UoL_tR5nARg&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-3892592780094730673?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/3892592780094730673/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=3892592780094730673&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3892592780094730673'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3892592780094730673'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/07/isolationism-isnt-patriotism.html' title='Isolationism Isn&apos;t Patriotism'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDzMsDYJCVI/AAAAAAAAAZs/wahESElNifE/s72-c/interracial-dating.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-4970796553323752098</id><published>2010-07-06T20:17:00.011Z</published><updated>2010-07-06T20:40:46.726Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RSA'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='economics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='motivation'/><title type='text'>What Motivates Us</title><content type='html'>I recently posted a video on my Facebook profile. The thing is. Not everyone who reads this blog is my friend on Facebook. So I want to share it here as well. Just make sure that it gets more distribution. I know that some of the people who read this blog aren’t connected to me on Facebook. They might not want to do so. But I'm easy enough to find there - just look for Sigmundur Halldorsson - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this was a brilliant video which the author of &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/"&gt;the Grand Narrative&lt;/a&gt; posted on Facebook and I picked it up from there. Takes you about 10 minutes to watch. But it's really time well spent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="510" height="311"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u6XAPnuFjJc&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u6XAPnuFjJc&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="510" height="311"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's brilliant about this video is that it actually made me discover the &lt;a href="http://www.thersa.org"&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;. Made me realize that even a 250 year old organisation can be doing stuff that makes me love the web all over again. "For over 250 years the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) has been a cradle of enlightenment thinking and a force for social progress.  Our approach is multi-disciplinary, politically independent and combines cutting edge research and policy development with practical action." They've produced some other good ones. It's really worth jumping over to YouTube to see some of their other stuff if you've only seen this one.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-4970796553323752098?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/4970796553323752098/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=4970796553323752098&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/4970796553323752098'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/4970796553323752098'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/07/what-motivates-us.html' title='What Motivates Us'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-8274268211820334016</id><published>2010-07-05T21:34:00.003Z</published><updated>2010-07-06T19:37:59.036Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='xenophobia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Iceland'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='China'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='foreign relations'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='EU'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='isolationism'/><title type='text'>On Xenophobia and Isolationism in Iceland</title><content type='html'>One of the rather unfortunate side effects of the economic downturn is the rise in xenophobia and isolationism here in Iceland. It’s a sort of siege mentality. Appropriately enough there’s even a book out called “&lt;a href="http://www.stjornmalogstjornsysla.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=460"&gt;The Siege&lt;/a&gt;” (links to an Icelandic review of the book) in which the author, Styrmir Gunnarsson, argues that foreign banks, the IMF and the European Union set out to destroy the Icelandic economy and take over our resources. It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that Styrmir (we go by first names here in Iceland) is a &lt;a href="http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/former-morgunbladid-editor-styrmir-gunnarsson-on-why-iceland-should-not-join-the-eu"&gt;member of the Icelandic anti EU movement&lt;/a&gt;. The same arguments can be heard in many quarters these days and recent public opinion surveys show a negative attitude towards Iceland joining the European Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t say that I’m surprised. Iceland was for a very long time a homogenous society, with relatively little contact with the outside world. Our nationalism is based on the same foundations of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_race"&gt;Nordic superiority&lt;/a&gt; as was evident in parts of Europe until 1945 and we haven’t really adjusted to the fact that this idea was completely rejected. Nor have we been able to follow the rather obvious trend in European foreign policy, which is the idea that working together makes the whole stronger than the individual nations. To me this seems fairly self evident. In an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations"&gt;international system based upon anarchy&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. might makes right), the rule of law pushed for by the European Union, makes a lot of sense for a small weak nation state like Iceland. Indeed we have been quite happy to become members of NATO. This despite not having our own army, which sort begs the question of what support we would give in the event of an attack on another NATO member state. We are long time members of the UN, WTO (formerly GATT) and numerous other international bodies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I’ve been thinking about what might explain our reluctance to become full fledged members of the most successful supranational democratic institution ever created. We’re quite close in cultural terms to Norway and it’s worth noting that Norway has twice rejected EU membership. I’ve looked at the multiple reasons given by the objectors and there seem to be a common thread there. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The foreigners are out to get us&lt;/span&gt;. Which is strange considering Icelandic history. We may have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars"&gt;fought over fishing rights with the UK&lt;/a&gt;, but in general our history has few indications that foreigners have a particular interest in taking over Iceland. Even the US seems to have shown considerable restraint in &lt;a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_cold_war_studies/v006/6.4ingimundarson.pdf"&gt;interfering in Icelandic affairs&lt;/a&gt; during the cold war. So without any actual evidence for this idea, it’s hard to take it seriously. As a matter of fact, besides us paying back loans we may have taken out from banks around the world, I don’t think foreigners have a great deal of interest in Iceland or our affairs. Indeed the evidence seems to point in the opposite direction. It seems to indicate that foreign interest in Iceland is generally positive and benign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDJTuB3rTLI/AAAAAAAAAZk/4hC27f4JZz8/s1600/Yellow+Danger.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 276px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDJTuB3rTLI/AAAAAAAAAZk/4hC27f4JZz8/s400/Yellow+Danger.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490542945959103666" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently we had a great example of this. &lt;a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/7020584.html"&gt;A Chinese government official came to visit Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. We ended up getting credit lines from the Chinese central bank, some commercial agreements and in general some positive indications from the Chinese that they would like to be seen as friends of Iceland. Surprisingly, this seemed to have the opposite effect. At least if you read the &lt;a href="http://silfuregils.eyjan.is/2010/06/11/hvad-vilja-kinverjar/"&gt;Icelandic blogsphere&lt;/a&gt; (link in Icelandic) and news media. Immediately some Icelandic commentators started speculating on the ulterior motives of the scheming Chinese. The Chinese were here to take over our resources. Which would be easy enough for them to do. We have 3 bankrupt banks which would cost them about 1 days revenue (or less) to purchase outright. Along with deeds to just about every resource we have. But they haven’t shown the slightest bit of interest in doing so. The Chinese Embassy has just moved into a much larger building. Becoming overnight, the largest embassy in Reykjavik. But this might simply be a matter of sound commercial judgement by the Chinese. After all real estate prices have plummeted in Reykjavik, so they probably got a good deal on the new embassy building. Nonetheless, I’m not naive enough to think that the Chinese did this out of the goodness of their hearts. As a matter of fact, this gesture is in line with current Chinese foreign policy. Of building up goodwill among a broad spectrum of nations. Furthermore, if the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage"&gt;Northwestern passage&lt;/a&gt; opens up. Iceland might become a great place to have a friendly container port. But it’s hard to imagine that we’d place special restrictions on international shipping, including the Chinese. What is of deep interest to the Chinese is building positive relations with nations in NATO and the European Union. I think this interest in Iceland is a great opportunity for us. There is already a positive relationship between us and China. China is a rapidly rising power. Second largest economic power in the world already and set to surpass the US within a few years. It all reminds me of something my a former colleague of mine used to say: “The east is not a beast, but a feast”. Which is true on multiple levels. Instead of being frightened of the rest of the world, we should be open to it. Embrace the opportunity offered by membership in the EU. Embrace the opportunity offered by friendly relations with the Chinese. Being afraid, isolationist and xenophobic is surely the road to ruin.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-8274268211820334016?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/8274268211820334016/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=8274268211820334016&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/8274268211820334016'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/8274268211820334016'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/07/on-xenophobia-and-isolationism-in.html' title='On Xenophobia and Isolationism in Iceland'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/TDJTuB3rTLI/AAAAAAAAAZk/4hC27f4JZz8/s72-c/Yellow+Danger.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-5738710176734516888</id><published>2010-07-02T13:24:00.006Z</published><updated>2010-07-07T11:00:23.258Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='350'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='environment'/><title type='text'>An Important Date 10.10.10</title><content type='html'>From: Bill McKibben - 350.org&lt;br /&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 29, 2010 at 3:28 PM&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Circle this date.&lt;br /&gt;To: You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear World,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a tough year: in North America, oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico; in Asia some of the highest temperatures ever recorded; in the Arctic, the fastest melting of sea ice ever seen; in Latin America, record rainfalls washing away whole mountainsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we're having a party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circle 10/10/10 on your calendar. That's the date. The place is wherever you live. And the point is to do something that will help deal with global warming in your city or community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're calling it a Global Work Party, with emphasis on both 'work' and 'party'. In Auckland, New Zealand, they're having a giant bike fix-up day, to get every bicycle in the city back on the road. In the Maldives, they're putting up solar panels on the President's office. In Kampala, Uganda, they're going to plant thousands of trees, and in Bolivia they're installing solar stoves for a massive carbon neutral picnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we've already worked hard to call, email, petition, and protest to get politicians to move, and they haven't moved fast enough, now it's time to show that we really do have the tools we need to get serious about the climate crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 10/10/10 we'll show that we the people can do this--but we need bold energy policies from our political leaders to do it on a scale that truly matters.  The goal of the day is not to solve the climate crisis one project at a time, but to send a pointed political message: if we can get to work, you can get to work too--on the legislation and the treaties that will make all our work easier in the long run. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;You can sign up to host a local event at &lt;a href="http://www.350.org/oct10"&gt;www.350.org/oct10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Or search for an event to join at &lt;a href="http://www.350.org/map"&gt;www.350.org/map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't worry about being alone at this party: there are already 1077 groups in 109 countries around the world scheduled to do something great that day. We'll knit all these groups together with a powerful mosaic of photos, videos, and stories from around the world. You wouldn't want to miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a tough year--but it can be a beautiful day on the 10th Of October if we work together, and party together. And if we do it right, then we'll take a big step towards the kind of political solutions we desperately need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill McKibben and the 350.org team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you feel a little shy, or wonder if you can really make a party work, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/350org/sets/72157622455212282/"&gt;check out these pictures from last year's Global Day of Action&lt;/a&gt;.

I came across this blog through music. A friend of mine. One of the better dj’s here in Iceland. A guy who’s both mixed better and produced some of the sweetest sounds I’ve heard in my life. Once said that "music is a universal language". There’s a lot of truth in that. So at some point some months ago. I was on YouTube looking for stuff to watch and listen to. Because YouTube isn’t just for great videos, it’s also a great source of music you can’t find anywhere else. I don’t know if you’ve noticed this. But if you register on YouTube, it will recommend stuff for you to watch. For some reason, on this particular day it recommended that I watch some South Korean music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point in time I knew nothing about S-Korean music at all. My main musical taste is electronic dance music. House and techno and that sort of stuff is the soundtrack of my life and S-Korea isn’t exactly famous for producing it. As it turned out this was a promotion by one of the largest music publishers in S-Korea. A firm called &lt;a href="http://www.smtown.com/"&gt;SM-Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; which was promoting their most popular act &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls'_Generation"&gt;Girls Generation&lt;/a&gt;. You might be familiar with the concept of girls groups. But this was taking it to a whole new level. Here they had 9 girls in a single group. The song wasn’t bad, but didn’t strike me as all that great, even if the girls where easy on the eyes and I sort of watched the video and thought to myself. “Interesting to see the girl group concept in an Asian version”. What surprised me a bit afterwards, was the fact that the song stuck in my head. If you’re interested here’s &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwiSpudKWI"&gt;the video to the song&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first introduction to the Korean music marketing machine. I have have an interest in music related things and one of the things I can appreciate is a well written pop song. There’s a formula behind it. It’s the length of the old time 7 inch single. Somewhere around 3-4 minutes long. It contains a hook that for some reason sticks in your head. This song did. So that got me interested in discovering more S-Korean pop music. Which turned out to be an adventure in discovering a thriving music industry that is apparently quite successful in Asia and starting to get more attention further afield. Something that is known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave"&gt;Korean wave&lt;/a&gt;. From an Icelandic viewpoint. The pop stuff looked quite similar to many of the pop groups being promoted here. What I didn’t know. Until I started reading the Grand Narrative. Was that S-Korean society is quite different from ours.  For one thing it’s based on the Confucian societal ideal. Which is quite different from ours. There’s also a disparity in the status of the sexes. Something we here find a bit strange. But the one similarity I found striking. There’s a strong streak in S-Korean society about keeping it homogenous. A feeling of cultural identity that apparently leads people there to respond to foreigners comments and criticism of S-Korean society by saying that they don’t understand what’s special about S-Korea. Which reminds me of our viewpoint. That Iceland is in some way unique. In my view there’s actually a very strong streak of xenophobia and racism here. A sense that seems to be shared by a large part of the Icelandic population. That evil foreigners are plotting to exploit us. Which to me seems somewhat farfetched. So with that in mind, what made S-Korean popular music interesting is that it didn’t seem that different from what I’d seen before from artist in N-America or Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t until I started reading The Grand Narrative that I realized that actually there’s quite a bit more to it. As I mentioned before the status of the genders is quite different from what we take for granted here. The rise of the Korean girls groups, of which there are now quite a few popular examples. Might actually be a reflection of a change in the gender roles within Korean society. That these gender roles would be best described as traditional might be an understatement. For example the wage disparity between men and women in S-Korea is the highest in all of the OECD countries and &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/2010/04/19/korean-gender-issues/"&gt;on average women in S-Korea only earn 60% of what men do&lt;/a&gt;. That there are quite strict societal norms concerning the relations between the sexes, which result in women being &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/2008/12/10/why-korean-girls-dont-say-no-contraception-commercials-condom-use-and-double-standards-in-south-korea/"&gt;ill informed about family planning&lt;/a&gt; and women having to suffer all sorts of &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/2009/02/05/for-every-birth-a-korean-career-dies/"&gt;inequalities in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;. That S-Korea has one of the &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/2008/08/29/korea-as-a-social-laboratory-the-impending-depopulation-crisis/"&gt;lowest birthrates around&lt;/a&gt; and that due to the emphasis on outward appearance it’s common for most of these pop group members to have undergone some sort of plastic surgery. That while some of these groups use strong sexual under (and over) tones in their visual imagery, &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/2010/02/15/girls-generation-korean-sexuality/"&gt;this is not a subject that Korean males feel comfortable about discussing&lt;/a&gt;. The author of The Grand Narrative has speculated on what level those involved in these pop groups are actually aware of how their image is being used for marketing purposes. Because, and I find this interesting, there’s a fine line between empowerment and exploitation when it comes to pop groups. It seems like these groups may represent the vanguard of a growing female empowerment in S-Korea. But it could just as well be argued that the women who form these groups are simply being exploited. This would get far to long if I get into that discussion and &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/"&gt;The Grand Narrative&lt;/a&gt; does a far better analysis. So if you find this interesting I would head over there and read more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3hB4HEAkiic&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3hB4HEAkiic&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-1032583933991697465?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/1032583933991697465/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=1032583933991697465&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1032583933991697465'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1032583933991697465'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/06/gender-roles-in-s-korean-pop-music.html' title='Gender Roles In S-Korean Pop Music'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-129353922785668753</id><published>2010-06-17T00:17:00.005Z</published><updated>2010-07-07T10:57:42.043Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Iceland'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='football'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertising'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='soccer'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='South Korea'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='World Cup'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='South Africa'/><title type='text'>World Cup Fever</title><content type='html'>We're in the grips of &lt;a href="http://www.fifa.com/index.html"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; fever here right now. Which might seem a tad strange. As Iceland doesn't even have a team playing in South Africa. Not that there's a  chance we'll ever field a team in the World Cup. After all we're in Europe. I've always found our participation in global sports events somewhat. Interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Icelandic Olympic motto is "It's more important to participate, than to win" - sort of tells you all you need to know about our sports capabilities. Still, we managed to win a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/sports/olympics/25iceland.html?_r=1&amp;ref=handball"&gt;medal in a team sport in Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. You might say that it was one of the few things we've had to cheer about these last couple of years. But when it comes to football. We don't have much of a chance. Not at least as far as our mens team is concerned. Our women are doing fairly well. But being in the European league it's hardly likely we'll ever see our team advance. Having seen them playing, I'm not optimistic it's going to happen in my lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this doesn't diminish our interest in the South African event though. &lt;br /&gt;There's been massive advertising campaigns here. There are World Cup related offers. On everything from TV's to fast food. There are dedicated shows on TV which analyze every game. Down into the minute details. Live broadcasts of the games. I've even discovered how I can watch it all &lt;a href="http://www.eurovisionsports.tv/fifaworldcup/"&gt;live online&lt;/a&gt;. But since we don't have a team playing. We can just pick our own favorite from all the teams that are playing. We always like it if one of our Nordic friends are playing. This year we only have the Danish team in the competition. So we certainly hope to see them advance. For me it was more a matter of picking a team at random. So I decided to go with South Korea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I really knew much about the South Korean team. It's just that I've been reading a really interesting blog about South Korea these last few weeks. &lt;a href="http://thegrandnarrative.com/"&gt;The Grand Narrative&lt;/a&gt;. I'll write more about it and a few other blogs I've been reading these last few months later. But it seems like in this World Cup the lesser known teams are the ones that are surprising the commentators. Not that I pretend to be a football expert. But the fun thing about these big global events. Is to get into the spirit. To allow yourself to be swept up in the euphoria of the event. So I'm enjoying the event. That's the whole point isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LKyq10hPRHg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LKyq10hPRHg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-129353922785668753?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/129353922785668753/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=129353922785668753&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/129353922785668753'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/129353922785668753'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/06/world-cup-fever.html' title='World Cup Fever'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-2415499479139977101</id><published>2010-06-06T02:04:00.002Z</published><updated>2010-06-06T19:27:22.213Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Iceland'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hong Kong'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ash'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='dust'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='volcano'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pollution'/><title type='text'>Dusted</title><content type='html'>Today as I went to attend my nephews birthday I had to start out dusting off my car. Not because I hadn't driven it in awhile, but because we're still dealing with the after effects of our latest volcano eruption. Friday we had a taste of what some people have to live with constantly, as the dust pollution index here rose above the 50 level mark (50 being the health limit) and went over 300 for a period of time during the day (200 being the level when flights are grounded). Closer to the volcano things were even worse.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pollution has a natural cause. Which just goes to show that "all natural" isn't a guarantee that it's good for you. As people around the world are aware we had volcano eruption here in Iceland. It shut down air traffic across Europe and stranded people all over the world. The reason was the fine ash produced by the volcano. Because it was so fine, the wind would carry it all over. Not all of it was blown out to sea. We've got tons of the stuff on the ground. When the wind blows from the east, our usually blue sky now might turn a shade of brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday was particularly bad. My friends in Hong Kong will known what I'm talking about. In March this year one of the worst dust storms in history made the air in Hong Kong turn a &lt;a href="http://www.eturbonews.com/15072/tourists-hong-kong-warned-stay-indoors-due-record-levels-polluti"&gt;particularly nasty shade&lt;/a&gt;. Residents of Beijing are accustomed to dust storms turning the air orange. Apparently this dust reaches Korea and Japan fairly regularly. So what's happening here isn't that unusual. But for us here in Iceland. This is unusual. I've never experienced anything like it before. You could literally taste the ash. People with respiratory problems were warned to stay in doors. Dust masks sold out in the pharmacies. I kept my windows closed. Now we just need a good rain to keep this out of the air.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-2415499479139977101?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/2415499479139977101/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=2415499479139977101&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2415499479139977101'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2415499479139977101'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/06/dusted.html' title='Dusted'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-2326610579637354881</id><published>2010-05-30T20:52:00.002Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T21:01:45.672Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Iceland'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='elections'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='politics'/><title type='text'>Not Politics As Usual</title><content type='html'>Yesterday was all about elections. We had local elections here in Iceland. I think this is the first time I've seen local elections here get so much attention abroad. I'm into politics. Even belong to one of the parties here. Can't say I'm happy with the results we got. On the other hand, I'm not all surprised. We're still dealing with a collapse in public trust. When that happens you don't have politics as usual anymore. Instead we get the rapid rise of a political party that on the surface seems to be just a satire of politics. &lt;a href="http://bestiflokkurinn.is/"&gt;The Best Party&lt;/a&gt;. It managed to secure 6 out of 15 seats in the Reykjavik city council, becoming the largest party in terms of seats and popular votes. At the start of it's campaign I don't think anyone took it that seriously. But once opinion polls showed the party managing to get seats on the council, it started to gain momentum. Quickly becoming the favorite and attracting people who under normal circumstances probably wouldn't even have bothered with politics. At one point opinion polls even indicated the party would gain a majority on the city council. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's interesting that a satire of politics could gain so much popular support. It's also a clear and loud message from the voting public, that it's looking for change. This message wasn't just sent in one location either. Voters went for political parties that are not associated with the traditional political system. What's interesting is that this is all taking place within the democratic process. People may have lost faith in the traditional political parties, but they haven't given up on the political process. The fact is that politics and the language used by politicians had become disjointed from the general public. The biting satire exposed this. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Sustainable transparency&lt;/span&gt; was the perfect example. Meaningless and empty. Following a clear call for honesty, equality, respect and justice at the &lt;a href="http://www.thjodfundur2009.is/"&gt;Þjóðfundur assembly&lt;/a&gt;. It seems clear that the traditional political parties have been unable to react in a manner that satisfied voters. This might have been meet with apathy or direct action. Now comes the difficult part for the newly elected representatives. If the new parties do well, we just might be seeing the dawn of new political movements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn't all about politics. Yesterday was also the day the Eurovision song contest was held. The Icelandic contribution didn't get a lot of points. But that didn't spoil the fun.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-2326610579637354881?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/2326610579637354881/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=2326610579637354881&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2326610579637354881'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2326610579637354881'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2010/05/not-politics-as-usual.html' title='Not Politics As Usual'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-5160600823412488574</id><published>2010-05-27T15:15:00.007Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T16:43:39.593Z</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='suicides'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='IT industry'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Foxconn'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Rework'/><title type='text'>Back From the Break</title><content type='html'>I'm starting to write again. It's been percolating for awhile and I may even start up another blog for some more business orientated writing. But it's time to start to write again. Summer is here and it's a full moon tonight. So this feels like a good time to start again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm reading &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/rework/"&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;. 37 Signals got me interested in Agile.

Just before I do that I'd like to share with you all these two little gems. These are Icelandic online games you may not yet have heard about. Both of these represent the products of the green sprouts of the Icelandic game developing industry. They both share a historical theme...I guess we're big historical nerds here in the Nordics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vikingsofthule.com/"&gt;Vikings of Thule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a casual Massively Multiplayer Online game (MMOG) where participants strive to become strong and respected Viking chiefs in Iceland. The objective is to become one of the 39 authorities that rule the land and hold a vote on its parliament. To achieve this, players need to employ all their wits and brawn. You’ll have the chance to face your enemies in live, animated battles, earn the respect of your followers, control your legion of henchmen and berserkers, buy and market exquisite items and tame Iceland's mythical beasts, the wights. &lt;a href="http://www.vikingsofthule.com/"&gt;To learn more about Viking of Thule click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hoursofwar.com/"&gt;Hours of War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, you build your career as a military commander, and battle alongside and against your friends in epic World War II battles. Try your skills in Allied landing in Normandy 1944, the Battle of the Bulge, or Soviet mass offensive against Finland at Tali-Ihantala 1944!  Your objective is to create an ongoing military career by commanding your troops to victory in battles that rage on 24/7!  &lt;a href="http://www.hoursofwar.com"&gt;To learn more about Hours of War click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-201208562147314400?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/201208562147314400/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=201208562147314400&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/201208562147314400'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/201208562147314400'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/12/gift-that-keeps-on-giving.html' title='The Gift That Keeps On Giving'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-3255835426251503187</id><published>2009-12-02T13:09:00.003Z</published><updated>2009-12-02T21:04:20.596Z</updated><title type='text'>ESB Já, takk!</title><content type='html'>Ég datt inn á vef Heimsýnar um daginn. Þetta eru að mínu mati svolítið skrítin samtök. Skrítin vegna þess að þarna virðast vera saman í einni sæng annars vegar harðir andstæðinga heimsvæðingar og svo hins vegar gallharðir íslenskir íhaldsmenn og fulltrúar afturhaldsamra sérhagsmuna. Það eina sem sameinar þennan hóp er andúð á hinu illa Evrópusambandi. Sem staðfestist í dag þegar fréttist af því að þau hefðu ákveðið að fá til liðs við sig andstæðinga ESB í Noregi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oft og iðulega les maður fullyrðingar frá þeim sem þarna starfa um það sem miður mun fara ef okkur auðnast að komast inn í sambandið. Þarna er til að mynda list 12 atriða sem þau nefna sem ástæður fyrir því að við ættum að hafna aðild. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ég sakna þess að hér starfa ekki enn samtök okkar hina sem ekki standa á ystu jöðrum í stjórnmálunum (eða erum varðhundar fámennra hagsmunasamtaka) og teljum okkur mun betur borgið innan Evrópusambandsins en utan þess. Svo mér datt í hug að setja niður 10 góðar ástæður fyrir því að sækja um aðild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Áhrif Íslands á alþjóðavísu margfaldast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hafi það eitthvað farið á milli mála, þá er vægi Íslands með 300.000 íbúa út á miðju norður Atlantshafi mjög nálægt því ekki neitt á alþjóðavísu. Þetta kom berlega í ljós við hrunið. Sömuleiðis er alveg ljóst að þegar kemur að því að sækja mál á hinum alþjóðlega vettvangi er stór munur að vera hluti af ESB eða eitt lítið landið sem fátt hefur sér til frægðar unnið annað en koma heilu bankakerfi á hliðina. Það litla traust sem til okkar var borið, sú ímynd að hér væri dugleg og heiðarleg þjóð. Var jörðuð af okkur sjálfum. Áhrif ESB eru hins vegar gríðarleg. Sú staðreynd að við, sem þjóð innan ESB, getum haft áhrif á þessi samtök evrópskra lýðræðisþjóða og fengið þau til að tala máli okkar á alþjóðavísu þýðir einfaldlega að áhrif okkar margfaldast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Við tökum þátt í alþjóðlegu samstarfi á jafnréttisgrunni með lýðræðisþjóðum Evrópu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Þær þjóðir sem starfa innan ESB gera það á jafnréttisgrundvelli. Það er tekið jafn mikið tillit til skoðana allra þeirra landa sem þarna eru inni. Það myndi líka koma þeim þjóðum sem starfa innan ESB og íbúum þeirra verulega á óvart að þær hefðu þurkast út. Einfaldast er að benda á að öll þessi ríki halda úti þingum, stjórnum, dómstólum, hafa fána, þjóðsöng og flest allt annað það sem einkennir þjóðir. Það kemur þó ekki í veg fyrir að þær sjái sér hag í því að starfa saman á þeim sviðum þar sem samstarf skilar betri árangri en að standa á eigin fótum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Smáríki eru sterkari innan en utan Evrópusambandsins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ein af stóru ástæðunum fyrir því að Evrópusambandið var stofnað var einmitt til þess að koma í veg fyrir að ein þjóð gæti neitt aflsmunar í samskiptum sínum við aðra. Með því að setja upp sameiginlegar stofnanir og veita málum í sameiginlegan og óháðan farveg þar sem allir sem að málinu koma hafa nákvæmlega jafnmikil áhrif á niðurstöðuna. Því miður höfum við ekki aðgang að slíku í dag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Það er styttra frá Brussel en Washington eða New York&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Það er óumdeilt að Ísland er hluti af Evrópu. Menningar og landfræðilega erum við hluti af Evrópu. En sumir telja að okkur sé betur komið með því að leita annað um samstarf. Sumir vilja að við sækjum um aðild að NAFTA (North American Free Trade Association) þar sem þungamiðjan er í Washington DC. Ekki þykir mér það freistandi. Aðrir hafa horft fast til Wall Street sem fyrirmyndar um góða siði. Hrunið hefur sýnt okkur og sannað að betur fer á því að horfa í aðrar átti. Hafi Íslendingar einhvern tíma átt sér málssvara í Bandaríkjunum, þá ætti öllum að vera orðið ljóst að þar í landi er áhugi á Íslandi svo lítill að ári eftir kosningar hefur Obama ekki einu sinni skipað hér sendiherra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Atvinnuuppbygging er eitt af forgangsatriðum sambandsins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Við erum að fást við atvinnuleysi hér á Íslandi í fyrsta skipti í mörg ár. Sú hugmynd að hér færi vel á því að byggja upp fáar stoðir til þess að halda uppi atvinnulífi reyndist vera röng. Sú hugmynd að hér færi vel á því að byggja upp margar stoðir með fjölbreyttu atvinnulífi. Er nákvæmlega í samræmi við stefnu Evrópusambandsins. Nýsköpun hér á landi krefst þess að hér verði náð stöðugleika sem ekki fæst nema í gegnum aðild að Evrópusambandinu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Núverandi peningamálastefna beið skipbrot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Það er grátlegt til þess að hugsa að fjölmargar íslenskar fjölskyldur eru nú tæknilega gjaldþrota vegna þess gríðarlega skipbrots sem núverandi peningamálastefna kom okkur í. Það hefur nefnilega komið endanlega í ljós að það er takmörkunum háð hvort ríki getur haldið úti sjálfstæðum gjaldmiðli. Vegna þeirra miklu viðskipta sem við eigum við ríki Evrópu liggur beinast við að taka upp Evru. Slíkt gerist ekki án aðildar að Evrópusambandinu. Það er beinlínis broslegt að þeir sömu og telja engar líkur til þess að hægt sé að semja um Evrópusambandið um stjórnun fiskveiða við Ísland, telja að það sé raunhæft að leita samninga við ESB um að taka upp Evru án þess að ganga í ESB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Við höldum okkar fiskveiðikvóta&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samkvæmt núverandi kerfi Evrópusambandsins þá gildir sú regla að kvóta er úthlutað á grundvelli veiðireynslu. Reyndar er það gert í Brussel en fyrir liggur að Evrópusambandið ætlar sér að endurskoða með hvaða hætti þetta yrði gert, með það fyrir augum að úthlutun gæti farið fram í hverju aðildarríki án afskipta frá Brussel, nema ef um er að ræða flökkustofna. 80% of fiskistofnum hér við land eru staðbundnir, svo þetta myndi henta okkur afar vel. Ef við værum fullgildir meðlimir í Evrópusambandinu gætum við haft áhrif á það hvernig þessum málum yrði skipað innan sambandsins. Raunar er það svo að það eru þjóðirnar í ESB sem gera tillögur um hvernig kvóta er úthlutað. Þó formlega gerist það síðan í Brussel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. ESB er friðarbandalag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okkur þykir ekki tiltökumál að halda ekki úti eigin her. Þó flest fullvalda ríki telji slíkt eitt af því sem gerir ríki fullvalda. Sé að það hafi burði til að tryggja eigin landamæri. Ríki gera það reyndar oft í samstarfi hvert við annað og Atlantshafsbandalagið er dæmi um slíkt. Evrópusambandið er allt annars eðlis. Það var stofnað til að tryggja frið í Evrópu og þar eru ríki sem sum hver standa utan allra hernaðarbandalaga. Fyrir þá sem þekkja sögu Evrópu þá er það stórkostlegt afrek að hafa skapað frið í álfunni. Frá upphafi hafa þjóðir innan ESB lagt á það áherslu að fylgja þjóðarrétti sem einmitt er grundvöllur friðsamlegra samskipta þjóða í milli. Fyrir vopnlausa þjóð eins og Íslendinga er því aðild að Evrópusambandinu mikilvægur þáttur í því að tryggja frið í álfunni og tryggja þar með öryggi sitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Verðlag á sumum vörum myndi snarlækka við inngöngu í ESB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fámenn hagsmunasamtök íslenskra framleiðenda telja íslenskum neytendum trú um að hagi þeirra sé betur borgið með því að við séum fátækari en við ættum að vera. Raunar er það til muna orðum aukið að íslensk framleiðsla muni leggjast af við innigöngu í Evrópusambandið. En það er ljóst að hagur íslenskra neytenda mun batna við inngöngu. Neytendavernd er einn af hornsteinum Evrópusambandsins og samkeppniseftirlit er þar öflugt. Þekki ég engan sem heldur því fram að Ísland geti brauðfætt þá sem hér búa. Ísland hentar einfaldlega ekki vel til landbúnaðar og sú staðreynd mun ekki breytast nema með verulegri hlýnun jarðar. Leyfum öðrum að njóta sín á þessu sviði. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Íslensk stjórnvöld og eftirlitsstofnanir myndu njóta aðhalds og stuðnings frá stofnunum ESB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Síðasta og jafnframt mikilvægasta ástæða þess að ég tel að við eigum að sækja um aðild. Er einmitt sú að mörgum þeim sem nú sitja í valdastöðum stendur mikil stuggur af Evrópusambandinu. Því með aðild myndum við njóta þess að valdastofnanir hér myndu hafa aðhald frá stofnunum ESB. Því sú gríðarlega spilling sem hér hefur viðgengist í skjóli kunningja og vinaveldis er líklega mesta mein Íslands.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-3255835426251503187?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/3255835426251503187/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=3255835426251503187&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3255835426251503187'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3255835426251503187'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/12/esb-ja-takk.html' title='ESB Já, takk!'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-8162840691156516810</id><published>2009-07-21T15:35:00.003Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T15:44:36.225Z</updated><title type='text'>40 Years Ago Man Landed On The Moon</title><content type='html'>Or did they? According to some people it's all a big hoax and here are the main reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Apollo 14 astronaut Allen Shepard played golf on the Moon. In front of a worldwide TV audience, Mission Control teased him about slicing the ball to the right. Yet a slice is caused by uneven air flow over the ball. The Moon has no atmosphere and no air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  A camera panned upwards to catch Apollo 16's Lunar Landerlifting off the Moon.  Who did the filming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  One NASA picture from Apollo 11 is looking up at Neil Armstrong about to take his giant step for mankind. The photographer must have been lying on the planet surface. If Armstrong was the first man on the Moon, then who took the shot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The pressure inside a space suit was greater than inside a football. The astronauts should have been puffed out like the Michelin Man, but were seen freely bending their joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The Moon landings took place during the Cold War. Why didn't America make a signal on the moon that could be seen from earth? The PR would have been phenomenal and it could have been easily done with magnesium flares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Text from pictures in the article said that only two men walked on the Moon during the Apollo 12 mission. Yet the astronaut reflected in the visor has no camera. Who took the shot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  The flags shadow goes behind the rock so doesn't match the dark line in the foreground, which looks like a line cord. So the shadow to the lower right of the spaceman must be the flag. Where is his shadow? And why is the flag fluttering if there is no air or wind on the moon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  How can the flag be brightly lit when its side is to the light? And where, in all of these shots, are the stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  The Lander weighed 17 tons yet the astronauts feet seem to have made a bigger dent in the dust. The powerful booster rocket at the base of the Lunar Lander was fired to slow descent to the moons service. Yet it has left no traces of blasting on the dust underneath. It should have created a small crater, yet the booster looks like it's never been fired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SmXhgTxXjzI/AAAAAAAAAZI/8h7rI9nR30s/s1600-h/AS11-40-5899.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SmXhgTxXjzI/AAAAAAAAAZI/8h7rI9nR30s/s400/AS11-40-5899.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360938876633845554" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/fullimage.jsp?searchpage=true&amp;selections=AS11&amp;browsepage=Go&amp;hitsperpage=5&amp;pageno=19&amp;photoId=AS11-40-5899"&gt;Image from NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-8162840691156516810?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/8162840691156516810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=8162840691156516810&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/8162840691156516810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/8162840691156516810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/07/40-years-ago-man-landed-on-moon.html' title='40 Years Ago Man Landed On The Moon'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SmXhgTxXjzI/AAAAAAAAAZI/8h7rI9nR30s/s72-c/AS11-40-5899.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-4109733892044087869</id><published>2009-07-20T01:28:00.001Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T01:31:20.581Z</updated><title type='text'>10 góðar ástæður fyrir því að vera í ESB</title><content type='html'>1. Af því að Evrópusambandið er einstakt og ótrúlega vel heppnað samstarf þjóða. Það hefur skilað friði og framförum og bætt lífsgæði fólks innan landamæra sinna og utan.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;2. Af því að við erum ekki ein í heiminum. Af því að alþjóðavæðingin hefur skellt okkur jarðarbúum í einn og sama bátinn. Við sjálf höfum t.d. sjaldan kynnst því eins og síðustu mánuði hvernig breytileg sjávarföll á Wall-Street geta skollið á okkur af fullum þunga.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;3. Af því að með aðild fáum við á endanum gjaldmiðil sem tryggir fyrirtækjum markaði, fjármagn og stöðugt rekstrarumhverfi. Evran tryggir stúdentum betri tækifæri til mennta, almenningi sanngjarna vexti og ferðamönnum heiminn.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;4. Af því að Evrópusambandið er að sumu leyti þróaðra og fullkomnara í nálgun sinni á brýn pólitísk viðfangsefni, heldur en okkar eigið stjórnkerfi og stjórnmálaflokkar.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;5. Af því að í Evrópusambandinu er rík lýðræðishefð, sem er byggð á grunni ítarlegrar málsmeðferðar og málefnalegrar ákvörðunartöku. Litlar þjóðir hafa mikið að segja innan Sambandsins og stærri þjóðir sem reyna að kúga minni þjóðir eru litnar hornauga. Fyrir þá sem trúa því að þjóðir geti bara verið með eða á móti manni, þá eigum við fjölmargar vinarþjóðir innan sambandsins. Við eigum almenning í Evrópu sem kaus okkur í Eurovision, þrátt fyrir að óvandaðir bankamenn hafi verið nýbúnir að stela sparifé þeirra, og þrátt fyrir að lífeyrissjóðir þeirra og bankar hafi þurft að afskrifa 6000 milljarða vegna Íslendinga.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;6. Af því að Evrópusambandið er friðarbandalag. Það er siðlegasti leikandinn og áhrifavaldurinn í alþjóðlegum stjórnmálum. Bandaríkin pynta fólk og fangelsa án dóms og laga. Kínverjar loka á Internetið og skerða málfrelsi (íslensk stjórnvöld hafa hingað til kosið að halla sér helst að þessum tveimur þjóðum). Rússland hefur ríkisvætt misskiptingu auðs. Nei, Evrópusambandið er rétti vettvangurinn ef menn hafa áhuga á að breyta heiminum til góðs (halló VG-liðar?!?).&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;7. Af því að Evrópusambandið stendur vörð um hagsmuni neytenda. Gegn ótrúlegum og vaxandi áhrifum stórfyrirtækja, þá hefur ESB sagt stopp. Þeir hafa stoppað Microsoft í einokunartilburðum. Þeir hafa hindrað samruna sem hamla myndu heilbrigðri samkeppni. Og þeir hafa fengið farsímaframleiðendur til að samþykkja einn staðal fyrir hleðslutæki fyrir farsíma. Íslenskir neytendur geta rifjað upp olíusamráðsmálið til að meta frammistöðu eigin stjórnvalda á þessu sviði.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;8. Af því að Evrópusambandið er lítið apparat. Það er ekki bákn. Það er hins vegar hægfara vegna þess mikla samráðs og upplýsingaöflunar sem fylgir allri ákvarðanatöku stofnanna þess. Sem getur verið kostur. Það eru ekki teknar geðþóttaákvarðanir í Brussel. Sambandið er ekki gallalaust frekar en önnur mannana verk. En á alla sanngjarna mælikvarða er það svo til fullkomið.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;9. Af því að Evrópusambandið er fremst í heimi í þróunarmálum. Já og umhverfismálum. Sem eru tvær hliðar á sama peningnum. Þeir eru miklu betri í þessu en við og okkar stjórnmálamenn. Á þessum sviðum erum við eins og illa upplýstir ríkisbubbar. Við höfum aðgang að menntun og peningum til að vera framarlega í þessum málum. En okkur er bara andsk. sama og kjósum frekar að sitja með höfuðið fast upp í okkar feita rassi.&lt;br /&gt;—–&lt;br /&gt;10. Af því að með aðild að Evrópusambandinu þá endurheimtum við hluta af sjálfstæði okkar, sem áður var tapað. Ekki sem þjóð eða þjóðrembur. Þjóðin er og verður áfram fullvalda. Heldur sem borgarar. Við fáum beina aðkomu að ákvörðunum og löggjöf sem snerta okkar daglega líf og sem eftir tilkomu EES-samningsins hafa komið til okkar fullbúnar til innleiðingar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://andres.eyjan.is/?p=1298"&gt;Tekið frá Andrési Jónssyni á Eyjan.is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-4109733892044087869?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/4109733892044087869/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=4109733892044087869&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/4109733892044087869'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/4109733892044087869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/07/10-goar-astur-fyrir-vi-vera-i-esb.html' title='10 góðar ástæður fyrir því að vera í ESB'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-7772064492870454604</id><published>2009-07-10T11:20:00.002Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T12:57:31.638Z</updated><title type='text'>Eat Less, Live Longer, Feel Younger</title><content type='html'>It takes me enough time to get from home to work to enjoy some radio time. Yeah, I'm old fashioned that way. I love listening to serious conversation on the radio. As a matter of fact, ever since my communications studies in the last century I've loved radio. Not the talk radio type that N-American readers might know. To me that's just like listening to static. No, the radio I like is the stuff that's created and delivered by the likes of BBC Radio 4, Radio 7 and the World Service. Say what you will about the British, but they do know how to create world class radio services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on my way to work I learned that by eating less. Being on something called the calorie restricted diet. Which is essentially staying below 30% of the daily recommended calorie intake. You can live longer and stay younger while you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It involved reducing calorie intake by 30% while maintaining nutrition and appeared to impact upon many forms of age-related disease seen in monkeys, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and brain atrophy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8141082.stm"&gt;Read the full news item here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-7772064492870454604?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/7772064492870454604/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=7772064492870454604&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/7772064492870454604'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/7772064492870454604'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/07/eat-less-live-longer-feel-younger.html' title='Eat Less, Live Longer, Feel Younger'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-1797544055076261174</id><published>2009-07-09T12:34:00.003Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T12:56:57.956Z</updated><title type='text'>Corruption</title><content type='html'>The head of state used their influence to divert government property and contracts to family and their close political allies. Funding from abroad flowed straight out of the country again and into the pockets of a selected group of people. These selected few created a few strong business groups that dominated the markets they operated in. The state would take a "hands-off" approach to regulation and corruption grew. The ruling party would appoint judges based upon their relation to the close knit political power circle. This went on until the economy collapsed, leaving the country loaded with external debts, but few if any actual paying investments. The elite mostly fled the country, while those left in the country lost faith in the institutions. What followed was the recurring story of despots and internal unrest as the general population suffered through sever reduction in social services in order to pay the external debt. Leading to a vicious cycle of poverty and conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the all to familiar story of many developing countries. Never thought I'd say this. But now I know why Iceland wasn't a developed society along the lines of the rest of the Nordic countries. Instead we are a developing country without strong internal democratic institutions and rampant corruption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of the facts on the situation faced by Iceland and why we've joined the debtor country group - &lt;a href="http://www.island.is/media/frettir/51.pdf"&gt;look right here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read Icelandic here are the 3 articles that you should read:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2009/07/09/dyrt_fyrir_rikid_ad_selja_banka/"&gt;Dýrt fyrir ríkið að selja banka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://eyjan.is/silfuregils/2009/07/08/icesave-2/"&gt;Icesave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jbh.is/default.asp?ID=180"&gt;Um smjörklípukenninguna og seðlabankastjórann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-1797544055076261174?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/1797544055076261174/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=1797544055076261174&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1797544055076261174'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1797544055076261174'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/07/corruption.html' title='Corruption'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-6792415245769172076</id><published>2009-07-03T13:16:00.002Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T13:19:54.187Z</updated><title type='text'>A Beautiful Day In Iceland</title><content type='html'>The weather was amazing when I walked out the door this morning.

It was difficult to get up and out of bed. That's not what was so strange. But then after a couple of hours at work, I had this really bad headache. It was strange. Felt really bad. Bad enough that I ended up taking a painkiller and it still stuck around. I usually don't bother much with painkillers. Often enough it's enough to get some water and a breath of fresh air. This time around it didn't help. Not even with the more than a little freshness in the air. If you're sweltering in the summer heat. We're chilled up here.

A few weeks ago I went to the Netherlands without it and found that travel in the Shengen area is just like domestic travel. But I want to have a valid passport and since I can't find mine I needed to get a new one. Turns out we've just updated our passports. Now mine will not only contain an RFID chip, but it will also contain my fingerprints. So lots of details for anyone who would be able to steal one of those things and break into it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I thought I could easily do it during my lunch break. Not quite as it turned out. First of all there's only one place to do it. Which is not quite next door to my current work place. Then when I got there. The nice numbered queuing system wasn't working. This I only found out after waiting for 15 minutes. When I asked how long it usually took and if it was fine for me to go out and get lunch and come back. The system is broken and we are waiting for IT people to come and fix it. Ah, the IT people need to fix the system and there's no way to deal with customers while it's broken. Actually they figured out within 5 minutes that they could, but by then someone else had gotten in front of me. So I had to wait. For another 5 minutes. It then took about 3 minutes to get the details about the new passport, take my photo and for me to sign and give up my fingerprints. Another couple of minutes and I could cancel out my old passport. What fantastic efficiency. The girl who took my application was really sorry. "I was just having my lunch break"...yeah me to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SkpF-UgX9aI/AAAAAAAAAYw/SQRqi1_jeCo/s1600-h/ReliefSlipLine.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 283px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SkpF-UgX9aI/AAAAAAAAAYw/SQRqi1_jeCo/s400/ReliefSlipLine.gif" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5353168044041958818" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-5754721935181511344?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/5754721935181511344/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=5754721935181511344&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/5754721935181511344'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/5754721935181511344'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/06/lunch-break.html' title='Lunch break'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/SkpF-UgX9aI/AAAAAAAAAYw/SQRqi1_jeCo/s72-c/ReliefSlipLine.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-7388890783649413509</id><published>2009-06-29T12:50:00.003Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T13:03:33.965Z</updated><title type='text'>The not so lost art of writing</title><content type='html'>Hey I'm back from my blog hiatus. My urge to write has returned. Will post stuff. Back to my old idea of 3 min non stop writing flow. So today I'm thinking about art and creative stuff. How I can stumble upon something so amazing that it literally takes me away from the daily grind for a few moments. Today I found this amazing little site I want to share with you. &lt;a href="http://www.electroboutique.com/"&gt;Electroboutique&lt;/a&gt; is run by a bunch of Russian artists. I've come to love Russian contemporary design. I think some of their web stuff is the most ozom use of the medium I've seen. Often minimalistic but there's a beauty in their use of the form. Quite different from the often bloated sites I see out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/Ski7mebSkWI/AAAAAAAAAYo/bIK-50woQRI/s1600-h/3265644863_98495692bb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 268px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/Ski7mebSkWI/AAAAAAAAAYo/bIK-50woQRI/s400/3265644863_98495692bb.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352734426806784354" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-7388890783649413509?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/7388890783649413509/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=7388890783649413509&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/7388890783649413509'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/7388890783649413509'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/06/not-so-lost-art-of-writing.html' title='The not so lost art of writing'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TdEryqUuZc0/Ski7mebSkWI/AAAAAAAAAYo/bIK-50woQRI/s72-c/3265644863_98495692bb.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-2339019708198056716</id><published>2009-02-28T13:53:00.001Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T13:54:33.557Z</updated><title type='text'>Lets Be Agile</title><content type='html'>I read somewhere, a long time ago, that writing your thoughts on things around has a calming effect. This has been true for me. Essentially I don't write for my readers (all 3 of them), but myself. So when I don't feel like writing. I don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I've been on a several weeks hiatus. Maybe it was the darkness. Maybe everything around me here in Iceland just seemed a little unreal. There's something strange going on when the temperature hits double digits in February. Global warming is coming and it's happening fast. Which is a scary thing. I just got a postcard (yes, one of those made out of paper) from a friend in Japan and there are scary things happening there. The thing is that it's hard for those of us who live so far north to really understand why global warming is a bad thing. Looking out of my window and watching a clear blue sky with the sunlight glittering in the snow. It just seems unreal to think that hotter weather is a problem. Somewhat as unreal as the news about the current situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a new central bank governor. This, I believe, is all for the good. We've now seen the culprits of the crisis removed from their positions. The high flying bankers are gone. There are new people in the Icelandic financial watchdog. There's a new government and now we've done some cleaning in the central bank. There's even been a few people who have apologized for making mistakes. Not the key people. They are still blaming one another for their own failure. After awhile I realized that's probably how they see it. I've become convinced that it's a built in problem of our system. Competitive behavior based upon the principle "winner takes all" simply leads to certain specific problems. Now, I want to ensure that I'm not misunderstood. I'm all for competitive behavior. I think it's the driver behind many good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now think about this for a second. Without the complex and highly advanced information and communications structure we enjoy today. This latest econmic crisis would have been averted. So would anyone seriously suggest that we stop using the Internet. I hope not, as that would mean I would have to find a new job. But some people seem to think that we shouldn't allow competition. Clearly the cause of the financial crisis was competition. The capitalist system caused it. Absolutely right and spot on. The only thing is. I'm not really convinced that there are any better alternative. Instead I believe that we need to be more agile. Think in the short term (not just, but also). Five year plans don't work. Six month plans don't work either. Two week plans seem to work just great. Plus we need surveillance and some authority that can provide the checks on the people who have access to capital. There are all sorts of good things that can be done. We can also make all sorts of silly mistakes. Here's what the past few months have made absolutely clear in my mind. Allow people access to "free" money and they will take it and run as quickly as possible. Show them how to do this without breaking any laws and they will take advantage of it. So clearly we need a highly regulated financial system. Enron and now the collapse of the banks show the danger of unregulated markets. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that those in power at Enron and in the banks, did not at any given point give more than 5 seconds thought about the other minority owners. Their actions speak for themselves in that regard. So my conclusion is that we need more democratization of business. Not that I know much about business. But I understand a few things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I mentioned before that I got a postcard. A paper thing with a photo on the outside. It was nice to get such an actual analog thing. I like it. Just because we can send e-mail, shouldn't mean that we stop doing all the analog things. A postcard is just about perfect. It doesn't have enough room for a lot of stuff. So you don't have to think long about what to write. It makes the receiver happy. So I say we should send more postcards and do more analog stuff. Do analog stuff and be more agile. Seems like a good project for the next 2 weeks.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-2339019708198056716?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/2339019708198056716/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=2339019708198056716&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2339019708198056716'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/2339019708198056716'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/02/lets-be-agile.html' title='Lets Be Agile'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-1725411798130838263</id><published>2009-02-05T10:28:00.004Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T13:10:14.369Z</updated><title type='text'>Not My Own Words</title><content type='html'>I came across some text that I thought was interesting. It might have been written by many of the commentators writing today. Originally it was written about America and I did a little experiment and replaced "America" with "Iceland".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The psychic effect of the depression, it seems to me, is generally a good one.... It has taught people the difference between speculative values and real values. It has hastened the death of sick industries, and proved the vigor of sound ones. It has blown up the old delusion that the amount of money in the world is unlimited, and that every Icelander is entitled to a police captain's share of it. Best of all, it has taught millions that there is really no earthly reason why there should be two cars in every garage, and a chicken in the pot every day."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A few years back we were all leaping along after the pacemakers, and making shining fools of ourselves. Life in Iceland had become an almost unanimous effort to keep up with the Joneses, and what the Joneses had to offer by way of example was chiefly no more than a puerile ostentation. So many luxuries became necessities that the line separating the one from the other almost vanished. People forgot altogether how to live well, and devoted themselves frantically to living gaudily."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It seems to me that the depression will be well worth its cost if it brings Icelanders back to their senses. Once they rediscover the massive fact that hard thrift and not gambler's luck is the only true basis of national wealth, they will discover simultaneously that a perfectly civilized and contented life is possible without the old fuss and display."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.L._Mencken"&gt;H. L. Mencken&lt;/a&gt;: "What Is Going On In the World," 1933&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as this was written back in the 1930's it seems like there's hardly a chance that we'll ever learn this lesson. Indeed there's now plenty of evidence that maybe what we need is to go back to the gold standard. That certainly would finally give the ISK the "hard" value it needs.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-1725411798130838263?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/1725411798130838263/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=1725411798130838263&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1725411798130838263'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/1725411798130838263'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/02/not-my-own-words.html' title='Not My Own Words'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-3941528948356252700</id><published>2009-01-21T22:33:00.005Z</published><updated>2009-01-21T22:52:09.438Z</updated><title type='text'>Recession Diary part 8</title><content type='html'>During my recent visit to Hong Kong everyone seemed to have heard about what happened to Iceland. I was asked to explain what had happened. Explained how much I lost. That some of my money had simply disappeared and that my retirement fund was now worth a lot less than it had just 6 months earlier. How much this was going to affect us. The inflation rate, currency exchange and interest rates. That nobody had been arrested for any wrong doing. That not a single government official or surveillance employee had lost their job. That not a single person in any sort of position of authority had stepped forward to apologize for their mistakes. What surprised my friends in Hong Kong and others I spoke with, was that until then the protests had been very civilized. Some meetings with speeches. But very little else. No serious riots. No burning cars or broken windows. My friends wondered what caused this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the situation as it stands right now. Where a huge number of people are faced with a couple of very uncomfortable facts. That the place where they live is actually decreasing in value, while the loans they are paying are rising fast. Just after returning I heard an example of this. Just over a year ago. A person had decided to invest in their own place to live. It cost at the time 30 million ISK. This person paid out 5 million in cash. Took a loan for 25 million in foreign currency. After all, everyone was told that it was crazy to take on loans in ISK. There might be some currency fluctuations, but low interests rates should more than make up for that. It was simply crazy to imagine that the currency would be allowed to fluctuate all that much. Right now the family home is valued at 27 million. But the loan is currently at 50 million. Now add to this the fact that somewhere close to 12.000 people (remember that's up from nearly none) are currently looking for work. That a huge number of people lost their work some 3 months ago and are just now waking up to the fact, that their next paycheck isn't going to cover their expenses and that it's unlikely that the situation is going to change any time soon. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. Except maybe the people who are most isolated from all of this. That things are starting to get a lot more heated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not surprised. It was amazing to get a chance to spend a couple of weeks among friends. To forget for a moment the serious situation right here. To enjoy great food, excellent company and learn from people who've actually been faced with similar events and even worse. Things aren't just bad here in Iceland. They are bad all over. But I also realized how little responsibility the Icelandic elite has taken for what just happened. The total and utter collapse of the Icelandic financial system, the emergency laws and the steady stream of revelations about dubious deals. What's even more amazing is that it appears like it's more or less all the same people who are in control within the new financial institutions. On top of that the Icelandic government has ensured that I can't even open an account outside of the country. Right now there are such heavy restrictions in place on the movement of foreign currency that foreign investors aren't even allowed to invest in the Icelandic economy. So the people who brought us into this mess. Most of whom don't seem to be exactly suffering, seem to be surprised that people have just about had enough of the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday thousands of Icelanders of all ages gathered together in front of the longest parliament in the world (established way back in 930). They blew whistles, banged pots and pans. Threw snowballs and did their very best to make the first meeting of the parliament after Christmas realize that something unique was happening. No formal political party had called upon people to make their voices heard. This was a pure form of grassroots activity. Facebook, SMS, blogs had been used to communicate this idea. The Icelandic police were completely taken by surprise. Unfortunately they lost control of the situation and were eventually forced to bring on the OC gas. This proved ineffective in breaking up the protests. Fires where lit and it wouldn't be until late at night that the protesters where driven away. Today we saw the crowds return. People are angry and parliament decided to postpone it's previously advertised meeting today. When the protesters discovered that in the church next door family and friends were grieving the loss of a loved one. They all left and didn't start up their protest until after the family had left. What a civilized bunch of protesters. They would head for the office of the prime minister and for the first time in decades the police had to escort the prime minister from his office. This hasn't been seen here since 1931 and back then we belonged to Denmark. This time around we can't blame the Danes for our problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleak fact of the matter is that we're faced with some amazingly bad economic news. People are losing their jobs. Prices are going up. There's a steady stream of news that seem to show that a small group of interconnected people have abused the public trust. There are cutbacks being announced in social services. Lots of people are being asked to accept a reduction in their paycheck at exactly the same time as expenses are going up. These are the kind of circumstances that call for drastic action. But the demands from the crowds seem to be simple enough. They are calling for elections. Our dearly beloved leaders seem to think that this might mean crisis. I wonder how they would define the current situation.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-3941528948356252700?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/3941528948356252700/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=3941528948356252700&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3941528948356252700'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/3941528948356252700'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/01/recession-diary-part-7.html' title='Recession Diary part 8'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7036937.post-6447001580377296514</id><published>2009-01-07T20:59:00.001Z</published><updated>2009-01-07T21:00:37.408Z</updated><title type='text'>Thoughts on 2008</title><content type='html'>It's time to remember the year that's just passed. What a remarkable year it was for me. To live in interesting times wasn't exactly what I expected at the beginning of the year. But 2008 turned out to be a year of big news. Looking back it's been quite an eventful year for me. As in previous years I've felt blessed enough to have excellent friends and it turned out to be a year when I made new friends in far away places and renewed my ties with old friends through Facebook. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A memorable visit where we drove in amazing northern lights during the coldest weekend of the year seems to stand out in memory from the early part of 2008. However, early on in the year there appeared signs that changes might be in store. While I was reluctant to make changes, I was pushed in that direction and eventually made a leap to a new work place. Something that I now feel was a good move. I feel on a professional level more alive in my work than at any point over the last couple of years. I'm more active now with my professional friends and feel that I'm learning and experiencing more than I've done in quite some time. Experience is one my keywords for 2008. It was however, with mixed feelings that I left my friends at my former workplace. At the same time it showed me new opportunities and finally gave me the opportunity to travel to new destinations. To be pushed into such a search was stressful, yet I found quite a lot of strength in my own habits of yoga and enjoying visits to the gym with my friends. I even made a professional visit to London to consider new options and visit friends, some of whom have now moved closer to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I'd been thinking about traveling to Asia. Spending 6 weeks on the road in Asia and visiting Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand before I started at my new workplace was an amazing experience. It brought me into contact with new environments and new friends. Experienced the rain forest in the rain. Had someone steal money from me while I slept. Discovered a lot of culture and tasted some excellent food. Made such a strong and positive impression on me that I went to Hong Kong at the end of the year for another visit. A start in London set the tone for the adventure. Change of plans turned out to be a good move. I saw amazing sites. Wrote a travel journal. It also ended in London with a visit to dear friends and some unexpected fun. At this point the financial situation already pointed towards changes. But the crash was unexpected. I've told people that I lost my kitchen. The money I meant to use to get a better kitchen vanished. I almost decided to cancel my travel plans to Hong Kong. What a mistake that would have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following my first travels to Asia I spent an eventful summer. Didn't do as much hiking as I wanted. But spent a very cold weekend in Thorsmork. A weekend that brought me right back to Iceland and made me remember how cold my home country really feels. Still managed to do some amazing shorter hikes. Became active in the Icelandic part of the Couchsurfing community. Something that I had experienced in Asia. Hosted a variety of people from all over the world. Made new friends. Saw Iceland through the eyes of visitors. Visited new places and rediscovered old favorites. Enjoyed excellent music during Iceland Airwaves with some of those visitors. Music as always part of my life. Discovered lots of excellent music. Saw some excellent movies. My Asian movie collection has grown by an amazing amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The later half of the year passed quickly. I made my best effort to learn a bit of Cantonese. Some of which I managed to remember during my visit to Hong Kong at the end of the year. Discovered a host of interesting blogs and made a dedicated effort to create one of my own. A site dedicated to bringing together images from around the world. Something I hope to continue in 2009. Struggled with my fears and made some progress. The year ended with an amazing visit to Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. I would cheer for the end of 2008 and the arrival of 2009 while drinking champagne and watching fireworks in Hong Kong. 2008 was in many ways an amazing year for me. It made me a strong believer in the power of karma. I discovered a city that I still haven't grown tired of. I watched my friends make a commitment to share their lives together. Enjoyed the hospitality and generosity of my friends near and far. Looking back this might have been a year of bad financial news, but for me it was an amazing year of discovery and wonder.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7036937-6447001580377296514?l=simmix1.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/feeds/6447001580377296514/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7036937&amp;postID=6447001580377296514&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/6447001580377296514'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7036937/posts/default/6447001580377296514'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://simmix1.blogspot.com/2009/01/thoughts-on-2008.html' title='Thoughts on 2008'/><author><name>Simmi</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03364596909094195234</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
