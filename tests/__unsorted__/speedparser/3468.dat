<blockquote><p>The Raritan River runs through the center of New Jersey, with upper reaches that are incredibly beautiful, providing a valuable source of water for more than a million people.  But industry took hold of the lower Raritan early on and left its mark.</p>
<p>This one-hour documentary, narrated by actor Avery Brooks, tells the compelling story of a river that has been profoundly contaminated over 200 years and of the extraordinary efforts to clean it up.  It reveals how government agencies, powerful corporations, environmentalists, developers, scientists and lawyers have all clashed in their attempts to deal with the aftermath of extensive pollution and environmental neglect.</p>

<p>The documentary&#8217;s web site also contains some great background information including a page with <a href="http://www.njn.net/television/specials/rescuingtheriver/learnmore/">links and books to learn more about the Raritan, waste, and industry</a>.

The day featured 3 separate guided hikes through the park, organized around a festival area at Summit Field that included an art show, live music, an educational booth run by the Essex County Environmental Center, and some other informational booths. All in all, a fun day for people of all ages, and some great weather.</p>
<h3>Hike 1: Summit Field to Washington Rock</h3>
<p>The morning started with a early hike out to Washington Rock and the overlook to the south at the Watchungs. The walk wandered a bit covering some unofficial trails and looping back along side Crest Drive. Attendance was light, but it made for a nice warmup for the day.</p>

<h3>Hike 2: Summit Field to Hemlock Falls</h3>
<p>This hour and a half or so, slow paced hike to the falls and back was attended by a nice crew of people. With the falls raging from the recent endless rain it was a great day to go down there. The hike mixed it up between the roads/bridal paths and the red/white falls loop trail with the highlight visiting then walking over the top of the falls.</p>

<h3>Walk 3: Wildflower Preserve Tour</h3>
<p>With 2 knowledgable tour guides we wandered the enclosed wildflower preserve learning about the native plant life and doing a little bird (and woodchuck) watching.</p>

In Essex County, there is also the 2nd Annual Mayapple Festival in <a href="/parks/south-mountain-reservation/">South Mountain Reservation</a>, featuring much shorter walks around the park trails, but also an ultra-marathon in distances from 100k to a shorter 10mile trail race.</p>
<h2>NJ2NY50</h2>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 169px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/5079046898/"><img class=" " title="Crossing The Parkway [Lenape34] by placenamehere, on Flickr" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4105/5079046898_5350749576_m.jpg" alt="Crossing The Parkway [Lenape34]" width="159" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hikers crossing the Garden Sate Parkway on last year&#39;s Lenape34</p></div>
<p><a href="http://nj2ny50.org/">The NJ2NY50</a> is a 50 mile walk along the East Coast Greenway and Liberty Water Gap Trails from NJ Transit&#8217;s Metropark Station in Iselin to New York City (via short &#8216;hike&#8217; on the PATH) and continuing the walk on the east side to Penn Station (where you can get a train back to the starting point). The hike goes through some suburban and more urban areas, but also meets up with the Hudson and some nice views across the river at New York and then back at New Jersey.</p>
<p>This event is part of the ongoing <a href="http://www.crossjerseywalk.org/">Cross-Jersey Walking Challenge</a>, a trek of 100 total miles from Trenton to NYC, and organized by the same folks that brought you last fall&#8217;s <a title="Lenape34, Lenape Trail Hike Report" href="/trip-report/lenape34-lenape-trail-hike/">Lenape Trail thru hike</a>.</p>
<h2>2nd Annual Mayapple Festival</h2>
<p>50 miles along trails and sidewalks wasn&#8217;t insane enough for you the trail runners in South Mountain Reservation will be looping around the park to race in distances up to 100k in the <a href="http://www.sites.google.com/site/southmtn100k/">2011 Mayapple Ultra</a>. If you&#8217;re interested, race registrations close Wednesday 5/18.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/5715746359/"><img class=" " title="Diamond Mill Pond Reflection [South Mountain Reservation] by placenamehere, on Flickr" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2735/5715746359_9e998e8605_m.jpg" alt="Diamond Mill Pond Reflection [South Mountain Reservation]" width="240" height="159" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A recent scene at South Mountain Reservation&#39;s Diamond Mill Pond</p></div>
<p>For those not interested in running (and I don&#8217;t blame you!) the Mayapple Festival event caters to families, walkers, hikers and nature lovers of all types with an art fair, guided hikes to Hemlock Falls or through the wildflower preserve, and, as an addition this year, live music all afternoon in the Summit. Having missed the festival last year, I&#8217;ll be around this year with a camera over my shoulder checking out a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>For more information on the Mayapple Festival, and directions to South Orange, NJ, see the <a href="http://somocon.org/">South Mountain Conservancy</a>, or the official <a title="The 2nd Annual Mayapple Festival event invitation" href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=211772665512599">Facebook event page</a>.</p>
<p>How will you be enjoying the local parks this weekend? Attending one of these events? Have plans for another trip or event?</p>

The snow was littered with fallen shards of ice, and glistened in the light, combined with the newly fallen beech leaves it was a pretty sight along this hilly route.</p>

<h3>Warning: South Mountain Reservation Closed For Deer Hunt</h3>
<p><a title="Deer Hunt Warning [Winter 2011] by placenamehere, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/5361175343/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5361175343_47ab48d4e8_m.jpg" alt="Deer Hunt Warning [Winter 2011]" width="159" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>South Mountain Reservation will be <strong>closed</strong> on Tuesdays and Thursdays from now until January 27 to allow Essex County to run its deer management (hunting) program. This program will then move to Hilltop Reservation and <a href="/parks/eagle-rock-reservation/">Eagle Rock Reservation</a> for the month of February. <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/essex_county_to_begin_deer_hun.html">More information on the hunt from NJ.com.</a></p>
