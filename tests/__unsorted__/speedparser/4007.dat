		<description><![CDATA[I think I enjoy I enjoy blogging when I have a nice buzz going on. I drank 5 beers and had some Jack Daniels tonight. So I was about to smoke weed tonight with some friends out hear in Cambridge, MA. But, then a car pulled up in a residential neighborhood and I bailed. Yeah, I really didn&#8217;t want to get caught or be associated with it.  So I still have my pot virginity. Yeah it was interesting with the grinding of the marijuana. I kind of still want to do it as I enjoy these weird pleasurable experiences. Plus everyone knows you can&#8217;t overdose on pot. It&#8217;s pretty chill. So yeah, college is a ton of fun. Lately I have been playing a ton of Ultimate Frisbee on Thursdays, Fridays, and Mondays. It&#8217;s a great way to meet new people and I love the game. Earlier this week I wrote a paper on the advertising world and how San Paulo, Brazil has banned any types of advertisements in the city since 2007. They handed out 8 million in fines since then. Also for forty years Vermont has not allowed billboards on it&#8217;s highway&#8217;s to preserve the natural beauty! I love my design class and I could care less about my literature class which is just a general education class. This is my third English class over the last couple of years&#8230; So I have to suck it up and get through it. As far as women and girls, there are plenty of attractive women here in Cambridge. So we will see what happens, I have been hanging out with this Boston University student who&#8217;s really nice and we have so many common interests. She&#8217;s a film &#38; communication major who studied art history in the past along with a couple of psychology classes down at Quinnipiac College. Yeah, I like her and I&#8217;m pretty sure she does to. It might just end up in a mutual friendship in the future I&#8217;m not sure. But, it&#8217;s nice to hang out with someone new. If I ended up in a relationship, I still want to write about but, I kind of have to respect my partners privacy. So I could just change their name for the internet, or I could just never right about my relationships, which i would hate. Or, I could keep my website a secret like other bloggers for great truthful writing material. All though that would be really hard to do and I would hate that. So in conclusion I like to be drunk with friends, play frisbee, do homework, educate myself, meet new how women, and the band Starfucker is awesome! I&#8217;m jamming to some music right now after a fun alcoholic night with friends. Peace out, and have fun motherfuckers! Love You, Rafael]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I found this pretty interesting conversation on facebook after I googled a friends name. I changed her original name just for privacy purposes but, I couldn&#8217;t agree more with her really intelligent well thought out answers and examples. About various wars, genocides, and god in general. Anyways just read the conversation she&#8217;s much more articulate than I am and tell me what you think. I realize this is a very controversial topic &#38; everyone has their own beliefs which I respect. Heather How do you know God exists? Ian: Treat He lives in me because I have died to self and I now know Him. Heather: Do you understand that religion is one of the most destructive aspects of society and has caused billions of deaths all over the world? Do you understand the billions of lives lost as a result of the Reconquista, The Crusades, the Muslim Conquests, The French Wars of Religion, the Thirty Years War, the current conflict in Northern Ireland, and the possibility of a third World War coming up in our own future? If the answer is yes, then why hasn&#8217;t God saved us yet? Has he heard the prayers of a 10 year old girl who&#8217;s head was bashed in with a machete because she was a minority in an African society? Has he heard the prayers of a Bosnian child who&#8217;s arm was blown off in his hometown because the Serbian aggressors wanted him to leave? Did he hear the prayers of the millions of Jewish people murdered in the Holocaust for absolutely no reason at all? Heather: I joined this group not because I&#8217;m an obnoxious bitch, but because I want to encourage you to keep an open mind to the world. Your pastor or such is not going to teach you these things. I doubt your school teachers or CCD teachers or your parents wil either. But they are true, unavoidable facts that cannot be ignored and this must be taken into account in order to prevent unnecessary deaths and violence in our future. Learn from our mistakes, to help us shape a better tomorrow. One should not rely on an entity that may or may not exist, they should find strength within themselves, and rely on their own will to get by in life. Ian: ok you don&#8217;t have to get rude over it all. i understand your points and they are good ones. but with regard to all the questions you threw at me, those aren&#8217;t God&#8217;s plans. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve gotta keep faith in him. jesus is coming very soon and that&#8217;s when, ultimately, we will be saved. and we can/are be saved already from jesus&#8217;s first coming which was 2000 years ago because of his death, burial, and ressurection. are you kidding?! my parents have very open minds, but they are sensible. i really fear for the sake of this country that we will learn from our mistakes or else we will end up like the israelites long ago.

		<description><![CDATA[So I&#8217;ve been living in Cambridge for about a nine days now and it&#8217;s nice to be around all the action in Harvard Square. I&#8217;m taking 5 classes &#8211; Art History, Drawing 1, Foundation of Design, Literature, and a conceptual theory based class about art. All the classes are interesting but, literature will be my most difficult class by far as it contains tons of reading and some written essays. Today I attended both of my classes and then I took a nap from exhaustion of reading for three hours last night. The only tough part so far has been the adaptation of friends. I signed up for 5 or 6 clubs today at the meeting over at the Doble Campus, so that should help out. I&#8217;m hoping the rock climbing club will work out with my schedule or else I am going to be kind of pissed off. As I love to climb. I&#8217;ve handed out a pretty bad ass resume to about 10 businesses around here and numerous emails to various craigslist adds for some freelancing work. I haven&#8217;t received any responses yet but, I&#8217;m confident in my abilities. So hopefully something works out soon with some studios ideally or if I&#8217;m desperate a conventional job like at an ice cream place, cup cakes, or a tea store etc&#8230; On another note I&#8217;ve gone off many tangents in the past about relationships and how it&#8217;s never really worked out for me. I really hate the idea of censoring myself  so I&#8217;m going to lay out my raw emotions now. It&#8217;s a bit difficult as I know some of my relatives and parents occasionally read this. Along with my room mates and other friends. But, this is my own website which is an ongoing public diary to a certain extent of the up&#8217;s &#38; downs of my life. So fuck it! So ideally this is the type of happy relationship I would like to be in ( watch the video above). Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be? In all honesty it the past I never really dated anyone as I knew it wouldn&#8217;t work out as I had to focus on my internship, academics, and I had to get back into college most importantly. Also I didn&#8217;t have my own place as I was living at home. Everyone know&#8217;s that your essentially the biggest loser ever when you&#8217;re living at home. It&#8217;s definitely not cool. Then I never bought a car as I got around the city with the bike and bus passes. But, more importantly all I&#8217;ve really had was a casual sexual relationship which lasted for a week with a friend. All I wanted to do at that point was to lose my virginity and fuck like any other teenager. After a week of fucking I realized that this was a horrible idea and I ended it. I wanted nothing to with the situation. But, more importantly she had a child and a boyfriend/ soon to be husband in the future. So that was the end of it....]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve been living in Cambridge for about a nine days now and it&#8217;s nice to be around all the action in Harvard Square. I&#8217;m taking 5 classes &#8211; Art History, Drawing 1, Foundation of Design, Literature, and a conceptual theory based class about art. All the classes are interesting but, literature will be my most difficult class by far as it contains tons of reading and some written essays.</p>
<p>Today I attended both of my classes and then I took a nap from exhaustion of reading for three hours last night. The only tough part so far has been the adaptation of friends. I signed up for 5 or 6 clubs today at the meeting over at the Doble Campus, so that should help out. I&#8217;m hoping the rock climbing club will work out with my schedule or else I am going to be kind of pissed off. As I love to climb.</p>

<p>So ideally this is the type of happy relationship I would like to be in ( watch the video above). Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be?</p>
<p>In all honesty it the past I never really dated anyone as I knew it wouldn&#8217;t work out as I had to focus on my internship, academics, and I had to get back into college most importantly. Also I didn&#8217;t have my own place as I was living at home. Everyone know&#8217;s that your essentially the biggest loser ever when you&#8217;re living at home. It&#8217;s definitely not cool. Then I never bought a car as I got around the city with the bike and bus passes.</p>
<p>But, more importantly all I&#8217;ve really had was a casual sexual relationship which lasted for a week with a friend. All I wanted to do at that point was to lose my virginity and fuck like any other teenager. After a week of fucking I realized that this was a horrible idea and I ended it. I wanted nothing to with the situation. But, more importantly she had a child and a boyfriend/ soon to be husband in the future. So that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Since then really nothing has changed about me romantically in the past two years. All I can say is that porn for four years straight essentially is not very fulfilling. I&#8217;ve never experienced the feeling of love, or gained the trust of another women, or enjoyed the constant responsible sex over a long period of time such as a month or a year. So lately I&#8217;ve been really wanting to change this and meet someone who shares the same passions in life as me. I&#8217;ve considered just having a fwb situation which would be nice if I ever got the chance. After all I am 21 years old and I&#8217;m not looking to settle down any time soon.</p>
<p>On a more a positive note look at these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yellrafael/sets/72157627570761404/with/6103312019/">photos of Mount Cannon</a>! I climbed this two weeks a go with my friend Billy. It took us 3 hours to climb to the top at 4100 feet high. Another 3 hours down and 8 hours of driving by Billy= a long day. We need to hike Mount Washington in the future though. It was a spectacular day though that I will remember forever as it was are first major mountain we ever climbed.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hurricane Irene is hitting everyone in New England right now. It&#8217;s 5:10 AM and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful day. I woke up late, grabbed some ice coffee, and headed into Providence. Then my mother and I saw Sarah&#8217;s Key at the avon cinema. It&#8217;s a story about a modern day editorial journalist who got wrapped up in this French imprisonment story of the Jews. A lot of shocking facts were reveled in the film. Later on we grabbed some pizza and then I went rock climbing with Luis down the street. It&#8217;s crazy how weak I am after not climbing for three months. But, it feels great to be climbing again. Tonight I downloaded a ton of alternative music. I also downloaded an app for my iphone which will guide me through the process of doing a hundred push ups in 6 weeks. So I did the initial test and first workout tonight. Other than that I&#8217;ve emailed a bunch of studios in Boston, the Apple Stores, and a photographer to earn some extra cash. Here&#8217;s some more inspirational films from vimeo that I enjoyed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So a lot has happened since I last wrote about Atlantic City.  I had a wonderful time at camp, with all the counselors &#38; kids. We had this one incident where a camper injured himself two nights in a row.  The first night he dropped a shampoo bottle on his toe so he lost a nail and had a bloody toe for the night. Then the following night he was playing gaga and he slid on the wood. So he got a massive wooden splinter on his but.  So the poor kid was crying his eyes out for twenty minutes as he was afraid of getting the splinter removed. But, my other two counselors plucked the wood out with a pair of scissors. So that night was completely hilarious and memorable. During the last night at camp we a massive slideshow and movie with all the memories from the 2011 summer. Following that we headed down to the lake and everyone said some nice words about each other. My co counselor made a great speech about all the kids on how they can improve certain atributes in the following years. After 11 years at camp Rosy said that it would be his last summer at camp which was a shocking moment. He was a great guy to I am going to miss him with all of are mountain biking discussions along the trails. I am going to miss so many people over these next few months like Harry and all of are frisbee time. Drinking until 4 am at a cabin on are day off. Alex and all her enthusiasm for are video elective class and so many others. Dorney Park was a ton of fun with my campers to. I convinced Mitch, Jeremy, and Ethan to go on to some wooden roller coasters. As well as the water park with all the slides/ the lazy river. &#8212;&#8212; Since I got back to New England I met up with my good friend Quan at Logan Airport. He came from Ha Noi in Vietnam and ended up waiting in customs lines for 3 hours in New York. So he got into Boston 8 hours later then he was supposed to. We ended up staying at the Sheraton for the night. Before we went to bed we grabbed some beers at whiskey bar &#38; some pizza at Steves near Berkley College of Music. Then we passed out for the night. The next morning we grabbed some breakfast at the trident bookstore  which was superb. Salmon Eggs &#38; a Cinnamon Raison for Quan. Lemon Ricotta stuffed French Toast with Blueberry Sauce for myself. After soaking up some sun in the Boston Commons we headed to China Town before we separated at South Station. After that I headed over to the ICA( Institute of Contemporary Art) where Red Bull was holding a cliff diving event. They jumped from the top of the museum to the boston harbor which is 88 feet. In 3 seconds of airtime they accelerate past 60 mph. It was an amzing event...]]></description>

<p><span style="color: #14143d;">On September 4th I&#8217;m moving into my dorm in Cambridge, MA.

		<description><![CDATA[Last Wednesday night I headed down to Atlantic City with some camp counselors and we stayed at the Tropicana Casino. It was great to be out of camp for 36 hours and take a break from the kids. We all got blatantly drunk at varios bars along the boardwalk. Before I left the hotel room I had 2 shots of whiskey and 2 beers. Then we hit up some other bars, grabbed food, and I tried to not get lost as my iphone died! One of the international staff drank so much at Caesars that he passed out at the bar. Steve, Nani, and I stumbled back to the hotel room 10 blocks away eventually safe and sound. I fell a sleep immediately at probably 4:30 in the morning with 8 or 9 beers in my stomach. This week at camp when I have the chance to try new activities I have been taking advantage of the situation. I tried to enhance my skills in Ceramics the other day by using the wheel to create a cup. I definitely need so much more practice and work, it&#8217;s much more difficult then I though. I also tried to windsurf with the assistance of a wonderful british girl. It&#8217;s pretty hard to stand up and balance yourself but, I think I did fairly well for my first time. I need to learn how to turn board and sail. I really can&#8217;t navigate right now but, it&#8217;s a ton of fun to windsurf. I also tried some archery which is pretty fun to. The kids are quite a handful but, they are all pretty awesome. We have a great artist in are bunk, some athletic kids, and one kid who is completely obsessed with bananas. Home sickness and agressive behaviors towards one another has been a major issue that we are dealing with. But, I am loving all the responsibility and adventures during week 3 camp. Camp is flying by and I have 5 remaining before I head back home before school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So as I stated in the past I am now a camp counselor at a camp in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania. I got here last Friday after a wonderful day with my aunt Carolyn and little cousin Liam. This week we have been learning all the rules at orientation on how to reprimand kids, stop bullying, promote good behavior, and have a good time. I have met some interesting and awesome individuals here at camp. There are a ton of Aussies here and they all have a great attitude on life and education. One second year counselor from Australia has been working in British Columbia, Canada at a ski resort with tons of fresh powder for the past two years which is pretty sick she&#8217;s only 20 years old along with being a camp counselor. The first week is a bit overwhelming and emotionally draining with all the rules and regulations. I didn&#8217;t realize a few months ago how much responsibility we held as counselors. As in we have to make sure the kids are safe at all times, get them to eat, have their medication, shower, clean up, and bounce back from home sickness. One of the shocking meetings that happened was when we talked about how sexual predators some times come to camps as counselors to take advantage of the situation with all the kids around. It&#8217;s disgusting and frightening to think about. So we have a system in place where two counselors always have to be around the children. So this is what my cabin looks like from bunk on the second level. I took this picture before we made all the beds and put up the posters up earlier today. Last night I headed to the coffee show where we had a ton of great performances from different counselors. Some great drumming solos, stand up comedy, dancing, singing, and musical talent here at camp. So I&#8217;ve been dancing a bit, eating s&#8217;mores, editing some videos, mountain biking, swimming and challenging my brain in new ways. It should be a fun exciting summer with lots of up and downs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never wrote anything last month but, I ended up dislocating my knee last month while I was rock climbing. I ended up in an ambulance that night and eventually it was popped back into place after a long night with lots of morphine pumped into my body. So after some physical rehab, I am running well and playing quite a bit of frisbee lately at Camp. I have to mention the great chats I had with Josh and Tim at Animal Studios on my last day of work. I feel that I have grown so much in the last ten months over at the internship. I have received some great pieces of advise and wisdom from everyone. Luke who&#8217;s the Graphic Designer at Animal was also so nice to get me some chocolate cake as a going a way celebration. It was a gorgeous 75 degree day in Providence where I chit chatted with Tim over his future plans and what was happening to me next semester. We ate at Trinity Brewhouse and grabbed a beer and Sandwich. Later on that day I hung out at the pool and ate some food at a barbecue with Josh and his family. Later we discussed the two majors that I had a choice of at College. So graphic design seems to be more valuable and marketable compared to animation. I can learn some theories expand upon my web design/ css/ and html skills. But, I could always possibly design some mobile applications in the future etc&#8230; I still plan on continuing my passion of creating great videos for the web and maybe clients some day. We also had a nice cold UFO beer down at this Bar/ Organic Restaurant called AS220. So all together it was a great year where I learned allot at my internship, Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s , and even my classes at PC and RISD.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I feel great today. I went to the DMV today and what a drag it is. I spent four and a half hours waiting to get my state id so I can drink whenever I want. I have been lugging around my passport with me which is kind of a pain as I lost my ID a couple of months a go. So it should be arriving in two weeks. Later on after I got home I fell a sleep for two hours and then rolled out of bed and rushed down to the rock gym. I have been improving quite a significant amount lately and my new rock climbing shoes definitely help  out.  So I am happy about my progress. Other than that I only have two or three weeks of work left at Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s and then I am off to Pennsylvania for camp on the 15th of June. I am also excited to go Kayaking with my cousin Matt on Wednesday. I am hoping it won&#8217;t rain and we can paddle around for quite a bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote this quickly for sumoskinny.com So two nights ago after my shift at Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s in Providence over near Thayer Street a massive rain storm moved in. I was supposed to bike home three miles but, I definitely wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve done it in the past and riding your bike in rain is a truly demoralizing cold awful feeling. But, here is a quick video I made while I was waiting for a ride. Also I am ending my time at Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s so I may be able to hook a few lucky people up with some good deals depending on who I am working with. Just remind me that you saw this blog post.

		<description><![CDATA[So the last few weeks have sort of been rough in a different sense to a certain extent. I am doing fine with work, and academics. But, in the world of women, dating, and hookups I haven&#8217;t been doing so well. To be honest I have never done this well. Lately I have really been wanting a relationship with someone. I am hoping something will develop in the next few months either at camp or more likely in Cambridge next semester at school. So after a party got cancelled from a coworker I was in a not so swell mood after a 7 hour shift at work, plus I was all set dressed, and in the mood to get wasted. So after being under the sheets for a few hours I took a shot of tequila, made myself this glass of gin and cranberry juice, and some gold old spagetti with cheese.]]></description>

I hate getting my blood work done as I usually think about an accident happening such as a used needle getting pierced  into my vein. Resulting in aids etc.. But, I have been shooting a ton of photographs via instagram so here they are. So essentially I have been eating well, drinking a few beers, rock climbing, cooking up quite a few meals and finishing my semester off.  Peaaccceee talk to you soon&#8230;..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On sunday I went up on the train to South Station and I grabbed a ride on the red line to Harvard Square for a bit of a retreat. The main purpose of going up to Cambridge was to shoot some long exposure black and white light streaks from the cars. I accomplished that fairly easy within a half hour so then I decided to treat myself to a nice dinner at wagamama. For an appetizer I ate some duck dumplings, then I had a delicious coconut lime noodle soup with onions, mushrooms, chicken, spicy red peppers, and some other veggies. It was great for my cold. These two dishes were delicious. After that I headed over to the Arabic Cafe and had some strawberry crepes with some hot orange mint chocolate. Phenomenal night. On another note I have been sick for the last week and I am recovering from a flu. Lately the majority of my energy has been spent on my classes with ceramics, and photography taking up quite a bit of time. Outside of class I have been staying busy with Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s, Animal, Turly Tag, and any other freelancing jobs that come up. I am glad that I was able to deposit 500$ in the bank today from various checks/ birthday money. I am trying to build up as much money as possible before camp to purchase a 7d. I just wish the 7d came with a flip out screen so I could see myself when I am shooting video. With twitter I have been trying to get as many followers as possible but at least I am over a thousand now.  I am writing little short articles on sumoskinny.com now too. When I get this dslr this blog will be a hundred times better with a constant source of new photography. Also this weather sucks lately with the 30 degree temperatures at the end of March. On the other hand Japan is really screwed up and it&#8217;s probably going to take a decade to clean up. As long as the nuclear plants don&#8217;t explode. I definitely don&#8217;t want to sound like a selfish prick but, I am ready for the summer to come so I can head to camp. Plus I want the nice weather to role around so I can play my boss again in tennis at Animal. He has a pretty sick serve. I am also eagerly awaiting some suntanning time along the beach. 85 degrees sounds superb right now! &#160;]]></description>
