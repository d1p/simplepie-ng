			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, J. and I took a teeny tiny adventure to LA metro, just for one day. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_701" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1060490.jpg"><img src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1060490-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="getty view" width="600" height="337" class="size-large wp-image-701" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">it&#039;s really bright at the top of Getty Center</p></div>We got in Tuesday morning and first headed to the Getty Center for a delicious lunch (grilled Barramundi on a bed of kale and mashed squash), followed by a thorough visit to the exhibit of Medieval <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gospel_illuminations/">illuminated gospels</a>, some of which date as far back as 900 AD. The Armenian books were the most breathtaking, with lots of carefully applied gold leaf and intricate calligraphy and scrollwork.<br />
<a href="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1060509.jpg"><img src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1060509-768x1024.jpg" alt="" title="P1060509" width="600" height="800" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-704" /></a><br />
After taking a break in our hotel room we drove over to Sony Picture Studios to attend a screening of the most recent film directed by the Brothers Quay, &#8220;Through the Weeping Glass,&#8221; <a href="http://museumjt.stores.yahoo.net/brothersquay.html">hosted</a> by the Museum of Jurassic Technology and screened at the Cary Grant Theater. The half-hour film provides a mesmerizing visit to Philadelphia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.collphyphil.org/site/mutter_museum.html">Mütter Museum</a>, part visual poetry, part documentary. Following the screening, Stephen and Timothy Quay discussed their work and answered some audience questions. </p>
<p>As an aside, I have to wonder: why do people have to ask the most inane questions? Or even worse, they don&#8217;t ask questions but rather attempt to involve the artist in some sort of pointless, pedantic discussion of one tiny needling detail, masking it as a question. &#8220;Oh I noticed this one thing you did, which is like this other thing, and was your intention to blah blah blah?&#8221; That&#8217;s not a question. You are just showing off. People&#8230;</p>
<p>After the moderated discussion we were shown a short behind the scenes film shot in digital b&#038;w, tracking the process of the making of the documentary. While I enjoyed the actual film, I actually found the behind the scenes look even more interesting. It was fascinating to see the artistic process and the techniques used. The Museum is really small, with narrow exhibit spaces and not much room to maneuver. There were some great uses of two way mirrors, scrims and cut-out panels that cast shadows, and some stop motion. <i>Weeping Glass</i> was made on a shoestring budget, but it does have Derek Jacobi (!) as the narrator. All in all, it was a worthwhile event. J. and I also chatted with two women, a photographer and an art dealer who drove from Santa Barbara, and it was nice that the screening also had such a big turn out to support the Quays.</p>
<p>After the event, we drove to Canter&#8217;s where we ate kugel and eggplant parmesan and pickles (well, I ate the pickles because I love them so much). And then the following morning, we flew back to SF. Tiny adventure = great success!</p>
<p>Oh, the Sony Pictures lot has a great mural for Cary Grant and Irene Dunne&#8217;s &#8220;The Awful Truth,&#8221; which is one of my favorite old comedies:<br />

<p><em>Pkhali</em> (ფხალი) is a Georgian appetizer that is somewhere between a salad and a spread. While the recipe I&#8217;m sharing here is made with beets, <em>pkhali</em> can also be made with spinach, cabbage, or green beans, for instance. It&#8217;s great when spread on a slice of country bread, or as a side dish. I&#8217;ve slightly modified the recipe from the one my mother follows by replacing mayonnaise with Greek yogurt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/neighbors.jpg"><img src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/neighbors.jpg" alt="" title="neighbors" width="450" class="alignnone wp-image-676" /></a><br />
So on this here map, you can see Azerbaijan right on the Caspian sea, which is where I was born, and its neighbor is Georgia. The climate is about the same: temperate and subtropical, with dry plains and lush mountains here or there, getting milder as you border the sea. Two other items from Georgian cuisine that I absolutely love: <em>khachapuri</em>, which is a cheese filled leavened bread, and <em>kharcho</em>, a spicy and garlicky tomato based beef stew. </p>
<p>What else can I tell you about Georgia? I&#8217;ve never been unfortunately, but there were a lot of people from Georgia living in Azerbaijan when I was a kid. I love the country&#8217;s folk music, and some of my favorite Soviet-era films were directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Daneliya">Georgi Daneliya</a>, who was born in Tbilisi.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you probably want the recipe. <span id="more-671"></span></p>
<h3>Pkhali</h3>
<p>(serves 4-6 people as an appetizer)</p>
<p>* 6-8 medium-to-large beets<br />
* 1 bunch of cilantro (washed,  finely chopped)<br />
* 4-5  garlic cloves<br />
* 1 cup of roasted, finely chopped walnuts<br />
* 2-3 tbsp Greek yogurt<br />
* Salt and lemon juice to taste</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil unpeeled beets in a large pot until just tender and the skin is peeling off. When prepared, fill the pot with cold water to let the beets cool down.</li>
<li>While the beets are cooling, on a dry pan roast the walnuts until just browned. Crush or finely chop the walnuts.</li>
<li>Finely chop the garlic cloves.</li>
<li>Once the beets are sufficiently cooled down, peel the remaining beet skin and trim the ends. Grate the beets &#8211; I like shred them for more texture, but you could also grate them finely if you like. It all depends on how much texture you&#8217;d prefer in the salad.</li>
<li>Mix the beets, garlic, toasted walnuts and chopped cilantro with the Greek yogurt until well mixed. Add in lemon juice and salt to taste. Serve room temperature or cold. This salad can keep in the refrigerator pretty well for a few days.</li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you like good food and <b><em>Game of Thrones</em></b>, you need to drop everything you&#8217;re doing and visit the <a href="http://innatthecrossroads.com">Inn at the Crossroads</a> blog. I found out about the blog via a write up on <a href="http://www.gilttaste.com/stories/2039-food-and-fantasy-in-game-of-thrones">Gilt Taste</a>, and I&#8217;m immediately hooked. </p>
<p>A pair of inspired chefs who happen to adore George R.R. Martin&#8217;s epic series recreate recipes from the books, take sumptuous photos, and encourage readers to use their recipes and share the experience. On a recent book tour, &#8220;agents&#8221; <a href="http://innatthecrossroads.com/2011/08/03/book-signing-tour-recap/">presented</a> George R.R. Martin with baskets full of goodies like beef &#038; bacon pies and lemoncakes in several of the tour&#8217;s cities. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_633" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wehaveaproblem.jpg"><img src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wehaveaproblem.jpg" alt="" title="wehaveaproblem" width="600" height="703" class="size-full wp-image-633" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">this is just a random sample</p></div>
<p>So, I may have a slight problem with buying cookbooks. This is just a random sampling, including some of the more recently acquired ones (like the Momofuku book). Trust me, there is a lot more where that came from. I just can never resist. At bookstores, after periodicals and new fiction and sci-fi releases, I almost always gravitate towards the food and cooking sections. </p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that a lot of these I haven&#8217;t even had a chance to try out. So I decided that you all will hold me accountable. Once or twice a month, I will take one of the cookbooks I have and I will pick a random recipe from it to try out. Then I will share the result of the recipe here with you, as well as a capsule review of the book. Coming up this week, just to get the ball rolling, my thoughts on Elena Makhonko&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Russia-character-photographs/dp/1903141575/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1316623340&#038;sr=1-2">Russian Food &#038; Cooking</a></i>, which provided three of the recipes for my <a href="/grand-entertaining" title="Grand entertaining">fancy dinner</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>By the way, if you live in San Francisco or nearby, the folks at <a href="http://18reasons.org/">18 Reasons</a> in the Mission are hosting another cookbook swap on Monday, September 26 at 7pm. There is no fee to attend: just bring some culinary books to swap. There will be a cash bar. I will not be able to make it that evening, but I thought I&#8217;d share the information with you.</p>
<p><strong>What books, or other items, are you simply unable to resist, buying them just to own? How do you curate and resist the urge to collect more than you need?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img title="table setting" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5402205196_86477c21f2_o.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" /><p class="wp-caption-text">hooray for an extra leaf &amp; a card table</p></div>
<p>It may be because it was such a big undertaking, but it&#8217;s taken me this long to write about a massive Russian feast I prepared in January (!) this year for a tiny group of old friends. Although there were only 9 of us at the table, after several days of recipe selection, ingredient planning and considerations for how to set the table, followed by a day and a half of cooking, followed by another half day of cleaning and dish washing&#8230; I&#8217;m not doing another one of these all on my own for a long long while.<span id="more-555"></span></p>
<p align="center"><img title="setting 1" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5137/5402204814_350980982c_z.jpg" alt="" width="300" /> <img title="setting 2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5096/5402205434_03feaf6b82_z.jpg" alt="" width="300" /></p>
<p>Which is not to say that it wasn&#8217;t amazing. I enjoyed looking through my cookbooks and various websites for recipes, which is how I found this fantastic culinary <a href="http://www.talerka.ru/" target="_blank">video-blog</a>, although it is entirely in Russian and may be tricky to navigate for some of you. Shopping for fancy dishes at thrift stores and figuring out place settings was oddly fun. It was when it came time to cooking and the minutes were ticking away that I found myself sweaty from more than just the heat in the kitchen.</p>
<div id="attachment_566" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/feast.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-566" title="feast" src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/feast.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the table spread, prior to being happily decimated</p></div>
<p>In my zeal to get everything done and crossed off, I threw away all the index cards on which I&#8217;d written out each individual recipe. The notebook from which I worked for the menu also seems to be missing. The menu below is accurate, but I will have to forage a bit to find the recipes for sharing. If you see something you&#8217;d like to know more about, comment and I&#8217;ll be sure to put up the information. I will be highlighting some of the recipes in a separate post.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-562" title="happyfeast" src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/happyfeast-1024x737.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="431" /></p>
<h2 align="center">The Menu</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center">Appetizers</h3>
<p align="center">~ Various marinated and fresh veggies ~<br />
~ Smoked salmon and <em>bastirma</em> (cured meat) from the deli ~<br />
~ <i>Pkhali</i> (Georgian beet salad) ~<br />
~ Vegetarian salad Olivier ~<br />
~ Chicken liver pate ~</p>
<h3 align="center">Hot Appetizers</h3>
<p align="center">~ Mushroom julienne ~<br />
~ Salmon <i>kulebyaka</i> (pie) ~</p>
<h3 align="center">Main Course</h3>
<p align="center">~ Chicken in pomegranate-walnut sauce (<i>fesenjan</i>) ~<br />
~ Lamb kabobs ~<br />
~ Dill rice ~</p>
<h3 align="center">Dessert</h3>
<p align="center">~ Fatima&#8217;s Thighs and Plum Kifli from <a href="http://www.crixacakes.com/">Crixa Cakes</a> ~</p>
<p>The menu was a mix of Russian staples, like chicken liver pate, salad Olivier, salmon in the puff pastry and mushroom julienne, combined with dishes familiar to me because of having my dad&#8217;s side of the family be from Azerbaijan (I was born there and lived there for 5 years). Stuff like kabobs, the beet salad and chicken in pomegranate sauce are not exactly Azerbaijani dishes, but they are an example of how my family often cooks.</p>
<p>None of my guests in attendance were vegetarians, or at least they weren&#8217;t at the time of my dinner, so the entrees were pretty meat heavy. I tried to offset that by serving a lighter version of the salad Olivier, which usually has meat chopped into it, and the dill rice was a subtle side dish to highlight the flavors of the hot entrees. According to my friends, I done good. Probably the most popular items from the evening were the &#8220;cheesy mushroom thingy&#8221; and the lamb kabobs.</p>
<div id="attachment_624" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-624" title="wreckage" src="http://www.stayfortea.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wreckage.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="392" /><p class="wp-caption-text">my roommate&#39;s dog investigates some of the wreckage</p></div>
<p>I did absolutely NO cleaning that evening, because not only was I tired but most of us also consumed a fair amount of champagne and vodka. There was quite a bit of giggling, toasting and teetering. The following morning I spent about 3 hours sweeping, wiping down surfaces, disposing of food scraps, washing and drying dishes, and reorganizing my left-overs in the fridge (oh yes, I had a lot of delicious left-overs to feed me for the next three days).</p>
<p>What can be learned from this? Well, for starters: don&#8217;t ever do something like this again all by yourself. Believe it or not, the final menu was actually the result of me scrapping a couple extra side dishes. And there were a few glitches, like the puff pastry on the salmon kulebyaka not cooking through all the way, and the &#8220;cheesy mushroom thingy&#8221; was a bit more gooey than I&#8217;d realized.</p>
<p>I found it very helpful to write out all the recipes I was going to prepare on index cards, with ingredients and measurements on one side and step by step instructions on the other. This helped during cooking, but also was useful when I was preparing my grocery list, allowing me to find overlaps in ingredients and to quickly adjust quantities of what I&#8217;d need to purchase. It was also really satisfying to tear each index card into pieces as I finished preparing each dish. On the financial tip, it was actually surprising how much less than anticipated that I spent on all the ingredients to make a 3-course meal for 9 people. In fact, all the dishes and stemware I ended up buying at Goodwill probably cost more. I had just filed my taxes early and received my Federal refund, so I kind of wasn&#8217;t thinking. I am sure that I could have been even more penny-wise if I was carefully counting. But who cares! It was so worth it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also helpful to have a couple of friends show up early by promising them the chance to be the first to taste dishes as they come out of the kitchen, in exchange for their help setting the table and chopping things.</p>
<p>So, all in all, it was a very successful meal. A lot of hard work that paid off in an evening of 5 hours of eating, drinking and laughing with good friends. And I think I appeased the culinary gods to last me a full year (plus my parents were really proud of me).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m shaking out the dust and cobwebs from this blog, finally. Yesterday I hunkered down and installed <a href="http://www.speckygeek.com/jenny-free-wordpress-theme/">a new WordPress theme</a>, hacked away at the CSS a bit, cleaned up the tags and categories, put up a new header (it will have to do for the time being, since I&#8217;m no graphic designer), updated the <a href="/about">About Me page</a>, and added a new section about which I&#8217;m particularly excited: <a href="/travel">Travel</a>!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created separate pages and each one will be updated with a detailed post full of photos and my favorite recollections &#038; recommendations for sightseeing from the destinations I&#8217;ve visited. This will probably take up the bulk of my future tinkering with the site, but I also feel that I&#8217;ll be more likely to make regular posts here on topics that aren&#8217;t just limited to cooking and nesting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited! Now, if you are reading this and want to be up on my blogroll, let me know please! I&#8217;d love to share the link love.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made my first pie (not just from scratch, but ever) recently. Somehow I thought starting off easy would be making an apple &#038; port wine pie in a cheddar cheese crust. A lofty undertaking, some said, but I thought the recipe was very straight forward. The apple filling recipe ended up being one that popped up all over the web, with slight adjustments, and the cheddar crust was from <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/282738/cheddar-double-pie-crust-variation">Martha Stewart</a>, although I didn&#8217;t use white cheddar, which is why my crust looks more speckled with cheese.</p>
<p align=center><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5100/5463523929_51791d6178_z.jpg" alt="pieeee" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s not easy as pie? This whole blogging business. I&#8217;m so impressed with my friends, offline and on the web, who consistently come up with interesting content, have fresh designs, or are just driven by inspiration so much that their creative well doesn&#8217;t run dry. Stay tuned for a follow-up post where I delve in depth into: why am I compelled to write, in general; why lack of creative self-discipline is standing in my way; and why I need some help pushing through the writing block hurdles. For now, here&#8217;s pie.
<p>
<strong>Apple-port pie with cheddar cheese crust </strong>
<p>For pie filling:</p>
<p>	•	1 1/2 c. Sugar<br />
	•	1/4 c. Cornstarch<br />
	•	2/3 c. Apple juice<br />
	•	2/3 c. Port wine<br />
	•	2 Tbsp. Butter/margarine<br />
	•	1 x Lemon peel, grated<br />
	•	8 med Cooking apples, peeled and sliced, (7-8 C.)</p>
<p>For crust:</p>
<p>	•	2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br />
	•	1 teaspoon sugar<br />
	•	1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
	•	14 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br />
	•	4 ounces cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)<br />
	•	1/2 cup ice water</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix flour, salt, sugar and butter until mix resembles coarse meal. Stir in the cheddar cheese.</li>
<li>Add in water gradually and mix lightly with fork to create dough.</li>
<li>Turn dough out; gather into a block. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes &#8211; 1 hr.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
<li>While dough is cooling, for the filling, peel, core and dice apples.</li>
<li>Combine sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan.</li>
<li>Stir in apple juice, port, butter and lemon peel.</li>
<li>Cook over medium heat till mix boils; add in apples and cook gently till just tender.</li>
<li>Divide pastry in half and roll out one half to fit a 9-inch pie pan (roughly a 13&#8243; circle).</li>
<li>Roll second half of pastry and cut into ten 1/2-inch strips, place on waxed parchment paper and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Spoon into bottom pie crust. Dot filling with butter. Cover with lattice crust. Fold edges over; crimp decoratively to seal.</li>
<li>Bake at 425 for 10 minutes, on lower rack, pie pan placed on baking sheet. Reduce temp to 350 and bake until golden brown for 45 minutes or so.</li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What have I been doing these past few weeks? Obsessively playing in a scavenger hunt organized by the SF Street Food Festival, which culminates tomorrow. My team, Eyes On The Pies has been steadily kicking butt, making friends with some other people we met through the game, cooking and eating yummy foods and bonding through creative projects. We maintained first place for two whole weeks, and now it&#8217;s the home stretch, and just over a day, another team rallied and knocked us squarely into second place. But maybe we still have a chance, and it&#8217;s up to you to help. Vote for us! We have one day (today) left to regain our first place.</p>
<p>The video below, which I made and my adorable <a href="http://everybarinsanfrancisco.wordpress.com/">teammate</a> acted in, was for a challenge to create a funny ad for Pepto Bismol. Tons more great entries from us can be found posted on our <a href="http://www.thegogame.com/streetfood/Team.asp?GamePlayID=38595">profile page</a>. Go to our profile and next to all our creative entires is a Facebook &#8220;Like&#8221; button. Please click on the buttons next to all our entries and help lead us to victory.</p>
<p><lj-embed id="60"><br />
<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5DLD4lZJHAI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5DLD4lZJHAI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br />
</lj-embed></p>
<p>Some of the challenges we had to do:</p>
<p>* make a meat hat &#038; show it off to a local butcher<br />
* cook a dinner with a secret ingredient (peach!) and invite a competing team over<br />
* serenade a guy who sells creme brulee from a cart/truck<br />
* make a video ode to cupcakes (i made a cute b&#038;w stop motion caper where toys come alive and eat cupcakes)<br />
* pretend to be a superhero imbued with magical powers after eating a tamale &#038; take a photo of the adventure<br />
* have a foodie battle (there is a hilarious photo defending myself with bacon against my friend&#8217;s giant cucumber) </p>
<p>Plus 3 more videos I shot and edited, several other fun photos, etc. If the stuff above sounds worth a peep, it&#8217;s because it IS. We put a lot of creativity and work into it.</p>
<p>So please, help a foodie sister out and <a href="http://www.thegogame.com/streetfood/Team.asp?GamePlayID=38595">go and LIKE</a> all our creative submissions. Thank you thank you! (It goes without saying that you should like only OUR stuff, not other teams.)</p>

<p>I have a few goals for this website, and the primary is for it to not be so vacant most of the time! Thus, I am going to overhaul this errant blog and give that fresh and well-scrubbed look that I vaguely have in the back of my mind.
<p>
What will that entail?<br />
1. Create a front page to serve as the main index/entry point for stayfortea.com, from which a variety of options will be available<br />
2. Embed my Tumblr blog within the website<br />
3. Tag all posts in the food blog &#038; create a recipe index<br />
4. Redesign (eek!) &#8211; I may need to ask for help with that one<br />
5. Write more, at least a post a week</p>
<p>So, given all that I want to do, I apologize in advance as things might be a little topsy-turvy over here for the next month or so. For now, have a cuppa and enjoy visiting any of the fine people in my blogroll.</p>

(adapted/modified from a <a href="http://www.readymade.com/blogs/readymade/red-quinoa-and-edamame-salad-with-hijiki-and-ginger-vinaigrette/">ReadyMade.com recipe</a>)</p>
<p>A very filling, delicious salad full of good-for-you ingredients. I feel that some of the measurements on the ReadyMade website are a bit off, when it comes to the amount of quinoa they suggest for the recipe. It also may depend on the type of quinoa, I suppose. However, having prepared 2 cups of quinoa I found myself with quite a bit of it that I couldn&#8217;t even put into the salad. So, if you want a nice balance of all the ingredients, follow my suggestions.</p>
<p><u>Ingredients</u><br />
1 cup quinoa + 2 cups water (for the cooked quinoa)<br />
1 tbsp dried <em>hijiki</em><br />
¼ cup diced red bell pepper<br />
¼ cup diced carrot<br />
½ tsp olive oil<br />
2-3 cups shelled edamame (depends on how much you like it)<br />
<u>Dressing</u><br />
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (I used black, but any sesame seeds will add good flavor)<br />
1 tsp peeled and grated fresh ginger<br />
2 tbsp rice vinegar<br />
2 tsp agave syrup/nectar<br />
¼ tsp red/spicy sesame oil<br />
dash of crushed chili pepper flakes<br />
¼ tsp sea salt</p>
<p>1. Prepare the quinoa according to packaged instructions; set aside to cool<br />
2. Soak hijiki in cold water for 30-40 minutes; rinse hijiki and simmer on low heat for another 10-15 minutes until just slightly soft; rinse in cold water and drain; set aside<br />
3. Sauté the carrots and peppers in the olive oil and add to the quinoa.<br />
4. Add the edamame to the quinoa.<br />
5. Mix all the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl &#038; add the drained hijiki.<br />
6. Stir in the dressing and hijiki into the salad until well mixed.<br />
7. (optional) Good garnish options: shredded dry nori, some more sea salt and sesame seeds</p>
