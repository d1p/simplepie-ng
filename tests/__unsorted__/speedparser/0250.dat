			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12807" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="great-content" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/great-content.jpg" alt="great content marketing" width="300" height="199" />How many times have you heard people (<a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/01/a-challenge-content-or-die/">including me</a>) rant and rave about the internet marketing benefits of great content? A lot, I&#8217;m guessing.  But how many of those pundits and the practitioners that read them stop to consider, What IS great content? What makes it great? How do you define that?</p>
<p>Is it great because the author thinks so? Or because the content was retweeted 700 times and shared 150 times on Facebook?  Was it great because there were 70 comments? Those are all things most marketers would feel satisfaction from in regard to content they created and published. But there&#8217;s a common disconnect with this idea of &#8220;great content&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the problem with 700 retweets, 150 Facebook shares and 70 comments? Nothing if you&#8217;re trying to win a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/07/content-social-seo-experiences/">KPI contest</a>.  The lost opportunity is that most content that aspires to be &#8220;great&#8221; is created following subjective interpretations designed to achieve KPI outcomes.  &#8221;Let&#8217;s create an infographic!&#8221;, or &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a viral video!&#8221;. These content creation efforts are often mechanical, albeit often creative, efforts to produce something &#8220;great&#8221; but don&#8217;t necessarily answer the questions of &#8220;For Who?&#8221; or &#8220;Why?&#8221;.</p>
<p>As marketers, &#8220;great content&#8221; isn&#8217;t just defined by me or you is it? It&#8217;s defined by the people the content is intended for &#8211; prospects, customers &amp; influencers. It&#8217;s defined by the people we&#8217;re trying to attract, engage and influence.</p>
<p>Not ALL content needs to be customer defined of course, because many people simply don&#8217;t know what they want or like. There are plenty of opportunities to produce content in support of defining a new market, category, concept or way of thinking.</p>
<p>I should mention part of the inspiration for this past was from a Tweet that <a href="http://twitter.com/unmarketing" target="_blank">Scott Stratten</a> shared yesterday morning:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12808" style="margin-left: 1px; margin-right: 1px; border: 1px solid black;" title="unmarketing-seo-advice" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/unmarketing-seo-advice.png" alt="" width="502" height="86" /></p>
<p>He&#8217;s right. Great content, I mean, &#8220;great freaking content&#8221;, is indeed what people share/spread/link to.  But there&#8217;s more to the story to make that work.</p>
<p><strong>1. In order for the content to be more than superficial SEO Linkbait, the idea of &#8220;great&#8221; should consider customers &#8211; </strong>their interests, needs, pain points and preferences for media formats and sharing . So find out what that means in terms of customer-centric topics, the types of content they best respond to, social channels and even keywords.</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;re not after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" target="_blank">filter bubble</a> effect, so there&#8217;s plenty of room for creative content that isn&#8217;t entirely sourced from customer personas and preferences, but re-framing what &#8220;great&#8221; means in terms of the final audience is important and often overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>2. Promote the content to people who have influence over distribution </strong>(Tell 2 friends, who tell 2 friends, and so on).  The ability for your message to propagate is directly related to relevant social networks and community connections. Great content without an audience is pretty damn lonely.  As I like to say, &#8220;Great content isn&#8217;t great until it&#8217;s consumed and shared.&#8221;</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s competitive content marketing environment, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/02/5-tips-for-content-distribution-networks/">promotion of content</a> is essential to get traction. Then it will flourish or not on it&#8217;s own merit with the networks of interest that consume it. If you have an interest in sharing your brand&#8217;s ideas and affecting influence, then can you really afford to leave &#8220;great&#8221; content distribution to chance?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toprankblog/4618683399/" title="TopRank Social SEO Cycle by toprankonlinemarketing, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4618683399_6ed3d04aac.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="TopRank Social SEO Cycle"/></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/09/video-cycle-of-social-seo/">cycle to social and SEO</a> for content sharing that shows some of the most valuable aspects of content marketing. Promoting great, customer and influencer centric content helps grow your network and attract links, which exposes your great content to an even larger universe of people who can share and link, and so on and so on. Each step of the way you can collect data that helps further refine your subsequent content efforts.</p>
<p>An additional reason for considering SEO and Social Media Marketing with great content is the increased <a href="http://searchengineland.com/what-social-signals-do-google-bing-really-count-55389" target="_blank">weight on links within social content</a> like Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus as influencers on search engine visibility.  Great search ranking of content isn&#8217;t just about keywords in title tags and links between web pages anymore.  A quantity of quality references and links within social channels (as well as the authority of those sources and rate of occurrence) are also important and are a big part of what happens when content is promoted.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create great content, maybe the first step might not be to decide which infographic designer to hire or which tabloid-inspired title tag to write for that monster list of resources you&#8217;re going to compile. The starting point is in understanding what it is that your target customer or influencer considers &#8220;great&#8221;. How does that manifest as topics, search and social keywords? What does it mean in terms of content format? Does it mean images, video, short format tips, long format lists, cartoons, infographics, user generated content and so on? What has worked before in the channels where your customers and influencers spend their time? What hasn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Figuring out what your customers care about along with strong creative, social and SEO execution, means you can create content that is valuable, useful and far more likely to inspire specific business outcomes than something based on a personal, subjective definition of &#8220;great&#8221; and leaving it to chance to spread.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12793" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="International SEO" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/International-SEO-300x290.jpg" alt="International SEO 5 Tips" width="300" height="290" />The growing Global Economy has significantly increased the number of companies seeking search marketing strategies to connect with target audiences all over the world. Many clients we work with at <a href="http://www.toprankmarketing.com" target="_blank">TopRank Online Marketing</a> are either already global organizations or aspiring to deliver products and services in different countries. As a result, we routinely field questions as clients begin their journey into International Search.</p>
<p>Many companies don&#8217;t know where to start with International SEO, so here are 5 basic and tactical SEO considerations for companies looking at expanding into International Search:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">1. Domain Name</span><br />
</strong>3 common <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-to-start-multilingual-site.html">domain setups</a> include Country-specific, Subdomain and Subfolder.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, a <strong>country-specific domain</strong> name is preferred. i.e. companyname.co.uk</p>
<p><strong><em>Pros<br />
</em></strong>The country-specific domain is a strong signal to the search engine and may provide better visibility for country-specific searches.</p>
<p>In addition, this domain typically provides better usability for the searcher as it’s the familiar and more common domain structure.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cons<br />
</em></strong>For some countries, registering a country-specific domain requires a physical address. If you are launching international ventures without a country-specific address this type of url may prove difficult or impossible to attain.</p>
<p>In addition, with a new domain, time and resources for marketing a new website (think content, links etc) will be required.</p>
<p><strong>Subdomain </strong>(i.e.uk.companyname.com)</p>
<p><strong><em>Pros<br />
</em></strong>If a country-specific url is not an option, a subdomain is likely the next best solution.</p>
<p>The pros for this type of url structure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Can be hosted separately, in native country</li>
<li>Can create a different sitemap for each country folder</li>
<li>Ability to set geotargeting in Google webmaster tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cons<br />
</em></strong>The downside to this approach is the URL will still require country-specific promotion/links and will not have the added credibility of the country-specific domain.</p>
<p><strong>Subfolder </strong>(i.e. www.companyname.com/uk)</p>
<p><strong><em>Pros<br />
</em></strong>The pros of a subfolder are that it’s easy to implement and you still have the ability to set <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=62399" target="_blank">geo-targeting</a> in Google Webmaster tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cons<br />
</em></strong>As with the subdomain, this type of URL structure provides no country-specific SEO value. In addition, a subfolder set up can potentially create duplicate content issues if the content is similar across multiple countries/subfolders.</p>
<p>Also, a subfolder is typically an indication of content subordinate to the top-level domain, which isn’t in line with creating a unique website for a different market.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">2. Where      the site is hosted</span><br />
</strong>Where the site is hosted is an important factor and one of the hundreds of items the search engines take into account when returning search results. Whenever possible, the site should be hosted in the target country. This is especially important if your site uses a generic Top Level Domain (TLD) like .com .net .org. In that situation, a search engine like Google will use the location of the hosting server to determine location for the site.</p>
<p>If you use a country specific TLD, then that will be the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=54d349f76383b5d4&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">primary signal</a> for your site&#8217;s location and hosting in the specified country is not as important.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">3. Addresses      Published on the Site</span><br />
</strong>In fleshing out the on-page company information, be mindful to lead with the contact information for the target country, even if the company headquarters might be elsewhere. This is good user experience as much as it&#8217;s good for search engines. The content of the website should be explicitly clear for the geographic target audience and that means displaying location information. Think of it as good keyword optimization. If you want your UK based company to rank well in google.co.uk for geographically specific phrases, then those phrases should appear in the site&#8217;s content, internal and external links.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">4. Localize and Optimize Content</span><br />
</strong>As with any other <a href="http://www.toprankmarketing.com/search-engine-optimization/">search engine optimization</a> endeavor, content and the optimization of that content is key. Best practices will hold true and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of unique content for the site that is not only translated, but optimized after translation</li>
<li>Content presented in the native language of the country - Optimized English that is then translated to another language does NOT result in content properly optimized for that language</li>
<li>Optimization of content for popular keywords, according to country-specific keyword results</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever possible, have native speakers review (if not, write) content for the site. <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/10/top-10-pitfalls-of-international-seo/">International SEO</a> isn&#8217;t simply a matter of publishing a site translated into a different language. There are a host of localization issues to be addressed. There are intricacies and interpretations with any language and the content on your existing site may not translate well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">5. Inbound      Links</span><br />
</strong>In creating a marketing plan for the site, be sure to include content creation that will be useful to the target audience, easily shared and ultimately be something people want to link to.</p>
<p>Building authority for the site will be critical and plans should include the acquisition of links from country-specific and native-language sites.</p>
<p>Creating a website which will produce results in country-specific search takes the same planning and coordination that’s likely being invested to achieve results from Google (US) search.  Keeping the target audience in mind and delivering a site customized for the visitor is the first step to International visibility. And don’t forget, Google isn’t King everywhere – so be sure to research how/where visitors search online in each specific country.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12795" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="wcco-mima-panel" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wcco-mima-panel.jpg" alt="Social Media Panel WCCO MIMA" width="300" height="180" />A social media panel at a bowling alley? Yes, that&#8217;s how I started my Thursday morning this week, thanks to WCCO Radio (Minneapolis/St, Paul) which was host to a panel on Social Media for Business at Pinstripes in Edina.</p>
<p>Esteemed panelists included several familiar faces and brands including MIMA Board members: Brent Shiely (<a href="http://twitter.com/brentshiely" target="_blank">@brentshiely</a>), Technology Director at General Mills; Ryan Arnholt (<a href="http://twitter.com/arbenangstrom" target="_blank">@arbenangstrom</a>), Director of Interactive Marketing at OptumHealth; Jill Gutterman (<a href="http://twitter.com/gigutterman" target="_blank">@gigutterman</a>), Director of Interactive Marketing at Rasmussen College; Tim Brunelle (<a href="http://twitter.com/tbrunelle" target="_blank">@tbrunelle</a>), CEO of Hello Viking. Bryan C. Del Monte of the Del Monte Agency (a sponsor) was also on the panel.</p>
<p>An informal poll of the audience revealed that just about everyone in the audience of 250 or so was on Facebook and LinkedIn had even better participation. There were far fewer people on Twitter and only a handful had &#8220;checked in&#8221; on Foursquare.</p>
<p>Tim Brunelle opened things up saying MIMA got tired of programming Social Media in their events 2 years ago (ouch to the audience Tim!) as a measure of how long it can take for new trends to emerge within the general population. The <a href="http://2011.mimasummit.org/" target="_blank">MIMA Summit</a> is coming up soon and Tim highlighted two impressive keynote speakers, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/09/avinash-kaushik-storytelling-web-analytics/" target="_blank">Avinash Kaushik</a> of Google and Chris Anderson of Wired. Those are indeed, two very impressive speakers right here in our back yard.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">What&#8217;s a good definition of social media?</span></h3>
<p>Tim: On the MIMA.org site, the jobs page is the most popular area of the site. &#8220;Social Media&#8221; has begun to appear frequently in many job titles for Fortune 500 companies. That&#8217;s a reflection of companies viewing social media more seriously.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Why should I care about social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Social media is everywhere, prevalent in our user groups. You think a welder can&#8217;t do it? Welders are on Facebook. It&#8217;s about engagement and conversations and that&#8217;s what social media is about.</p>
<p><strong>Bryan:</strong> Why do you do any kind of marketing? Much of the technology called social media helps lower costs of doing things you&#8217;re already doing. Why wouldn&#8217;t you do it?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">How does a large company justify expenditures in social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Here&#8217;s how General Mills has brought value through social. Salesfoce.com bought Radian 6. Radian 6 measures sentiment. Radian 6 measures Tweets and comments. BTW a free tool is socialmention.com We&#8217;re in the food business. Sometimes there are events outside of our control. Example: Food borne illness. A situation might be confined to a competitor or extended to an entire category. While some of the food borne illnesses are confined to a competitor, social media helps General Mills understand whether the marketplace sees it that way or not.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Within a large organization you can see in marketing and research that it&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity. On the listening side it gives companies an opportunity to understand what a market place is talking about.  On the engagement side, it provides opportunities to directly connect with customers on their terms.<br />
In the last 5 years it&#8217;s gone from a way for people to share to a way for an entire company to share.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">When a client comes to you with interns running a Facebook Page and Twitter, where do you start? What are the building blocks?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Bryan:</strong> I ask about previous successes. What is their affinity for communications and customers. Companies are usually not interested in change. I look for ways to associate what a company is already doing with social media opportunities. Social media is not broadcast. Look at Starbucks. They make one or two posts a day and get thousands of comments from fans talking to the brand. Another example: Carnival Cruises, the &#8220;fun cruise&#8221;. Their content is about &#8220;fun&#8221;. Carnival has polled their Facebook fans and acted by changing what they offer as a result.  Social media building blocks: great content, engage and action based on customers feedback.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">What are the building blocks of listening for social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> For monitoring, what are you going to monitor? Our focus is on standard operation procedures for monitoring. We deal with students and we have a process for dispositioning how to engage what we find when monitoring. It&#8217;s important to establish guidelines and a strategy. How are you going to monitor and what are you going to do about what you find?  Pay attention to the experience that you&#8217;re after when your brand engages with customers and prospects. Define a process and your approach and then identify the technology.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">How would you define the basics of the telling side vs. the listening side?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> There are different ways to respond according to a situation. Some things like what consultants and analysts say might be logged as insight. What your audience is looking for is another situation.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">What are the core technology tools for social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Keep it simple. If you don&#8217;t have a website, use Google to find low cost templates. If you do have a website add Google Analytics. To find keywords, use Google Analytics. Twitter is free. Take those keywords from Google Analytics and leverage that for Twitter content. Facebook is the same story &#8211; although Facebook is more about friends. Use Google Analytics information to inform editorial on Facebook as well. When you put up a website, Google may or may not find it. Use Google Webmaster tools to help make that happen.</p>
<p><em>(Note to readers: To find new keywords people are actually searching for on Google that are relevant to your website, use the free <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google AdWords Keyword Suggestion tool</a>.)</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Aside from actions and policies, how should businesses address human resources for social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I&#8217;m lucky because my VP and Chairman &#8220;get&#8221; social media. We have a dedicated Social Media Manager, but with 22 campuses, we&#8217;re all partially involved with social. I also have a full time blogger and a SEO Specialist. That team is the hub of a hub and spoke model that functions as a center of expertise and excellence for the organization and our community.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">How do you coach and advise the balance of an organization on social media as a vendor?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Bryan: </strong>I believe that everyone needs to live the brand. You might have a social media department and an agency, but you should also be living your brand.  As a vendor, I can &#8220;help you&#8221;, I can&#8217;t &#8220;be you&#8221;.  There are ways to make the process more efficient. There should be controls in place but the brand needs to be engaged.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">How does General Mills think about staffing? There are so many communities and how do you staff?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Every brand is it&#8217;s own business. Every brand manager has the autonomy to grow their brand as they see fit. Brand Managers work with their agencies and there&#8217;s also internal social media expertise.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">How do you establish success metrics, budgets and success metrics for social media versus other forms of marketing?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>You can&#8217;t always tie social activity to increased revenue, but you can associate it with increased productivity, increased performance and also lower costs. Social media can affect brand opportunities that can lead to revenue opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Activity and results.  We stated 2 years ago and started measuring. Establish benchmarks, then look at that data to see what&#8217;s interesting. Don&#8217;t try to measure everything, but focus on activity and results. Spends some time understanding what you&#8217;re going to do with that data and focus on what&#8217;s happening and outcomes.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Social operates 24/7, should businesses staff accordingly?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>No. Whatever happens overnight we can deal with in the morning. There are situations that call for off hours engagement, just don&#8217;t set that expectation.</p>
<p><strong>Jill: </strong>It depends on your business. If you run a global organization, you need to staff accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Bryan: </strong>It depends. If you&#8217;re regional, probably no. If you&#8217;re a global brand yes.</p>
<p><strong>Brent:</strong> Our business is global and there&#8217;s someone on our staff on 24/7.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Should every firm articulate a social media policy outside work?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Brent:</strong> It&#8217;s part of the on boarding process, one of the documents reviewed with new employees. Let employees know that if they have a bad day, tell their supervisor. Help them understand that posting publicly can have an impact on the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Rasmussen has a code of conduct for employees and students. Imagine what your posting is being said on national TV.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Social media policy is covered in our employee guidelines. We&#8217;re looking at policies that will help us provide employees with guidelines on how they can be proactive socially.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Is the future of marketing actually customer service through social media?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Bryan: </strong>Who has heard of Twelpforce? (few audience members raise their hands) There was a thing called Twelpforce from Best Buy and it didn&#8217;t work out so well.</p>
<p><em>(Twelpforce not successful? Not sure about that. Check out Fast Company&#8217;s coverage of Twelpforce: <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1648739/marketing-that-isn-t-marketing" target="_blank">Marketing that Isn&#8217;t Marketing</a>: &#8220;Twelpforce has responded to near 28,000 customer inquiries via Twitter, enlisted 2600 employees to share their knowledge, and paid for itself many times over via extensive PR coverage, enhanced brand perceptions, and potential savings to the call center.&#8221;)</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">My question for the panel: </span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Where are you getting the rationale and budget for dedicated social media resources?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>From an interest in better engaging with customers, listening to our market and for marketing. We&#8217;re also looking at how social helps our SEO and search visibility as a reason to further invest in social media resources.</p>
<p><strong>Jill: </strong>Our competition has made mistakes, led leadership to support the argument to apply resources to not make those mistakes. Also the drive to scale, SEO impact and culture of the organization.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">A comment from the audience pretty much sums up Google Plus for people outside of the early adopters:</span></h3>
<p>&#8220;I keep getting invites from this new Google thing and I don&#8217;t have time to figure it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A was pretty good covering everything from mobile to blogging. Overall I thought this was an excellent way for people to get insights into a broad range of topics about social media from practitioners and agencies. Tim Brunelle did a great job of keeping things moving and relevant and the speakers were pretty good about giving practical advice without pontificating.</p>
<p>The entire session was recorded and will be available soon at: <a href="http://www.wcco.com/breakfast" target="_blank">http://www.wcco.com/breakfast</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12785" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="internet-marketing-trends" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/internet-marketing-trends.jpg" alt="Internet Marketing Tends" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>The web is flush with change and innovation. Gone are the days of linear information flow and incremental growth. Content flows in every direction through a variety of platforms, formats and devices.  The mass adoption of the social and mobile web have facilitated a revolution of information access, sharing and publishing at a scale never before experienced.</p>
<p>Access to information for discovery has traditionally been most associated with search. According to comScore, Google handles over 11 billion queries a month. But did you know, Twitter delivers over <a href="http://visual.ly/following-twitter" target="_blank">350 billion</a> tweets each day? Facebook is now over <a href="https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics" target="_blank">800 million</a> users and Google Plus has had a flood of new users as well, with estimates now approaching over <a href="https://plus.google.com/117388252776312694644/posts/EwpnUpTkJ5W" target="_blank">50 million</a>. Social media is ripe for discovery as well as engagement.</p>
<p>In an effort to distinguish themselves, many pundits in the search marketing and social media industries have treated each channel independently. Of course that&#8217;s not the reality of user experience and information discovery.  Consumers and buyers move back and forth between social recommendations, search engines and social search on their journey to discover, consume and share information as well as to purchase.</p>
<p>Understanding the interplay between <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/09/content-marketing-world-2011/">search, social media and content</a> translates into opportunity for brands and marketers to engage an active internet marketing strategy that celebrates diversity of channels vs. silos &#8211; provided such efforts are customer focused.</p>
<p>The future of <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com">internet marketing</a> brings the best of these disciplines together. To meet consumer needs, whether it&#8217;s B2B or B2C, it&#8217;s inevitable that PR will know SEO and Social Media Marketers with be versed in media relations.</p>
<p>Relevance, timeliness and sharability is the win with modern internet marketing. That means better content and better visibility in all the places customers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/business/media/pew-media-study-shows-reliance-on-many-outlets.html" target="_blank">might be looking</a> or influenced by. It also means a better experience in brand / consumer interactions.</p>
<p>For example, searchers expect not only to find what they&#8217;re looking for on a search engine, but to interact with the results through commenting, rating, joining as well as buying. Purchase is just the start of social engagement with customers that extends across a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/11/marketing-content-customer-lifecycle/">lifecycle</a> from prospect to evangelist. Adaptive internet marketing pays attention to those customer needs and creates a dynamic cycle of social and search interaction.</p>
<p>To that end, here are three areas in particular that I think internet marketers should pay attention to in the coming year:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12787" title="content-marketing-hub" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/content-marketing-hub.png" alt="Content Marketing Hub" width="250" height="173" /></p>
<p><strong>Content Marketing: Creation &amp; Curation </strong>-  Many brands have begun adopting a publisher model of marketing through content as evidenced by the growth of &#8220;<a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/02/why-content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a>&#8221; and &#8220;content curation&#8221;. This will only continue and get increasingly competitive for those that can afford to scale original content and media.  The sheer volume of content out there now is overwhelming (we now record and transfer <a href="http://themetricsystem.rjmetrics.com/eric-schmidts-5-exabytes-quote-is-a-load-of-c" target="_blank">23 exabytes of data</a> every 7 days). Social publishing platforms online and though mobile/tablet devices makes it incredibly easy to create and share.</p>
<p>However, original content creation is expensive to scale and challenging in the long term. <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/06/content-marketing-curation-context/">Content curation</a> will continue to grow as an efficient model for marketers to engage consumers as a source of signal amongst the noise.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12790" title="mobile-tablet-marketing" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mobile-tablet-marketing1.jpg" alt="Mobile Smartphone Tablet Marketing" width="250" height="206" /></p>
<p><strong>Mobile and Tablet Explosion</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s almost cliche to include Mobile in a prediction post because it&#8217;s been the &#8220;hot pick&#8221; for so many years. The days of reckoning for mobile are <a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2011/02/all-the-numbers-all-the-facts-on-mobile-the-trillion-dollar-industry-why-is-google-saying-put-your-b.html" target="_blank">finally here</a>. As of late 2010, more Americans <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/direct/more-americans-own-mobile-phones-than-computers-14618/" target="_blank">own mobile devices than computers</a> and Google&#8217;s timeline for growth of mobile match that of Google&#8217;s own search engine&#8217;s hockey stick growth.  The mobile web (including tablet devices) is becoming as viable a marketplace as the Internet we&#8217;ve known over the past 10 years. Search, social, local and apps all offer opportunities for customer acquisition and engagement on mobile devices.  Social networking is one of the <a href="http://www.emarketer.tv/Article.aspx?R=1008448" target="_blank">top 3 uses of mobile phones</a> and as apps and tablets proliferate the market, more time will be spent there and away from personal computers. Marketers must fish where the fish are.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12789" title="social-business-graph" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/social-business-graph.jpg" alt="Social Business" width="250" height="188" /></p>
<p><strong>Social Business</strong> &#8211; When you add up the impact of the social web on overall business outcomes, it&#8217;s easy to see why companies like <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1779375/move-over-social-media-here-comes-social-business" target="_blank">IBM</a> and <a href="http://www.socialbusinessindex.com" target="_blank">many others</a> are adopting <a href="http://www.socialbusinessforum.com/what-is-social-business/" target="_blank">social business</a> models. Beyond Marketing, social communications, technologies and engagement manifest and facilitate in every aspect of a business&#8217;s operations from Customer Service to Legal to HR. Companies that incorporate social media literacy and empowerment from within will empower their employees, partners and customers to act collectively on behalf of the brand.</p>
<p>With each of these areas of focus lies an important consideration for how brands will connect people with content and experiences that create awareness, confidence, relationships, sharing and conversions.  I&#8217;m a firm believer that search and social are inseparable as means of discovery that lead to valued business outcomes like sales. Pay attention to content, mobile and social business as you make internet marketing and business development plans for 2012 and beyond. Where do they fit within your go forward marketing strategy? Or are you already there?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12778 alignright" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="keyword-research-tools" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/keyword-research-tools.jpg" alt="keyword research tools" width="300" height="233" /></p>
<p>Keyword and topic research is a significant part of Search, Social Media and Content Marketing.  An understanding of what customers care about related to a brand&#8217;s offering and how that manifests as keywords, helps drive how marketer&#8217;s approach content, optimization and promotion.</p>
<p>Over the past 5+ years, the search landscape has evolved significantly and optimization has extended beyond the web page to digital assets like images, PDF&#8217;s and video, news, social media and mobile. The increased diversity of content requires internet marketers become more creative in their keyword research in order to fine tune the matching of optimized content with what and where consumers are searching.</p>
<p>There are a mix of standard keyword research tools that most SEO practitioners will use, ranging from WordTracker to WordStream. Here are a mix of keyword tools and ways to use them in order customize keyword research for the increasing diversity of content types and methods of search.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Mobile Keyword Research: </span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/06/quick-guide-to-smartphone-mobile-seo/">Mobile SEO</a> is the probably the most underrated of SEO practice areas. According to a study by Google, 77% of smartphone users visit search engine websites and 90% of smartphone searches result in an action (purchasing, visiting a business, etc). That&#8217;s pretty compelling data and if you have mobile-specific content, it makes sense to understand what words mobile users are searching with, relevant to your mobile website.</p>
<p><img title="mobile-keywords-google" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mobile-keywords-google.png" alt="Mobile Keyword Research" width="450" height="128" /></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mobile Keyword Research Tool: </strong><a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google AdWords Keyword Research Tool</a> offers several filtering options for mobile: All Mobile Devices, Mobile WAP Devices, Mobile Devices with Full Internet Browsers.  Now you can leverage mobile-specific keyword insight when creating content that is likely to be consumed via mobile devices whether it&#8217;s a dedicated mobile site or a general website that is mobile friendly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">News Keyword Research:</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/02/news-seo-tips/" target="_blank">News optimization</a> can impact ranking of content within news search engines like Google News in addition to Google.com. Many marketers realize that the home page of the major search engines isn&#8217;t the only place target audiences are searching. News aggregator websites like Google News can provide an important source of relevant discovery and website traffic from end users and journalists.  Internet Marketers that have access to publishing and distribution of content through a trusted Google News Source (website, mobile site or YouTube channel) may want to better optimize their content by understanding what keyword phrases are being used by News Search readers.  The difference between popular searches on Google.com vs. Google News might modest, but for popular and trending topics, it could prove a worthy investment.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12776" style="margin-left: 1px; margin-right: 1px;" title="Ubersuggest" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/facebook-timeline.png" alt="Ubersuggest News Keyword Research" width="350" height="216" /></p>
<p><strong>Recommended News Keyword Research Tool: </strong><a href="http://suggest.thinkpragmatic.net/" target="_blank">Übersuggest</a> provides a useful service by collecting the auto-suggested search words provided by Google News as you type. It can do this for Google.com as well. The Google Suggest feature tries to autocomplete user search keywords, suggestion words and phrases based on previous queries. By capturing an alphabetical sequence of the variations on your search phrase, you can get some good ideas about what&#8217;s popular and a whole range of variations.  The temporal nature of news topics provides an opportunity to identify news topics that Internet Marketers can act on by creating news keyword optimized content.  Optimizing news content means end users as well as journalists, analysts and bloggers that research stories will have an easier time of finding your content.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Video Keyword Research:</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/10/video-seo-basic-tips/">Video optimization</a> is another hot area for Internet Marketers, especially since there are over 600 new videos published on YouTube every 60 seconds. Videos that rank well on Google have a good chance of also doing well on Google.com. If so, Google will display a thumbnail of the video, which stands out from the mostly text content that makes up most Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12777" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="youtube-keyword-tool" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/youtube-keyword-tool.png" alt="YouTube Keyword Research Tool" width="450" height="183" /></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Video Keyword Research Tool: </strong><a href="https://ads.youtube.com/keyword_tool" target="_blank">YouTube Promoted Video Keyword Research Tool</a> provides insights into what users are searching for on YouTube with options to source your suggestions from keywords, another YouTube video or a diverse array of demographic information.  This tool is intended to work in concert with ads on YouTube, but can provide some useful insight into words video content producers might use with titles, descriptions and even in the script.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s Keyword Suggest feature of auto-completing your search phrase is another possible source of keyword ideas. Unfortunately, Google doesn&#8217;t make it possible to copy and past the list of phrases that are suggested as Ubgersuggest does above with Google.com and News search.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Social Media Keyword Research:</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/03/integrated-seo-social-media/">Social Media Optimization</a> can mean a variety of content types from video to images to blogs, and that makes it a bit trickier to recommend one specific tool.  Social media content can be optimized for better visibility in public search engines like Google and Bing as well as the internal search engines that power closed networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. At a minimum, understanding trending social topics can help inform social content planning so marketers can create content that&#8217;s being discussed by the social community, &#8220;right now&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12780" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="socialmention-keywords" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/socialmention-keywords1.png" alt="social media keywords" width="450" height="280" /></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Social Media Keyword Research Tool: </strong><a href="http://socialmention.com/" target="_blank">socialmention</a> is a general social media search engine that provides a downloadable list of keywords that most often occur in conjunction with whatever it is that you search on. Sources range from Twitter to comments to video to forums.</p>
<p>There are many other tag based sources that you can use for social media optimization keyword research as well including: <a href="http://www.delicious.com/tag/" target="_blank">Delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/" target="_blank">Technorati</a>, <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/tag/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a>, and <a href="http://www.bing.com/social?form=DTPSOO" target="_blank">Bing Hot Social Topics</a>. But those are simply lists or tag clouds, not in response to a query where you get results based on popularity. Despite that, they could be worth checking for trending topics.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Image Keyword Research:</span></h3>
<p>Image optimization falls in line with the intersection of digital assets and social media. Every 60 seconds, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/09/content-marketing-world-2011/">6,600 images are uploaded</a> to Flickr. Images are often shared through social channels from Twitter to Facebook to Instagram. Images can also appear on certain queries made on Google and Bing as well as their respective image search engines. Well optimized images can provide a very relevant source of traffic to a website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12781" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="image-keywords" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image-keywords.png" alt="image keywords" width="450" height="234" /></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Image Keyword Research Tool:</strong> <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> using the Images filter, provides  &#8221;top searches&#8221; and &#8220;rising searches&#8221; relevant to your query.  You are also provided with regional interest over time that is presented as an animation highlighting different areas on a map as the popularity of the search term rises there. There are a number of additional filters including geographic region, time frame and industry category.  Additional top level filters include News, Web and Product search, so essentially this is another tool for news keyword research as well.</p>
<p>Of course there are many other creative ways and reasons to do keyword research and I&#8217;m stopping at my shortlist of 5 so that you might share a few of your own. Have you found keyword research tools specific to other types of search engines or media? Have you used the tools above to any significant effect?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12765" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="remington-typewriter" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/remington-typewriter.jpg" alt="remington typewriter" width="310" height="310" />Copywriting for the web is a true art form, whether you&#8217;re writing web pages, press releases or landing pages. Add the practice of <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/10/search-engine-optimization-basics/">search engine optimization</a> and it can get even trickier.  Too much focus on SEO and that high ranking web page may confuse readers, resulting in lacking conversions. Too little focus on keywords and search traffic will suffer.  Both questions remind copywriters to consider who their target audience really is: search engines or <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/08/lose-the-seo-lingo-and-optimize-for-customers/">customers</a>?</p>
<p>Obviously it&#8217;s both and working with a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/07/fixed-dynamic-keywords/">Keyword Glossary</a> can provide copywriters with a solid guideline for topic planning, organization and emphasis so that both engines and customers are being optimized for.</p>
<p>While many companies have bought in to the fact that they need to make their content more &#8220;findable&#8221; and socially interesting to reach and engage more customers, the implementation is often a bit fragmented.</p>
<p><strong>For effective <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com">Internet Marketing</a></strong>, it&#8217;s important to promote a diversity of content according to the audience segments your company is after. That means promoting keyword optimization of content holistically and across channels.  Not only can keyword optimization work to make content more discoverable through search, but it should improve user experience as well.</p>
<p><strong>A Cross Channel Keyword Optimization</strong> effort means incorporating relevant keywords in more content than just product and service web pages on the corporate website. As companies evolve their <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/02/why-content-marketing-strategy/">Content Marketing Strategy</a>, developing purposeful content across the organization, there&#8217;s an opportunity to help that content become much easier for intended audiences to find.  That means, Human Resources, Public Relations, Customer Service as well as Marketing and Sales.</p>
<p><strong>Individually, there&#8217;s benefit to each</strong> of those content producers for being more effective at connecting with more of their target audience. More candidates in the hiring pipeline, more media inquiries from industry publications, more problems solved online vs. call centers and more inquiries, leads and sales.  Collectively, each of those content producers can coordinate via shared Keyword Glossaries to elevate overall keyword visibility by leveraging relevant cross linking, social content promotion and content creation.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12770" title="topic-constellation2" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/topic-constellation2.png" alt="keyword optimization" width="458" height="270" /></p>
<p><strong>Should you use the same keyword across multiple mediums?</strong> If your SEO Strategy calls for your company to dominate on certain high level topics, then the answer is yes. Web pages, blog posts, guest posts, contributed articles in industry publications, press releases, YouTube videos, Tweets, Facebook status updates, public Google+ updates and any other public content that can be discovered and crawled by a search engine (as well as consumed by your target audience) is ripe for consistent keyword usage. If Marketing can work together with Public Relations, Customer Service, IT, HR, Legal, Marketing &amp; Business Partners, Resellers, Dealer Networks, Distributors, Affiliates and any other content producers, the whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging builds the brand and keyword messaging makes that brand easy to find. </strong>Companies that invest in their brand pay close attention to messaging. There are communication and identity standards that guide content producers to keep that core messaging relevant and congruent with overall brand goals. Use of congruent keywords across content and media isn&#8217;t that much different. In some companies, keyword messaging and brand messaging are the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway here is</strong>, expand the scope of what you see as &#8220;optimizable&#8221; content.  Understand that in a competitive market, it&#8217;s essential that marketing coordinates with other content producers in the organization and that SEO expertise should be brought in to work with Content Strategy and Planning. Architecting an effective Content Marketing program means understanding customers and the content that will inspire them to the business outcomes your&#8217;re after. It also means being effective at using the language in copy that makes it easy for prospects to find through search.</p>
<p>My question for you is: Are you implementing interdepartmental coordination with SEO copywriting in your company? Do you share keyword glossaries between Marketing, PR, HR, Customer Service and other departments? Do you cross-train on SEO best practices with groups outside of Marketing and PR?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_12761" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12761 " style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="lee odden" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/lee-odden.jpg" alt="Lee Odden" width="300" height="239" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Interview Screen Grab from the 2011 Vocus Users Conference</p></div>
<p>When I was at a client&#8217;s User Conference earlier this year, <a href="http://twitter.com/Steveology" target="_blank">Steve Farnsworth</a> caught up with me and asked a question about using analytics to refine content for increased sales. I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/06/green-online-marketing-5-ways-to-repurpose-content/">repurposing content</a> and I noticed that the video itself never mentions me or my name and that people who read Online Marketing Blog might not see it.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve paraphrased the transcription and shared below.</p>
<p><strong>When people look at analytics from their website while developing content plans, what kinds of things should they look for to help improve online sales?</strong></p>
<p>To start with, a company can do some research to start developing <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/11/social-media-personas/">personas</a> that reflect the kinds of customer segments they&#8217;re after. That information can get things going in terms of an <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/05/content-seo-tools-keyword-glossary-editorial-plan/">Editorial Plan</a> and keywords used to optimize content and attract links, resulting in content that ranks well on search engines and drives traffic to product and services pages. As you attract that traffic from search engines, there&#8217;s some data to work with &#8211; to analyze and refine.</p>
<p>Through web analytics you can see which search terms are driving outcomes that you want, like conversions.  You might see really broad phrases, if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to rank highly for really broad phrases, driving traffic that results in behaviors that are more indicative of &#8220;tire kicking&#8221; during the initial phase of a buying cycle.</p>
<p>More specific phrases may be more characteristic of buyers that are further along in the search process. You can see that by looking at referring search queries for instances of pricing, specific nomenclature or model numbers. That kind of search can be more representative of someone who is ready  to buy.</p>
<p>So in terms of your editorial planning for content, you can take a look at this sort of cycle and anticipate what people want, optimize and promote. Observe how they visit and behave on the site. Then identify and refine subsequent content creation, optimization and promotion to make the content even more relevant and valuable.  The result is a shortening sales cycle, more revenue per sale and a better experience for customers.</p>
<p>Paid search marketers can refine their ads on the fly and see the effect on sales. What do you look for you in your web analytics to refined web site content to become more &#8220;findable&#8221; and more likely to convert visitors to buyers? Do you incorporate social CRM tools with web analytics? Any other tools?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12758" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="location-based-marketing" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/location-based-marketing.jpg" alt="location based marketing" width="300" height="297" />Note from Lee: When I heard from Aaron Strout that he and Mike Schneider were writing a book, <a href="http://amzn.to/lbm4d" target="_blank">Location-Based Marketing for Dummies</a>, I knew it would be a great resource. We often do book reviews here on Online Marketing Blog but Aaron and I decided on this format instead, focusing on specific tips and tactics you can use today.</em></p>
<p>Writing a book takes a lot of work, but with the work is done, it&#8217;s satisfying to look back and read all the content that got created. One downside to writing a physical book, however, is trapping all that content between two covers, especially for anyone that decides not to read the book. Rather than let that happen, we are unlocking 17 of the best tips from <em>Location-Based Marketing from Dummies</em>.</p>
<p>Before diving it, we should probably start by explaining what location-based marketing is. In short, location-based marketing is the art of engaging your customers and prospects using services like <a href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">foursquare</a>, <a href="http://yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="http://scvngr.com" target="_blank">SCVNGR</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com" target="_blank">Gowalla</a> to drive loyalty, word of mouth marketing and referrals. While the tools (location-based services) may be new to some people, the approach and execution behind creating a good campaign are not that disimilar to that of any other strong marketing program.</p>
<p>Now that you have a little bit better sense of what location-based marketing is, let&#8217;s dive into the tips. As a frame of reference, these tips appear in the order they occur in the book and range from the strategic to the tactical. For any of you that already have the book (or plan to pick up a copy), we&#8217;ve included the page numbers next to the tips if you&#8217;d like to read more about that particular topic:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Align your goals with the right platform: </strong></em>Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses, and understanding the platforms allows you to pick the right platform for a campaign or tailor your marketing campaign around a platform (p. 42).</li>
<li><em><strong>Make sure your business is set up correctly on Google Places:</strong></em> Because one in three Google searches is conducted with local intent, and <a href="http://www.google.com/placesforbusiness" target="_blank">Google Places Pages</a> are prominently displayed in Google results, claiming your Google Places Page is vital to your online marketing (p. 64).</li>
<li><em><strong>Ensure your own location(s) are &#8220;check-in&#8221; worthy</strong></em>: Would you check-in to your own location a second time? While it&#8217;s always dangerous to form a focus group of one, nobody knows your business better than you. Is your check-in experience as good as other memorable experiences (p. 69)?</li>
<li><em><strong>Need help merging multiple foursquare venues? Get a superuser to do it</strong></em>: If someone else set up your company&#8217;s venue(s), you may need to edit the details or even merge multiple venues into one. Look no further than the list of foursquare superusers or active users who have been designated with special administrative powers. Request a venue merge/change by a <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/foursquare" target="_blank">supersuser here</a> (p. 79).</li>
<li><em><strong>Create a Budget for your campaign:</strong></em> This may sound like we are stating the obvious but like any good marketing program, creating a budget for your location-based marketing campaign will help you stay focused and measure your success over time (p. 85).</li>
<li><em><strong>Make sure your employees are ready</strong></em>: One of the most important things you can do when you set up a location-based campaign is to make sure your employees are prepared and aware of the rules. Sometimes printing up a one page cheat sheet with all the details can be a great way to ensure everyone&#8217;s on the same page (p 86).</li>
<li><em><strong>Encourage employee participation:</strong></em> While you don&#8217;t necessarily want your employees owning the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare_(website)#Mayorship" target="_blank">mayorship</a>&#8221; or other top designations awarded for those that check-in the most to your venue, you also don&#8217;t want to discourage their participation. In fact, some of your best &#8220;tips&#8221; and overall campaign suggestions may come from your employees as they are the ones that know your day-to-day business best (p. 87).</li>
<li><em><strong>Surprise with badges:</strong></em> Not all offers need to cost money. In the case of several location-based services, there is a &#8220;badge&#8221; option which rewards things for a first check-in, check-ins at several similar type establishments or multiple people checking into the same place at the same time. (p. 99).</li>
<li><em><strong>Transform loyalty programs into social loyalty programs:</strong></em> By incorporating location-based services into your loyalty program, you give customers additional ways to earn points, rewards and recognition. You also provide them incentives to share their check-ins across other social platforms like Twitter and Facebook thus broadening your reach (p. 104).</li>
<li><em><strong>Understanding the difference between paid, earned and owned media:</strong></em> Understanding the differences between paid (advertising), owned (your website, Facebook account, etc.) and earned (media coverage or conversations about your company on the web) is key to any good integrated marketing campaign. Understanding how this &#8220;holy trinity&#8221; of media affect your location-based marketing campaign are equally important (p. 119).</li>
<li><em><strong>Create an ambassador program:</strong></em> Tap some of your best customers (particularly those that check in regularly) to form an ambassador program. Get them together regularly &#8212; monthly or quarterly are good frequencies &#8212; either on the phone or in person. Ask them to help you create the best offers and program possible (p. 125).</li>
<li><em><strong>Learn from what other businesses have done:</strong></em> The saying goes that &#8220;mimicry is the highest form of flattery.&#8221; That being the case, why not check out what some of your peers are doing for their location-based marketing campaigns. That can be as simple as walking around your downtown and checking in OR if you&#8217;re using foursquare, you can see some examples of brands using the service <a href="https://foursquare.com/business/brands" target="_blank">here</a> (p. 125).</li>
<li><em><strong>Specify which geographic areas you cover in Google Places:</strong></em> If you&#8217;re a service business that travels e.g. a plumber, you can specify on Google Places which areas you cover. This is also helpful for pizza/food delivery businesses (p. 131).</li>
<li><em><strong>Review your favorite LBS &#8220;places&#8221; database:</strong></em> Every location-based service has a location database called the &#8220;places database.&#8221; This places database lists every variation of your company&#8217;s name; you need to search for each variation to extract all the data pertaining to your business (p. 158).</li>
<li><em><strong>Monitor your competitors traffic:</strong></em> This may seem a little shady but keeping an eye on your competitors check-in traffic can give you a sense of how many people are checking in and what they are saying. This is fairly easy to do using a tool like Tweet Deck or Hootsuite. (p. 161)</li>
<li><em><strong>Think about which key performance indicators are critical:</strong></em> Any good program should have key performance indicators that it tracks. These include metrics like daily check-ins, check-ins cross-posted to Twitter, comments and tips, photos, offers/deals redeemed (p. 165).</li>
<li><em><strong>If your business is a restaurant or bar, think about table tents and placards:</strong></em> Many businesses fall down when it comes to cross-promoting their location-based campaign with other types of marketing and advertising. If your company is a restaurant or bar, you should absolutely remember to print table tents and placards describing your program &#8212; remember to include which service(s) you support, what offers and how to download the app if necessary (p. 221).</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12755" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="framework-content-marketing-optimization" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/framework-content-marketing-optimization.jpg" alt="Framework Content Marketing Optimization" width="300" height="199" />The pressure of competition and desire for business growth pushes marketers towards tactics that promise quick wins. Pundits advocate strategy first (been there) but doing so in a comprehensive way isn&#8217;t always practical, especially when it comes to areas like social media and <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/06/content-marketing-definition-tactics/">content marketing</a>.</p>
<p>For marketers in need of practical advice on customer-centric, practical content marketing, a solid framework can be invaluable for an adaptive approach that is thoughtful about overall direction and measurable short term impact at the same time.</p>
<p>An increasing number of Search Engine Marketers are advocating both Content Marketing and Social Media in concert with achieving SEO objectives which is a great sign, but often lacking a customer-centric approach.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a Content Marketing framework that proves to be customer-centric as well as SEO and Social Media savvy that I think any smart online marketer can follow.  Keep in mind, with a holistic approach, this 4 part framework can be applied to any type of online content that a company produces: HR, Customer Service, Public Relations, etc.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12754" title="optimize-framework-CMO" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/optimize-framework-CMO.png" alt="Optimize - Content Marketing Optimization" width="500" height="240" /></p>
<p>I talked about this approach at Content Marketing World recently and will be elaborating on it at several future events as well. Of course I drill down even deeper in &#8220;<a href="http://optimizebook.com" target="_blank">Optimize</a>&#8220;.  But since that book won&#8217;t be out until the first part of next year, here is a bit of an elaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Customers </strong>- Optimize for keywords or optimize of customers? It may be semantics and it&#8217;s certainly not a mutually exclusive situation with customer segments and individual search keywords. Many online marketers focus on keywords that are popular and relevant to products and services without ever considering things like customer pain points, behaviors and position within the buying cycle and how that manifests as a search query.</p>
<p>Content Marketers organize their campaigns according to customer needs and how to influence those customers to buy. Add keyword optimization (SEO) to that mix and you have a very powerful combination.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Identify customer segments</span> &#8211; What do they care about? What is their context?</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Document pain points</span> &amp; information needs during buying cycle.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Build a path</span> of content including triggers that inspire purchase and social sharing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong> &#8211; As you understand the language of your customer, the opportunity to optimize content for search &#8220;findability&#8221; becomes very important. What better place to connect with customers than at the moment they proactively seek a solution? Build relevant keywords according to customer interests into a content creation plan with key messages and you&#8217;ll be one step closer to &#8220;relevant ubiquity&#8221; .</p>
<p>Besides search keywords, it&#8217;s worth considering social topics. The interplay between searching and social referrals is becoming more standard as buyers navigate information resources online.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Brainstorm</span> and research keywords with tools like Google AdWords Keyword Tool, Wordtracker and Ubersuggest.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Tap into social media</span> monitoring tools to gauge what topics cluster together on social networks, blogs and Twitter, relevant to your search keywords.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Organize search keywords</span> and social topics into a keyword glossary shared with anyone in your company that creates online content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#8220;Content</strong> &#8211; is King and Creativity is Queen&#8221;, according to <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/09/intel-globalize-editorial-planning/">Pan Didner of Intel</a>. I happen to agree. Content Marketing is growing and soon &#8220;everybody will be doing it&#8221; but certainly not doing it well. Through a combination of keen customer insight, analytics and smart creativity, online marketers can stand out amongst the 27 million pieces of content shared in the U.S. each day or the 5 Exabytes of information created every 2 days around the world.</p>
<p>Keywords and topics can fuel a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/05/content-seo-tools-keyword-glossary-editorial-plan/">Content Plan</a> that provides a calendar of planned content publishing, topics, optimization focus, promotion channels and planned repurposing. Allow for wildcards and spontaneous content creation according to real-time opportunities and current events.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Plan content</span> according to customer segments, keyword topics and business services/product offering.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Leverage search keywords</span> for content optimization on the website, blog and on social media sites.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Create modular content</span> that can serve its purpose individually, as part of a matrix of topics and as repurposed content in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimize &amp; Socialize </strong>- Armed with customer insight, a keyword glossary and a content plan, it&#8217;s time for those Social SEO smarts to see some action.  With content staff and social media teams trained on SEO best practices, new content will be easier for prospects and customers to find &#8211; when it matters. They&#8217;re looking for it!   Monitoring search analytics for refinement of on-page optimization helps keep your investment in optimized search and social content high impact and current.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s online marketing world, there is no &#8220;Optimize&#8221; without a smart dose of &#8220;Socialize&#8221;.  Social network development and content promotion is essential to inspire sharing, traffic and links. Social links and web page links to your content provide a powerful combination for search engines to use when finding and ranking helpful information that leads your customers to buy and share.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Train copywriting and social media</span> staff on keyword glossaries and SEO best practices. Keep social topics up to date!</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Optimize web and social content</span> on and off the corporate websites while engaging and growing social networks.</li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Create, optimize and share</span> useful content that will inspire customers to buy and share with their social friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>The particular strategy, goals and methods of measurement will vary according to your situation of course, but as I mentioned above, this framework is applicable to any area of online content that a company might be publishing: Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Human Resources, Public and Media Relations.</p>
<p>Have you seen examples of companies doing a great job of going from basic SEO to more robust content marketing optimization? Have you implemented or observed some great examples of &#8220;optimize and socialize&#8221;?</p>

		<description>One of the many great things about apps and an iPhone is that you can be productive or at least productively kill time, should you ever be blessed with such a thing as &amp;#8220;free time&amp;#8221;.   Mobile social media usage is on the rise and one of the most productive opportunities to be creative is using your [...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12750" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="iphone-apps" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/iphone-apps.png" alt="iPhone Apps Social Media Graphics" width="300" height="367" />One of the many great things about apps and an iPhone is that you can be productive or at least productively kill time, should you ever be blessed with such a thing as &#8220;free time&#8221;.   Mobile social media usage is <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/social/" target="_blank">on the rise</a> and one of the most productive opportunities to be creative is using your iPhone at conferences to create interesting and fun graphics.  At Content Marketing World, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/09/intel-globalize-editorial-planning/" target="_blank">Intel&#8217;s Pam Didner</a> commented &#8220;Content is King, Creativity is Queen&#8221; and I sincerely believe that a competitive advantage can be gained in the <a title="content marketing" href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/06/content-marketing-definition-tactics/" target="_blank">content marketing</a> space by being smarter through analytics and especially by being more creative.</p>
<p>There are numerous apps one could use to modify photos, but what I find interesting are apps that use photos to create an end product like a Comic, Collage or even an Infographic &#8211; all from your iPhone. Below are 5 examples of graphics (using my very limited creative skills) and the iPhone apps used to create them &#8211; each with some level of social sharing built-in.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">ComicBook! (1.99)</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_12742" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 391px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12742" title="Content Marketing World 2011" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cmw11-comicbook.jpg" alt="Content Marketing World 2011" width="381" height="569" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Conference Comic from Content Marketing World</p></div>
<p>This is a feature rich app that is only limited by your own creativity. While I&#8217;ve only ever used this app for &#8220;Conference Comics&#8221; with single graphics, I could see someone creating multi-page comics with the app and putting them together into an interactive experience (using some other tools) that would allow viewers to turn pages, tag people and share easily on social sites. As it stands, I&#8217;ve really just started experimenting, but my running &#8220;Theme&#8221; is Conference Comics.  What theme could you see using using Comic Book?   Here&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comicbook!/id436114747?mt=8" target="_blank">more info</a> on ComicBook!.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">WordFoto (1.99)</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_12745" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 335px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12745" title="wordfoto-ann-lee-sm" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wordfoto-ann-lee-sm.jpg" alt="WordFoto" width="325" height="334" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ann Handley of MarketingProfs and I in San Francisco</p></div>
<p>This is a fun app that uses word sets to re-create images that you import. You&#8217;re unlikely to achieve &#8220;a picture made of a 1,000 words&#8221; but the words you do use, can add context to the photo.  This app works best with images that have balanced contrast and simple segments of color. A complicated group shot of 20 people isn&#8217;t going to work as well as a portrait shot of someone&#8217;s face.   Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordfoto/id414002091?mt=8" target="_blank">info page</a> for WordFoto.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Postale (.99)</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_12748" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 460px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12748" title="postale-dreamforce11-sm" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/postale-dreamforce11-sm.jpg" alt="Postale" width="450" height="259" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dreamforce Keynote with Marc Benioff 2011</p></div>
<p>You&#8217;re on the road, so why not send a post card from the event you&#8217;re attending? Well, maybe not a &#8220;snail mail&#8221; postcard, but a virtual card using this handy tool. I don&#8217;t find the card options outside of &#8220;AirMail&#8221; very interesting, but that&#8217;s enough for a few creative uses of this app to highlight a photo and message for use in email or as an illustration in a blog post. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postale/id436737730?mt=8" target="_blank">more info</a> on Postale.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">ToonCamera (.99)</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_12747" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 460px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12747" title="toon-camera-sxsw11-leebrian-sm" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/toon-camera-sxsw11-leebrian-sm.jpg" alt="Toon Camera" width="450" height="349" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lee Odden &amp; Brian Clark at SXSWi 2011</p></div>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t exactly call the images and video you can shoot with this app a cartoon exactly, but it&#8217;s an interesting effect &#8211; especially since you can shoot both video and images with it. Images in your photo library can be converted one by one as well. There are also varying effects in color and black &amp; white. You can get these effects with several other apps but they don&#8217;t offer the video option. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tooncamera/id392538848?mt=8" target="_blank">more info</a> on ToonCamera.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Pic Collage (Free)</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_12746" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 335px"><img class="size-full wp-image-12746" title="pic-collage-sessf11-sm" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pic-collage-sessf11-sm.jpg" alt="Pic Collage" width="325" height="488" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SES San Francisco 2011</p></div>
<p>This is a very simple tool for creating a collage from various photos, slightly similar to Comic Book! but without the comic effects. It&#8217;s a great way to summarize key images from an event. Photos can come from your photo library or Facebook. What&#8217;s lacking is the ability to overlay a title, but there are other iPhone graphics programs that you can use to do that. Sometimes a super simple app is all you need and for those times Pic Collage fits the bill. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pic-collage/id448639966?mt=8" target="_blank">more info</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can do another roundup of creative iPhone apps that focus on interesting video effects.</p>
<p>What are your favorite creative iPhone apps for graphics and photo editing?  If anyone has iPhone infographic creation apps they&#8217;re aware of, please share.  If you have examples of creative graphics generated from an iPhone app on your blog, please describe and link to them in the comments. (Excluding spammy stuff of course)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one thing to create a content marketing strategy, it&#8217;s another thing to execute it in a way that works out the way you planned.</p>
<p>Buyer experience is important! 43.7% of buyers say they&#8217;re taking more time to research purchases. (DemandGen Report)  Each person receives 5,000 messages each day (and that stat is 2 years old) imagine what it is today.  The amount of information that confronts each person online every day is overwhelming, so people begin to shut down or become better filters of information.</p>
<p>66% of buyers say the vendor&#8217;s website influenced their purchase decision (DemandGen Report). However, a problem exists when people SEO their website content so much that it&#8217;s not a compelling or useful user experience. Being found doesn&#8217;t mean much if the content doesn&#8217;t engage prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Content is marketing currency</strong></p>
<p>Attention is a capacity to maintain selective or sustained concentration. Instead of chasing a quantity of fans, friends and followers, focus on creating the best match between brand and social connections. Look at metrics like time on site, return visits, CTR on calls to action vs only how many Twitter followers or Facebook fans there are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursory Attention: I might be interested</li>
<li>Misleading Attention: Thinking of your content but also 10 other things</li>
<li>Voluntary Attention: Every time I read their stuff I learn something useful. You need to cultivate these connections. They will not become buyers unless their attention becomes:</li>
<li>Intentional Attention: This information will help me solve a problem I&#8217;m dealing with. I wonder what else they can help me with&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>The only way to guide prospects through these levels of attention is if you connect your content marketing to guide them through the experience.</p>
<p>Most marketers focus on pre marketing qualified leads and do not nurture.  Most prospects don&#8217;t contact vendors until they&#8217;ve formed their shortlist.</p>
<p>The buying cycle starts with interest and attention, but it&#8217;s no longer a proper funnel. Especially in the middle where other people from the buying committee are brought in. Then it narrows again as the shortlist is narrowed.</p>
<p><strong>B2B Buying Process: </strong>Status Quo, Priority, Research, Options, Step Back, Validation, Choice</p>
<p><strong>Buyer Experience Funnel</strong>: Interest, Attention, Value, Engagement, Buying Committee Involvement, Conversation, Purchase</p>
<p>Ardath is big on marketing automation. Software is critical for nurturing and handling scale.</p>
<p>A key question when developing a content marketing strategy is: &#8220;What could cause the prospect to kill the deal?&#8221;  When the buyer committee members that have not been involved in the buying process come in and start asking questions. When executing our content strategy, we need to have answers to those questions and potential objections. We need to empower the buyer champion so they can provide confidence to their peers.</p>
<p>The secrets to a better buyer experience:  Questions, Conversations &amp; Stories</p>
<p>Questions initiate conversations. When prospects initiate their search for a solution, they often search. It&#8217;s essential to  understand the overlay between Buyer Experience and Buying Stage. Anticipate corresponding Buyer Questions. Think of the questions your prospects will have in the varying stages of their experience and the stages they go through during the process.</p>
<p>Those questions will help you formulate meaningful content that stimulates conversations with prospects. Content can Simulate sales dialog, ask/answer questions and counter objections. Always remember what you want the prospect to do next.</p>
<p><strong>The story companies tell:</strong></p>
<p>Beginning: You need our products, we&#8217;re the leading provider<br />
Middle: Look at our feeds and speeds. You looked &#8211; you want to buy?<br />
End: FUD &#8211; You&#8217;ll perish without us. We can beat that price.</p>
<p>A lot of companies tell this story and nobody cares. Compare it to:</p>
<p>Beginning: We know the buyer. We educate the buyer that there&#8217;s a problem. Pain escalates.<br />
Middle: The buyer seeks a resolution. They will encounter obstacles, so help them. They will seek to find expertise (hopefully yours).<br />
End: Overcome challenges. Solve the problem. Buyer is the hero.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about your company. It&#8217;s about the buyer.</p>
<p><strong>Content that builds a better buyer experience:</strong></p>
<p>Education: Where, What, When, Why How (not about the product, about the problem that they&#8217;re solving)</p>
<p>Expertise: Industry Trends, Methodology, Strategic Insights, Futuristic. (Add your take on general trends &#8211; what does this mean to your customers and what they care about) Show that you have more to offer than the product. Are you a partner or a vendor? Give enough actionable information for prospects to implement and see an effect so they come back for the &#8220;rest of it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Evidence: Customer Stories, Analysts, Earned Media, Reputation, Credibility. Build trust &#8211; people buy from people they trust.</p>
<p>Mix up your format choices because it&#8217;s not so much the format, but the content.</p>
<p>Content Hubs Keep You On Track and help you get the most out of your content. Example: Webinar</p>
<p><strong>Pre Event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Registration page</li>
<li>Email invites</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Press Release</li>
<li>BlogPosts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post Event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slideshare</li>
<li>Email Archive Link</li>
<li>Q &amp; A Blog Post</li>
<li>White Paper</li>
<li>Article Series</li>
<li>Podcast(s)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build in Momentum Accelerators</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected Content</li>
<li>Follow-on Offers</li>
<li>Calls to Action</li>
<li>Conversational Takeaways</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer a question with your content, make sure there&#8217;s a takeaway. This is how you get your ideas in conversations where you&#8217;re not present. If you can do that, you can facilitate the sales process.</p>
<p>This session was rich with great ideas and I wish I&#8217;d been able to get a few of the process and content hub slides. However, I did capture a ton of information as you&#8217;ve read above. The practical approach and attention to approaching content from a customer needs perspective.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12732 alignright" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Alison-Bolen-SAS-CMW11" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Alison-Bolen-SAS-CMW11.jpg" alt="Alison Bolen SAS CMWorld" width="300" height="232" /></p>
<p>The B2B Track during day one of Content Marketing World in the &#8220;Gold Room&#8221; was jam packed for each session. That includes this session about Corporate Blogging and Globalizing your Editorial with two speakers from SAS and Intel. Since the topics were so different, I decided to split the liveblog post into two. This is part one.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Alison Bolen <a href="http://twitter.com/alisonbolen" target="_blank">@alisonbolen</a> Content Editor SAS<br />
<strong>Presentation:</strong> Results-Driven Blogging for B2B Brands</p>
<p>Alison&#8217;s presentation focused on corporate blogging and the blog program at SAS (a $2 billion business analytics company).</p>
<p>The history of SAS and social media started in 1976 with the first SAS Global Forum, 2004 internal blog program, 2006 SAS communities launched, 2007 the first external blog launched and in 2011 the transition to the WordPress platform. You can find SAS blogs here: <a href="http://blogs.sas.com" target="_blank">blogs.sas.com</a></p>
<p>Alison works in the Public Relations organization at SAS along with 8 other corporate journalists.</p>
<p><strong>How to Grow a Corporate Blogging Program</strong></p>
<p>Develop a strategy: Find out where the current corporate strategies are and find a hook into them. For the SAS blogging program, there were 3 main goals: to align with PR, Marketing and Customer Support.</p>
<p>Blogging supports each stage of the funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the problem / opportunity</li>
<li>Research solutions</li>
<li>Evaluate</li>
<li>Consider</li>
<li>Purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>SAS blog efforts are meta data enabled: by persona, by category, by industry. For content to be relevant and valuable it must be persona based and aligned with steps in the buying process.</p>
<p>The next step in corporate blogging strategy development is to find the right content.  Ask these important questions: Where do stories live? (Word Docs, PPTs, Videos, Live Events) Where does knowledge live? (Sharepoint, White papers)</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to find the right people. Alison gave the example of two SAS bloggers that write for distinct audiences.</p>
<p>Blog Planning with Monthly Assignments. All posts are due on a specific date each month. The most timely posts are published first. Breaking news and fillers are published as relevant.  A schedule ensures there is content to work with each month.</p>
<p>Another planning option is to focus on one specific topic.  For example, each Quarter, focus on a specific topic for each blogging contributing to that particular blog.</p>
<p>Another angle on corporate blog planning involves themes every week. Example: Monday (Getting Started Articles) Wednesdays (Topics the Blogger is Trying to Learn &amp; Documenting that Process) Friday (Posts in reaction to a particular topic from other blogs)</p>
<p>Tap Internal Subject Matter Experts: If the organizational structure supports it, you can divide blogging assignments by areas of specialization.  Example: 16 Think Tank team members for healthcare at SAS that includes authors who specialize in specific areas. They are assigned to blog on their area of expertise at least once a month.</p>
<p>Have a blog that new bloggers can contribute to in order to show their commitment. SAS also has an internal blog network of 700+ bloggers that also acts as a testing ground.</p>
<p>If you have a group blog, you must have an editor. No assignments and nobody in charge = NO CONTENT.  A blog editor is a content chaser, people watcher and project manager &#8211; not necessarily a corporate communications person.</p>
<p>For events, plan across blogs as needed. Map topics and aspects of the events to be covered by the different blogs in your organization to ensure coverage.</p>
<p>If blogs don&#8217;t work out, retire them.</p>
<p>Coach and advise, don&#8217;t micromanage.   Be patient with different learning styles. Don&#8217;t pre-judge and expect too much.</p>
<p>Results: Customer Support &#8211; Positive comments and links to your blogs.<br />
Results: Marketing &#8211; Bloggers invited to speak at conferences, getting calls from journalists, posts picked up by industry publications and bloggers getting invites to write books<br />
Results: The New PR &#8211; Journalists contacting SAS after seeing blog posts. It&#8217;s the new PR.<br />
Results: The Blog is the top news source on the sas.com website. In fact. compared to other news pages on the SAS site, the blogging effort is blowing other content out of the water in terms of traffic.</p>
<p>I think Alison gave some really useful ideas for blog content and planning. One of the most common objections I hear from companies that really should be blogging (and not all companies should) is that they have difficulty with creating content on an ongoing basis. It&#8217;s a big mind shift and kudos to SAS for having 8 Corporate Journalists on staff.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12734 alignright" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Pam-Didner-Intel" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Pam-Didner-Intel.jpg" alt="Pam Didner Intel" width="300" height="213" />Day one of Content Marketing World was a great mix of catching up with old friends, making new ones and of course, great content. On the BtoB track I sat in on a session including speakers with two different presentations from SAS and Intel. Since they were so different, I split them into 2 posts. This is part two of that session.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Pam Didner <a href="http://twitter.com/pdidner" target="_blank">@pdidner</a> Global Integrated Marketing Manager, Intel<br />
<strong>Presentation: </strong>Intel Inside Out: How to Globalize Your Editorial Planning</p>
<p>Pam&#8217;s presentation covered her journey over the past year and a half to &#8220;try&#8221; and globalize Intel&#8217;s editorial planning.</p>
<p>Intel&#8217;s 2011 Marketing Objectives and Strategy:<br />
- Objective: Increase Intel&#8217;s brand relevance<br />
- The Hero (Product):  Intel Core Processors (i3, i5, i7)<br />
- Audience: IT Managers<br />
- Communications Strategy: Signal business advantages, Stimulate interests, Engage with IT.</p>
<p>The challenge is engagement, because Intel is an ingredient brand. Consumers cannot touch or feel their product directly, so how is Intel supposed to engage? Intel promotes with new product launches but afterwards, their promotion machine &#8220;goes dark&#8221; &#8211; no engagement.</p>
<p>Social and Search are rewriting the rules of audience engagement.</p>
<p><strong>A Scalable Editorial Planning Process</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Grail: Tight collaboration between HQ (Corporate Marketing) and the Geo (Geo is how Intel defines areas of business in other parts of the world)</p>
<p>1. Prioritize countries and topics (HQ w/geo feedback)<br />
2. Finalize editorial timeline (HQ)<br />
3. Create Geo editorial collatoral (HQ + Geo)<br />
4a. Create topics marketing kit (HQ)<br />
4b. Craft engagement plan (Geo)<br />
5. Share engagement results (Geo)<br />
6. Refine Editorial Planning, Marketing Kit (HQ w/geo feedback)</p>
<p>Once you develop a list of topics, you can consolidate, especially at a higher level.</p>
<p>Global Editorial Calendar:<br />
Planned topics, Product launches<br />
Geos should have the discretion at to which topics they want to focus on.</p>
<p>Real-time marketing is great, but planning is also very important. At Intel, the Global Editorial Calendar is established 6 months in advance.</p>
<p>Who owns content, Headquarters or Geographies?  The answer is, &#8220;it depends&#8221;.  For a small company, it might make more sense for the Geo to control content. For a big company like Intel, HQ needs to drive content, but with Geo collaboration.</p>
<p>Topic Maketing Kit<br />
- What&#8217;s the Intel story? What does Intel have to say about the topic? (Legal approved)<br />
Geos can take that story, copy and paste as they need to.<br />
- Messaging and positioning: Long and short form, sound bites<br />
- Search terms &#8211; what are the search phrases relevant and popular to the topic?<br />
- A list of content pieces &#8211; Case studies, webinar, social media conversation guide</p>
<p>The kit is pretty comprehensive for the Geo it&#8217;s created for.</p>
<p>HQ creates the top level content but the Geos are responsible for localizing and marketing execution.</p>
<p>Topic Marketing Kit is the Hub, surrounded by engagement tactics:  Search Optimization, Targeted Ads, Public Realtions, Landing Pages, Local Marketing, Direct Marketing, Co-Marketing</p>
<p>Key Learnings from Intel:<br />
- There&#8217;s a long lead time necessary for producing a Topic Marketing Kit (12-14 weeks). Three topics is ideal.<br />
- Get up and personal with all Geos. There need to be clear roles and responsibilities between HQ and the Geos<br />
- Content is King and creative is the Queen. That means storytelling with simple creative that is headline driven. If you use people shots, understand you&#8217;ll need to customize for the region. Try to create compelling content that does not require a lot of customization.</p>
<p>The Geo&#8217;s job is to create an implementation plan and to execute, measure results.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
- Getting Geos to customize content is difficult.<br />
- How do you scale an editorial board to 5 geos? For U.S. the editorial board is working, but getting it to scale globally is not &#8211; yet.<br />
- The marketing kit takes 12-14 weeks, so good luck with &#8220;real-time&#8221; marketing.  When PR monitors social media and reaches out in certain situations, that&#8217;s real time marketing. But for marketing to monitor for opportunities and to react in a global fashion, it&#8217;s a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>These were some great Global or International Content Marketing insights from Pam. I think this is a huge area of growth as content marketing becomes a bigger part of mainstream online marketing in international markets.</p>
<p>Pam showed her quick wit and sense of humor when the projector showed double images, her reaction was that this was a 3D presentation and that we should have brought our 3D glasses.  :)  Great job Pam!</p>

What does all that activity have in common? It&#8217;s content, it&#8217;s social and presents a ripe opportunity for optimization.</p>
<p>Content Marketing is a hot topic and deservedly so.  According to an AOL Nielsen <a href="http://corp.aol.com/2011/04/28/aol-research-content-is-the-fuel-of-the-social-web/" target="_blank">study</a> in May 2011, 53% of all time on the internet is content consumption. In the U.S. alone, 27 million pieces of content are shared per day.  In the Junta42 and MarketingProfs B2B Content Marketing <a href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/d5f6caf8#/d5f6caf8/5" target="_blank">study</a>, it was reported that 90% of marketers use content marketing and 51% plan to budget more than the previous year.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12726 alignleft" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" title="cmw11-slide" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cmw11-slide.png" alt="Content Marketing World" width="300" height="221" /> To help businesses, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/07/seo-content-strategy/">strategists</a> and practitioners make sense of the opportunity, the first <a href="http://www.contentmarketingworld.com" target="_blank">Content Marketing World</a> conference in Cleveland, OH this week will bring together an impressive mix content marketing smarties, strategists and practitioners.  My little slice of this content marketing pie concerns the intersection of Social Media and SEO as assets for an effective <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/04/optimized-content-marketing/">Content Marketing Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, I&#8217;ll be covering:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Importance of a Holistic Approach</strong> &#8211; Organizations are achieving certain levels of effectiveness by employing Search, Social Media and Content Marketing strategies independently vs. not at all. However, the opportunity to really master the ability to optimize for consumer/buyer content preferences for discovery, consumption and sharing is too significant to ignore. A holistic approach to Content Marketing leverages optimization of content for user experience that includes search visibility and social sharing as well as engagement that inspires business outcomes for marketing, public relations, customer service, human resources and other functional areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How Exactly Do Social Media, SEO &amp; Content Marketing Work Together?</strong></span> &#8211; The possibilities are exciting when you think about how both search and social media optimization can elevate relevant content visibility, especially to target audiences that are actively looking.  The path from research to purchase involves interaction with search and social influences at an increasing rate. A <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/(S(qolko3450oim0q55s152wx45))/Article.aspx?R=1008282" target="_blank">study</a> by GroupM and comScore reports that 48% of buyers were led by a combination of search and social media to purchase. The effect of interacting with search and social influences can vary by topic, phase in buying cycle, geography and person. Companies that incorporate Social Media and SEO in their Content Marketing Strategy can amplify their ability to be the most visible and relevant resource throughout the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/11/marketing-content-customer-lifecycle/">customer lifecycle</a>. Additionally, social content and links can be influences (directly but more likely indirectly or conditionally) on standard search visibility.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>7 Step SEO Strateg</strong>y </span>- Understanding relevant customer preferences for topics, customer pain points, position in the buying cycle and behaviors helps content producers and marketers research keywords, plan, optimize and promote content with purpose. Integration with other departments can co-opt resources for common benefit and of course no marketing initiative is effective without measurement &#8211; KPIs to conversions.  The specific 7 steps I&#8217;ll cover include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Audience</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Optimize</li>
<li>Socialize</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Measure</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tactical Best Practices and Examples</strong></span> &#8211; Rounding things up includes a few examples B2B and B2C that illustrate at a high level, the implementation of these 7 steps and the resulting outcomes.</p>
<p>Readers of <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com" target="_blank">Online Marketing Blog</a> know how enthusiastic and persistent I&#8217;ve been at promoting Social Media SEO and Content Marketing.  The number of companies operating these functions independently is simply astounding. The opportunity to amplify or &#8220;<a title="Optimize" href="http://optimizebook.com" target="_blank">Optimize</a>&#8221; online marketing effectiveness towards reach and engagement is too significant to keep Social, SEO &amp; Content in silos. I greatly appreciate opportunities to share this perspective at events like CMW.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re attending Content Marketing World, I do hope to see you <strong>Thursday, September 8th at 2:00 PM</strong> for my presentation, &#8220;A Content Marketer’s Guide to Social Media &amp; Search Strategy&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12722" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="df11-make-social-media-pay" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/df11-make-social-media-pay.jpg" alt="Making Social Media Pay DF11" width="300" height="212" />As companies seek to understand where and how social media fits, one of the key questions asked is: How can you move beyond branding with social media and directly affect business outcomes?</p>
<p>At Dreamforce this week, <a href="http://twitter.com/robertwollan" target="_blank">Robert Wollan</a> &#8211; Global Managing Partner for Accenture CRM, attempted to answer that question with his presentation: &#8220;Making $ocial Media Pay &#8211; With (Really) Fast Followers.</p>
<p>Most C-level execs are finding that traditional channels are not delivering the results that they had in the past. At the same time, they&#8217;re trying to capture new growth potential through disruptive forces and emerging channels like social. Conversations need to happen about social in the boardroom and at C-levels in order to affect real change in the organization.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12724" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="robert-wollan-accenture" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/robert-wollan-accenture.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />Successful social leaders get past the hype of individual social tools and focus more on the specific social media behaviors that can lead to revenue growth. What are the behaviors inside and outside the organization that can be capitalized on to generate revenue?  Social media is a catalyst for change to better go after digital consumers.</p>
<p>Key considerations: speed, mobile, real-time, behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pick a strategy before it picks you. Most companies get into social media</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uh, Oh strategy. A viral event from a customer or employee</li>
<li>It&#8217;s too big not to be there strategy</li>
<li>Response to a competitor</li>
</ul>
<p>How many of our customers are social media active? Where? What do they do? How can we leverage social participation to affect business outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>2. You&#8217;re not on stage anymore. Welcome into the crowd. Marketing and sales needs to adjust speed and be more agile.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Social Media is not just a new channel. </strong>It&#8217;s not like commerce where we have a new place to sell. What&#8217;s going to change if we become a successful social enterprise? What needs to change in the organization in order for the company to be successful?  Social media is a catalyst for organizational change.</p>
<p><strong>4. The time for experimentation is up.</strong> It&#8217;s time to mobilize the masses. Social media isn&#8217;t just about marketing, it&#8217;s about integrating social media into the way the organization operates and collaborates. HR needs to be involved from day one.</p>
<p>DNA of the Really Fast Follower:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a convoluted path from the Enterprise to the Consumer.  Early examples of social media focused on certain types of businesses, so it&#8217;s important to understand what part of the DNA chain makes the most sense to optimize through social media.</p>
<ul>
<li>BtoB relationships</li>
<li>BtoC relationships</li>
<li>PtoP relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure out where social media can make a difference at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Three places to optimize for social:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create lead opportunities with social</li>
<li>Speed to leads and better matching leads.</li>
<li>Cutting costs, being more efficient</li>
</ol>
<p>A Sales Community that brings B2B sales teams together includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales Best Practices</li>
<li>Sales Training</li>
<li>Market Intelligence</li>
<li>Process Support</li>
<li>Sales Planning</li>
<li>Sales Incentives</li>
<li>Sales and Marketing Materials</li>
</ul>
<p>With Business to Consumer, the opportunity that stands out is &#8220;speed to consumer&#8221; through fast innovation and knowledge arbitrage. (<em>Lee: You gotta love the vernacular of consultancie</em>s)</p>
<p>To get going with the social web, the different levels of engagement are typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen (Learn &amp; Adapt)</li>
<li>Engage (Build your own network)</li>
<li>Optimize (Drive Innovation)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Listening Examples:</strong><br />
USAA embedded social listening into operational execution. They don&#8217;t look at social media data as another set of reports, but as central. Social data is the essence of how they understand their customers. Those social insights are incorporated into how they operate &#8211; it&#8217;s part of the culture.</p>
<p>Samsung uses social listening across the ecosystem. They tap into social in order to innovate by understand what their customers want. What is learned in social media affects operational choices made. Social isn&#8217;t just treated as a special project.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Examples:</strong><br />
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia launched a campaign to grow underserved market segments. The effect of the campaign was amplified through social media, which was directed towards female entreprenuers.</p>
<p>Dell has engaged by identifying and mobilizing influencers across multiple functions. They&#8217;ve launched the listening center.  Watch the video below for more insight into Dell&#8217;s listening strategy:</p>
<p><object width="560" height="345"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/w4ooKojHMkA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/w4ooKojHMkA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="345" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Wet Seal is an online retailer focused on reaching young women that&#8217;s redefining the shopping experience. They create engagement amongst customers by providing the ability to assemble outfits and virtually interact with the product.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Example:</strong></p>
<p>Best Buy decided to launch a tool to extend their tech expertise beyond stores and the website through Twelpforce on Twitter. Best Buy engagement with customers and employees helps to solve problems. If you have a question, tweet @twelpforce and you&#8217;ll get an answer from one of 12,000 employees competing to answer the fastest and best. In the first year, Twelpforce has driven down customer complaints by 20%.</p>
<p>Key benefits of the Twelpforce model include speed and connecting questions with the best people to answer, which isn&#8217;t practical in a call center situation. Service is a differentiator for Best Buy over other electronics retailers.</p>
<p>The things to get right for really fast followers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Act now. The time for experimentation is behind us</li>
<li>Embrace social media with digital and mobility. Don&#8217;t isolate it.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone across the enterprise is aligned to an outcome.</li>
<li>Untangle the technology complexity and address questions of how social media will be applied to the business</li>
<li>Empower the front line people of your organization</li>
<li>Social media needs to be a cC-Suite imperative. Don&#8217;t delegate it down in the organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think some of the important takeaways from this presentation is a focus on understanding behaviors (vs starting with social applications) and how they can impact business outcomes. Also, there&#8217;s no time to wait, businesses need to figure out where social fits in their organization, NOW.  The rate of change and social adoption by consumers, buyers and the competition is happening so fast, that coming into the world of social enterprise late, could put a company at an uncomfortable disadvantage.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12718" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="b2b-social-df11" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/b2b-social-df11.jpg" alt="B2B Social Media" width="300" height="180" />One of the big questions in the social media marketing space is whether social media is the place for B2B marketing. As companies begin to understand for every B2B company, there&#8217;s also a &#8220;C&#8221; aka people behind the business (<a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee" target="_blank">@garyvee</a>).</p>
<p>Once B2B companies realize that buyers discover, consume and share information on social channels just like any other &#8220;human&#8221; they seek to understand how social participation and marketing fits.</p>
<p>The session, &#8220;B2B Social Media: Not As Different As You Think&#8221; at <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF11/" target="_blank">Dreamforce</a> in San Francisco aimed to help answer that question with presentations from three B2B Social Media Marketing practitioners. The speakers included: <a href="http://twitter.com/gordonevans" target="_blank">Gordon Evans</a> from salesforce.com, <a href="http://twitter.com/stokobr" target="_blank">Brian Stoko</a>e from Caterpillar, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mauraginty" target="_blank">Maura Ginty</a> from Autodesk.</p>
<p>Godon did introductions and opened things up with an audience poll, asking how many people were on Twitter, blog and have a social strategy.</p>
<p><strong>First up is Maura Ginty from Autodesk,</strong> Senior Manager of Strategy and Innovation. Autodesk provides 3D software for architecture, engineering, manufacturing and entertainment industries. Maura has initiated search and social media programs at Autodesk. If you&#8217;ve sat in a building, used a product or watched a movie, you&#8217;ve probably been touched by Autodesk software.</p>
<p>How did Audodesk start with social media? Starting with individual tactics, they wanted to look at social a bit differently. They use a multiple hub and spoke model. Social Media Vision in the long term is to foster social media innovations.  This isn&#8217;t just in marketing, but across the organization.</p>
<p>The focus is social from product to marketing to sales and went experimental with 20 people to over 100 and a more formal social strategy in 2 years.  They added social features into a consumer product, they monitor Twitter for customer service opportunities and engage with a community on Facebook with over 500,000 fans.</p>
<p>Social isn&#8217;t about shouting, it&#8217;s about &#8220;answering the phone&#8221; from your customers</p>
<p><strong>Next up is Brian Stokoe from Caterpillar </strong>who is responsible for all public facing social media there. Caterpillar has over 100,000 employees and revenues of over $40 billion. They have 24 brands and over 20 customer industry segments, so there is a diversity of considerations for how they participate on the social web.</p>
<p>Caterpillar started by creating a social presence on sites like Facebook and Twitter, which worked well because people familiar with the brand expected them there. But they had to take a step back and start to consider the variety of needs for their different customer segments. Previously, they would promote a message to Facebook, but that wasn&#8217;t necessarily relevant to all customer groups.</p>
<p>They look at each customer segment and decide what mix of social presence is appropriate: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Forums, etc. vs. publishing one destination for the whole company. By creating unique social destinations for each segment, Caterpillar better serves it&#8217;s customers with relevant information and experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q and A on B2B Social Media:</strong></p>
<p>Neither Brian or Maura are part of PR and Communications departments, which is in contrast with how social media is governed in most organizations. Maura mentioned that Autodesk social media efforts worked with PR from the start.</p>
<p>Brian mentioned one of the customer segments his social media efforts addresses are the the audience for PR and that Caterpillar has embraced PR use of social monitoring and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Are your goals at your company to empower all employees to be ambassadors for your company?</p>
<p>Maura: We want to tap into that enthusiasm. We have guidelines for participation. It helps you</p>
<p>Brian: It goes back to the policy we have for employees regarding social media. We want employees to show their expertise, be smart about disclosure and proprietary information. On centralized sites like Facebook or Twitter, the expectation is that the message of Caterpillar be managed through a company spokesperson. But when it comes to forums, employees can jump in as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> What&#8217;s a good listening strategy for B2B?</p>
<p>Maura: The first thing you can list for are brand keywords. What&#8217;s happening with the brands and other identifiers like the tasks prospects want to complete. There&#8217;s some back and forth between what words customer are using and how you want to be known for. Understanding the how customers see things is important.</p>
<p>Brian: With Caterpillar, there were challenges because of &#8220;cat&#8221; and &#8220;Caterpillar&#8221; meaning different things.  As for listening, attention is paid to the differences in customer segments.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Do you monitor your competitors?</p>
<p>Brian: Yes</p>
<p>Maura: If you&#8217;re going to listen, why not listen to the industry?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>What are you measuring?</p>
<p>Brian: We have an extensive metrics program. We look at it as a value funnel. We gather info for awareness and put some context to it to identify value. As the interactions get further down the buying funnel, that&#8217;s where the rubber hits the road. It&#8217;s important to tie social media metrics to business objectives, not just reputation.</p>
<p>Maura: Our social media center of excellence collaborates to determine what we should measure.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> How important is your video strategy as a B2B company?</p>
<p>Brian: For us yes, much of what we do is very visual. One thing we&#8217;ve identified is that there&#8217;s no reason to re-create the wheel with video hosting &#8211; people watch videos on YouTube, so that&#8217;s what we use.</p>
<p>Maura: We determined that YouTube was a great place for use to participate through Net Promoter score. We have almost 14 million views on YouTube so far.</p>
<p>Brian: A lot of organizations come from a world of high video production and we&#8217;ve found authenticity is more important. Actual experiences and the rugged reality of using our product better connects with the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Can you give advice on how to evolve your channel or dealers through social media propgrams?</p>
<p>Maura: We include them in social media training. There&#8217;s more work to do there</p>
<p>Brian: Dealers are a critical part of Caterpillar. They carry their own brand in dealing with customers. It&#8217;s important to us that dealers have training and guidelines so customers have a congruent experience.</p>
<p><strong>Audience Q:</strong> Do you actively pursue and engage key influencers?</p>
<p>Brian: Yes, especially in forums who help out. Whether it&#8217;s tossing them a CAT hat or publicly recognizing them, we strive to keep them involved.</p>
<p>Audience Q: How did you segment social media efforts by customer segment?</p>
<p>Brian: I borrowed somewhat from an Enterprise strategy that had similar considerations for the differences in customer groups.</p>
<p>There was more Q &amp; A but I needed the time to wrap up this post so I&#8217;d have time to work on the morning keynote post.  A great session overall and good insights into how B2B companies have actually implemented social strategies in their companies. Along the lines of this topic, here are a few good posts that share specific resources for B2B social media: <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/04/b2b-social-media-infographics/">infographics</a>, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/04/b2b-social-media-reports-2011/">reports</a>.</p>

<p>The sub-title is appropriately a great indication of the theme for this guide: &#8220;Research and Insights for Creating and Capitalizing on a Rich End-User Search Experience. This is a far cry from the days of &#8220;Boost Your Search Engine Rankings and More!&#8221;.  As Online Marketers have matured, there is an increasing focus on optimizing for customers and customer experience vs. the sole KPIs of rankings and traffic.</p>
<p>Authored by Research Analyst Kaci Bower, MarketingSherpa&#8217;s <a title="Affiliate Link" href="http://www.sherpastore.com/2012SearchMarketingBMRSEO.html?8907" target="_blank">2012 Search Marketing Benchmark Report SEO Edition</a> is broken down into an executive summary that outlines key findings from the survey from which the report is based, 10 chapters on everything from integrating Social Media &amp; SEO to Mobile tactics to SEO Success Stories. There&#8217;s also an appendix that includes charts from the research.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a nut for data, charts and research based insights, this guide is priceless. The section on Planning and Tracking budgets as well as the Agency Perspectives offer helpful information for consultants and of course the SEO Objectives/Tactics, Local, Mobile and  Content Marketing sections offer plenty of tactics and insights for practitioners.</p>
<p>If you read Online Marketing Blog, you know we&#8217;ve been promoting the notion of &#8220;<a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/08/lose-the-seo-lingo-and-optimize-for-customers/">optimize for customers</a>&#8221; over a sole focus on keywords. That perspective blends well with the customer-centric theme of MarketingSherpa&#8217;s SEO Report.</p>
<p>Just think about the richness of users search experience today in stark contrast to the bland search results made up mostly of just web pages several years ago. With Google in particular, Universal Search, Personalized Search, Social Search, Instant Search, Local/Mobile, Preview and even the currently suspended Real-Time Search all factor together to  give users what they&#8217;re looking for. The diversity of search experience is the basis for the research and recommendations in the 2012 SEO Guide.</p>
<p>One of the interesting insights from the research in this report includes the disconnect between marketers that consider SEO Strategy an important challenge to overcome, but not a a top objective.  That mismatch in priorities can be costly in terms of ineffective prioritization of tactics and inefficient utilization of resources. The real irony is stated in the report, &#8220;Interestingly, increasing measurable ROI ranked higher as an objective than developing an actual strategy to do so!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="size-full style= alignnone" title="SEO Strategy" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/msherpa-seoguide-strategy.png" alt="SEO Strategy" width="450" height="466" /> <!-- this image added manually --></p>
<p>Another key finding concerns the importance of <a href="http://www.toprankmarketing.com/content-marketing/" target="_blank">Content Marketing</a>, which was rated  as one of the most effective tactics for SEO but also one of the most difficult to implement. Content has been a hot topic for years, with many SEOs dismissing &#8220;content is king&#8221; as a whitehat SEO battle cry. But of course, relevant (optimized) content is effective for link building, sharing and certainly for inspiring prospects to become customers.  The SEO Report identifies many other top SEO tactics as well, segmenting by organization SEO maturity and industry.</p>
<p><img class="size-full style= alignnone" title="Content Marketing SEO" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/msherpa-seoguide-content.png" alt="Content Marketing SEO" width="450" height="382" /><br />
<!-- this image added manually --></p>
<p>I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. MarketingSherpa has done a great job at providing data sliced and diced every way you can imagine with this year&#8217;s version of the SEO Report.  The survey findings presented according to level of SEO maturity is especially helpful for companies that have been utilizing SEO best practices for some time, but want to continue to advance their progress.</p>
<p>For organizations that are just starting to investigate a more holistic approach to SEO to professionals that want to incorporate SEO best practices in their areas of expertise (like Public Relations, Web Design, Interactive), the 2012 SEO Guide is full of data, examples and insights.</p>
<p>You can get a sneak peek at the Search Marketing Benchmark Report, SEO Edition and more information about the report overall on the <a href="http://www.sherpastore.com/2012SearchMarketingBMRSEO.html?8907" target="_blank">MarketingSherpa website</a> (affiliate link).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12712" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="optimize-social-seo" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/optimize-social-seo.jpg" alt="Optimize" width="300" height="225" />With the boom in brands publishing content and the explosion of user generated <a href="http://corp.aol.com/2011/04/28/aol-research-content-is-the-fuel-of-the-social-web/" target="_blank">content from social networks</a>, the competition to stand out is only going to get more challenging for companies that rely on the web to attract new business.  Online Marketers that adapt, evolve and scale through a more holistic approach to marketing online gain both <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/08/social-media-content-marketing-success/">short and long term</a> benefits, distinct from competitors reliant on the latest tactic du jour.</p>
<p>The process of change starts with acknowledgment that change is needed and then extends to identifying goals, understanding target audiences &amp; communities, developing an approach and tactical mix for reaching business objectives. Assessing a starting point is usually accomplished through an audit, research and benchmarking for future performance tracking.</p>
<p>When taking a look at our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toprank" target="_blank">TopRank Slideshare</a> account for past presentations I found one on Social Media &amp; SEO from back in 2007 offering the following advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory your media &amp; content</li>
<li>Keyword optimize your media</li>
<li>Research social media communities</li>
<li>Make it easy for readers to save/share content</li>
<li>Create profiles and grow a network of friends</li>
<li>Participate in the community</li>
<li>Measure results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s as solid advice today as it was then.</strong> As a advocate of the power of optimization (not just search engine optimization but optimizing online marketing for better performance) it&#8217;s interesting how much hasn&#8217;t changed in the past 4 years.  No matter what BS certain mainstream publications or social media pontificators say, SEO brings a competitive advantage to an online marketing mix.  It may not be the silver bullet it once was, but SEO is an amplifier and catalyst to Social Media and Content Marketing. What smart marketers know, is how and when to apply SEO best practices to extend the reach of their social media and content marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Last week I gave my first presentation at Social Media Breakfast Minneapolis St. Paul #SMBMSP on the intersection of SEO, Social Media and the importance of Content in <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com">Online Marketing</a>. In order to scale the impact of Social SEO &amp; Content, internal advocates need to become Social SEO Heroes that can lead, educate and support the organizational change necessary to empower business social media and SEO literacy.  This presentation starts with context and perspective, then provides a framework and even specific tactics for the Content Marketing Trilogy of  Discovery, Consumption and Sharing. I hope you find it useful and share your feedback in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12493" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="seo-learning-resources" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/seo-learning-resources.jpg" alt="SEO Training" width="300" height="199" />To learn the art and science of SEO (search engine optimization) it is my belief that the best source is your own efforts at hypothesis, experimentation and refinement.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re starting from scratch and really have no idea what SEO is, then certainly one of the popular <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/12/reader-poll-best-books-on-seo/">SEO books</a> would be a appropriate as well as attending an industry conference like SES, SMX, Pubcon or a regional event.</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters?hl=en" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/gg132923.aspx" target="_blank">Bing</a> have made great efforts at providing webmasters with resources that are worth checking out as well. Online SEO training like that offered by <a href="http://www.marketmotive.com/internet-marketing-training-certification-subjects?sub=trb" target="_blank">Market Motive</a> (affiliate link) can help those without the time to attend &#8220;real world&#8221; events.</p>
<p>For brand marketers, I&#8217;d suggest checking out the ad:tech New York <a href="http://www.ad-tech.com/ny/adtech_new_york_marketing_masters.aspx" target="_blank">Marketing Masters</a> SEM Track in November that <a href="http://www.ad-tech.com/ny/adtech_new_york_speakers.aspx?Spkid=3421" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been putting together</a> with case studies and best practices SEO and Integrated PPC insights from VW, REI, Salesforce and several others. (shameless plug)</p>
<p>Every other SEO resource has pretty much been covered in posts like this elsewhere on the web but when sourcing any kind of recommended list (including this one) care should be taken as to motive and real-world validity of the advice and information provided. There are plenty of smart pontificators that have taken &#8220;make shit up&#8221; to an art form, blending reasonable advice with pure theory and packaging it as SEO gospel. In fact, that same dose of healthy skepticism could be applied to anything you find and read on the web.</p>
<p>Literally everything you&#8217;d ever want to know about becoming a successful SEO is online, you just have to sort through what&#8217;s theory, rant and outdated information.  That&#8217;s why, if you create a strong base of knowledge through your own testing and direct observation, you&#8217;ll be in a better position to filter quality signal from the noise.</p>
<p>Not to overwhelm, but here&#8217;s a list of over <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/09/100-ways-learn-search-marketing/">100 SEM information sources</a> and another list of over <a href=" http://www.toprankblog.com/search-marketing-blogs/">400 SEM &amp; Online Marketing Blogs</a> that you may find useful in your journey to learn more about SEO.</p>
<p>We just added a review of the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/08/marketingsherpa-2012-seo-benchmark-report/">2012 MarketingSherpa SEO Benchmark Report</a> &#8211; a great source of data driven insights about SEO. Very useful as a SEO learning tool.  A similar resource that we&#8217;ve reviewed: <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/06/seo-best-practices-2011/">Econsultancy SEO Best Practices Guide</a> is also a great aid in learning SEO.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;ve been in the search engine optimization game for 1 or 10 years, what have you found to be the best sources of information to learn, maintain and advance your SEO knowledge?  What would you recommend to a SEO newbie?  Or to an in-house interactive marketer with SEO responsibilities but limited time to test and learn on their own?</p>

Besides hiring an editorial staff complete with corporate journalists, one of the most valuable sources of content for online marketing comes from your brand&#8217;s community.</p>
<p>Tapping in to what customers care about related to your products /services and what your brand stands for can be a gold mine of meaningful content.</p>
<p>I wrote about this recently on ClickZ, &#8220;<a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2098809/crowdsourcing-user-generated-content" target="_blank">Crowdsourcing and User Generated Content</a>&#8220;, offering pros and cons plus a few tips. Here are 5 of those tips with some additional commentary based on discussions with audience members at the recent SES San Francisco conference:</p>
<p><strong>Interviews.</strong> Raising questions is one of the most basic ways to crowdsource content. The method to employ depends on the desired outcome. Asking the community for suggestions of whom to interview and what questions to ask is a great way to get people involved. Interviewing industry thought leaders provides the brand&#8217;s audience with unique content and creates a positive association between the &#8220;brandividual&#8221; and the company.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Example: </strong></em></span>Tapping multiple industry thought leaders for their definition of &#8220;<a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2010/06/content-marketing-curation-context/">content curation</a>&#8221; for a blog post that received substantial distribution and return visits.</p>
<p><strong>Social Q&amp;A.</strong> Yahoo Answers, LinkedIn, and sites like Quora can provide very useful platforms to present questions and attract answers from a variety of people. Of course, your intent needs to be clear and permission for reuse should be obtained before republishing. Those familiar with the Q&amp;A communities can word questions to attract replies from specific influentials who might not otherwise respond to a content participation pitch via email.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong></span>Posting a question to LinkedIn related to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2009/01/shift-budgets-digital-marketing/">shift in direct marketing budgets to digital</a>&#8220;, that received great quality responses and over 30 comments on the post.</p>
<p><strong>Contests Resulting in Content</strong>. Examples of contests in which consumers produce their own videos and share images abound on the social web. Search engines love any kind of content, especially text.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong></span>In the past, Marketing Pilgrim ran a great contest for a <a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/search-engine-marketing-scholarship" target="_blank">search marketing scholarship</a>. The articles written by contestants drive traffic to Andy&#8217;s website and also become content on it. To top if off, the articles were compiled into an e-book.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Feedback Loop.</strong> One of the most meaningful ways for a community to engage with a brand is through comments on a company blog. Asking readers to participate in a dialogue by commenting can result in content that is better than the original blog post. Brands can then recognize blog commenters by drawing attention to the &#8220;best of&#8221; comments through a separate blog post or in a newsletter.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong></span>See TopRank&#8217;s <a href="http://www.toprankmarketing.com/tips-newsletter/jun11/" target="_blank">Online Marketing Newsletter</a> for an example of this in action, where comments are curated into a section called, &#8220;What the Online Marketing Blog Community Has to Say&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Book Authoring by Community.</strong> Reaching out to industry experts to share their insights as part of a larger project, such as a book in print or an ebook can be very effective.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong></span>Author Michael Miller did this with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Online-Marketing-Heroes-Interviews-Successful/dp/0470242043" target="_blank">Online Marketing Heroes</a>, of which I was a part. He interviewed 25 successful marketers; the results of those interviews became the book published by Wiley.</p>
<p>Numerous companies have connected with industry thought leaders for content and compiled the responses into an eBook. A good example is Jay Baer&#8217;s &#8211; Staggering Social Media Insights: <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/convince-convert-news/staggering-social-media-insights-the-best-of-twitter-20-ebook/" target="_blank">The Best of the Twitter 20 eBook</a>.</p>
<p>This is really just the tip of the iceberg for creative content crowdsourcing ideas. Each industry and community is different and with quality analysis and creative ideas, organizations can accomplish content creation objectives as well as better engaging and growing their social networks.</p>
<p>Have you overcome content creation and scaling issues by crowdsourcing? What creative content sourcing ideas have you implemented?</p>
