Well, lets jump to another host city for one of next year&#8217;s top sporting events: Warsaw, the capital of Poland. The capital is ready to give a warm welcome to football fans from around Europe, are you ready?<span
id="more-7180"></span></p><h2>What to see in Warsaw</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/10/03/euro-2012-warsaw-the-heart-of-poland-28-7180/attachment/warsaw-history/" rel="attachment wp-att-7181"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7181" title="Looking back..." src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Warsaw-history.jpg" alt="Looking back..." width="500" height="400" /></a></p><p><strong>Beautiful and glorious:</strong> Warsaw seems to be just that at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, a city at its absolute height of importance, a metropolis in Europe known locally as the &#8220;Paris of the North&#8221; with its tree-lined avenues, literary cafés and culture central for the old continent.</p><p>Then came the Second World War: after being bombed by the Germans, Warsaw was never going to look the same. <strong>The city was, for the most part, destroyed</strong>. This didn&#8217;t stop the Poles from gathering up every single stone to rebuilt their capital, this time to suit the tastes of the Socialists. Today the Old Town still shines in all its glory, surrounded by a myriad of new buildings, including the Palace of Culture and Science.</p><h2>Not to miss</h2><h3>Old Town (Stare Miasto)</h3><p>As we said, this area was rebuilt by the Polish with great passion which renewed the city and gives visitors a glimpse of Warsaw&#8217;s earlier splendour. The reconstruction respected original city plans, even the use of the original material and architectural style. Let&#8217;s take a look at the essentials in this corner of the city:</p><ul><li><strong>Market Square (Rynek Starego Miasta):</strong> the heart of the Old Town. All the small roads converge here and is the perfect beginning to a perfect afternoon walk. On foot you can reach Castle Square where the Zamek stands. It was once a royal palace but today it is now one of the city&#8217;s finest museums with a number of important masterpieces inside.</li><li><strong>Religious buildings:</strong> these are without a doubt the most beautiful buildings in the city and it would be unthinkable to come all the way to Warsaw and not visit the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in perfect Gothic form. Tired? Take a little break before heading over to the Church of the Holy Spirit and the Church of St. Hyacinth, two important examples of the Baroque style in the city.</li></ul><h3>Warsaw&#8217;s palaces</h3><div><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/10/03/euro-2012-warsaw-the-heart-of-poland-28-7180/attachment/warsaw-zamek/" rel="attachment wp-att-7182"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7182" title="Zamek" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Warsaw-Zamek.jpg" alt="Zamek" width="500" height="322" /></a></div><p>Warsaw&#8217;s palaces are fine examples of beautiful architecture, built in a number of different styles which show that many artistic movements that swept through Europe actually arrived quite a bit later in Poland than in western Europe which is why you&#8217;ll see such a mix of styles and influences around the city. The result is nothing but captivating.</p><ul><li><strong>Wilanow Palace: </strong>this is probably the most beautiful palace in the whole country, from the aesthetic point of things. From the outside you&#8217;ll see where the Italians had an effect on the design. The English and Oriental influences can be found inside, in the different motifs. The palace houses one of the country&#8217;s most impressive collections of paintings. Don&#8217;t miss the exterior gardens as well.</li><li><strong>Palace of Culture and Science:</strong> this was a gift from the Soviet Union to Poland, built in just 3 years with the help of thousands of workers. When communism collapsed in the 1980s the Polish government discussed at length what should be done with the building. They decided to transform it into a major tourist attraction, making it also the highest building in the country.</li><li><strong>Water Palace: </strong>located in the wonderful Lazienki Park, you can also visit a number of other neoclassic buildings nearby including a theatre which stands on an artificial island in the middle of this enchanting park.</li></ul><h2>Other areas of interest</h2><div><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/10/03/euro-2012-warsaw-the-heart-of-poland-28-7180/attachment/warsaw-skyline/" rel="attachment wp-att-7183"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7183" title="Warsaw towers" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Warsaw-skyline.jpg" alt="Warsaw towers" width="375" height="500" /></a></div><p>Warsaw is a very multi-faceted city with ample opportunities to experience a journey within a journey, visiting some of these interesting neighbourhoods that can take you back in time.</p><p><strong>Jewish Ghetto:</strong> this area of Warsaw is now home to one of the biggest Jewish communities in a previously Nazi-occupied European country. The past is tainted red; many Jews were taken from here to the nearby concentration camps. The Jewish Ghetto isn&#8217;t a sombre stop on the tourist trail, it shows what&#8217;s possible after an atrocity. <strong>Nozyk Synagogue:</strong> for many with Polish ancestors who were killed during the Second World War this is a site of pilgrimage where the fallen are memorialized in the Jewish Cemetery.</p><p><strong>Prague Quarter: </strong>the area beyond the Vistula, on the right bank, was separated from Warsaw for more than three centuries. It was a city in itself, part of which was hardly touched by the German&#8217;s bombs. While Warsaw grew and expanded, the residents in Prague just watched, staying close to their humble roots and never straying too far from their river-side homes.</p><h2>Warsaw by night</h2><p>The sun slowly disappears beyond the horizon and the atmosphere of the city takes a 180° turn. Warsaw&#8217;s nightlife offers travellers a little bit of everything. What kind of party or experience are you looking for? Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p><h3>Bars</h3><ul><li><strong>Chlodna 25. </strong>If you like the more alternative/bohemian vibe then head here. The place has hugely been neglected but the locals like its laid back, grunge vibe. Get here early because it&#8217;s packed on weekends with the local crowd. <strong>Address:</strong> 75a, ul. Zelazna</li><li><strong>Prague Port. </strong>Looking for something a little more refined? Cocktails, high-heels and collared shirts. As the name suggests, you&#8217;ll find this chic place in Prague. <strong>Address:</strong> 23, ul. Stefana Okrzei</li></ul><h3>Nightclubs</h3><ul><li><strong>Piekarnia. </strong>Part of being the coolest club in town means that this place is really busy on weekends. Theme nights are a real hit! Some of the best DJs from both the European and the international circuit come to spin their discs here. <strong>Address:</strong> 11, ul. Młocinska</li><li><strong>Platinum. </strong>As the name suggests, Platinum is quite exclusive. The nightclub spreads out on two floors, giving the perfect setting for an intimate and luxurious evening. If you&#8217;re set to impress your date, bring them here after a couple of cocktails at Prague Port. <strong>Address:</strong> 6, ul. Fredry</li></ul><h2>Other tips</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/10/03/euro-2012-warsaw-the-heart-of-poland-28-7180/attachment/city-of-warsaw/" rel="attachment wp-att-7184"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7184" title="City of Warsaw" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/city-of-Warsaw.jpg" alt="City of Warsaw" width="333" height="500" /></a></p><p>Warsaw is both quiet and hospitable but as in most major cities there are a few areas that are worth staying away from as a foreigner at night. Avoid the small and <strong>narrow streets of Prague</strong> when the sun sets. Unfortunately this is an area with a rising number of petty crimes like theft and muggings. Better to keep your eyes open and walk with a group.</p><p>As for <strong>taxis</strong>, make sure your driver has a well-displayed licence and that the meter is turned on right away. In general, it&#8217;s better to take a taxi back to your <a
title="Cheap hotels in Warsaw" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-hotels/hotels-warsaw_pl/">hotel in Warsaw</a> than to walk at night.</p><p>In Warsaw&#8217;s tourist areas you won&#8217;t have a problem getting around and asking for directions in English however if you plan to explore other areas of Poland and even the capital, pick up a <strong>simple Polish phrase book</strong> before you go with an English/Polish and Polish/English glossary in the back.</p><h2>Getting to Warsaw for cheap</h2><p>The only low cost airline connecting <a
title="Cheap tickets London - Warsaw" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/airline-tickets/cheap-ticket-london-to-warsaw_pl/">London to Warsaw</a> is <strong>Wizz Air</strong> although if you search far enough in advance you&#8217;ll find that regular airlines match, sometimes even beat, Wizz Air&#8217;s prices. Try Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa or Brussels Air.</p><p><strong>Have you ever been to Poland? Are you planning on seeing some of next year&#8217;s Euro 2012 matches in Warsaw?</strong></p><p><span

Like every year in October (from the 14-23rd), Europe&#8217;s finest chocolatiers will showcase the festival with their finest creations&#8230; and samples!<span
id="more-7170"></span></p><h2>Chocoholics Anonymous!</h2><p>This festival is for you! Over time Eurochocolate has become a <strong>major event for chocolatiers</strong>, not just Italian ones either. The chocolate festival takes place every October just when the summer temperatures begin to drop and chocolate consumption is on the rise.</p><p>Apart from chocolatiers, the festival attracts<strong> chocoholics from all over Europe</strong>, including &#8220;professional tasters&#8221; representing each country. We&#8217;re pretty sure anyone who can&#8217;t pass a day without it is considered professional&#8230; While the main festival takes place in Perugia, other chocolate events also take place at the same time in Rimini, Turin, Rome, Pisa, Naples, Florence and other satellite cities.</p><h2>Tasters at the ready</h2><p>If you want to get a <strong>mouthful of this year&#8217;s samplings</strong> then you need to get your paws on the <strong>Chococard</strong>, the official pass for samples at the Eurochocolate Festival. What else can you expect at Eurochocolate? <strong>Art, made of chocolate</strong>. In the city centre, master chocolatiers will built chocolate sculptures which you can see by showing your Chococard as you enter to the exhibition space. The card costs €6 and can be bought online at <a
title="Chocostore" href="http://www.chocostore.it/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chocostore.it</a>.</p><p><a

Just make sure you leave room for exploring Perugia&#8217;s historic city centre as well! <strong>Fly from London to Perugia for £67</strong> (return, taxes included) to get there just in time for National Chocolate Day on October 12th, 2011 with Ryanair.</p><div

Sure, it is but if you&#8217;re creative and can think outside the box a little bit you can enjoy this amazing city with the same travel budget you would any other European capital! Skip the line to ride the Eye and let&#8217;s go, there&#8217;s plenty more &#8220;London&#8221; to see than that.<span
id="more-7150"></span></p><p>Londoners know that there is always something free going on in the core of the city and if not&#8230; there are always the museums which, unlike most cities in the world, are completely free! That&#8217;s right, all of the government sponsored museums are free. With so many free activities to do in London, there&#8217;s no excuse for putting it off, recession or not. If anything, it&#8217;ll be your <a
title="Cheap hotels in London" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-hotels/hotels-london_gb/">hotels in London</a> that set back your travel budget, so make sure you compare prices before reserving!</p><h2>Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</h2><p><a

It survived the Blitz, although you can see the damage to the outer wall on the Exhibition Road side. Inside is a myriad of rooms, filled with golden trinkets, mosaics, statues and artefacts from around the world. Highlights include the modern design rooms, the samurai costumes and the miniature portraits. The V&amp;A also puts on some very well-curated exhibitions so always check out what&#8217;s on display temporarily.</p><h2>Borough Market</h2><p><a

The market it open Thursdays and Saturdays, don&#8217;t both going on any other days because you&#8217;ll just be disappointed. Grab a light breakfast and then bring your canvas shopping bags with you for a feast. There are mostly merchants selling hand-crafted foods, gourmet cheeses, cured meats, olives, cakes and breads&#8230; You can sample your way through lunch here! One of London&#8217;s best coffee joints is here too, called Monmouth on Park Street. For £2.30 you can get the best latte you&#8217;ve ever had in your life&#8230; honest!</p><h2>Portobello Road Market</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/29/7-free-things-to-do-in-london-7150/attachment/sony-dsc-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-7156"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7156" title="Portobello Road" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Portobello-Road.jpg" alt="Portobello Road" width="502" height="335" /></a></p><p>Each and every year Europe&#8217;s largest street festival takes place here, near Notting Hill Gate. The Notting Hill Festival is an absolute riot for two days! For the rest of the year Portobello Road is an eclectic shopping street with everything from over-priced cappuccinos, vintage thrift stores to reggae record shops. The market street is characterized by the differently coloured painted houses. The market is the best during the weekend when the most stalls are open. If you&#8217;re shopping for unusual souvenirs then come on Sunday when the flea market is open on Portobello Green.</p><h2>Serpentine Gallery &amp; Hyde Park</h2><p>You can certainly make a day out of visiting the famous Hyde Park but save some of your afternoon for visiting the lovely Kensington Gardens and more specifically the Serpentine Gallery. It has a stunning permanent collection with big shots like Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst and always impressive temporary exhibitions from influential artists from around the world. In summer there is a special pavilion set up where frequent films are screened as well as talks hosted with exhibiting artists.</p><p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by the ever-inviting lawn chairs set up in the park. You have to pay £1.50/hour to use them. Instead bring your own blanket to sit on in case the grass is damp.</p><h2>British Museum</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/29/7-free-things-to-do-in-london-7150/attachment/img_0090/" rel="attachment wp-att-7152"><img
title="British Museum" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0090.jpg" alt="British Museum" width="392" height="294" /></a></p><p>The sheer size of the British Museum is enough to swallow anyone up. There are millions of artefacts here and no chance to see all of them in one visit, or ten for that matter. Once you arrive, head straight for the main hall that opens up to the sky. Grab a complimentary map (although they suggest a £1 donation) and plan your route. If you don&#8217;t have any special interests in the collection, just choose one or two wings or pick a sampling of &#8220;high-profile&#8221; items, like the Rosetta Stone or the huge sphinx statues from Egypt. The Greek statues are also pretty fantastic.</p><h2>Wellcome Collection</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/29/7-free-things-to-do-in-london-7150/attachment/wellcome-collection/" rel="attachment wp-att-7155"><img
title="Wellcome Collection" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wellcome-Collection.jpg" alt="Wellcome Collection" width="491" height="328" /></a></p><p>Somehow this last museum gets left out of the typical &#8220;free things to do in London&#8221; lists and it&#8217;s a wonder why? One of the most&#8230; curious&#8230; museum collections in the city by far! It&#8217;s located in an unassuming building near Euston Station so keep your eyes open for the signs. Go straight up to the Medicine Man Collection on the first floor to get an up-close look at 500+ of the strangest objects you&#8217;ll see in one room in your life: Florence Nightingale&#8217;s moccasins, Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s toothbrush, lock of Henry V&#8217;s hair, ancient Japanese sex objects, medieval artificial limbs&#8230;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;A free destination for the incurably curious.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>Museum of London</h2><p>Not far from St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, the Museum of London is one of the most interesting free museums in the city. The top floor is dedicated to the pre-historic, Roman and Medieval London up until the Great Fire in 1666. The bottom floor (arguably the more interesting of the two) takes you from Victorian London all the way to present day. Don&#8217;t miss the rad outfits from the 1960s and rock-and-roll memorabilia!</p><p><strong>What are you favourite free spots in London?

That&#8217;s the topic up for debate. Travellers were asked <em>why</em> they like to travel in a group, or at least why they would be motivated to do it. Some do it out of sheer practicality. Certain areas of the world are totally off-limits if you&#8217;re not with a tourist group and guide: Tibet, for example. If you&#8217;re short on time and money, group travel is often a great alternative to see a lot in a short period of time. The plus side, they rarely put you on <a

True colours come out on the road&#8230;</p><p>@solangefrancois: I prefer travelling alone or with one partner/friend but group travel is attractive for extra security and cost savings.</p><p>@toddwassel: To meet new people. Sometime traveling alone gets&#8230;lonely.</p><p>@bpmojo: Good with a optimized group : a photographer, a bargainer, a crazy dude (always good), a historical genius, a adventurer.</p><p>@aladdintravel: Traveling in a group adds multiple eyes, ears, opinions&#8230; and thoughts&#8230; Not to mention new friends!</p><p>@our_oyster: For the memories. I like to be able to say &#8216;remember when&#8217; to someone. :)</p><p>@redhunttravel: Group travel got me to places like Antarctica and the Galapagos&#8230;where solo travel isn&#8217;t easy.</p><p>@foodieintl: More people = more plates at the dinner table!

title="Euro 2012: Eastern Europe steps up to centre field" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/08/23/euro-2012-eastern-europe-steps-up-to-centre-field-6847/">Eastern Europe takes the spotlight</a>! Here is your opportunity to discover the &#8220;other Europe.&#8221; Eight cities in total will host matches during the championship, here is our short guide to the first: Kiev.</p><h2>What to see in Kiev</h2><p><strong>Kreschatyk Street:</strong> Think of it like the Oxford Street or the Champs-Elysées of Ukraine! This wide avenue, skirted with tall buildings can easily make you feel the size of an ant. This is where all the luxury boutiques are hiding. Stroll along like the dandy that you are to Independence Square, metro Mayden Nezalezhnosti. On weekends the avenue is a crowded meeting place for busking musicians and street performers of every kind. Meet with locals walking with a bottle of Ukrainian beer, Obolon, in hand.</p><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/27/euro-2012-kiev-the-ukrainian-capital-18-7127/attachment/independence-square/" rel="attachment wp-att-7128"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7128" title="Independence Square" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Independence-Square.jpg" alt="Independence Square" width="450" height="338" /></a></p><p><strong>St. Sophia&#8217;s Cathedral:</strong> The Sobor Sviatoi Sofiya is the most famous monument in Ukraine. It was built in the 11th century and is topped with 13 sparkling, golden domes.</p><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/27/euro-2012-kiev-the-ukrainian-capital-18-7127/attachment/st-sophie-cathedral/" rel="attachment wp-att-7129"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7129" title="St Sophia's Cathedral" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/St-Sophie-Cathedral.jpg" alt="St Sophia's Cathedral" width="450" height="310" /></a></p><p><strong>Priogovo Museum:</strong> This gigantic museum sits on a huge piece of property, 150 hectares, and is one of the biggest outdoor museums in the world. It houses 300+ pieces of traditional Ukrainian art and is a must for anyone with an inkling to get a closer look at this exciting culture.</p><p><strong>Hidropark:</strong> This type of leisure park is an ideal place to waste a day, well not waste but you can spend an entire day here on the island in the Dnieper. Why not spend a night here too enjoying the restaurants and nightclubs? It&#8217;s also a nice place to walk and relax on the sandy beaches. The locals promise a good time on the weekends when they all come to barbecue and spend time with their friends and families. A must: join in on a waltz at the dance hall located in the middle of the park.</p><p><strong>Motherland Statue (Rodina Mat):</strong> This titanium statue stand 102m tall. You can take an elevator to the top of his shield for the best view of Kiev possible. At 300 feet above the ground you can see Dnieper clearly and Kiev&#8217;s skyline. Don&#8217;t forget to visit the Museum to the Great Patriotic War (WWII) which greatly glorifies the Soviet forces.</p><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/27/euro-2012-kiev-the-ukrainian-capital-18-7127/attachment/central-statue/" rel="attachment wp-att-7130"><img

Tuck yourself into a big bowl of traditional borsch with sorrel and nettles and garlic. Save money by eating at a local canteen in the city centre that cater to the working class. They are usually crowded but cheap and the food is usually quite good.</p><ul><li>A popular chain of these cantenes is called <strong>Puzata Hata</strong>, find one along Krchtchatik Avenue and Tara Shevchenko.</li></ul><p>In spring and summer there&#8217;s nothing better than barbecued skewers of pork or chicken, called shashlik. A beer or a shot (or more) of vodka is the way that the real &#8220;Kievians&#8221; do it. Somewhat surprisingly, sushi is a big hit in Ukraine and you won&#8217;t find it difficult to track down a good sushi joint in the city centre.</p><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/27/euro-2012-kiev-the-ukrainian-capital-18-7127/attachment/mushroom-salad/" rel="attachment wp-att-7131"><img

When choosing a place you&#8217;ll find yourself choosing between one chic lounge bar and another equally chic lounge bar. The nights are long and the locals are well-conditioned to dance and drink until dawn. Nightclubs are easily found since they&#8217;re so numerous.</p><ul><li><strong>Sorry Babuska:</strong> This seems to be a good choice for those who want to get the real party experience in Kiev. With several floors, each with its own ambiance and music, there is plenty for everyone in your entourage.</li></ul><p><strong>Where to avoid:</strong> The River Palace. Unless of course you are determined to find someone to take home at the end of the night. But to put it bluntly, if you are not interested in paid sex than stay clear away from this place. It attracts tourists because of its location on the river but women should steer clear and watch out for unexpected (and unpleasant) surprises!</p><p>Do not take offence if you are thoroughly searched before going into a nightclub, they&#8217;re mostly looking for guns and knives. Entry to nightclubs are considered to be relatively expensive for Ukrainian standards.</p><h2>Weather and language</h2><p>June is one of the best times to visit Ukraine. Kiev is very nice in the spring as well although you can expect spring to happen about a month later than it does at home. If you&#8217;re not a fan of cold weather, stay away from this place from December to March.</p><p><a

English isn&#8217;t always a help in Ukraine, even in Kiev. Take a phrasebook with some key pages dog-eared&#8230; it will be invaluable. You can pick one up at just about any major book store in the foreign language section.</p><h2>How to get to Kiev</h2><p>Unfortunately Ukraine isn&#8217;t exactly the best country for <a
title="Cheap flights from London" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-flight-from-london.html">low cost flights from London</a> or even elsewhere in the UK. From London, Wizz Air and Air Baltic will get you to Kiev the cheapest although British Airways, Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines also fly the route.</p><ul><li>A flight from London to Kiev for next June when the  Euro 2012 football championship is going on will set you back £119 (return, taxes included) with Wizz Air, departing from London Luton Airport for travel June 14-24th, 2012. Not bad!</li></ul><div

The heat, the smiles, the traffic&#8230; Bangkok and beyond to Thailand&#8217;s 1430 islands, this country has a charm that will leave you wishing to stay forever.<span
id="more-7072"></span></p><p>Bordered by Burma, Laos and Cambodia, Thailand is an enchanting mix of tropics, secluded beaches, busy cities and Buddhist temples. Most traveller&#8217;s first experiences in Thailand will be in the capital capital when they arrive off <a
title="Cheap flights to Bangkok" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-flights/flight-bangkok_th/">flights to Bangkok</a> but there is a whole country to discover, one sense at a time!</p><h2>Sight</h2><p><a

Thai monks can be seen just about everywhere in Bangkok and especially in cities with big monasteries. Spot the young ones playing in the streets, following their curious noses to the marketplaces and saying their prayers at the Buddhist temples.</p><h2>Taste</h2><p><a

It&#8217;s in everything cooked here in Thailand. If you&#8217;re not used to hot food then watch out! The philosophy behind Thai food is all about balancing the flavours: sour, sweet, bitter and salty. Their dishes are know for being enthusiastically flavoured with herbs and spices like lemon grass, mint, garlic, ginger and a lot of chilli.</p><h2>Smell</h2><p><a

Some say it reduces stress and helps to relax during meditation, others say it purifies the environment, making it a suitable place to meditate and make offerings to the Buddhas. Incense is also used as part of Thai marriage ceremonies.</p><h2>Hearing</h2><p><object

The chit-chatting of Thai ladies, gossiping about their relations, the men about politics. Sellers yell out their best deals, louder than the merchant next to them to be hear over the crowds. Every once in a while even a train may pass through the market, trading the buzz of conversations for the sound of grinding steel.</p><h2>Feel</h2><p><a

It&#8217;s produced mainly in the north east in Khorat Pleateau where the precious silkworms feed on mulberry leaves. Believed to be the finest in the world, you can buy it in any colour of the rainbow. Even more precious is Thai silk that has been hand-woven.</p><p>Thailand may be located in the far east but if you keep you eyes open for flight deals, you can make a trip to Bangkok just as affordable as one to anywhere else. Fly with Royal Jordan from London to Bangkok for £403 (return, tax included) in November.</p><div

More than just devices to get you from the bottom to the top and back down again, they&#8217;re top tourist attractions! Plus, they&#8217;ve got the best views in the house!<span
id="more-7051"></span></p><h2>Genting Skyway &#8211; Malaysia</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/23/top-5-cable-car-rides-around-the-world-7051/attachment/genting-skyway/" rel="attachment wp-att-7052"><img

It whisks you away in the Malaysian mountains, taking you up one of the longest cableways in Asia. What is waiting for you at the top? Genting Highlands Resort, a luxurious spot 6,650 feet above sea level! It&#8217;s not just any resort though, it&#8217;s complete with theme parks, casinos, hotels and excellent shopping, more like a holiday destination all on its own.</p><h2>Table Mountain &#8211; South Africa</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/23/top-5-cable-car-rides-around-the-world-7051/attachment/view-from-the-table-mountain-cable-car/" rel="attachment wp-att-7054"><img

The floor of the cars are able to rotate the full 360° so you can get the best views on the rather short trip up. The summit of the mountain sits at about 3,500 feet. From there you can take several hiking paths or enjoy the view with a picnic lunch. In the afternoon the view can get quite smoggy, so for the best views head up in the early morning or early evening.</p><h2>Picos de Europa National Park &#8211; Spain</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-destinations/2011/09/23/top-5-cable-car-rides-around-the-world-7051/attachment/spain-teleferico/" rel="attachment wp-att-7058"><img

Instead of heading to the islands, grab <a
title="Cheap flights to Oviedo" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-flights/flight-oviedo_es/">flights to Oviedo</a> and explore Spain&#8217;s northern mountains. This cable car takes you up 6,000+ feet. From the top you can enjoy the best view of this huge national park. Warning: the views of these spectacular mountains are known to inspire multiple return trips to northern Spain.</p><h2>Zacatecas &#8211; Mexico</h2><p><a

The cable car, called a <em>teleférico </em>in Spanish, takes you above the colonial streets of Zacatecas. The narrow streets look even smaller from above, the plazas less crowded and the roofs&#8230; it&#8217;s all a beautiful rose-coloured ceramic mosaic as you go up towards Cerro de la Bufa. The trip only take a few minutes so make sure you enjoy every second of it while you&#8217;re on <a

There are two stops on this ride. The first part of the journey takes you up to Urca Hill, with great views over Guanabara Bay. The next leg goes up to Sugarloaf Mountain which reaches a height of 1,300 feet. In the distance on a clear day you&#8217;ll be able to spot Rio&#8217;s most famous monument, <em>Christ the Redeemer</em> on top of Corcovado Mountain. Best time to go up is at sunset.</p><p><strong>Have you ever gone up in a cable car? Where was it?</strong></p><h5><span

It can be a breeze&#8230; it can also be a nightmare. Without a doubt applying for visas and passing through immigration makes for good travel stories.<span

/> Even though you have nothing to hide, your palms still sweat when you approach the counter at any immigration border. Do you have any goods to declare? Have you &#8220;forgotten&#8221; about the Hungarian sausages you snuck into your backpack a few minutes before departing for the airport? Sometimes it&#8217;s as easy as, &#8220;How long are you planning to stay?&#8221; and a stamp in the passport. Other times, you may be asked a whole range of other questions. Here are, without a doubt, the funniest from this week&#8217;s #TTOT session!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q3 via @himalfootsteps: What&#8217;s the funniest question you ever got applying for a visa or at immigration?</strong></p></blockquote><p>@roniweiss: When I was a kid, the question at the Canadian border: &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; &#8216;Hockey.&#8221; &#8220;OK, you can go.&#8221;</p><p>@chuckgspins: I gave a funny answer: &#8220;Anything to declare?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I declare I&#8217;m tired &amp; ready for bed!&#8221; The guy laughed.</p><p>@EverywhereTrip: In the Solomon Islands, the immigration guy asked how long I was staying in a very stern way, and then say &#8220;Hey, stay longer!&#8221;</p><p>@MalloryOnTravel: Would you like to donate one of those bottles of whiskey that you aren&#8217;t going to drink yourself to the guards?</p><p>@bpmojo: US back in the game!

Open borders make travelling a breeze! Unfortunately it’s not that easy for travellers from other parts of the world, or even for Britons and Europeans to travel to other countries. Some countries are totally off-limits. Similarly, some country’s citizens are also very limited to where they can travel. It’s not always as easy as booking a <a
title="Cheap flights on liligo.com" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-flights/">cheap flight</a> and taking off. Is it fair?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Q5 via @crashpadder: Do you think it&#8217;s fair that the world is not open to travel by everyone?</strong></p></blockquote><p>@packurpassport: I think in an ideal world this would be amazing. Unfortunately we live in a world where some can&#8217;t be trusted/don&#8217;t have respect.</p><p>@SparkReviews: I&#8217;m a big proponent of not going where I&#8217;m not wanted. It would be nice to be wanted everywhere, though.</p><p>@hjortur: Because of the unequal life standards around the world, I guess it&#8217;s a necessary bad.</p><p>@luxtrvlwrks: Travel opens minds about the world in ways that no other experience can. I wish entire process was easier for all.</p><p>@Roopunzel: I think its crazy that the majority of people in this world still CHOOSE not to get a passport!</p><p>@25travels: Visas are okay if issuing it are based on a fair review rather than a preconceived stereotypes.</p><p>@MagellanPR: A passport is a privilege given to people who have good intentions &#8211; it should be taken away from any nasties, so yes.</p><p>@AnthonyOFlynn: 100%- so many places you&#8217;d love to visit, but can&#8217;t!!</p><p>@GQtrippin: A borderless world would mean less headaches not having to deal with so many Visas on a RTW trip.</p><p>@tripku: It would be awesome to have open borders as long as we could continue collecting stamps, just for the heck of it. :-)</p><p><strong>How about you? Any funny immigration stories to share? Do you think the world should be visa-free with open borders?</strong></p><p><a

width="300" height="199" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Why-NOT-to-go-to-Oktoberfest-300x199.jpg" class="attachment-medium wp-post-image" alt="Why NOT to go to Oktoberfest in Munich" title="Why NOT to go to Oktoberfest in Munich" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s right, we said it. If you&#8217;ve ever been to Oktoberfest you may be able to sympathize. For those who haven&#8217;t and plan to head to Munich to partake in the drinking fest for the &#8220;real&#8221; Oktoberfest experience, hold your horses!<span
id="more-7092"></span></p><p>First of all, like you, thousands and thousands of other tourists and foreigners will also be heading to Bavaria to drink until their faces fall off&#8230; likely outnumbering the locals which give it that undeniably Bavarian feel.</p><p><strong>Oktoberfest is all about two things: beer and massive crowds. </strong></p><p>If you like both of these then you might find the festival all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. For the rest of us, it&#8217;s not. At this point you&#8217;ve missed the<strong> opening weekend</strong> which is, to say the least, the worst part of it all. That is when the crowds are at their peak. If you&#8217;ve been tossing up whether to book <a
title="Cheap flights to Munich" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/cheap-flights/flight-munich_de/">last-minute flights to Munich</a> to catch the tail-end of Oktoberfest or not here are three reasons <strong>why you should <em>not</em> go</strong>.</p><h2>No outside drinks allowed</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/21/why-not-to-go-to-oktoberfest-in-munich-7092/attachment/dsc_0366/" rel="attachment wp-att-7098"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7098" title="Cheers!" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cheers.jpg" alt="Cheers!" width="300" height="448" /></a></p><p>If you&#8217;re planning to participate in the drinking going on inside the tents you have to get there early in order to get a seat. The<strong> benches fill up pretty quickly</strong> and once you&#8217;re there, you&#8217;d better stay there. Even though you can buy other beers and drinks on the festival grounds you can&#8217;t take them into the tents with you. There is security at all the doors checking bags. If you&#8217;re not a beer drinker, this can be a problem since there is <strong>only beer on tap</strong> at the bar. Any soft drinks, juices or wines you buy outside the tent must be consumed outside the tent.</p><h2>Toilets&#8230;</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/21/why-not-to-go-to-oktoberfest-in-munich-7092/attachment/wc/" rel="attachment wp-att-7095"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7095" title="WC" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/WC.jpg" alt="WC" width="442" height="332" /></a></p><p>As you can imagine, visitors need to use the W.C. a lot when they&#8217;ve been drinking beer all day. The only <strong>W.C. facilities</strong> are located within the beer tents (remember, no outside drinks allowed). As you might imagine, the <strong>lines can be quite lengthy</strong> (and toilet paper scarce) so if you need to pee<strong> plan ahead</strong>! As you can imagine the people waiting at the front of the line might not be so kind to let someone in front of them, no matter how entertaining their &#8220;pee dance&#8221; is.</p><h2>Mind the crowds</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/21/why-not-to-go-to-oktoberfest-in-munich-7092/attachment/crowds-at-oktoberfest/" rel="attachment wp-att-7093"><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7093" title="Crowds at Oktoberfest" src="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crowds-at-Oktoberfest.jpg" alt="Crowds at Oktoberfest" width="472" height="313" /></a></p><p>If you had the idea that you would arrive at Oktoberfest, find your way to the tent and grab a seat, you&#8217;re highly mistaken! You need at<strong> arrive early in the morning</strong> in order to get a seat in any of the beer tents, or else you need to <strong>reserve your place</strong> in advance. If you arrive at a tent and by some extraordinary struck of luck you find a free place, <strong>GRAB IT!</strong> Don&#8217;t leave it for the rest of the day because you&#8217;ll never get it back. If you lose sight of your friends, don&#8217;t panic but make sure you&#8217;ve organized a meeting place in case you get separated. It&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;re going to hear their phone ringing in this commotion.</p><h2>Fame &amp; Popularity</h2><p><a
href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-blog/travel-tips/2011/09/21/why-not-to-go-to-oktoberfest-in-munich-7092/attachment/locals/" rel="attachment wp-att-7094"><img

Truth be told, many of the local residents take their holidays during the festival time and come back once it has all been cleaned up. Most of the people you will meet there will be <strong>foreigners</strong> or from other parts of Germany, which is great if you&#8217;d like to connect with other travellers! But, if you were hoping for a more<strong> authentic Oktoberfest experience</strong>, with the locals, then steer clear of Munich and check out some of the smaller beer festivals happening in other parts of Bavaria and Germany.</p><p><strong>This year&#8217;s Oktoberfest runs until October 3rd, 2011.</strong></p><p><strong>Have you ever been to Oktoberfest in Munich before? What was your experience like?</strong></p><h5><span

Tight turns, ups and downs&#8230; the Alps is the perfect place to let yourself go!<span
id="more-7039"></span></p><p>More than <a
title="Cheap car hires on liligo.com" href="http://www.liligo.co.uk/car-rental/">rental cars</a>, travelling by motorcycle gives you access to even more places off the beaten path. If you&#8217;ve ever seen <em>The Motorcycle Diaries</em> you also know that there&#8217;s just something about motorcycle journeys that also lead you to self-discovery. You can go at your own speed and take unplanned detours. In Europe one of the best places to ride is through the Alps.</p><h2>Does this inspire you?</h2><p><iframe
src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/28779945" width="550" height="309" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p><h2>How to do it</h2><h3>Plan your route</h3><p>The Alps cover a huge area and are part of <strong>six countries</strong>: Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Slovenia. It&#8217;s impossible to cover it all in one trip. If it&#8217;s your first time, a good introductory route will take you from <strong>Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean</strong> in France. This route is called <em><strong>La Route des Grandes Alps</strong></em>.</p> <iframe

Like renting a car, you&#8217;ll need your passport, credit card and possibly an <strong>international driver&#8217;s license </strong>as well as proof that you have a valid motorcycle license from your home country.</p><p>Before leaving with the bike, <strong>check it over thoroughly </strong>for any scratches and defects, get them down in writing so that you&#8217;re not charged for them later!</p><p><a

If you do happen to break down, make sure you know what your rental companies protocol is. If it&#8217;s your own bike, it&#8217;s useful to<strong> research mechanics</strong> located along your route.</p><h3>Miles&#8230; and more miles</h3><p><strong>How many miles should you cover in a day?</strong> It all really depends on your route and where you&#8217;d like to stop along the way. It&#8217;s recommended to take <strong>8 days </strong>for La Route des Grandes Alps, covering 80-100km in a day. This leaves plenty of time to enjoy yourself as well, stopping at castles and appreciating the views.</p><h3>What to pack</h3><p>If you&#8217;re a<strong> seasoned biker</strong> then you probably know what kind of things to pack for a longer trip. Still, it helps to have a list, there&#8217;s a good <a
