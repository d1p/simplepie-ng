			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Majority Leader <strong>Eric Cantor </strong>said Monday that he expects the House will approve legislation Tuesday that funds the federal government through mid-November.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully we can avoid any kind of shutdown talk and get it done,” the Virginia Republican said at a news conference.</p>
<p>If approved, lawmakers will defer a fight over fiscal 2012 government funding until Nov. 18, by which time Republican leaders hope to have reached a deal with Democrats that covers the entire fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted to approve the measure.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats still disagree on the underlying funding levels of individual programs and departments. In addition, some House Republicans would like to reduce the agreed-upon spending ceiling and shave more funding from the federal budget.</p>
<p>At a weekly press conference, Mr. Cantor said he hoped there wouldn&#8217;t be additional temporary short-term funding measures after Nov. 18.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Carolina’s first-in-the-South presidential primary will be held Jan. 21, the state GOP announced Monday, the latest indication that the 2012 nominating contest could begin around the first days of the new year.</p>
<p>It makes the Palmetto State the first of the four early voting states to announce a new balloting date after Florida declared last week that it would hold its presidential primary Jan. 31.  South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada had all been scheduled to vote first next year, beginning in February or later. But on Friday, Florida announced it would move its primary voting up, an effort to gain more influence in deciding the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>Florida&#8217;s decision likely means 2012 voting could begin in about three months. (On Friday, New Hampshire officials said it was possible the Granite State would hold its 2012 primary in late 2011; under Iowa law, the Iowa caucuses must occur eight days before any other presidential nominating contest.)</p>
<p>Former Sen. <strong>Rick Santorum</strong> (R., Pa.), whose  long-shot bid relies on support from social conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina, has complained that the earlier contests benefit the field’s front-runners, <strong>Rick Perry</strong> and <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>. If voting begins earlier, candidates such as Mr. Santorum have less time to make inroads with voters and raise money, something they have little of compared with Messrs. Perry and Romney.</p>
<p>“Last Friday, a nine-person committee brought chaos to the 2012 calendar,” South Carolina GOP Chairman <strong>Chad Connelly</strong> said in a written statement. “Today, South Carolina is making things right.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[President Barack Obama’s campaign said the leading GOP presidential candidates are too outside the American mainstream to be elected. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facing grim economic news and weak poll numbers, President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>’s campaign said Monday morning that the leading GOP presidential candidates are too outside the American mainstream to be elected.</p>
<p>“From economics to immigration, Governor Perry, Governor Romney and the Republican field have embraced policies that the American people oppose,” campaign spokesman <strong>Ben LaBolt</strong> writes in<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/OFAMemo.pdf"> a strategy memo</a> sent to reporters Monday morning. “The campaign to win the Republican nomination has become a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the Tea Party.”</p>
<p>The argument is not a new one for Team Obama, but the 850-word memo is perhaps the broadest attack on the GOP’s 2012 fray from the president’s re-election campaign. It also is another example of the type of campaign the president will have to run if Americans do not develop more confidence in the economy before next November. As Republicans try to outflank each other to woo the GOP’s primary voters – traditionally more conservative than the rest of the country – the campaign hopes they will take positions that alienate independents in a general election.</p>
<p>For instance, the memo seems to target former Massachusetts Gov.  <strong>Mitt </strong><strong>Romney</strong> when it criticizes Republicans for being “increasingly out of step on immigration.” Mr. Romney has repeatedly attacked Texas Gov. <strong>Rick </strong><strong>Perry</strong> for signing a law that allows some illegal immigrants to attend state universities at in-state tuition rates, something many conservatives oppose.</p>
<p>“The leading Republican candidates oppose a path to citizenship for immigrants,” Mr. LaBolt writes. “And a majority of Americans have consistently supported the DREAM Act which the Republican candidates universally oppose at the federal level.”</p>
<p>The DREAM Act, a bill that has failed repeatedly in Congress, would provide a path to citizenship for some young illegal immigrants. Mr. Perry’s conservative critics have compared his tuition law to a state-level version of the legislation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Pervaiz Shallwani</em></p>
<p>With fervor growing about &#8220;will he or won&#8217;t he,&#8221; a larger than normal local and national press corps watched eagerly as Gov. Chris Christie presided over an annual awards ceremony for National Guard at a training center on the New Jersey shore.</p>
<p>In anticipation, guard members assigned to media duty flagged reporters as they entered the base, escorted them to a makeshift media parking lot and corralled them in a roped-off-area 50-feet from where the governor watched and addressed troops. Guards could be overheard telling each other to make sure the press are blocked from pursuing the governor when he leaves.</p>
<p>The closest any talk of Christie pursuing the Republican nomination for president came as he left the stage after the one-hour ceremony.</p>
<p>Reporters shouted out questions: &#8220;Any decisions about running for president?&#8221; &#8220;Anything?&#8221; &#8220;Are you running&#8221; &#8220;Are you gonna run?&#8221; &#8220;Do you need a hearing aid?&#8221; Mr. Christie did not acknowledge them, and kept moving down the stairs past a line of guardsmen and out of town.</p>
<p>The hour-long ceremony took place  at the National Guard Training Center in Sea Girt on the New Jersey shore.</p>
<p>Mr. Christie, wearing a dark suit, baby-blue shirt and red tie, shook hands with a line of about three dozen guardsmen who worked during Hurricane Irene. He  rode around in a Humvee inspecting troops, and also presented medals, merits and ribbons to 14 troops. At one point, the guard gave him a 19-shot &#8220;gun salute.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a five-minute address, Mr. Christie commended the troops for their service overseas and the  commitment of their families. He offered special praise for the state national guard effort last month during Hurricane Irene. &#8220;We would not have come through that crisis nearly as well without you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony, Mr. Christie met with military veterans over breakfast, speaking about veterans issues, said one participant, retired guardsman Harold Liberatore, 65 years old, of Jefferson, N.J.</p>
<p>But there was no talk of entering the presidential race.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think today is the place for it,&#8221; Mr. Liberatore said, adding that he would support him if he decided to run. &#8220;I like him. He tells you the like it is. He is the type of guy you want to stop in with for a beer.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> chastised Republicans for keeping quiet when members of a GOP presidential debate audience booed a gay soldier, and one of the Republican candidates, <strong>Herman Cain</strong>, conceded Sunday it would have been &#8220;appropriate&#8221; to have responded to the crowd.</p>
<p>Reverberations from the Sept. 22 Republican debate in Orlando, Fla. continued throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama, addressing the nation&#8217;s largest gay lobby group at a dinner Saturday, admonished the Republican slate for letting the behavior by members of the debate audience go unanswered.</p>
<p>Being commander-in-chief means defending those in uniform, &#8220;even when it’s not politically convenient,&#8221; Mr. Obama said in the speech in Washington before the Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe in standing silent when that happens,&#8221; the president said.</p>
<p>Mr. Cain, pressed on the issue during an appearance Sunday on the ABC program &#8220;This Week,&#8221; at first said that, in the heat of the debate, it was difficult to determine why the audience is booing. He added: &#8220;I was not in control. I was not the moderator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, he acknowledged that, &#8220;in retrospect,&#8221; it would have been right to say something.</p>
<p>During the debate, broadcast on Fox News, members of the crowd booed, some loudly, after <strong>Stephen Hill</strong>, a U.S. soldier in Iraq, asked via video conference about the repeal of the 1993 &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; law. Later, they cheered when candidate Rick Santorum said he opposed lifting the ban.</p>
<p>Although not a front-runner in the Republican nomination battle, Mr. Cain has seen a surge of support in recent polls</p>
<p>Mr. Obama, while extolling the repeal of the repeal the military&#8217;s ban on openly gay soldiers during his Saturday speech, stopped short of endorsing same-sex marriages. The president has said that his views on the matter are still &#8220;evolving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has been looking for ways to rally his liberal base of support amid polls showing that Americans are dissatisfied with his stewardship of the economy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who is hosting a fund-raiser for President Barack Obama in New York Friday night, said he is pleased with Mr. Obama’s stewardship of the economy but understands why some on Wall Street have deserted him.</p>
<p>Mr. Buffett attributed the fallout to populist rhetoric from the president, some early in his term. As a result, Wall Street donors felt demonized, he said.</p>
<p>“I think some &#8212; there was some rhetoric that contributed to that,” he said in an interview Friday with the “Charlie Rose” show on PBS. “I think the president felt, ‘My God, look at all the things we did for business, and they’re unappreciative, and you know, I’m all that stands between them and pitchforks,’ and all that kind of stuff.”</p>
<p>“So, Wall Street doesn’t &#8212; certainly doesn’t feel loved. And they might like to feel loved,” he added.</p>
<p>The campaign event in New York was being held at the Four Seasons. The New York Post reported that tickets ranged from $10,000 to $35,800, the maximum contribution allowed by law. The evening was to include a conversation with Mr. Buffett and Austan Goolsbee, who recently left the White House, where he had served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, Mr. Buffett caused a dust-up in Washington when he said that he was not familiar enough with all of Mr. Obama’s jobs plan to have an opinion. Some Republicans said that amounted to a break between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Obama, who named a plank of his plan after the Berkshire Hathaway chairman. Mr. Buffett made clear that he endorsed the plank of the Obama plan named after him, which would affect people earning more than $1 million a year. He declined to offer an opinion on other tax increases Mr. Obama is promoting, many of which would affect families earning $250,000 per year or more.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Time is running out for late entrants to the GOP presidential race to file all the paperwork necessary to get on primary ballots around the country.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sarah,  Chris,  Rudy (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/us-usa-campaign-huckabee-idUSTRE78T48Y20110930">and Huck?</a>),  take note:  Only four weeks are left to get on the first-in-the-nation primary ballot.</p>
<p>After Florida announced Friday that it will hold its presidential primary on Jan. 31, New Hampshire, which traditionally holds the country’s first presidential primary, declared that it will move its own balloting up – possibly to late 2011 – in order to remain in front of Florida. It also announced that candidates have to file <a href="http://www.sos.nh.gov/Filing%20Period%20announcement.pdf">by Oct. 28 to get on the ballot</a>. If candidates miss the deadline, even if their names are <strong>Sarah Palin</strong>, <strong>Chris Christie</strong>, <strong>Rudy Giuliani </strong>or <strong>Mike Huckabee</strong>, they won’t be listed on the GOP primary ballots.</p>
<p>The early date also appears to make New Hampshire the first filing deadline of the 2012 election season.</p>
<p>Florida’s state parties must submit their list of candidates by Oct. 31. South Carolina, traditionally the country’s first Southern primary is next. Candidates have until 5 p.m. Nov. 1 to pay a $35,000 fee to the South Carolina GOP and, in turn, get on the ballot.</p>
<p>The Iowa caucuses, the country’s first nominating contest, don’t have a filing deadline.</p>
<p>Despite some Republican discontent with the current primary field, the dates show that there isn’t much time to change it. Furthermore, the number of hoops candidates must jump through to get on some states’ ballots means it is likely already too late to enter the 2012 fray, said <strong>Matthew</strong><strong> Sanderson</strong>, who helped with balloting issues for Sen. <strong>John McCain</strong>’s 2008 presidential campaign. In Virginia, for instance, candidates have until Dec. 22 to submit the signatures of 10,000 qualified voters, including 400 from each congressional district. The Virginia State Board of Elections recommends that candidates collect 15,000 to 20,000 signatures and 700 from each district “because many people who are not registered to vote will sign a petition.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanderson said the drop-dead date is fast approaching. A late entry, he said, is not “impossible, but it does make success harder to achieve.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ATLANTA – The Georgian who every Republican presidential candidate wants in his camp still hasn’t  decided who he’s going to back. But although <strong>Bernie Marcus</strong> believes in abortion and gun control, he knows who he won’t support: <strong>Barack Obama</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>In an interview at the Georgia Public Policy Foundation meeting here, the billionaire philanthropist and Home Depot co-founder lambasted the “amateurs in the White House” as “amateurs surrounded by amateurs.”</p>
<p>But he would not pick sides in the fight for the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>“Listen, <strong>Herman Cain</strong> is a pistol. I’ve known him for years. He’s got a real quality. <strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> is without a question the smartest guy in the world. Whether he can be elected is another issue,” he said, pitching his fellow Georgians. “I’ve spent a lot of time with <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>. I think he’s very bright. I think he’s very articulate. I think he’s a businessman. He understands how to deal with things. <strong>[Jon] Huntsman</strong> may in fact slip in. I mean it’s a possibility. And he’s a brilliant guy with a great record. So all of them are good candidates.”</p>
<p>Having just seen Texas Gov. <strong>Rick Perry</strong> speak Friday morning, Mr. Marcus declared him “a wonderful candidate for the Republican Party.”</p>
<p>Mr. Marcus’s enthusiasm may say a lot about President Obama’s standing with Big Business and Big Money. Mr. Marcus said of abortion, “I think it’s right.” He added, “I think I’d like to have some sort of controls on guns.” He also supports stem-cell research.</p>
<p>Yet he’s willing to embrace candidates with diametrically opposite social views if they agree with him on economics. He said the next president needs to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits while holding the line on defense spending.</p>
<p>“I’m not an arch [conservative] kind of guy, but people like myself want to see someone in Washington who understands that if the country is not strong economically, we can’t be strong period,” he said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By running for president, former Pennsylvania Sen. <strong>Rick Santorum</strong> forfeited what appears to be his single-biggest source of income last year: the $293,153 he drew as a commentator on Fox News.</p>
<p>The cable network suspended Mr. Santorum and former House Speaker<strong> Newt Gingrich </strong>as paid contributors back in March after both took steps to pursue presidential bids.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania senator earned at least $970,000 last year, according to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SantorumDisclosure.pdf">financial disclosure forms</a> released Thursday by the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich did not list his Fox salary in his financial disclosure form; instead, he listed most of his income in the form of payouts from Gingrich Productions, a for-profit corporation. Fox News, like the Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Santorum claims assets of at least $885,000, including five rental properties in State  College, Pa., the home of his alma mater, Penn State University. Most of the rest of his money is tied up in stocks or other investment accounts, including college savings plans for five of his seven children.</p>
<p>This puts him far behind <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>, the former Massachusetts governor whose net worth is in the neighborhood of $200 million, and even Mr. Gingrich, who was worth at least $7 million when the race began.</p>
<p>He owes the rest of last year’s income to his stint as a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer; his work for Salem Radio; his tenure as a senior fellow at a Washington-based think tank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center; and consulting work for Consul Energy and a pair of government affairs firms based in the nation’s capital.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CONCORD, N.H.&#8211;In a move that epitomized his philosophy of personal liberty and individual choice, politician-physician <strong>Ron Paul</strong> suspended his presidential campaign Friday for a bike ride&#8211;without a helmet.</p>

</div>
<p>Brilliant leaf-peeping weather broke out at noon in time for the Texas congressman to take a 12-mile ride, a break in a day of campaigning.</p>
<p>Clad in snappy white matching Pearl Izumi bikewear, Mr. Paul said he &#8220;dared&#8221; his GOP rivals to break from the campaign trail for time on the bike paths. Pausing for the cameras before his ride through leafy Concord with campaign staffer <strong>Brian Early</strong>,</p>
<p>Mr. Paul, an avid cyclist at age 76, offered his libertarian view on fitness: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think responsibility for taking care of ourselves, mentally or physically, should be the responsibility of the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as if to underscore his words, he pedaled off without a helmet.</p>
<p>When President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> went helmet-free while cycling with his family on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard in 2009, it raised enough eyebrows that he never did it again. But Mr. Obama, Ron Paul staffers point out, favors government regulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Paul, an obstetrician with 4,000 deliveries on his resume, believes federal laws governing helmets on motorcycles as well as smoking and narcotics use are a waste of time and money. So in the name of liberty, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take a little bad press,&#8221; a staffer said.</p>
