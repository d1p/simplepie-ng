			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know where all this jealousy is coming from. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s happening at all. I just made three rather horrid attacks at him online. Why? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d just be nice if I could stop doing this. If I could just start being normal.</p>
<p>I keep thinking that I&#8217;m going to be this messed up forever. That my constant relationship fuck-ups teamed up with the other bullshit that I just can&#8217;t seem to give up will really be the end of everything. I will end up meeting the most amazing man on the planet, and just be so confused I&#8217;ll end up pushing him away, like I did with the last one. Sure, everyone says I&#8217;ll find someone that will fill all the spaces up, because there are so many empty spaces, but there are also spaces I have already filled that need to be re-filled with the right person. What if it happens again? Like a drug I just can&#8217;t seem to quit.</p>
<p>I ended up hating myself to the point where I broke. Every part of me broke. My mind. My heart. I broke down in an extremely public place and my best friend couldn&#8217;t understand what was happening to me, and ended up just yelling at me and walking off, which made everything hurt even more.</p>
<p>What a contridicting title, huh?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If someone ever makes you cry for three days  straight, what are you supposed to do? Surely you’re not supposed to see  them, so they can do it again. But what if you can’t do it. You can’t  not see them. And they do it again, but worse. And then they find a way  to be a part of everything you are. And then you can’t see anything,  mostly you can’t see being happy, without them. What a twisted sense of  happiness. Is it even happiness? After everything, they still don’t  understand how their actions hurt you. They don’t realise how completely  betrayed you felt after what they did. Like they had everything you had  to give in their hand, and crushed it, without any known feelings of  regret. And like you weren’t already broken up enough after the first  time, you gave them a second chance, you let them have all of you … or  what was left of you, and they just crushed it all again. How can  someone even think that it’s something that is completely forgettable?  Being torn apart like that. When you’ve been ripped to shreds you can’t  exactly just sew the pieces back together. So, the only way you’re able  to stand up is by knowing that they’re still there. They may have ruined  you, but they haven’t left you. Not yet. You keep trying to find your  feet, trying to find something else to hold on to so you don’t need them  to help you stand any more, but you just can’t seem to find what you’re  looking for. You can’t find it in yourself, because being yourself  doesn’t make you happy. You feel worthless without someone else beside  you. You’re not good enough for the world. You’ve completely lost your  independence, and for what? How well do they really know you? Have they  even bothered to find everything out? But now they’re shutting you out,  like you believe you deserve. You don’t really deserve to be happy, but  they do, and they’re going to be happy without you someday, so just move  on. They’re going to be happy without you someday, so stop torturing  yourself thinking that things will always stay the same, and this  twisted sense of happiness will always be enough for you. It’s not  enough for you, and you can do better. You can do so much better. They  have that certain place in your life, so stop letting it be something  else. It’s not what you want. It was never what you wanted. So stop  selling yourself short, and stop giving everything you have away to  someone that doesn’t deserve it and look for that someone that does.  Because that person that does deserve all of you is out there. You  haven’t spent this long making your way through life to go through the  rest of it alone. You’re going to be happy, and even though you’re  crying right now, and you’ve been crying the whole time you’ve been  writing this down, the tears just changed from tears of sadness to tears  of joy because of that single realisation. You will be happy, and you  don’t need to constantly worry and drown yourself in a pool of distrust  and hate. You will be happy, but because this is not enough for you it  is why you always try to make something out of nothing. It’s because  your soul is impatient. You’re looking for that person you can give  everything to, and because you can’t find them you’re trying to make  someone else into that person.</p>
<p>You’ve already given enough of yourself away, so chin up. Just be patient. The time will come.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PJs. Dark room. Sitting cross-legged on my bed.</p>
<p>Today I am planning on applying for my P2s. I&#8217;m kind of excited, because it means no plates and less chance of a fine for going the ~actual~ speed limit on the freeway. I&#8217;m just your average driver, I guess. I sure as hell haven&#8217;t been a goody-two-shoes. I speed. All the time. I don&#8217;t know what it is but there&#8217;s something about going fast, and being a tiny bit reckless, that makes me happy. I am sometimes one of those kids who gives P platers a bad reputation.</p>
<p>But I have no idea where I would have been without my licence and my car this year. I rely on it way too much. Fuel eats away at my savings. It&#8217;s my own fault. I really should stop driving everywhere. It&#8217;s bad for the environment. It&#8217;s just so goddamn convenient. I LOVE the convenience. The public transport system in Adelaide is <strong>SHIT</strong>. Oh man. It&#8217;d probably take me 2 hours to get to work if I didn&#8217;t have a car. Which again, is my fault for having a new job that is so far away.</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;m at the point where I feel like I&#8217;m above using public transport. Like I&#8217;m better than that. And sure, I myself can afford to pay for fuel, but I don&#8217;t think that I really can afford to feel that way when the shit coming from the exhaust pipe of my fuel guzzling Commodore is part of what&#8217;s damaging the Earth&#8217;s climate.</p>
<p>SO, my new years resolution for 2011 will be to try and reduce my own use of my car. I will not drive to the train station. I will take buses and trains whenever I can. I will try to only spend 20 dollars a week on fuel (I used 80 dollars worth this last week), and if I run out of fuel during that week I will not top up until the start of the next week (unless I desperately have to get to work).</p>
<p>Lets see how it goes, yeah?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not really sure why I&#8217;m putting this here. Maybe cause I don&#8217;t update this thing enough for people to actually give a shit about what I&#8217;m writing any more. I&#8217;ve been listening to music all day. It&#8217;s been really refreshing because I haven&#8217;t spent a day like this in a long time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not happy with my weekend. What happened. What should of happened and didn&#8217;t. The disappointment.</p>
<p>On Friday I almost became the one thing I never wanted to become. It&#8217;s quiet a horrible thought. It was a great night. Up until the last &#8230; 30 minutes. I have no idea what made me do the things I did. I guess I felt frustrated. I&#8217;m 18 years old and all I really want is to find a lovely boy, and spend days at a time just falling in love. I cringed at that last word. It sounds so fucking lame. I am not the kind of girl who needs someone else. I&#8217;m social. I have a whole bunch of friends that keep me busy. I love them all. And I wish I saw them all more.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m trying to write.</p>
<p>Maybe I should make a wish. I already made one at 11:11, but it didn&#8217;t come true.</p>
<p>I wish that someone will sweep me off my feet sometime soon.</p>
<p>&#8230;Maybe if I play my cards right.</p>
<p>Oh boy, my mind sure went off into distant places in this post.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m wasting my time trying to talk to him about why  we haven&#8217;t talked in three months. It&#8217;s not like he mattered, he was  just around to replace something that was missing from my life at the  time. And I was around for him for exactly the same reasons.</p>
<p>I  thought we&#8217;d at least stay friends. But he deserves to be given hell for  the way he treated me. I don&#8217;t know why I only realise this now. I  don&#8217;t know why I just ignored the problem for so long. It&#8217;s probably  because I really, really want to not have anything left to say to the  losers that are in my past. And this guy, he really was a loser. A player. Fuck, I feel like such an idiot.</p>
<p>There are so many nice guys out there, so many. And I&#8217;ve been out of the game for so long, I think I just want back in.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brave new world,<br />
Hold me tight,<br />
Catch my breath,<br />
Rain comes down</p>
<p>Dedicated for this,<br />
Pull me back,<br />
Say it to the skies,<br />
Dreams pour through the cracks</p>
<p>Now I see,<br />
I went too far,<br />
Save us from those habits,<br />
That all belonged to me</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t apologise,<br />
Those things I&#8217;ve done,<br />
I was in it alone,<br />
And you never mattered</p>
<p>The crime is done,<br />
I won&#8217;t do time,<br />
Chance means less than fate,<br />
It was easy to let this end.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jesssssbah.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/tumblr_lc401tauak1qzlqzgo1_400.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" title="tumblr_lc401tAUAK1qzlqzgo1_400" src="http://jesssssbah.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/tumblr_lc401tauak1qzlqzgo1_400.jpg?w=400&#038;h=301" alt="" width="400" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a change in myself, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s one that I like.  I used to be so excited when there was a party coming up, or whatever, and now I just keep feeling like it&#8217;s too hard and I&#8217;d rather stay home and watch movies with the one or two people I see every single week. I feel like I&#8217;ve slowly lost interest in every other person I used to hang out with. I know I&#8217;ve completely lost interest in my primary school friends. One I keep meaning to catch up with, but it never happens, and one I do see, but I&#8217;m just not interested in what&#8217;s going on with her. I feel like a massive big hole has been created between all the people I used to hang out with at school and little old me. Because either we all live too far away from each other, they don&#8217;t believe I care about the causes they&#8217;re interested in or what they&#8217;re up to, or one side just can&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<p>I was excited to go out tonight. As much as I was hoping my closest friends would come, I was kind of buzzed to be going out to see people I hadn&#8217;t seen in the longest time. And to be just me, in a crowd. I had made plans to get there weeks ago with my dad, but because of my trouble making brother, he and dad are going down to Pt. Elliot tonight, leaving me stranded. If I had been paid this week it might have been different. I would have been able to afford to drive there myself.</p>
<p>My parents have said before &#8220;This is the last time we&#8217;re giving you money for petrol, next time, if you can&#8217;t afford to go, you&#8217;re just gonna have to deal with it&#8221;. They&#8217;ve said this a couple of times though, so I&#8217;ll probably be pushing it to ask them to slide me a 20 or whatever. I&#8217;m just so sick of things changing. I&#8217;m sick of plans changing. I know I&#8217;ll regret not going, but I&#8217;m just too tired to care at this point. I&#8217;m just scared I&#8217;m going to regret this whole year, how I&#8217;ve spent my spare time.</p>
<p>I have to shut up now. I really do.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>

There are so many things I could be doing, no, I should be doing, but I don&#8217;t because I waste my time checking Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and MSN over and over and over again. Hopefully when I start working more I&#8217;ll stop using it so much, but until then I&#8217;m going to be talking to my friends all the time instead of painting/drawing/redecorating/planning/falling in love, etc. </em></p>
<p>Anyway, enough of that. Last week Monday I had my first trial for a new full time job at a rather big gourmet deli that&#8217;s super-far away from my house, but I love it. It&#8217;s all women, but no gossip. No. Gossip. But, eh, it&#8217;s gonna make it harder to meet nice young guys. I don&#8217;t think many guys would come up to the store to buy deli meats, unless their with their mum or something. Which reminds me, I had my first shift back at KFC last night, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve laughed so much in such a long time. I was in kind of a giggly mood already when I got there, but Zoe and I had the funniest time, even if the shift was a shift from hell. Funny story, a really gorgeous guy that had just finished work at Woolies &#8211; across the street &#8211; came in and ordered some sort of promotional meal, and Zoe had to cook it up, as she was doing it she kept repeating &#8216;This is the best so-and-so ever, it&#8217;s going to be delicious.&#8217; and so when I handed it out I was just like &#8216;So, apparently this is the best so-and-so ever, I hope you enjoy it&#8217; and he laughed his head off, cause he&#8217;d heard her saying it as she was making it. I thought he&#8217;d left the store so I went around to Zoe and jumped up and down and was laughing and was just like &#8216;He is so adorable and cute and nice!!&#8217; quite loudly, because I thought nobody was in the store.</p>
<p>Long story short, I go into the dining room to sweep up and I see him sitting there with the dumbest grin on his face and I couldn&#8217;t help but go outside, laugh my head off, compose myself and then go back in to sweep up. &#8230; Cool story bro. Right? Typical me. Well I had fun. :3 I also had my second trial shift for my new job yesterday as well. Was super awesome. I am excited.</p>
<p>On ze weekend I had Jacob, Kara, Fi and Rhys over and we had cocktails and nachos and pizza and appleberry pie and watched movies and went driving and it was so much fun. :3</p>
<p>Ah blah, I&#8217;m tired of writing.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And when the moment&#8217;s gone then I&#8217;ll be all alone.</em></p>
<p>The thing is, I think I started avoided using this blog because everything I wrote about wasn&#8217;t what<em> I wanted to write about</em>. It was a cover up, and I felt guilty, because I felt like I was lying to myself. And you know what? I still can&#8217;t write it down. I can&#8217;t put it down in my diary and I can&#8217;t put it down here.</p>
<p>Well, another day, another dollar (another colour). Someday I&#8217;ll be able to write, and not hold back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get there soon enough, but for now, I&#8217;m gonna stick to rambling about travel and jobs and paying full price for bus tickets.</p>
