			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you advertise an anti-racist message to a group of Neo-Nazis?</p>
<p>Simple: You sneak it in with a Trojan T-Shirt.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ExitDeutschlandTShirt.jpg" alt="Exit Deutschland T-Shirt" title="Exit Deutschland T-Shirt" width="540" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-654" /></p>
<p>At a recent right-wing extremist rock concert in Germany, a group called Exit Deutschland handed out t-shirts that featured skulls and bones and the message &#8220;Hardcore Rebels: National and Free&#8221; on the front.</p>
<p>However, after the fist wash, the original design would wash away, revealing the hidden message underneath: &#8220;What happened to your shirt can happen to you. We can help you break from right-wing extremism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal was to reach younger Neo-Nazi members who haven&#8217;t yet fully converted into extremism, to plant the seed that there&#8217;s always hope for a change in your life path.</p>
<p>Even with an audience as challenging as Neo-Nazis, this t-shirt campaign proves that with the right medium, you can get your message in front of just about anyone.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[If you give your passionate customers the tools they need to share their passion for your product or service with others, and reward them for doing so, you can create an army of great ‘salespeople’ who will do more for your company than any high paid salesperson ever could.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Few companies realize the value of their most passionate customers.</strong> They occasionally acknowledge them with frequent buyer programs or other discounts, but it’s rare for a company to really empower their customers to share their passion for the company and its products or services with others.</p>
<p><strong>Most companies rely on salespeople to position the benefits of their products or services to potential customers.</strong> Good salespeople do this in a way that excites customers about the possibilities and potential of using what they’re selling, but <strong>their ‘passion’ for the product is motivated by the paycheck they get for selling it</strong>, not by the product itself.</p>
<p>However, if you give your passionate customers the tools they need to share their passion for your product or service with others, and reward them for doing so, <strong>you can create an army of great ‘salespeople’ who will do more for your company than any high paid salesperson ever could</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of a well executed ambassador program. <strong>With a small investment in materials, it becomes a formalized, simplified, and easy to maintain word of mouth marketing campaign that the company itself can participate in.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlossen/4338224061/"><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/BoseCurtoseyCard.jpg" alt="Bose Curtosey Card" title="Bose Curtosey Card" width="540" height="359" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-643" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Bose Courtesy Card set the standard for a well executed ambassador program.</strong> Customers who were using (and loving) their Quiet Comfort headphones while flying would get asked about them by other passengers, and instead of disrupting the quiet zone that the headphones created, the customer could simply hand the person a Courtesy Card and let them check out Bose on their own time.</p>
<p><strong>It was simple and easy for the customer to do (not to mention unique and ‘cool’) and it also gave Bose control over the message that potential customers received.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasperbs/3039831732/"><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Fishing.jpg" alt="Fishing" title="Fishing" width="540" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-644" /></a></p>
<p>If you think of sales as fishing for customers, then Bose provided the bait, and just asked that current customers set the hook. After the initial interaction, potential customers would come to Bose, and all Bose had to do was reel them in.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/iPodSilhouette.jpg" alt="iPod Silhouette" title="iPod Silhouette" width="540" height="412" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-645" /></p>
<p>The hype that Apple generated with their white headphones is well known, and <strong>an Ambassador Program is like a whole army of white headphone wearers, but ones who have been given the tools necessary to help convert that initial interest and opportunity into additional sales</strong>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I haven’t seen many companies follow in the footsteps of Bose, which is why I was intrigued by Foursquare’s announcement of their Ambassador Program.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/FoursquareAmbassadorCard.jpg" alt="Foursquare Ambassador Card" title="Foursquare Ambassador Card" width="540" height="160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-646" /></p>
<p>Foursquare users love the deals they get from participating venues, but venues can’t provide deals if they don’t know about the service, so <strong>Foursquare created the Ambassador Program to help users spread the word</strong>. As long as you’re a “creative and excited evangelist”, Foursquare will send you a pack of Foursquare Ambassador Cards that are custom-printed with your name on them for you to hand out to the businesses that you frequent. Assuming that the businesses use the cards to sign up, Foursquare says that “the businesses get details about their foot traffic and loyal customers, and you and your fellow foursquare users will see more Specials at your favorite places.”</p>
<p>With the Ambassador Cards, <strong>Foursquare rewards users by crediting them with the creation of the location, and users get additional rewards when their favorite locations sign up and start offering deals and discounts</strong>. It’s a win-win, and Foursquare is simply enabling and encouraging their most passionate users do the selling for them.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons businesses get involved in social media is that they want to support the word of mouth marketing that customers are doing online. <strong>With a well planned ambassador program, you can get those same benefits offline as well with a small investment in materials and a way to thank those customers who are out there doing your work for you.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakenRum.jpg" alt="Kraken Rum" title="Kraken Rum" width="540" height="493" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-628" /></p>
<p><strong>Launching a new brand into a crowded market is never easy. However, if you’re focused with your message, and use the tools now at your disposal to spread that message far and wide, then you just might have a shot at gaining some decent exposure.</strong> Mix in fun, whimsy and a bit of mythical storytelling, and you’ll follow in the footsteps of <a href="http://www.krakenrum.com/">The Kraken Rum</a>, which recently set a new high bar with the launch of their Caribbean black spiced rum.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Kraken is the most fearsome of all sea monsters, that lives up to 3,000 feet below the ocean surface. This dreaded behemoth has been known to attack ships, dragging god-fearing seamen to their deaths. The largest shipment of Caribbean black spiced rum was said to be brought down by the Kraken. The rum was named thusly, as to being as dark, strong and mysterious as the ink of the beast.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The foundation of The Kraken’s marketing success was their focus on design</strong>, which gave them both a target audience (design geeks) and a messaging platform to build off of. The unique name, bold aesthetic and double handled bottle help to create a memorable brand, and set them apart in the minds of consumers from the supermarket aisle full of rums that merely focus on the results of drinking their product, or the history of their company to move units. <strong>By keeping their look and feel strong, yet simple, The Kraken has managed to not clutter their brand with excess design and distraction, and instead let the elements that form the essence of their brand shine through.</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="540" height="435" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TH_Z86mTjFk?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I emailed Charmaine Choi, who was responsible for much of The Kraken’s launch campaign, and asked about the development of the brand. She replied, <strong>“The Kraken Rum&#8217;s brand really came to be when we developed the voice and look of it out of the packaging. We wanted to make sure the style of writing and art only made the packaging come to life.”</strong> Her explanation makes perfect sense in the context of her agency, Dead As We Know It, which she describes as &#8220;a Brooklyn-based, creative-only advertising agency that conceives and produces communications, in all mediums, from the traditional to the uninvented, with the sole purpose of developing unique brand characters that deeply connect with people.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakenBox.jpg" alt="Kraken Box" title="Kraken Box" width="540" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-635" /></p>
<p>Many companies claim to have a strong brand, but it’s usually just the combination of name recognition that comes with age, a specific color that they call their own, and perhaps a logo or other design element that they have clung to. With Kraken however, their brand is not just a collection of elements, but <strong>a whole style and persona that is both unique, and instantly recognizable</strong>. There’s a feel to Kraken that you just don’t get with many products, and while it’s polarizing, it’s also something that consumers can latch onto and really claim as their own.</p>
<p>The first time I encountered Kraken Rum, they were in the midst of a PR blitz that caught the eye of NOTCOT, resulting in not one, not two, but THREE separate posts on the <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2009/10/kraken-rum-the.php">bottle</a>, the <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2010/12/kraken-rum-the-gift-guide.php">gift guide</a>, and the <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2009/10/kraken-unboxing.php">unboxing</a>. This was no doubt due in large part to the fact that NOTCOT received 1 of 50 silk screened press kits that were sent out to a highly targeted list of bloggers, which contained evidence that The Kraken truly exists. Each kit included a personalized letter, Kraken teeth, Kraken ink, quill, Kraken poster showing its enormous scale, scientific journal, a DVD of Kraken tales, and a bottle of the Kraken Rum itself.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakenInfluencerBox.jpg" alt="Kraken Influencer Box" title="Kraken Influencer Box" width="540" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629" /></p>
<p>According to Charmaine Choi, <strong>“The press kits were really done out of a labor of love. We didn&#8217;t have a huge budget and we all wanted to make something that we would want ourselves as an art piece.</strong> Everything was silkscreened by hand in house, from the box to the poster to the DVD covers. Conceptually, the items in the box were in support of the Kraken&#8217;s true existence. At the end, we really wanted the viewer to have something that was one of a kind and each kit had its own unique ink smears.”</p>
<p>By using their brand’s strong design elements to create objects that would stand out from the crowd of me-too swag giveaway, The Kraken ensured that their communications would catch the attention of target bloggers and reach the intended influencers. They also put enough time and enough effort into the marketing collateral that I’m sure bloggers felt at least a little compelled to write about the product, if nothing else than to thank the brand for all of their effort, and for selecting them to be the recipient of such an impressive kit of materials. <strong>These days, it’s pretty much a no-no to try and buy influencers outright, but that doesn’t mean you can’t put a little money into the lure you’re using to catch the big fish.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to catching the attention of bloggers, The Kraken press kits also helped to establish and spread the Kraken backstory, which was an important part of setting the brand apart from other spirits. <strong>By creating an aura around the brand and its origins, they were able to move the conversation away from tastes and flavors, which liquors typically chain themselves to, and instead focused on the unique experience of Kraken rum, which does a much better job of incentivizing a trial.</strong> As a consumer, you can be easily turned off by a liquor that sells itself as a flavor that’s not your usual preference, but it’s hard not to try a brand that challenges you to tame a mythical beast.</p>
<blockquote><p>To launch the world’s first 94 proof black spiced rum, we developed an integrated campaign based on the sea-beast of myth and legend. We developed an “accurate” history and, quite possibly, real world from which The Kraken Rum, may indeed have come. We created &#8220;scientific&#8221; movies, a scientific journal and an interactive website to educate the public. &#8211; <a href="http://www.charmainechoi.com/#204132/Kraken-Black-Spiced-Rum">Charmaine Choi</a></p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakenOnlineStore.jpg" alt="Kraken Online Store" title="Kraken Online Store" width="540" height="431" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-632" /></p>
<p>My second encounter with The Kraken was when their online store was discovered by a group of design blogs. Kraken, realizing the demand that had been created by consumers who saw the press kits and lusted after the content, had decided to take that brand aesthetic and apply it to a variety of products that would further expand their design. With unique items like a Moleskine notebook (what better way to get the design geeks swooning?), shower curtain, desk lamp, and handkerchief, Kraken wasn’t just hucking t-shirts and coasters like a typical alcohol brand. Instead, <strong>they were avoiding the common trap of forcing crap on unsuspecting customers who hold on to it just long enough to throw it away in the nearest trash bin, and instead created a brand that people not only appreciated, but actually went out of their way to purchase items with the Kraken look and feel on it</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakeniOSGame.jpg" alt="Kraken iOS Game" title="Kraken iOS Game" width="540" height="419" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-630" /></p>
<p>Lastly, to put the icing on the cake, <strong>Kraken released an iOS app that deftly combined a branded experience with game mechanics and an animated, comic book style history lesson on the beast that is The Kraken</strong>. Called “The Simulation Application for Nautical Maneuvering”, it’s billed by the makers of Kraken rum as a “near-accurate simulation, so that you may experience the perils they encountered in bringing their fine products to the world.”</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="540" height="334" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fYSOM4T5dpk?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>With the brand already established as a force to be reckoned with in the liquor world, Kraken took the bold step of replacing their homepage (and as a result, their search results and inbound links) with a single page preview of the game, directing potential customers not towards additional information about the product, but instead towards an experience where they would learn additional information about the brand itself.</p>
<p>With the unique aesthetic and clever copywriting that is a staple of the brand firmly in place in both the game’s design, and its marketing collateral, <strong>Kraken once again turned the focus away from taste, and towards something that would set them apart</strong>. Phrases like &#8220;state-of-the-art 19th century technology&#8221;, &#8220;hand-etched art, etched by real hands&#8221; and &#8220;fall-off-the-edge-of-Earth accuracy&#8221;, combined with hand-drawn artwork that uses .gif style animation to create fun visual Easter Eggs, work together to further the brand and its push towards becoming not just a spirit, but a whole persona for consumers to adopt.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/KrakenWallpaper.jpg" alt="Kraken Wallpaper" title="Kraken Wallpaper" width="540" height="334" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-636" /></p>
<p><strong>In the end, Kraken’s constant dedication to looking at the ‘brand’ not as a cost center, but as a differentiator in the market, and thus worthy of a few extra dollars here and there and a bit of experimentation from time to time, resulted in the creation of something that not only sells a product, but actually manages to sell itself as an aspirational lifestyle.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sometimes the best new ideas are just the combination of a few old ideas that still have life left in them.</strong> Swag giveaways, tweet requests and attractive models are nothing new, but combining them in an innovative and interesting way makes for <strong>a simple yet effective promotion that engages a targeted audience and extends the reach of a local event</strong>.</p>
<p>When Swatch partnered with GrandLife to host a party for New York Fashion Week, they wanted to promote their recently released New Gent and Lady watch collections by giving them to the taste makers in attendance.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SwatchDress.jpg" alt="" title="Swatch Watch Dress" width="540" height="426" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" /></p>
<p>Instead of just sticking them in a goodie bag or handing them out at the door though, Swatch decided to make partygoers work for their watches. They covered a model, dubbed the Swatch Girl, in 107 watches, and then asked attendees to tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/swatchus">@SwatchUS</a> with the hashtag #SwatchGirl to receive one of the watches off the model’s body.</p>
<p>The watch dress, which took two hours to assemble, was distributed in just ninety minutes, leaving the model in a skin colored, Swatch branded dress for the remainder of the party.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SwatchTanDress.jpg" alt="Swatch Tan Dress" title="Swatch Tan Dress" width="540" height="455" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618" /></p>
<p>It was certainly not the most expensive promotion to take place during Fashion Week, but Swatch estimates that the resulting tweets had a total reach of 400,000, <strong>helping their small giveaway reach a much larger audience with just a simple twist on a traditional formula</strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contests, giveaways and sweepstakes have always been a great way to get a brand in front of a large number of people, but interest in the campaign usually wanes as soon as the winner is announced. To combat that trend, <strong>many contests have turned into hunts for the next online cewebrity, where the winner gets a chance to extend their 15 minutes of fame through the sponsor’s social channels (and on the sponsor’s dime) in exchange for extending the life of the campaign in the process</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The formula is simple: Mix one part love of contests with one part love of ‘reality’ entertainment, add a heaping spoonful of social media and you’ll end up with what I’m calling the ‘Experience Prize’.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/FiestaMovement.jpg" alt="Fiesta Movement" title="Fiesta Movement" width="540" height="160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-584" /></p>
<p><strong>Ford was one of the first brands to experiment with adding the social media spotlight to their prize with the <a href="http://chapter1.fiestamovement.com/">Fiesta Movement</a>.</strong> In the Fiesta Movement, 100 winners (they called them ‘agents’) were selected from more than 4,000 applicants, and each was given a brand new Fiesta to drive for six months. Then, each month Ford would send the agents on themed missions, and the agents would complete, and then lifestream those missions with blog posts, photos, videos and status updates. <strong>Thus, the agents didn’t just win a car for six months; they won an experience prize that included ongoing interaction with the brand, and a series of unique trips and adventures in exchange for their willingness to share the experience with the world.</strong></p>
<p><object width="540" height="325"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Of6EBA1pmdg&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Of6EBA1pmdg&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="540" height="325"></embed></object></p>
<p>Queensland, Australia was the next to integrate social media into their prize, with <strong>one lucky winner spending six months as the caretaker of an island in what they called <a href="http://www.islandreefjob.com/">The Best Job In The World</a>.</strong> During those six months, the winner explored the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, and the world followed along through a regularly updated blog, YouTube videos and Twitter posts. <strong>Instead of just a trip, this experience prize included a job title, roles and responsibilities, and the jealousy of thousands of people around the world.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/LiveOffGroupon.jpg" alt="Live Off Groupon" title="Live Off Groupon" width="540" height="145" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585" /></p>
<p><strong>Groupon took the concept of the experience prize and evolved it into something else entirely, as their experience prize is more like an experience challenge.</strong> The contest, called “<a href="http://liveoffgroupon.com/">Live Off Groupon</a>”, challenges one person to attempt to survive for one year with nothing but a laptop, a cellphone and an unlimited supply of Groupons. If he can last for twelve months, he wins $100,000, and if he can’t, he still gets to take home a pretty good chunk of Internet fame as a consolation prize.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/OldSpiceInternshipChallenge.jpg" alt="Old Spice Internship Challenge" title="Old Spice Internship Challenge" width="540" height="166" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-586" /></p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>Old Spice added sex appeal and competition to the formula for their experience prize</strong>, with Gretchen Bleiler and Anastasia Ashley hosting an <a href="http://www.oldspiceadventure.com/">Internship Challenge</a>. While the two women act as ‘internship mentors’, the two winners get to go to Switzerland or Fiji, where they will compete with one another in various challenges spread out over five days. Each challenge gets documented with photo and/or video evidence that is then uploaded to the Old Spice blog and Facebook Page, where a winner will be selected by those following along to receive an extra $1000 per challenge.</p>
<p><strong>The key benefit of the experience prize is that it finds people who are likely to be loud, far reaching and influential voices online, and then gives them the tools and the exposure they need to amplify their voice even further.</strong> This turns the winners into mini cewebrities, or enhances their current cewebrity status, and lets them use that status to promote the brand (and themselves) for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>In addition, another benefit of the experience prize is that <strong>the world can follow along as the winner essentially test-drives the sponsor for an extended period of time</strong>. Whether it’s an actual test drive, as in the case of the Fiesta Movement, or a test drive of the benefits of a service, like the Groupon challenge, it’s a chance for the rest of the world to watch as the winner uses the service in excruciating detail, and then shares that experience in the most entertaining way possible.</p>
<p><strong>So what are the challenges that a brand faces when putting on a contest with an experience prize?</strong></p>
<p>For one, <strong>the prize needs to be worth the effort required to enter, win and then use it</strong>. If the goal is to find an online personality that will engage others and be worth watching for an extended period of time, then you need to <strong>fish with the right bait</strong>. If the prize is too small, you either won’t receive many entries, or the entries that you do receive won’t be from the right type of people. <strong>Large prizes also tend to spread via word of mouth</strong>, as one person tells the next about the great prize that they can win by just entering a contest, and the result is that you can keep your promotion costs relatively low while still reaching a large audience.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that <strong>it can be difficult to transition the success of an experience prize campaign into the success of other social efforts</strong>. Unlike an online ad buy, which can drive traffic to a social channel that can then be used for a number of promotions, an Experience Prize often lives on its own microsite, and is not integrated into a larger social effort. While this can be mitigated by hosting part of the contest on a channel like Facebook, it’s important to remember that <strong>a few extra YouTube videos and tweets from the entrants aren’t suddenly going to turn your brand into an ongoing social media success story</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>there needs to be a concentrated effort to build buzz and excitement around the contest before the entries are due</strong>, because the quality of the entries will determine the quality of the content that the campaign creates. Whether it’s with voting, targeted ad buys, YouTube videos entries or a full blown social media bombardment, word of mouth is key, and <strong>the campaign must be easy enough to share that entrants will willingly help to promote it to their friends</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Despite the challenges, a well-run contest with a unique and interesting experience prize can generate a ton of buzz for a brand, and can keep the excitement alive for months after the announcement of the winner.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DantesInfernoASCIIArt.jpg" alt="Dante&#039;s Inferno ASCII Art" title="Dante&#039;s Inferno ASCII Art" width="540" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-572" /></p>
<p><strong>When the team behind the Dante’s Inferno video game hid ASCII art in the source code of many popular websites and then waited for that art to get discovered, they were taking a huge risk, but sometimes big rewards can only come to those that are willing to take equally big risks.</strong> The risk was mitigated by the fact that their campaign was innovative and well targeted, but there was still the chance that their idea was going to fall flat, or that consumers were not going to be receptive to the idea of hunting for what essentially boils down to fancy looking banner ads.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/HellIsCloserThanYouThink.jpg" alt="Hell Is Closer Than You Think" title="Hell Is Closer Than You Think" width="540" height="174" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-575" /></p>
<p>Before we dive into the campaign however, let’s do <strong>a quick history lesson</strong>: ASCII art, or art made with text, has been around since the early days of the computer. Back when printers weren’t able to make graphics, someone figured out that various characters could be combined to simulate them instead, and ASCII art was born. Because of its lengthy history and quirky nature, ASCII art has remained popular in the geek crowd for many years, and coders are even known to hide ASCII art in the source code of their websites so that other geeks will stumble across it and discover the hidden art while looking under the hood of another coder’s site. This type of ‘hidden reward’ is also found in video games, where coders will hide objects or inside jokes in hard to reach places or behind lengthy button combinations in what&#8217;s affectionately referred to as an Easter Egg. The goal for both is to <strong>reward users that dig into a website or explore in a video game beyond what the typical user would do</strong>, so that whether it&#8217;s hidden code in a website or a hidden Easter Egg in a video game, those that discover it feel like they have earned access to some sort of exclusive content or reward.</p>
<p>With that history lesson out of the way, lets look at how Dante’s Inferno combined the geek’s love of ASCII art with the gamer’s love of Easter Eggs into a unique and innovative ad campaign that generated a ton of buzz for their upcoming release.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DantesInfernoASCIIArtDeath.jpg" alt="Dante&#039;s Inferno ASCII Art - Death" title="Dante&#039;s Inferno ASCII Art - Death" width="540" height="706" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-578" /></p>
<p><strong>The campaign featured six pieces of ASCII art that were hidden in the source code of various video game and technology websites.</strong> One of the first of these sites to get discovered was Digg (by <a href="http://www.brentcsutoras.com/2010/02/03/digg-hacked-clever-advertisement/">Brent Csutoras</a>) with the initial discovery leading to a large scale search that uncovered a number of other pieces of art scattered across the Internet in places like IGN, GameSpot, Daily Motion, Games Radar, and WWE. One site, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5463668/latest-dante-stunt-buries-ascii-art-in-our-source-code/">Kotaku</a>, even discovered art hidden in their own source code after a reader tipped them off to the campaign, which the editors claimed to have no knowledge of. <strong>In addition to the art itself, each hidden &#8216;ad&#8217; also contained a URL and a password to a secret site, and by collecting all six of these passwords, users could visit that website and unlock a special bundle of content that included music, wallpapers, posters, concept art and more from the upcoming game.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ReapYourEarthlyRewards.jpg" alt="Reap Your Earthly Rewards" title="Reap Your Earthly Rewards" width="540" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-574" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this campaign is that it was very risky, since the ads could have sat unnoticed for a lengthy period of time before being discovered, and even then, they would have to be almost exclusively passed around by word of mouth, since there is no way to view them except by manually selecting to view the source code of a website. Thus, the campaign would have been dead in the water if it had not generated the buzz that its creators were hoping for. In addition, there is no way to track who views the source code of a website or the traffic generated from those views, except through a very rudimentary URL tracking system that uses custom URLs to track the source of visits. Thus, <strong>the only way to judge the results of this campaign is to track how many users download the special bundle, and what kind of buzz the campaign generates</strong>. (It&#8217;s interesting to note that Dante’s Inferno decided not to track what sites users were grabbing their codes from, since the same URL was used across all sites, and secret codes were shared among sites as well.) Another challenge is that while bundle downloads do indicate the total number of people exposed to the campaign, they can&#8217;t differentiate between a user that actually viewed the ASCII art in the source code of a website, and a user that simply found or was given the six passwords on a gaming forum or other less involved medium and then used them to unlock the bundle.</p>
<p>The result of these challenges is that <strong>for a campaign like this to work well, it has to be used for the right product at the right time and with just enough luck thrown in to capture the interest of the right audience long enough to make an impression</strong>. Judging by the blog reactions and user comments about the campaign however, this seems to have struck just that balance, with comments ranging from &#8220;I am pretty impressed by this campaign&#8221; and &#8220;it is an advertising campaign and quite a clever one if I must say so myself&#8221; to &#8220;The latest stunt is eerie, and gets bonus points for both creativity and giving the fans some fun bonuses.&#8221; Even Digg&#8217;s Chas Edwards, Digg Publisher and Chief Revenue Officer was quoted as saying, &#8220;Since Digg’s early days, ASCII art has been ingrained in our site’s culture. We’re thrilled with the opportunity presented by our partnership with Electronic Arts and the Dante’s Inferno team — incorporating ASCII art into advertising on Digg, while providing the 40 million users in the Digg Community first access to the promotion code.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Gluttony.jpg" alt="Gluttony" title="Gluttony" width="540" height="338" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-576" /></p>
<p>Hiding an ad in the source code of a website is a great example of a company that&#8217;s willing to think outside the banner, but <strong>does the success of the Dante&#8217;s Inferno campaign mean that hidden ASCII art is a viable option for other ad campaigns as well?</strong> In this case, I don&#8217;t think that you could duplicate the results of this campaign in the near term, as the success was due in such large part to the combination of right place, right time to the right audience for the right product. However, if enough time goes by and users once again forget about a company’s ability to hide ads in places as remote as the source code of a website, I think we could see another campaign or two reach a similar level of success by using a similar idea. </p>
<p><strong>So why can’t companies just start hiding ads in the source code of all of their favorite websites and then wait for people to find them?</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>There is a very small percentage of people that even know how to view the source code of a website, and even then, it’s not a guarantee that they will like ASCII art.</li>
<li>Much of the buzz around the Dante’s Inferno campaign was driven by the novelty of the idea, so each subsequent implementation will have substantially less buzz as people get accustomed to seeing ads hidden in source code.</li>
<li>If people don&#8217;t care enough about a product to go searching for hidden art with secret codes and mystery websites in exchange for exclusive content, then the campaign will never get seen by more than a handful of consumers who accidentally stumble across it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The take away from this campaign is that it’s important to always keep your eyes open for new and innovative ideas, and to be willing to take a risk on a new format that might drive a lot of interest in a product, even if that format can&#8217;t be directly tied to traffic or sales.</strong> In addition, because the lack of direct tracking means you will never know the exact impact of a risky or non-conventional campaign, you must find a new way of defining your reward (besides just traffic and clicks) so that you will know if the risks were worth it, and if the campaign was a success.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique and innovative campaign generated a massive amount of buzz.</li>
<li>Exclusive content motivated users to seek out additional pieces of hidden art and pass along the campaign to others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Results would be difficult to duplicate, as much of the buzz was driven by how innovative the idea was.</li>
<li>Limited tracking means the success of the campaign is based on a single number (in this case, bundle downloads) and that the awareness generated by the ads themselves, separate from clicks, was all but impossible to track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique ad formats that reward the viewer are sought out by consumers, rather than needing to be forced upon them.</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[Gowalla, a location-based social network, and Incase, an Apple accessory manufacturer, have teamed up to create one of the first ad campaigns to live exclusively on a location-based social network.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GowallaIncase.jpg" alt="Gowalla Incase" title="Gowalla Incase" width="540" height="85" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, a location-based social network, and <a href="http://www.goincase.com/">Incase</a>, an Apple accessory manufacturer, have <a href="http://gowalla.com/blog/2010/01/go-out-with-gowalla-and-incase/">teamed up</a> to create one of the first ad campaigns to live exclusively on a location-based social network.</strong> (They’re calling it a ‘collaboration’, but it’s still a proof of concept even if Gowalla isn&#8217;t getting paid for it.) The campaign features six Incase-branded virtual items which are modeled after actual Incase gear. When Gowalla users check in at any Apple Store around the world during the promotional period, they receive one of those six virtual items, and a few lucky users will even receive an actual Incase Slider case in addition to their virtual item.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GowallaPrize.jpg" alt="Gowalla Prize" title="Gowalla Prize" width="540" height="284" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-558" /></p>
<p>This ‘real prize’ functionality debuted during Gowalla’s 10 and a Half Days of Christmas promotion, but <strong>this is the first time it’s been sponsored by another company</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/RealPrize.jpg" alt="Gowalla Real Prize" title="Gowalla Real Prize" width="540" height="271" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-559" /></p>
<p>Lastly, if a user collects all six virtual items, they receive a special ‘Incase Pin of Glory’ to mark their accomplishment. (Pins are one feature of Gowalla’s system.)</p>
<p>Since Gowalla, Foursquare, <a href="http://www.loopt.com/">Loopt</a>, <a href="http://whrrl.com/">Whrrl</a>, <a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a> and the rest of the location-based social networks are all relatively new, they’re all still trying to figure out how to monetize their service, which should make this an interesting space to keep an eye on in 2010. In fact, I&#8217;d go so far as to say that <strong>location-based social networks will be <em>the</em> space to watch in the coming year</strong>, as they have the potential to revolutionize how companies advertise to consumers on a highly targeted and hyper-local level.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IncaseFoursquareSponsorship.jpg" alt="Incase Foursquare Sponsorship" title="Incase Foursquare Sponsorship" width="540" height="306" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562" /></p>
<p>Currently <strong>the two leaders in the space (at least in terms of buzz) are Foursquare and Gowalla, and each service is trying slightly different methods of advertising to their users</strong>, with each method having unique advantages and disadvantages. Gowalla gives users items related to the locations that they check in at, such as Incase items at Apple Stores, and a <a href="http://gowalla.com/blog/2009/10/crush-it-with-gowalla-part-dos/">digital icon of Gary Vaynerchuk’s Crush It book</a> at all stops on his book tour. Foursquare on the other hand shows users sponsored locations that are near their check in location, offers users coupons and specials based on check ins, and also counts the number of times that a user checks in at a location, turning Foursquare into a hosted loyalty rewards program. Regardless of which advertising method comes out on top though, <strong>expect to see each service adopt parts of what works well with the other services</strong> as each continue to refine their offering.</p>
<p><strong>To test drive this campaign, I visited the Apple Flagship Store in San Francisco and checked in on Gowalla.</strong> The first time I checked in however, nothing out of the ordinary happened, so I returned later that day and checked in again, and received an Incase Slider Case item in return. There wasn&#8217;t much more to it though, which left me feeling like they could have done so much more with the idea. (Note: I did receive a tweet the next day, shown above, which said that I was the winner of an actual Incase Slider case. While I’m excited to have won, I think the points below are still valid.) <strong>A few potential ideas/changes that crossed my mind:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explain the campaign in the item messaging.</strong> Had I not been actively reading the Gowalla blog, I would not have known that the Incase item was any different from a normal item that you receive when checking in on Gowalla. At the very least, <strong>Gowalla should have included some information about the campaign and the fact that you can receive a special pin for collecting all six limited edition items</strong>, as this would go a long way towards increasing the repeat engagement of each user, and highlights the specialness of the item. Taking the sponsor integration a step further, if Gowalla included a web browser in their app, they could include a link to the Incase product page in the message, and if a user wanted to find out more about the featured product, they would be just a click away from detailed information and potentially even an online storefront.</li>
<li><strong>Turn each item into a coupon.</strong> If Incase wants to convert Apple Store shoppers into Incase customers, they should <strong>use the message attached to each item as an opportunity for them to give Gowalla users a special deal on Incase products</strong>. The timing is perfect, since they’re reaching a very targeted audience at or near the point of purchase, and <strong>they’re also able to specifically target early adopters and heavy social network users</strong> who are the most likely to be using Gowalla at this point, and are also the most likely to help spread the message to others. Even better (for Incase at least, though maybe not for users) would be to turn each item into a small coupon, and allow users to combine the six items together to create a larger coupon, creating an incentive to collect all six items that has more real-world value than a virtual Gowalla pin.</li>
<li><strong>Get users to share.</strong> Encouraging users to collect all six items is a great way to motivate repeat visits, but if Incase wants to spread the word from the initial group of influencers to a larger audience, they need to incentivize the sharing of items with others. Perhaps it&#8217;s a coupon that is only activated when one user gives an item to another user, or a contest where the person whose item is subsequently picked-up and dropped-off by the most users wins a prize from Incase, but <strong>a little motivation can go a long way toward the spread of information from user to user</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the Gowalla/Incase campaign shows, <strong>advertising on location-based social networks can be integrated into the experience in a fun way that adds to a user’s enjoyment of the service, rather than detracting from it</strong>. And while Twitter continues to struggle to find the best way of monetizing their service without angering their users, Gowalla and Foursquare have both introduced advertising very early in their growth, which should help users accept ads and other promotions as a part of the user experience. As they continue to grow however, <strong>the key will be for location-based social networks to work closely with sponsors to help create campaigns like the Incase sponsorship that integrate ads in a non-invasive and additive way</strong>, so that users welcome and respond well to these ads, since they will ultimately provide value to both the sponsor and the user.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/NOTCOTNetbookResourceCenter.jpg" alt="NOTCOT Netbook Resource Center" title="NOTCOT Netbook Resource Center" width="540" height="140" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-547" /></p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s NOTCOT sponsorship is a great example of how <strong>a company can go beyond the banner to integrate itself into the uniqueness of a blog and speak directly to that blog’s audience through custom content</strong>. It also shows how <strong>the continued transition of ad dollars from traditional media into online media will fund new opportunities for advertisers to reach their online audience in new ways as blogs capitalize on the customizability of their medium</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/NOTCOTIntegration.jpg" alt="NOTCOT Theme Integration" title="NOTCOT Theme Integration" width="540" height="585" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-548" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Go sponsorship includes <strong>a special section in NOTCOT called the Netbook Resource Center</strong>, which covers netbook news and accessories (they call it ‘fresh mobile lifestyle content’) and lives inside of a <strong>branded wrapper</strong> featuring images of the Samsung netbook done in the traditional NOTCOT style. There’s also a <strong>traditional banner that leads each post, and a rich media banner at the end of each post that’s co-sponsored by CNET</strong>, and lets readers see reviews, change color options, view the netbook from different angles, and compare prices.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/SamsungRichMediaBanner.jpg" alt="Samsung Rich Media Banner" title="Samsung Rich Media Banner" width="540" height="237" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-551" /></p>
<p>(<strong>Tip for Samsung:</strong> If you’re going to feature the CNET Editor Rating in your banner, make sure you actually give CNET a netbook to rate.) Lastly, <strong>posts written ‘out in the wild’ on the Samsung netbook receive a special banner style tag</strong> that&#8217;s appended to the lead image.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/WildBanner.jpg" alt="Samsung Wild Banner Tag" title="Samsung Wild Banner Tag" width="540" height="329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549" /></p>
<p>The result is an integration that <strong>lets the blogger keep control over the content</strong>, allowing her to continue to make the content that created her audience in the first place, while <strong>Samsung can wrap it in advertising that goes well beyond the traditional banner and works to become a part of the overall experience</strong>.</p>
<p>While the <a href="http://thefutureofads.com/popurls-and-ups-team-up-for-the-brown-edition">POPURLS sponsorship allowed UPS</a> to brand business news without paying any writers for the privilege, <strong>the NOTCOT sponsorship is on the opposite end of the spectrum</strong>, and allows Samsung to speak directly to their target audience by paying a writer to create an entire section of specialized content dedicated to related news. The end result is that <strong>Samsung has more control over the message</strong>, though that control must be balanced with the idea that blog writers know what will resonate with their readers, and should usually just be left alone with a minimal amount of guidance.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/UncrateTrendHunterSponsorship.jpg" alt="Uncrate TrendHunter Sponsorship" title="Uncrate TrendHunter Sponsorship" width="540" height="134" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550" /></p>
<p>In addition to NOTCOT, <strong>Samsung also sponsored Uncrate and TrendHunter</strong>, which highlights another interesting aspect of this campaign: The difference in integration between the three. While NOTCOT created an entire section dedicated to netbook posts, and redesigned the blog’s theme to includes the Samsung Go, Uncrate and TrendHunter have just appended the leading and trailing banners to their netbook posts and placed the content aggregating banner into the sidebar, giving their sponsorships a much more traditional feel. <strong>As blogs continue to evolve and take over the role that traditional media used to serve in the consumer&#8217;s consumption of media however, I expect more sites to go the route that NOTCOT has pioneered, offering advertisers a much more customizable and comprehensive option for integrating a brand and its products into the overall experience.</strong></p>
<p>While this was obviously <strong>a one-off campaign that required a lot of planning and integration</strong>, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine how blogs and advertisers can use this as an example of how to think outside the banner and reach their intended audience without feeling like the brand is being forced upon them. However, the key will be to <strong>avoid sponsorships that feel like the blogger was bought and paid for, and work to create sponsorships that feel like a natural extension of the content that the sponsored blog would cover anyways</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsorship highlights the brand in a natural, non-intrusive way that’s specific to the blog being sponsored.</li>
<li>Innovative placements cut through a viewer’s ad blindness.</li>
<li>Content doesn’t feel forced, and integration is a natural extension of the blog’s typical subject matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive one-off requires a lot of planning and setup, and would be difficult to roll out on a large scale.</li>
<li>Consumers are wary of sponsored content, which can affect their opinion of any review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brands work closely with blogs to integrate themselves into the experience, going beyond just a banner ad or sponsored post, and becoming a much larger part of the new digital media.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/POPURLSBrownEdition.jpg" alt="POPURLS Brown Edition" title="POPURLS Brown Edition" width="540" height="191" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-538" /></p>
<p>Most companies would love to have people spend a few minutes of each day thinking about their brand, and many pay a lot of money for the privilege. However, <strong>paying to put your brand in front of people’s eyes and having people want to look at your brand on a daily basis are two very different things</strong>, with the former often leading to brand fatigue while the later leads to a case study and high fives around the office. Making people want to look at your brand isn’t what I’d call easy, but <strong>if you can find a service that people want to use anyways and then cover it in your branding, there’s a good chance you can get them to look at your logo on a daily basis and actually get some value out of it along the way</strong>. For UPS, that’s exactly what they’ve done with the POPURLS Brown Edition, a sponsored dashboard for business news.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/UPSVideos.jpg" alt="POPURLS UPS Videos" title="POPURLS UPS Videos" width="540" height="254" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-540" /></p>
<p>POPURLS is a “dashboard for the latest web-buzz, a single page that encapsulates up-to-the-minute headlines from the most popular sites on the internet”. <strong>POPURLS Brown Edition takes that formula and delivers only business related news</strong>, including the U.S. Economy, Small Business news, the Global Economy, Capital Lending and more. UPS then pays POPURLS to make the page UPS brown, slap the UPS logo in a few different places, and slide video thumbnails of the UPS whiteboard ads in between content, with the end result being <strong>a branded space that automatically updates with all of the latest business news on a frequent basis</strong>. Think of it as UPS associating their name with some of the best business content online without having to pay a single dollar to any writers to do so.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/UPSTags.jpg" alt="POPURLS UPS Tags" title="POPURLS UPS Tags" width="540" height="253" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-539" /></p>
<p><strong>One addition to the already proven POPURLS formula is that UPS has permanently added specific UPS links to the bottom of each section when appropriate</strong>, so for instance, the Technology section links to the UPS Mobile iPhone App and the Small Business section links to UPS Paperless Invoice service. These links are tagged with a small UPS logo, and work well because they’re categorized along with the regular news, so that someone who is interested in technology and browsing the technology news section can also see what UPS is doing on the technology front.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/POPURLSRWW.jpg" alt="POPURLS Banner" title="POPURLS Banner" width="540" height="193" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-541" /></p>
<p><strong>Another advantage of the POPULRS sponsorship is that UPS can use the POPURLS system to create dynamic banner ads that are constantly updated with the latest business news.</strong> This allows them to automatically inject hot keywords and relevant headlines into their banners that will grab people’s attention, and the rotating creative helps fight banner fatigue for viewers that see the same banner over and over. These banners rely heavily on the POPURLS branding, which works well in the social space where many viewers will have had previous experience with the POPURLS service, but may not work as well in other areas where the POPURLS name is not as recognizable.</p>
<p>Partnerships and sponsorships are a tricky thing to master, as <strong>each brand must benefit from the union, the two must be related but non-competitive, and the value needs to be high enough to deliver results, but not so high that the cost becomes prohibitive</strong>. However, when done right, a good partnership/sponsorship can be an easy way to create a service that people actually want to use, and that each side can be happy to be a part of.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing POPURLS formula is proven, making it easy to create a new product with just a few small changes.</li>
<li>Users get value out of the dashboard in exchange for their time spent in front of the UPS brand.</li>
<li>Constant updates keep the content fresh and allow UPS to leverage the latest in business news.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UPS is not a vital part of the equation, and a business news edition of POPURLS could easily survive without the UPS sponsorship.</li>
<li>Lack of control over the content means there are potential risks for stories that don’t favor UPS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Partnerships and sponsorships allow brands to piggyback on successful web properties while delivering value to the user in exchange for brand exposure.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://thefutureofads.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ColumbiaPandora.jpg" alt="Columbia Pandora Banner" title="Columbia Pandora Banner" width="540" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-533" /></p>
<p>Lately I’ve been listening to a lot of music on Pandora, and while their Music Genome Project is great, it’s their advertising that has kept me coming back for more. <strong>By working with companies to integrate their ads into the overall experience, Pandora is able to use their advertising format to create value for both the advertisers and the users.</strong> One example that really stood out recently was the <strong>integration of Columbia, which brings together a banner, backgrounds and playlists to create an entire branded experience</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Experience marketing is a growing trend in recent years</strong>, as companies think outside the banner and look beyond traditional media for their next customer, but it’s often costly, time and labor intensive, and usually relies on social media to spread the experience of a select few out to the larger population. <strong>What Pandora has managed to do with their advertising is to create an experience that, while not at the scale of a traditional experience marketing campaign, does manage to spread a sponsor’s message to a much larger audience.</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Pandora Experience’ goes like this: When listening to the free version of Pandora on Pandora.com, any user action (such as changing the volume, skipping or rating a track, or changing a station) changes the banner(s). This allows Pandora to ensure that their ‘views’ are actually being viewed, and probably helps boost the numbers when it comes time to negotiate costs. Sponsored banners (vs. remnant ads served through ad networks) usually include a site takeover that changes the background as well, though <strong>not all advertisers are using that feature to its full advantage</strong>.</p>
<p>When Columbia makes it to the front of the sponsored banner rotation, listeners are presented with a banner that looks like a dashboard interface that has been customized to include their local weather forecast. While banner customization based on IP address has been available for a while now, it’s often inaccurate at best, and usually results in a very rough and forced feeling of customization. On Pandora however, <strong>account holders provide a zip code when they register, so the Pandora system can accurately match each user to a location they’ll recognize</strong>, even if they happen to be traveling or at work and away from their home base.</p>
<p>With this single piece of user data in hand, Columbia matches the user’s current weather to a piece of clothing in their current collection. Users can then scroll over the rest of the five-day forecast to see what Columbia would recommend for the upcoming weather, or arrow through a larger catalog if they see something they like and want to investigate further. <strong>Each type of weather also includes a customized playlist that a user can add to their collection of Stations, and when listening to that custom playlist, the user exclusively sees the Columbia banner and the Columbia-sponsored background that matches the weather.</strong> (Or maybe the weather that the user wishes they had, as Columbia also allows users to select a variety of alternative weather options in case they want to brighten up a stormy day with the Sunshine Playlist.)</p>
<p>What’s so great about this medium is that <strong>Columbia can use it to transport your mind away from your desk</strong> and into a winter wonderland, where you can see the snow and hear the winter music, and then think to yourself, ‘<em>You know, I probably will need a winter jacket for that ski trip I’ve got planned.</em>’ They grab your attention with personal details that you wouldn’t expect an advertiser to present you with, and then use that attention to draw you into an experience that promotes the brand to more than one of your senses.</p>
<p><strong>Columbia’s attention to the detail can also be seen in the way they have designed the banner</strong>, with plenty of arrows to direct an interested viewer’s attention to the important areas of information. For starters, every arrow but the ‘Buy Now’ button points away from the product, giving your eye a point to focus on that centers on the product they want to sell you. Then, if your eye works its way down from the forecast through the trail of orange, there are arrows along the way to guide you from the product to the weather to the custom playlist to the ‘Add Playlist’ button. <strong>It’s subtle, but there’s some good UI going on</strong> in this banner that works well for the intended purpose. <strong>If I were to find fault, I’d say that the alternative playlist selection is a little funky</strong>, but that’s nitpicking at best, since most users will just want to select the playlist they’re given that matches the weather they’re currently experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>By presenting each user with a single banner at a time, and not overwhelming them with a barrage of advertising, Pandora has created a valuable placement that advertisers should be willing and happy to pay a premium for.</strong> At the same time, <strong>companies who are going to pay that premium need to be smart about it</strong> and think like Columbia to create an experience that adds to the medium and gives users a reason to engage with the advertising.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Integration creates a full experience that can be shared by a large number of consumers.</li>
<li>A small amount of user data goes a long way towards creating a look and feel that is customized without being intrusive.</li>
<li>Repeat engagement is dynamic, and the experience changes with the weather.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative playlist selection is a rough edge on an otherwise smooth experience.</li>
<li>The available backgrounds are a bit… ugly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Custom integration within specific channels allows advertisers to cater their message to each user and create a small-scale experience that packs plenty of impact.</li>
</ul>
