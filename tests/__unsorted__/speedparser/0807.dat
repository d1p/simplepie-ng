			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I had a rather unpleasant encounter on Twitter. I won&#8217;t be naming names here for privacy reasons, (more for friends than for myself), but it was with the PR account of a fairly successful brand of niche adult toys.</p>
<p>This account made a series of jokes in bad taste about Mexican people, following the news that Mexican customs wouldn&#8217;t allow their toys into the country. There was a joke about catapulting the toys over the fence, (a reference, as I understand it, to an actual plan discovered?), and they also retweeted someone else&#8217;s joke about a &#8216;toy cartel&#8217; forming that would go around raping people.</p>
<p>Obviously these jokes are racist and insensitive. And while the PR account later admitted that they were, after myself and a few of my friends called them out, they did not retract nor apologise sincerely for their comments.</p>
<p>Their response was that we were making too much out of a small thing, that we should have better battles to fight, and that we shouldn&#8217;t make things hard for ourselves by speaking up.</p>
<p>The problem with this line of thinking is that if nobody spoke up, I doubt the account would cease to post insensitive and offensive comments. They have a history of doing this, though this is the first time I have spoken up. It seems to be a tired, recurrent theme running through online culture at the moment. It has become acceptable and hip to make offensive remarks &#8216;ironically&#8217;, with some people claiming we live in a &#8216;post-racial&#8217; environment, where people are free to comment on other races at will.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these people often come at the argument from a position of privilege. White folks have been making light of minorities for hundreds of years; need I mention gollywogs, minstrels, cowboys and indians movies? These jokes are based on a very real inequality between the two groups of people involved.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a sore point for myself and my partner. We recently played host to two of his friends from the States. Online, they were humble, intelligent and spiritual people who seemed nice, if a little intimidating. Unfortunately, in person they were resentful, cruel and unaware of the offense that some of their jokes caused. They commented on how spinners and chrome wheels were a &#8220;plague amongst the poor blacks and Mexicans&#8221;; they remarked that our fridge was small, and said how their fridge at home &#8220;could fit at least two Mexicans in it&#8221;. And in online spaces like 4Chan and SomethingAwful these comments would be rated highly.</p>
<p>I suppose all you can do is make some noise when people you know make these types of comments. Even if they react in anger and reject the notion that a joke carries more weight than just its humour, the fact is that it is a symptom of a greater issue with many online spaces, and it can carry over offline as well. I just hope that by speaking up I have made them think about what they said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">A lot of outfits I wear are pretty costumey. I prefer it that way; I try never to wear the same outfit twice, and everything can tell a story.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was compiling a few things that I&#8217;ve had my eye on recently, and I noticed that they basically amount to a bush-bashing-type lady&#8217;s outfit. Maybe it&#8217;s because of my recent dinner at <a href="http://yourrestaurants.com.au/guide/?action=venue&amp;venue_url=lava_stonegrill">Lava Stonegrill,</a> (which has had some poor reviews but was quite good), featuring, among other things, wild boar and kangaroo?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">So Gary is in the metaphorical doghouse today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/wEG03l.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I got two missed calls on my phone while I was at work, so I googled the number and it was the local council. I automatically leapt to the worst conclusion; our house is on fire and all my pets are dead. (Rational, right?)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I called them back and nobody knew what the heck so that was okay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then a lady called me and left a voicemail saying she thinks she has my dog?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turns out Gary had somehow got out of the backyard and wandered off exploring, into the next-door neighbour&#8217;s garden. She saved me an impound fee from the rangers and hung onto him for the day. Apparently she found my number from his <a href="http://www.boomerangtags.com/page.php?c=collartags">Boomerang collar tag</a>, but she only found it when he was&#8230; sitting on her lap having a nap. It&#8217;s one of the flat ones so it didn&#8217;t stand out amongst his fur.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So Gary got a nice day playing with the Labrador puppy next door and having cuddles, and the lady got a nice bottle of champagne when my partner picked the little wanker up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It could have been so much worse! Little jerk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Collar, register and microchip!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a few things I&#8217;ve bookmarked this week. I got my tax return in record turn-around time (8 days!) but can&#8217;t spend most of it, so I&#8217;m torturing myself by browsing online. I did buy a couple of things from the <a href="http://www.yoursclothing.co.uk" target="_blank">Yours Clothing</a> sale recently but they haven&#8217;t turned up just yet.<span id="more-211"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_212" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Mysize-Silverado-pants.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-212" title="Mysize Silverado pants" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Mysize-Silverado-pants.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="767" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">MySize Silverado Printed Harem Pants - $79.95</p></div>
<p>Prints are not normally my thing, but for some reason these pants really appeal to me. I also like the styling; I haven&#8217;t bought anything from MySize since I was a teenager with limited options, but it looks like they&#8217;re really stepping up their game.</p>
<div id="attachment_213" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 278px"><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eastwest-platform-crisscross-sandals.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-213  " title="eastwest platform crisscross sandals" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eastwest-platform-crisscross-sandals.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">eastwest Platform Crisscross Sandals - $40.00</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find a pair of flat platform sandals for a while, and these look pretty fab. I don&#8217;t do well in heels so I might consider these for summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_214" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/il_570xN.251190983.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-214" title="il_570xN.251190983" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/il_570xN.251190983-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Authentic French Crate Cat Bed from caeauxdecatherine - €79,99</p></div>
<p>Okay now this is just super cute!</p>
<div id="attachment_215" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75663761/big-bad-red-cloak-with-hood-and-fur-trim"><img class="size-medium wp-image-215" title="Big Bad Red Cloak from LeahMayShop" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Big-Bad-Red-Cloak-from-LeahMayShop-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big Bad Red Cloak from LeahMayShop</p></div>
<p>Totally bad-ass cape that I would wear <em>all of the time</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_217" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/59081012/la-revolucion-jodhpurs-custom-made-in"><img class="size-medium wp-image-217" title="La Revolucion Jodhpurs by idolatre" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/La-Revolucion-Jodhpurs-by-idolatre-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">La Revolucion Jodhpurs by Idolatre - $92.00</p></div>
<p>Again, really not what I would normally pick out, but there&#8217;s something wicked and Tank Girl about these pants. I would wear them with a sheer black blouse, some chunky rings and knee-high strappy gladiator sandals. Unfortunately hipsters don&#8217;t work on me always but so help me, I would make them work.</p>
<div id="attachment_218" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><a href="http://cooleastmarket.com/collections/frontpage/products/shatter-pattern-jikatabi-socks-set"><img class="size-full wp-image-218" title="pair_boardwalk_jika_jpg_large" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pair_boardwalk_jika_jpg_large.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shatter Print Jikatabi from Cool East Market - $29.99</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been looking into more bare foot-style shoes because I find them way more comfortable to walk in. Jikatabi have a split toe for better agility and nice flat soles. These printed ones remind me of the MySize pants and are very reasonably priced. Cool East Market has hand-dyed jikatabi in all different colours of the rainbow.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s enough for now, before I make myself too sad! But thankfully I have my packages to wait for in the meantime~</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is what I wore last night to a friend&#8217;s house to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice">Liar Dice</a> (which is great fun but I&#8217;m quite bad at it). Also I will write a bit about why exactly I&#8217;m blogging again. There are photos of cats as well (result!).</p>
<p><span id="more-199"></span></p>
<p>It features my new Chicstar velvet jacket, which is <a href="http://chicstar.com/storefront/listproducts.aspx?Plus-Size-Gothic-Lace-Corset-Velvet-Jacket&amp;id=7322">still on the site</a>. I actually found it at an op shop and couldn&#8217;t resist. That was a good op shop day actually, I think there must have been a whole wardrobe of clothes donated by some wonderful person. There were a lot of designer and high street clothes around my size. I picked up this jacket, a nice blue blouse for work, the skirt from my last post, and a shirt for Joss from Industrie or some brand like that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite pleased with the quality of the jacket. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been worn. The velvet is lovely and soft, it&#8217;s fully linked, and the lace isn&#8217;t scratchy at all. I&#8217;m thinking about removing the lace from the sleeves as it makes them slightly too long, and I&#8217;m unsure about the corset back. It&#8217;s a little more goth than I&#8217;ve worn lately! But I wore it with jeans and a tee on Friday and it looked great. It hits right at my waist and doesn&#8217;t gape open too much over my chest like some blazers do.</p>
<p><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/p20110717-010803.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-203" title="p20110717-010803" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/p20110717-010803-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The top is from Sussan, it&#8217;s actually only a size 10. It&#8217;s a boxy cut that you can adjust with drawstrings just under the bust. Fits fine really; I don&#8217;t think I would wear it any bigger as the V-neck would be too low.</p>
<p>The skirt is a City Chic vinyl inset one that I picked up for $15 in the sales a few weeks ago. It&#8217;s nicely comfy and high-waisted. It does feel like it&#8217;s riding up at times but when I go to adjust it, it actually isn&#8217;t. It also is really noisy to wear because of the vinyl. But it&#8217;s fun and sexy.</p>
<p>The tights are also new. I just received my order from <a href="http://welovecolors.com/">We Love Colors</a> on Friday, only 2 weeks after I placed it! They&#8217;re rad. My faggy friends liked them and I&#8217;ll definitely be wearing them whenever I feel confident enough to do so. I also picked up a pair in red, rubine and black. I have a pair in grey, black and purple already but they&#8217;re getting old. They have a few holes around the crotch but that tends to happen in all my tights. I saw one suggestion to cut off the panty area, then attach the legs to a pair of undies or similar, which I might do!</p>
<p>My boots are super old but comfy and sturdy, despite the duct-tape repairs that have been necessary over the years. The necklace is one that I assembled from various bits and bobs from Spotlight, it&#8217;s a heavy-ish chain with a 3D jaguar in grey with black spots. My purple lipstick is by Innoxa and I think it was a cheapie from Myer.</p>

<p><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/p20110717-010849.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-201" title="p20110717-010849" src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/p20110717-010849-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The title of this post refers to my two little helpers which you can spot in some of the photos in this post. The cat is being shooed out of the third, and the dog is posing in the second. Obviously me standing still is quite interesting!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite glad that I&#8217;ve been able to post twice in one week. It&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve reached a conclusion about blogging and why I want to keep going with it. To start off with, I was blogging because I read a lot of blogs and I thought the people who wrote them were really cool; I wanted other people to read mine, compliment my outfits, give me an ego boost&#8230;</p>
<p>That sort of trailed off when I realised that few people were actually reading what I was writing, so it felt a little pointless. But I continued reading other people&#8217;s blogs, like <a href="http://www.definatalie.com/">Definatalie</a> and <a href="http://blog.twowholecakes.com/">Two Whole Cakes</a>, and I realised that for me, blogging is never going to be about a popularity contest. For one, I&#8217;m not a slim, wealthy, conventionally pretty woman with lots of free time and a keen photographer friend. But what I am is smart, funny and occasionally confident. I have the privilege of the writing skills and resources to be able to say things &#8211; about bodies, social justice, animals, anything I like.</p>
<p>As a fat blogger, I am making my body visible in a world where often, we&#8217;re told to be invisible. Even if I don&#8217;t post a wordy social commentary piece, my pictures speak loudly, saying that I&#8217;m not afraid to show myself. I gladly open myself up for ridicule or applause because I refuse to be invisible. If people don&#8217;t like what they see, that&#8217;s their problem, not mine. And I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve realised that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met my Trixie Pixie in October 2010. I went to Stirling Pound to look at a bulldog, who I thought might get on with Gary and keep him company. He was too big and too in his face, so the introduction went badly; Benson barked, and Gary hid. (Benson is in rescue with the <a href="http://www.animalprotectionsociety.org.au/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=3&amp;category_id=2&amp;Itemid=23">Animal Protection Society</a>, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll find a great home for his retirement.)</p>
<p>The ranger had another few dogs that he showed us, but none clicked. Then he brought out a tiny old girl with huge bat ears, set her down, and Gary immediately stood over her as if to say, <em>Oh, this one suits. I&#8217;ll take care of her.</em></p>
<p><em><span id="more-187"></span><br />
</em></p>
<p>We took her home, and found that as well as being blind, she was mostly deaf, and &#8216;selectively&#8217; deaf the rest of the time. She had bad arthritis, and walked with her back hunched and most of her weight on her front legs, because the back ones hurt too much.</p>
<p>With some good food and some love, she started to come out of her shell. She learned a mental map of the backyard, and could trot around at her version of full speed, brushing her ear on this chair or that pot to reassure herself of her location. Chicken necks and cheap supermarket dog-meat rolls were her favourite foods, and she would snatch them from your hand as soon as the smell wafted under her nose, earning her an affectionate nickname; &#8220;The Shark&#8221;.</p>
<p>She loved to walk around the park, sniffing all the smells, stumbling slightly when she came to a curb and on one occasion, almost falling into the lake. Gary would be at her side, always checking back with her, sniffing what she sniffed.</p>
<p>The winter came, and it was hard on her. Her arthritis became even more prominent, and she would whine for hours in her bed, unable to get to sleep at night. She rarely sat down, for this hurt more than walking, and she went off her food. Her teeth were so bad that she couldn&#8217;t have dry food, and the dog roll gave her intermittent kidney trouble. She started to become incontinent, and would try to hide her accidents after waking up to find them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she would sit on your lap, but mostly she struggled to get down and keep walking.</p>
<p>This week, she ate like a queen. She had salmon, beef mince, oats, dog roll; to hell with it, at least she was eating. On Monday I left work early, and came home, and she slept on my lap more quietly than she ever has before.</p>
<p>Today, we went to the park. She ate raw mince and walked, and sniffed all the smells she fancied, and didn&#8217;t fall in the lake.</p>
<p>And later, we went to the vet, and she sat on a clean towel, and we held her as she slipped into the world of painless dreams.</p>
<p>Goodbye, my little old dog. We were lucky to know you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a few quick outfit photos before I forget to post them.</p>
<p>I started a new job a few weeks ago, which is turning out quite well. The work itself is fairly mindless, but it is nowhere near as stressful as my old call-centre job. By the end of it, I was dreading going to work at that place every day, so this makes a nice change.</p>
<p>After a year or so of trying to incorporate more colour into my wardrobe, I&#8217;m falling back into the &#8216;all black&#8217; world. Once a goth, always a goth! Even so, there are some colourful pieces that I still like to wear, and the accent jewellery is getting a work-out too.<br />
<span id="more-179"></span><br />
Also, I got a haircut. It&#8217;s an asymmetrical deal with long fringe/side bits, swept up from the back, and shorter in back. I was hoping for a <a href="http://www.definatalie.com">Natalie</a> style do, and I&#8217;m still considering getting it shorter in the back. This works fine for work though, and I have been enjoying being able to tease up the long bits and zhuzh them into a fantastical tall hairdo for going out.</p>
<div id="attachment_183" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 180px"><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P14-04-11_15.1101-e1303476938850.jpg"><img src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P14-04-11_15.1101-e1303476938850-170x300.jpg" alt="" title="14.04.11 " width="170" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All black.</p></div>

<p>I love this shirt. It&#8217;s extremely soft and fits me perfectly. The only problem with it? The button-holes were too large, so it kept popping open. I fixed that in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Cardigan: Jay-Jays size XL<br />
Velvet shirt: Op shop, no size<br />
Pleated satin skirt: Target, size 16, worn high waisted<br />
Leggings: Best &#038; Less size 20<br />
Amethyst necklace: Made by me</p>

<p>Favourite pants from Yours Clothing. I&#8217;m even considering getting another pair. They&#8217;re still available on extra super sale <a href="http://www.yoursclothing.co.uk/P/Black_Wide_Waistband_Peg_Leg_Trousers_31_Inch_Plus_Size_Fuller_Figure-%289243%29.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Cardigan: Marks &#038; Spencer size UK22, via op shop<br />
Grey top: Best &#038; Less size 22<br />
Peg leg trousers: Yours Clothing, UK28<br />
Necklace: Morgan Marks, gift from my mum</p>
<p>I wore my el cheapo Big W black flats with both of these outfits, unfortunately they&#8217;re falling apart but that&#8217;s to be expected I suppose. I&#8217;ve been wearing my big stompy boots instead.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day I&#8217;ll be able to persuade one of my boys (housemates&#8230;) to take my picture so I can get out of the bathroom.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to all who have purchased some of my jewellery, to help out with Gary&#8217;s operation costs.</p>
<p>He had his operation on Monday and is recovering well. When he went in, unfortunately the surgery was much more difficult than the vet thought it would be. He has arthritis developing in both rear knees, and needed the patella luxation corrected as well as a <a href="http://www.citybeachvet.com.au/Dog/Dog_ACL.htm">partial repair of his cruciate ligament</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-173"></span></p>
<p>He&#8217;ll be off his leg for around 8-12 weeks, and probably won&#8217;t be able to be as active as he has been in the past, the poor wee thing. He&#8217;ll be happier though, and hopefully pain free soon.</p>
<p>He has a massive bandage to keep his leg compressed and reduce movement.</p>
<p><a href="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P23-03-11_11.40.jpg"><img src="http://soprefontaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P23-03-11_11.40-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Gary Post-op" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-174" /></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s also on several different painkillers, which are making him a little bit spacey&#8230;</p>
