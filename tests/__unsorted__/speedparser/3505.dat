Much like the early 2000's blog rage, and more recently the social media craze ("if you're not on Facebook, you're nowhere!"), QR codes are popping up in our little industry like wildfire. They're starting to show up on labels, in ads, on shelf talkers, business cards, tasting room menus and more.&nbsp; <span></span><br /><br /><span></span>Here are two recent articles on how wineries are using these handy new promotional vehicles:<br /><br /><a title="" target="_blank" href="http://www.winebusiness.com/news/?go=getArticle&amp;dataid=90631">Wineries Connect with QR Codes</a><br /><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Wine Business Monthly</span> | August 2011</span><br />(note: excerpt only - full article in the August issue)<br /><a title="" target="_blank" href="http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/31892/smart-phone-qr-codes-enter-the-tasting-room/"><br /><span></span><span>Smart Phone QR Codes Enter the Tasting Room</span></a><br /><span><span style="font-style: italic;">North Bay Business Journal</span> | April 4th, 2011</span> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span><span>And, for those statistically-minded... here are a few online reports around customer usage of QR codes: </span><br /><span></span><br /><a title="" target="_blank" href="http://web.scanlife.com/us_en/trend-reports"><span>Mobile Barcode Trend Report, Q2 2011</span></a><br /><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Scan Life</span> | June 2011</span><br /><span></span><br /><a title="" target="_blank" href="http://mghus.com/blog/2011/03/23/breaking-qr-code-stats-revealed/"><span>Breaking: QR Codes Stats Revealed</span></a><br /><span><span style="font-style: italic;">The MGH Modern Marketing Blog</span> | March 23, 2011</span><br /><br />With  consumers rapidly adopting their use, and the early stage  excitement  around them, now is the time to take advantage of their  functionality.&nbsp; Ready to take the leap? Here are a few considerations to  keep in mind...<br /><span></span><br /><span>1) </span>QR codes are simply "a means to an end" -  to get the offline consumer you're reaching to an online place with more  information and to extend their engagement with your product, service or  brand.&nbsp; Once the QR code is activated, you've moved a consumer into queue to become your customer... and at this point, it's on you to capture or lose them. What you deliver in this next engagement is critical. Consider your content. Is it relevant? Is it unique? Does it "pay off" for the efforts to scan the code? Does it provide more information? Or does it just send your new (potential!) customer to your website with no direction?<br /><br /><span></span>2) With the rapid  usage of QR codes coming into play, many wine marketers are failing to  pay attention to the very BASIC of best practices in implementation. A great article on  ensuring the best user experience was recently run on <a style="" title="" target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/02/qr-code-mistakes/">Mashable</a>. In it, the author lists 5 very basic mistakes that can - and should - be easily avoided with your QR campaign. Read the article on Mashable.com - <a style="" title="" target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/02/qr-code-mistakes/">5 Big Mistakes to Avoid In Your QR Code Marketing Campaign</a>. <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>3) Finally, like any good marketing initiative, the basic marketing disciplines must also be applied: <br />* Understand your audience and their needs first.<br />* Aim to be relevant and meaningful to those needs, through your marketing and messaging. <br />* Be available where they can find you. <br />* As with any social vehicle - aim to engage. Don't just push. Aim for them to pull you in to them.<br />* Don't neglect the call to action - give them a "next step" to take.<br /><br /><span></span>Still want to know more about QR codes, how they work and what they are?

And, typically, that CRM is silo&rsquo;d in distinct purchasing channels; a POS system in the tasting room, an ecommerce platform, a call center management application. Unfortunately, the data typically captured in each of these is unique to its own discipline or need, which therefore makes the data pushed out from these systems just as unique. Customers are certainly able to interact with a brand across multiple channels &ndash; purchasing online, then calling customer service with an inquiry, and perhaps visiting a tasting room the next month &ndash; so by keeping the various platforms silo&rsquo;d, we never get a true 360degree view of an individual customers&rsquo; behavior. <br /><br />  CRM is typically also considered solely a marketing concern &ndash; or it is used to describe the technology platform utilized by marketing to manage customer data. However when managed holistically within a company or for a brand, its application can and should provide critical input into sales &amp; outreach efforts, customer service, product development and so much more. <br />  </div><hr  style=" clear: both; visibility: hidden; width: 100%; "></hr><span  style=" float: right; z-index: 10; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/7172520.jpg?207" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"> <font size="3">So what is CRM? </font><br />CRM is the discipline of managing and nurturing a brands&rsquo; relationship with its customers.

It's important at this step to define the list of questions you&rsquo;d like to ask and customer behaviors that you'd like to better understand in order to improve your relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By defining both of these in advance, you can then define the types of data you will need to capture. <br /><br />For instance, if you want to know if customers are responding to certain marketing efforts you&rsquo;re undertaking, it will be important to assign the marketing execution information to the customer record; <em style="">Jim White received a direct mailer on July 2nd. He made a purchase through the website on July 8th, buying the product that was promoted in the mailer He called the contact center on July 10th and placed a second order of the item on promotion as a gift .</em> Data fields critical to capture for the above scenario include: all customer information, shipping information (identifying a different recipient), marketing source code (the mailer), order information (what was purchased, at what price point/promotion, date/s purchased), and channels purchased through (contact center, ecommerce). <br /><br />  <font size="2"><strong style="">Step 2: Data Capture</strong></font><br />It is at this critical step that most CRM efforts fail. And sadly, this is typically the step at which most wineries are stuck. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Knowing which data points to capture (per the above) is critical, but getting staff to ask customers where they heard about a promotion, or if they would like to provide an email address during a busy day can be a challenge. Establishing &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; and a discipline for data capture is mandatory.  Some wineries are incentivizing their staff to capture complete data &ndash;  pizza parties at the end of the day for meeting email name capture  goals, bottles of wine for exceeding goals. Do you know where your data capture discipline stands? <ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;"><span style="">C</span></span>onsider your data capture rates &ndash; do you know what percent of your tasting room traffic is joining your email list? Or what percent of your contact center calls are being tracked by individual customer? </li><li>Consider your existing data &ndash; how complete is it? Take a look at your email list. What information do you have about those customers &ndash; likely only the email address. Do you have first and last name? How about address &ndash; or a Zip Code to allow for geo-graphical targeting? </li></ul><font size="2"><strong style="">Step 3: Learn</strong></font><br />At this step, the rubber hits the road. With the now complete information that you have captured, it&rsquo;s time to start asking questions. Consistent evaluation and reporting on customer behavior across all channels, in response to all marketing initiatives, and through defined time frames will allow you to learn about both general and individual customer behaviors &ndash; and most importantly - respond to their needs and reward desired behaviors (step 4). Take a look at the regular reports that your teams are generating regarding customer behavior. What else could you ask. Is there cross over behavior between different purchasing channels? Are there improvements you can make? <br /><br />  <font size="2"><strong style="">Step 4: Apply</strong></font><br />With robust customer behavior data and the knowledge of which behaviors you want to reward, smart marketers can now segment and target their customer in marketing initiatives and refine customer support strategies based on those identified behaviors; all the way down to the personalized level. In addition, by profiling&nbsp; "best customers" or desired customer segments, you should now be able to inform and develop new products and programs to better meet the needs of customers. At this step, you can begin to test assumptions and new strategies, learn from the results, and refine your overall efforts. <br /><br />  <font size="2"><strong style="">Step 5: Predict</strong></font><br />Another step which is often missed is the use of these customer and purchase behavior insights to find trends across demographic, psycho-graphic, geographic, purchasing (RFM) and other data profiling baselines. Once recognized, the information can be used to "predict" potential new customer profiles and behaviors and better inform the tasks necessary to bring those customers in; whether purchasing consumer lists, deciding which publications to use to reach your audience, identifying appropriate events to participate in, or simply to find new potential customers in your own database.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br />  </div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr><span  style=" position: relative; z-index: 10; float: right; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/3390388.jpg?227" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"> <font size="3">The benefits to implementing a true CRM discipline are plenty </font><br />  <ul><li style="">Improved service, loyalty,      and retention</li><li style="">Higher sales productivity</li><li style="">Increased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">market      share</span></a></li><li style="">Added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-selling"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">cross-selling</span></a>      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up-selling"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">up-selling</span></a>      opportunities</li><li style="">Streamlined sales and      marketing processes</li><li style="">Increased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_center"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">call      center</span></a> efficiency</li><li style="">Higher close rates</li><li style="">Better profiling and      targeting</li><li style="">Reduced expenses</li><li style="">Higher overall profitability</li></ul>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winebusiness.com/">Wine Business Monthly</a> recently published an article (July 2010) evaluating several of the available systems which wine suppliers are using to perform CRM strategies.&nbsp; A consistent themes throughout the article &ndash; coming directly from those who are either responsible for their own CRM or for helping clients implement CRM - is the idea that CRM is a <em style="">discipline</em> &ndash; not just a set of software tools or basic marketing executions. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>That said, however, there are several who provide CRM-based tools.

Think ahead to the questions you&rsquo;d like to ask about your customers. Does the data captured in your system/s allow you to find that answer? If not, how can you adapt your processes or systems to allow you to capture that information? Do you know what percent of your database is &ldquo;actionable&rdquo;? Meaning, is the data complete enough to use?

Are staff members aware of the need or benefit to capturing complete information? Are they actively asking customers for complete information? Are they entering the data into the system/s on a timely basis? Monitor your customer information capture rates. At the most basic level, define what percent of your customers are joining your mailing list after visiting the tasting room and work with your team to increase that percentage!<br /><br />  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="">4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>From a customer perspective &ndash; are you still mass marketing to both aquire and retain your customers?

What can you learn about your top tier of customers to inform strategies to move the second tier up?<br />&nbsp;  <br />  For CRM to be truly effective, an organization must understand not only how CRM can benefit it, but also how its discipline must be adopted and championed throughout &ndash; not just within a marketing or technology department.&nbsp; <br />  </div><hr  style=" clear: both; visibility: hidden; width: 100%; "></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are your DTC and DTT strategies working together?]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/06/are-your-dtc-and-dtt-strategies-working-together.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/06/are-your-dtc-and-dtt-strategies-working-together.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2010 08:27:03 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/06/are-your-dtc-and-dtt-strategies-working-together.html</guid><description><![CDATA[ [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span  style=" z-index: 10; float: left; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/832149.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml">     <font size="1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The following is a  guest post by Mitch Schwartz, consultant to the wine industry focused  specifically on helping small to mid-sized wineries increase their  distribution through Direct to Trade channel sales initiatives.</span></font><br /><br />Much has been written about the consolidation of the middle tier &ndash;distributors - in the three tier system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The continued consolidation within the middle tier has led to fewer opportunities for wine brands, especially smaller boutique brands, to gain representation in the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In response to this narrowing of the playing field, many wineries have pursued two strategies to build their brand awareness and grow their distribution; 1) increase the size of their Direct to Consumer (DTC) sales, and 2) for some, pursue a Direct to Trade (DTT) initiative. <br /><br />  Addressing the later specifically, DTT sales can be a tough path to hoe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many wineries have successfully built a DTT business in their home state, but they do not have the bandwidth, sales skills, or contacts to pursue this strategy in additional markets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly there are obstacles to selling direct out of state, but a handful of wineries are solving this puzzle as we speak, and out of necessity, more and more are leaping into the fray.<br /><br />  In order to fully leverage the possibilities of both DTC and DTT initiatives, a winery should see them as a single strategy, supporting each other.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are opportunities to use the knowledge gained through each initiative, the relationships with both consumer and trade accounts on your list, and to leverage the possibilities made available through each to build momentum and drive more sales overall. What do I mean by this? Well, here are just a couple of ideas for doing so: <br /><br />  I know one winery that sells to the trade through their DTT initiative exclusively - no distributors. They attend as many consumer events around the country as they have the time and budget to support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when doing a consumer tasting, and the consumer asks where to purchase their wine locally, they don&rsquo;t direct them to their website; instead, they provide the consumer with a list of local retail accounts (often only two or three) and restaurants where they can purchase their wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in turn, creates pull for the retailer, who becomes more inclined to both carry the brand and recommend it to their additional customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winery still maintains contact information for the consumer, adds them to their mailing list and markets relevant information to them (winemaker dinners in their local market, consumer events they will be pouring at, and even online purchase offers on their website).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winery believes that the best customer is one who purchases their wines through multiple channels; both direct and through their trade partners. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />  Another idea for consideration is to use your mailing list, or allocation membership list, to encourage incremental and new trade placements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose you contacted your mailing list and asked for suggestions on favorite restaurant/s, more specifically those in which they&rsquo;d like to see your wine made available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this information, a winery could contact the restaurant directly, and use this data to not only encourage the restaurant to consider your wine (at minimum), but perhaps to offer to host a winemaker dinner or more. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>With enough club or mailing list members in a specific market, the dinner could be &ldquo;Invite Only&rdquo; for your members and a guest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winery should encourage the restaurant to add your wine to their list, and your guests would be given the opportunity to move to the front of your waiting list (if using an allocation list).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possibilities are yours to create and execute. <br /><br />In an economy in which restaurants are seeing lower than expected seatings, with a trade down in wine consumption, and in which wineries are looking to actively increase their sales, as well, why not bring the two channels together to help encourage growth and sales on both sides. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>By combining your DTC and DTT strategies into one, your chance of success can only increase.<br /><br />  </div><hr  style=" clear: both; width: 100%; visibility: hidden; "></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A loyalty program you'll want to stick with...]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/04/post-title-click-and-type-to-edit.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/04/post-title-click-and-type-to-edit.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 23:28:02 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/04/post-title-click-and-type-to-edit.html</guid><description><![CDATA[According to a  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span  style=" float: left; z-index: 10; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/7432892.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/news/pr/2010/012510.asp">recent study by  the CMO Council</a>, 54% of loyalty &amp; rewards program members are thinking of leaving their programs or even defecting from those brands  altogether due to the barrage of irrelevant  messages, low value rewards, and impersonal engagements they received from the programs (for a copy of the full report, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/resources/form_leading_loyalty.asp">visit  here</a>). </div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; "><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_editdata.mso">  Wow! The programs which those brands set up specifically to create loyalty are actually causing the exact opposite behavior: defection?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><br /><br />  The study maintains that companies are using the programs to deliver general discounts, savings, and perks to an aggregated mass of loyalty program members, ignoring the actual insights into each individual customers&rsquo; behavior which could help provide more relevant, targeted and meaningful communications and drive to the ultimate goal: capturing both mind and wallet share.<br /><br />  The necessity and value of implementing a direct marketing discipline of data analytics to inform 1:1 communication and marketing opportunities in the exact type of program which begs for it (a &ldquo;LOYALTY&rdquo; program!) can&rsquo;t be emphasized enough &ndash; or demonstrated more prominently than with these statistics. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />  So what are those companies doing with their loyalty programs? Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of how companies are actually using the data gathered. Bottom line is that only half of the brands leveraging loyalty and rewards programs are actually using the data to improve their sales, increase consumer brand affinity and create even deeper loyalties with their customers. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><br /></div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/3945044.png?300" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div></div></div><span  style=" z-index: 10; position: relative; float: left; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/5569869.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><span style=""><br />  In the wine industry, our version of a loyalty program is the Wine Club. Wineries use their clubs to bring customers closer to the  brand and purchase on a more frequent basis. On-going and consistent revenue  for the winery is a wonderful thing. Our shipments allow us to bring products  into the customers home on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis &ndash; keeping us top  of mind perhaps, encouraging repeat purchases off the shipment (&ldquo;<span style="font-style: italic;">Love the Pinot  in this shipment? Buy more now for an additional x% off!</span>&rdquo;), encouraging  purchases of our products in traditional channels and - at the very top of the  customer pyramid - creating loyal ambassadors who will help spread our brand across the  globe. <br /><br />  Wineries, of course, hope to continue to build their wine club programs &ndash; adding members at a rate that exceeds the number of  members who leave. Events are held for club members to encourage their continued membership; promotions are offered to encourage incremental purchases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are all wonderful &ldquo;perks&rdquo; and drive a relationship with the customer for the standard 12-, 16-, 21-month wine  club membership. Customers typically join wine clubs after a great experience  in the tasting room, hoping to bring a little bit of that out of home  experience back home with them. <br /><br />  The discipline of managing a wine club is pretty standard: set up your release or club shipment programs, balance the costs of the  wines to ship with that defined in the program, print a newsletter with  accompanying information, recipes, events, etc., and ship to everyone on the list.  Fingers crossed the list grew since the last shipment went out the door. <br /><br />  Done. <br /><br />  No wonder members leave the club over time. That bit of experience they brought home with them may slowly wear off, until  they&rsquo;re left with just wine coming in on a regular basis. If the wines are unique to  the club members, or limited edition, or released to club members earlier  than the general public, good. More reason to stay in. If there is a little something extra  in the box, or recipes in the newsletter, nice. But these tactics are product and brand focused, and not individual consumer-focused; delivering to the member relevant offers, products, engagement opportunities. <br /><br />How can you &ndash; wine club  manager &ndash; promote a deeper engagement with the individual  customer? How  can you use your customer and order data to better identify who those customers  are, and how they are interacting with your products to further that relationship  and extend its (potentially limited) timeframe? How can you avoid the same  kind of defection that&rsquo;s noted in the CMO Council survey?<br /><br />  First, you need a good database and the ability to get data and insight out of it. Second, you need to segment your customers into  behavioral buckets and then use that information to market to them!<br /><br />  Some sample segmentations, using traditional RFM tactics:<br />  </span><ul><li><span style="">Members who bought 3+ bottles of our Carneros Pinot Noir in the last 6 months</span></li><li><span style="">Members who purchased more than 6 times in the last 9 months</span></li><li><span style="">Members who spent over $250 in the last 12 months. </span></li></ul><span style="">  In addition, you might consider segmenting your members by their behavior across direct channels:<br />  </span><ul><li><span style="">Members who purchased from our tasting room AND our website in the last 3 months.</span></li><li><span style="">  Members who purchased from our tasting room more than 3x in the last 6 months.</span></li><li><span style="">  Members who purchased wine at winery events in the last 12 months.</span></li></ul><span style="">The information you will gain out of sample segmentations like the above should provide insight into whether or not you have a  viable segment to market new, exclusive or unique offers to. It should also  tell you if you have an untapped opportunity to perhaps form a new club, extend  more events to your members, or even create promotional offers at distinct  pricing or # of bottle thresh holds. It can also identify for you who your TOP 10-50-100 customers are, and give you the insight to market to them in an individually relevant and personal way; and as a result, lengthen your relationship and increase their engagement over time. <br /><br />  If you&rsquo;re in the business of creating a loyalty program and encouraging long term relationships with those members, it&rsquo;s critical  you find, manage and LEVERAGE a customer database to its fullest. Any loyalty or direct marketing program is only as good as the insight you glean from your data, and use of that insight to create long term relationships with your customers.<br /></span></div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Power Combo: Keys to Success]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/the-power-combo-keys-to-success.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/the-power-combo-keys-to-success.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2010 22:34:12 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/the-power-combo-keys-to-success.html</guid><description><![CDATA[In a recent  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span  style=" float: left; z-index: 10; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/2938619.jpg?174" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><span style="">In a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wineindustrysaleseducation.com/">WISE Academy</a> class, we had an opportunity to  discuss the distinctions between knowledge and skill, and the importance  of mastering both to truly excel in a specific profession. The  point of the discussion was to identify the distinction between both,  and talk about ways in which each of us can increase one or both to make  us individually more successful in whatever our endeavor. </span><br /><br />   <span style="">It got me thinking personally about my own efforts to  achieve pure blissful perfection in my own daily life and profession. I quickly came to  the conclusion that 1) I&rsquo;ll never achieve pure blissful perfection, and  2) that there are actually two more critical elements necessary to  bringing great success to our efforts.

Nor do I believe there needs to be a pure balance in weighting for each element. In fact, I actually think that different weightings may be applicable for different career paths, or different life stages; and that success can be had for those distinct stages without balanced weighting. </span><br /><br />  <span style="">For instance:</span><ul><li><span style="">Some people are just insanely passionate about what they do. And that passion is entirely infectious &ndash; to the point that people begin to follow those people and a sense of fame or &lsquo;success&rsquo; comes with that following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><a target="_blank" href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Take Gary V.</a></span></li><li><span style="">Or, some people have absolutely mastered a certain skill and while they clearly have passion behind their practice, the skill is what drives their success. Take <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIqVvRh_cEY">Jashaun Agosto</a>.</span></li><li><span style="">Or, some people simply own the world with their amazing depth of knowledge in specific or focused areas. Take <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/">Steven Hawking</a>.&nbsp; </span></li></ul>  <span style=""><br />Now, none of the above examples demonstrate that any of the people mentioned lack the other 3 key elements identified. I simply mean to imply that there may be a different weighting of one element over another and they each &ndash; no doubt &ndash; worked hard in their endeavors to bring the other 3 elements into the fold. </span><br /><br />  <span style="">Think about it in terms of your own position or career path, or life stage. Success &ndash; no matter how you define it for yourself &ndash; seems to be achieved most effectively with these 4 primary elements. If you want to achieve greater success &ndash; no matter what your definition &ndash; it&rsquo;s worth looking at each of these and identifying how you might be able to elevate one, two or each of them... <br /><br />Or perhaps it's time to consider a change. </span><br />  </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Email Subject Lines | Lost Art or Simple Science?]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/email-subject-lines-lost-art-or-simple-science.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/email-subject-lines-lost-art-or-simple-science.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2010 21:06:24 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/03/email-subject-lines-lost-art-or-simple-science.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Email is an effective means of communication with you [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span  style=" position: relative; float: left; z-index: 10; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/9859176.png" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">Email is an effective means of communication with your customers, and one that &ndash; when managed appropriately &ndash; can help bring cost efficient and effective results. But there&rsquo;s one element we don&rsquo;t generally spend a lot of time on &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the Subject Line.<br /><br /> The Subject Line is the introduction to your email that appears in the in-box of your email recipient, and &ndash; much like a billboard as you&rsquo;re cruising down the highway &ndash; has about a 3 second chance of convincing the recipient to take action &ndash; specifically to <strong>Open the Email</strong>.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s worth paying attention to. Subject Lines represent one of those often-ignored marketing levers that can greatly influence ROI. We all do it: spend time, money and effort in the planning, designing, and manipulating of the body of an email marketing release, and then casually throw a Subject Line up during testing &ndash; the point when we&rsquo;re reminded we need to add it.</div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; ">In reality, your Subject Line can be as impactful as the body of the email. It&rsquo;s important that you put some time and thought into the development of the Subject Line. Case in point:<br /><ul><li>Use specific spam-filter unfriendly words and your message won&rsquo;t be delivered.</li><li> Use exclamation points and excessive capitalizations and your message will be ignored as spam, or even caught by spam-filters before it&rsquo;s delivered.</li><li>Use a Subject Line that has nothing to do with the content of your email &ndash; and risk confusing your audience &ndash; or worse yet, leaving them feeling deceived.</li><li>Use a Subject Line that&rsquo;s irrelevant or flat, and your message is ignored.</li></ul>On the flip side, when used effectively, Subject Lines can have great impact on driving Open Rates up &ndash; your primary objective when setting a Subject Line. Some techniques to think about when setting yours:<br /><ul><li>Be Direct &ndash; Tell your recipient what you want them to act on.</li><li>Connect the Subject Line with the promotional messaging in the body of your email.</li><li>Avoid capital letters (no SCREAMING!).</li><li>Avoid excessive exclamations or punctuations.</li><li>Keep number of words limited: Let your recipient see the full Subject Line in their in-box.</li><li> It&rsquo;s not mandatory that you include your brand name in the Subject Line. Consider and use appropriately.</li></ul>Some examples that I&rsquo;ve received recently which represent the above strategies:<ul><li><strong>Great for Giving: Monogrammed Gifts</strong> (William-Sonoma)</li><li><strong>Last Chance &ndash; Only One Day Left to Save</strong> (Cellar 360)</li><li><strong>Gift Ideas for Wine Lovers</strong> (In Wine Country)</li><li><strong>15% Off Personalized Wine Gifts - 4 Days Only</strong> (Windsor Vineyards)</li><li><strong>Just Arrived: Perfect Holiday White, 91 WS under 11 bucks</strong> (Wine Library)</li><li><strong>Free Shipping.

Thanks to IBG for the repost rights.</span></font><br /><br />Found an interesting chart today on <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/">marketingcharts.com</a> defining the top online retailers by conversion rate.&nbsp; This&nbsp;chart shows the&nbsp;total percentage of visitors to a website who completed a transaction&nbsp;during their visit&nbsp;in the critical December timeperiod. All I can say is &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;. Check this out:<br /></div><span  style=" z-index: 10; float: left; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/2852413.gif?316" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">First, to refresh any memories, a website conversion rate is the <em>percentage of visitors to a website who took a desired action</em> &ndash; in this case, placed an order. So, from this info, it appears that nearly 30% of all visitors to <a href="http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/">thepopcornfactory.com</a> placed an order in December! It should also be noted that retailers only qualified for evaluation in this list if they had a minimum of 500k page views in a month. That&rsquo;s a lot of popcorn transacting across the web.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Again, wow.<br /><br /> I&rsquo;ve been in the direct, online business for many years now. I have certainly spent my share of time obsessing over my own conversion rates, and how to increase them. I&rsquo;ve hired agencies to help. I&rsquo;ve tested different variables to help encourage purchase. I&rsquo;ve implemented multiple promotional strategies (<strong>Free Shipping</strong>! <strong>50% off</strong>! <strong>Buy this NOW</strong>!). All paid off in different ways, and I&rsquo;ve felt relatively successful with my efforts, but never to the tune of 30%!<br /><br />I have a new personal goal.<br /></div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; ">So how do you improve your conversion rate?&nbsp; And what is it that&rsquo;s driving such high numbers for these sites? I think it&rsquo;s a number of factors &ndash; all of which must play together truly move the needle. Here are my 5 suggestions to start you along the path of improving your conversion rate:<br /><br /> <strong>1)&nbsp;Know where you come from.<br /> </strong>Do you know your own conversion rate? You better, if you want to improve it. Use Google Analytics or other analysis tools to define (and monitor) your conversion rate.<br /><br /> <strong>2)&nbsp;Grab a friend</strong><br /> Grab a friend who may be unfamiliar with the nuances of your website and ask them to help you &lsquo;experience&rsquo; your website. I suggest you ask them to do two exercises. And don&rsquo;t forget to watch the entire process. Literally, stand over them &ndash; and DO NOT coach them along!<br /> <ol><li> Ask them to visit your homepage and experience your site. Don&rsquo;t tell them to shop. Don&rsquo;t tell them to read. Just see what they do. We&rsquo;ve talked a lot with our clients about the importance of having an easy and intuitive navigational path for our clients (see an earlier post by Ben Chinn, our Director of Web Design &amp; Development: <a href="http://blog.inertiabev.com/index.php/2006/10/09/site-structure-and-navigation/">http://blog.inertiabev.com/index.php/2006/10/09/site-structure-and-navigation/</a>), as well as the importance of asking for what you want with headlines and &lsquo;Calls-to-Action&rsquo; on the part of the visitor. Both of these efforts can have the desired effect of leading your visitor through your website &ndash; ideally to YOUR desired end. Did your friend follow your desired path throughout your website? Did they &lsquo;see&rsquo; and act on the things you intend your visitors to? Or did they miss key messages entirely?</li><li><strong>A</strong>sk your friend to visit your website now with the goal of purchasing a specific product. Start them at your homepage, and watch the path to purchase. Did they get lost? Struggle to find the right page that the product would be on? Did they find the product and the &lsquo;buy now&rsquo; button with the minimal number of clicks? Ask them what information they would want to see in order to make that purchase (price, label, tasting notes, reviews). Did they find what they needed? Did it take a few minutes or many minutes, and a lot of &lsquo;back button&rsquo; usage?</li></ol> <strong>3)&nbsp;Resolve to Test and Measure</strong><br /> It&rsquo;s ok to fail. Seriously. That&rsquo;s what testing and optimizing is all about. Set a plan for what you want to achieve (in this case, higher conversion rates), list all of the potential tactics for reaching that goal, and get started. There are a number of things you can test: headlines, promotions, graphics/images, positioning of information on a webpage, the order of your navigational links, etc. For each tactic tested, watch &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; results. Did things improve or get worse? If they got worse, great! You learned what doesn&rsquo;t resonate with your visitor. Another item off your list&hellip;<br /><br /> <strong>4)&nbsp;Take Baby Steps</strong><br /> Don&rsquo;t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Just because your conversion rates may be lower than you like, and the shopping experience of your &lsquo;friend&rsquo; was clunky, doesn&rsquo;t mean your entire site needs to be overhauled. Commit to taking baby steps to learning about improvements in your conversion rates. Implement small changes at a time, and measure their impact. Learn what helps your visitor along to purchase and what doesn&rsquo;t. And give yourself some time to learn. Commit to testing something over at least a week, if your visitor traffic is significant enough to give you &lsquo;usable&rsquo; data. If it takes a month to get a real read on results, then give it a month.<br /><br /> <strong>5)&nbsp;Be Relevant and Meaningful</strong><br /> Your visitor is going to engage with you, and continue to engage with you if you provide something relevant and meaningful to their needs. Think about your own online shopping experience. When you need something and a site has it, that&rsquo;s relevance. But when you make that relevant product or information entirely MEANINGFUL to them, you&rsquo;ve now started a relationship. How do you make things meaningful?<br /><ul><li> Watch how visitors move through your site. Which pages do they spend the most time on? This can give you an idea of the type of content your visitors are most interested in. Finding a lot of activity on your Recipe&rsquo;s page? Put it up front! Make it easier to find your Recipe pages, add a link to this page from relevant product pages.</li><li> Watch what visitors are purchasing. Likely the bulk of your sales are on products you&rsquo;re well known for, have greatest distribution on, and/or highlight the most on your website. But if a sleepy Zin that&rsquo;s getting no play on your homepage is actually selling fairly well, it&rsquo;s telling you to give it some presence. Try it out. Suggest to visitors that this is a &ldquo;Customer Favorite&rdquo;, and post any reviews that you can get from your customers on that product.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t forget about your follow up marketing, as well: Email. Once you know what people are purchasing, and where they are going on your website, send emails that demonstrate this. I buy a lot of products on Amazon.com. And, at least once a month I receive an email suggesting other relevant products. This makes my experience with Amazon more meaningful to me. I buy. They suggest. I like that.&nbsp;</li></ul>What are you doing to stimulate conversion rates? Have you &lsquo;experienced&rsquo; your website? Are you bringing something meaningful and relevant to your customers? Think of it this way: if your website was achieving a 15% conversion rate, what kind of sales would that translate to? Do the math. It's inspiring!<br /><br /> Again. Wow. <br /> 				</div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building Your Mailing List without a Tasting Room?]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/building-your-mailing-list-without-a-tasting-room.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/building-your-mailing-list-without-a-tasting-room.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2010 11:26:46 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/building-your-mailing-list-without-a-tasting-room.html</guid><description><![CDATA[The following was originally posted on the REThinkWine blog in Oct 2008.

The visitors that walk into the tasting room  immediately become customers or well-qualified prospects that can be  added to a winery&rsquo;s &ldquo;contact list&rdquo; for future outreach. But if you don&rsquo;t  have a tasting room, building a contact/customer list is a much more  daunting task. But if email marketing and online sales is part of your direct sales strategy,  then it&rsquo;s a task you must take up and address.<br /><br /> Here are just three creative strategies for building customer and contact  lists that have been successful for other wineries without tasting  rooms.&nbsp;<br /><br /> </div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr><span  style=" position: relative; z-index: 10; float: right; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/5180904.jpg?91" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><strong>1. Business Teaser Cards</strong>: A few wineries, when   printing business cards for all their employees, have used the back of   the card to&nbsp;offer the holder a 10% or even 20% discount on their first   purchase. Often each card has a code on it that buyers can use to assure   their online discount and to track who&rsquo;s business card led to the  sale.  It&rsquo;s a creative way to invite new acquaintances to the website  when  without the discount/invite you&rsquo;d only be handing out a business  card  with no call-to-action.<br /><br /> </div><hr  style=" width: 100%; clear: both; visibility: hidden; "></hr><span  style=" float: left; position: relative; z-index: 10; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/1616997.jpg?231" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><strong>2. Event Giveaways:</strong>&nbsp;One  Sonoma winery with no  tasting   room but with a guest house on their  property always brought a  sign   to the tastings they attended announcing  that following the tasting  a   drawing would take place for a weekend  getaway at the winery&rsquo;s guest    house. The sign carried beautiful  pictures of the guest house and the    property. All the attendees had to  do was drop their business card  in a   fishbowl or fill out a simple slip  of paper with name, state and   email.  Within a day of the tasting the  winery did their drawing,   contacted the  winner and set up when they  would visit. But more   importantly, the  winery would also contact via  email every single   person who entered the  drawing with a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;  message and an offer   of 15% on their first  purchase. Their list  continues to grow. <br /><br /><strong>3. Contests</strong>:&nbsp;A number of  wineries without tasting    rooms have found that contests are a fantastic  way to draw prospective    customers to their website. The best contests  should be easy to  enter,   but also give the entrants a&nbsp;feeling of  participation or  connect with   the winery, winemaker or&nbsp;brand. One  winery has used its  back label as  a  canvas for the contest by inviting  entrants to&nbsp;design  their own  100-word  back label on a specific subject.  The winner had  their entry  published  on the label when the wine&nbsp;was  bottled! The  contest&nbsp;was  announced with a  press release&nbsp;and an&nbsp;ad, and  the  winner&nbsp;was announced  on the website  and in a press   release.&nbsp;They&nbsp;received hundreds of  people visiting their  site to   participate, all providing their entry  of back label copy along  with   their e-mail address. The winery grew  their mailing list and  customers   were able to engage with the brand.  Win-Win.<br /><br /> Prospecting and   building your email contact list must  be an ongoing  project if   increasing online sales is part of your  marketing strategy.  If you   don&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;tasting&nbsp;room, you&rsquo;ll need to  think creatively. The  time   and effort that goes into a very creative  customer prospecting  program   will pay off in an enhanced email  list,&nbsp;and ultimately&nbsp;increased   sales.  </div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Call for Wine; Service Provider Overview]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/call-for-wine-service-provider-overview.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/call-for-wine-service-provider-overview.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2010 23:21:30 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/call-for-wine-service-provider-overview.html</guid><description><![CDATA[On the heels of a good telemarketing discussion in a recent WISE Academy session, as well as the blog we posted last week on tele-marketing, I had a chance to chat with Mark Parton, Founder &amp; President of  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; ">On the heels of a good telemarketing discussion in a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wineindustrysaleseducation.com/">WISE Academy</a> session, as well as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/2/post/2010/02/give-me-a-call-youve-got-my-digits.html">blog we posted last week on tele-marketing,</a> I had a chance to chat with Mark Parton, Founder &amp; President of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.callforwine.com/">Call for Wine</a>. For many small- to medium-sized wineries, the challenge isn't in having a good product to sell, or in having a good story to tell; it's in having enough TIME to make the connections with your customers and build a strong and trusting relationship. Call for Wine provides a solution for helping build those critical relationships through telephone outreach and conversation. <br /><br />Customers joined your mailing list because they are interested in learning more about your brand or products; they agreed to make a connection, or initiate a relationship. Telemarketing is a great way to nurture that relationship and help provide customers with the connection they're seeking. I enjoyed my conversation with Mark and thought it may be beneficial for others to learn a little about them, as well. <br /></div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/1312833.gif" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div></div></div><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; "><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"><link href="file:///C:%5CDOCUME%7E1%5CKRISTI%7E1.KTA%5CLOCALS%7E1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"><strong style="">WHO'S CALL FOR WINE?</strong><br /><br />  An outbound tele-marketing firm specifically for the wine industry. They've been in business for over 6 years, with 2 call center locations (Northern CA and AZ), and 45 &ldquo;seats&rdquo; -- or staffers -- actively calling on behalf of winery clients. Primarily servicing wineries in the Northern CA area, they are helping several well-known wineries grow their direct businesses. <br /><br />  The CFW staff is trained and educated in wine; they run on-going internal training sessions, as well as invite winery clients to come into their offices and train the sales staff on the brands and products they&rsquo;re helping bring to their customers. <br /> <br /> <strong style="">WHAT DO THEY DO?</strong><br /><br />  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outbound calling to customers on winery mailing lists</span><br />Call lists utilized are primarily purchasers from a winery&rsquo;s wine club, tasting room, online or event participation lists. CFW does not conduct cold calling. They recommend calling customers no more than 2-3x per year, in order to help nurture - and not overwhelm - the winery's relationship with that customer. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They will only sell a winery&rsquo;s wine to that winery&rsquo;s customer list; no cross-list sharing between clients or cold calling is conducted. <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Data hygiene</span><br />Cleaning up your customer contact list is critical. CFW helps by making the initial contact and confirming all phone, mailing and other information is correct. They <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication">de-dup </a>lists for basic clean up and conduct <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Change_Of_Address">NCOA processing</a>, two standard data hygiene practices that many businesses overlook. <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Data appending</span><br />In an initial customer outreach, CFW will ask for any missing email addresses or phone numbers to append to a winery's contact list; a valuable addition, as the cost to market online or by phone is considerably cheaper (and can be more valuable) than traditional direct mail outreach. <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Outbound operational contacts</span> <br />It's critical that wine club managers have up-to-date credit card information for all customers prior to running a club batch. CFW will contact customers with expired or declined credit cards and return updated and valid information for 40-60% of an invalid contact list.&nbsp; <br />        <strong style=""><br />WHAT ELSE DO THEY DO?<br /><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncover new sales opportunities for clients</span><br />By learning from their outreach and customer conversations, CFW is able to suggest to clients new and potentially effective campaigns that will help service their customers and sell more wine.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Work directly with service providers</span> like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amsretail.com/">AMS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nexternal.com/">Nexternal </a>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ewinerysolutions.com/">eWinery </a>to update winery customer and order information directly into a winery's existing database; critical for real-time customer views and consistency of data.</div><span  style=" z-index: 10; float: right; position: relative; "><a><img src="http://www.juiceboxdirect.com/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934884/2667286.png?171" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span><div  class="paragraph" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><strong style=""><br />WHAT RESULTS DO WINERY'S TYPICALLY SEE?</strong><br /><br />The chart on the right shows average statistics for CFW clients in 2009. <br /><br />For more information on Call for Wine, visit their website at <a href="http://www.callforwine.com/">www.callforwine.com</a> or call Mark Parton at 800.946.3705.         </div><hr  style=" visibility: hidden; clear: both; width: 100%; "></hr>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
