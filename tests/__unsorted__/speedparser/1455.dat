      <description>&lt;img src="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/35202974/300.jpg" title="Gabrielle Satchel in Khaki Organic Twill" align="left" style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;" /&gt;Free Shipping Within in USA

The perfect bag for the elegant bohemian who wants a signature accessory but likes to switch it up. The Gabrielle Satchel can be worn four different ways &#8211; satchel style, messenger style, shoulder bag style and as a backpack.  Grab the faux leather handle and tote your iPad or tablet-of-your-choice to work, sling it against your hip for a stylish commute, and pack all your essentials to carry backpack-style for a weekend away&#8230;or maybe for a bike ride with your main squeeze.  

Exterior made from supple organic twill, interior lined with striped ticking. Eco-friendly faux leather accents protect corners and flap against constant wear, which means no frayed edges - just a long-lasting bag with long-lasting cuteness.  Faux leather is inherently weather resistant, chemical free, durable and vegan.

Flap is held closed with two tongue clasps. A small pocket right under the flap gives easy access to things you need fast like a cell phone, metro card, or sunglasses. Four large pockets on the inside of the bag keep you from scrambling to find your everyday stuff, while a large zipper pocket on the back exterior wall keeps prized possessions (journal, passport, love letters&#8230;) close to you.  

When worn as a backpack, the Gabrielle Satchel is designed to fall comfortably mid-back.  You might even forget it&#8217;s there until someone asks where you got it!

16" at widest point, 9" deep, 3" across the bottom.

Spot Clean with mild soap or dry clean.

Worried about rains and stains, you might want to have a look at our &lt;a href="http://shop.pansymaiden.com/product/nikwax-waterproofing-treatment"&gt;waterproofing treatments&lt;/a&gt;

Good things come in threes, and the Coco Clutch is no exception. This sly little number can be worn as a mini-satchel, shoulder bag, or messenger-style.  One bag, three ways!  The perfect size for a day trip or concert, the Coco can easily fit the basics &#8211; phone, map, snacks, camera &#8211; but is small enough to keep from dragging you down.  Adjust the strap to fit and leave your hands free for snapping pictures or snapping to the beat.  The nautical braid detail, made from cotton piping, compliments both shoreline colors, Stone and Sea Mist.  

Exterior and strap made from a hemp/cotton blend.  The strap is removable and machine washable - a major plus, as we all know straps can use the occasional clean.  Interior made from a linen-like cotton ticking. Flap stays put with two magnetic snaps, keeping all your belongings snug and secure.

Eco-friendly faux leather accents, including the handle, protect the bag against daily wear, making the Coco durable and sustainable.  Faux leather does not contain any substances that contaminate the environment or pose potential toxicity after use.  It also happens to be vegan, weather resistant and buttery-soft.

11" at widest point, 5" deep, 2'" across bottom.

Spot Clean with mild soap or dry clean.

      <title>Petite Hobo in Eucalyptus Faux Leather - $135.00</title>

      <description>&lt;img src="http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/35200014/300.jpg" title="Petite Hobo in Eucalyptus Faux Leather" align="left" style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;" /&gt;Free Shipping Within The USA

The ultimate hobo, this chic, casual bag is a classic with one catch: the materials have been updated to reflect the smarts of the eco-conscious gal. Our supple, buttery-soft, and most importantly, eco-friendly faux leather comprises the outside of this bag. Our faux leather does not contain any substances that contaminate the environment or pose potential toxicity after use, and is both durable and lux. And, guess what? PVC free, of course!

Small and slouchy, the Petite Hobo&#8217;s laid-back crescent shape is deceptively roomy, with three interior pockets &#8211; including one large zipper pocket &#8211; for keeping your things organized and easy to find.  Adjust the strap on this shoulder or messenger bag for the perfect, comfy fit, then head out to wherever you&#8217;d like to look effortlessly elegant (i.e. everywhere.)  

The Petite Hobo has four stud snap-closures for easy access.
Interior and strap made from organic canvas.  The strap is removable and machine washable - a major plus, as we all know straps can use the occasional clean. 

14" at widest point, 5" deep, 4" across bottom.

Spot Clean with mild soap or dry clean.

On the outside, this bag is made with super lux, super ecofriendly Ultrasuede&#169; (made from 80% post-consumer materials, in this case, recycled plastic bottles!). On the inside you have organic canvas. This bag was made for the eco/boho-lass on the go. Not to mention that a bag with a loose, understated bow is cheeky and adorable. Sling it on for an instant, unfussy way to punch-up any outfit.  Whether you&#8217;re off to the museum, a night-out, or the farmer&#8217;s market, this versatile bag&#8217;s got you covered. 

Stash all your essentials in one of the four generous interior pockets; use the large zipper pocket on the back exterior wall for whatever you like to keep extra close at hand.  Bag shuts tight with a magnetic snap. Oh, and before we forget, Ultrasuede&#169; is machine washable, extremely durable, and very vegan.

Watch my &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/zmifeFupEnU"&gt;"What's In My Bag: Shake Sugaree" &lt;/a&gt; video to see this bag in action.

At last: A petite, feisty, perfect-sized clutch that looks as good with jeans as it does with that killer vintage dress you&#8217;ve been saving for just the right occasion. (You know the one.) The Utility&#8217;s faux leather band acts as a handle - just slip your hand through and carry it everywhere. Flap stays put with two magnetic snaps, keeping all your belongings snug and secure. One pocket under the flap is big enough for an iPhone, the other holds whatever little thing you can't live without (lipstick, powder, business cards, good luck charm&#8230;) 

About materials:
Faux leather handle makes this clutch easy to carry, and 100% animal (and PVC) free. Interior made with cotton ticking. Exterior made with organic twill, which is never genetically modified, and does not contain polluting agro-chemicals or harmful dyes.  This material is eco-conscious, tough, and super cute &#8211; kind of like some people we know. 

9 1/2" at widest point, 5 1/2" deep, 3/4 inch bottom.

Spot Clean with mild soap or dry clean.

      <title>Lady Day Shoulder Bag in Black Wave Hemp/Tencel - $65.00</title>
      <link>http://www.pansymaiden.bigcartel.com/product/lady-day-shoulder-bag</link>
      <guid>http://www.pansymaiden.bigcartel.com/product/lady-day-shoulder-bag</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2011 01:29:53 -0400</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/35195374/300.jpg" title="Lady Day Shoulder Bag in Black Wave Hemp/Tencel" align="left" style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;" /&gt;Free shipping within the USA

This bag is named for Billie Holiday; the offset ruffle was inspired by the gardenia she wore.  No fresh flowers to tuck behind your ear? No worries, the Lady Day plays the part.  The detachable/adjustable strap allows you to wear this bag three ways, as a shoulder bag, clutch, or across the body - perched against one hip this bag is jaunty, fem, and distinct.  Small enough to be delicate, this bag still carries everything you need, with two small inside pockets to organize the essentials.   Flap stays put with two magnetic snaps, keeping all your belongings snug and secure.  Made with a hemp/tencel blend and cotton, the Lady Day is ecofriendly, sustainable, and completely machine washable.   

The Materials:
The Lady Day ruffle is made with ultra-suede, a lux, durable, and vegan fabric made with 80% post-consumer recycled fibers (in other words, recycled bottles).  Like suede but way, way, way better.
	
Exterior made with hemp/tencel blend.  Hemp requires no pesticides, is one of the world&#8217;s strongest fibers, and ages gracefully (the more you wash it, the softer it gets).  Tencel is made using sustainable practices and is fully biodegradable.  Hemp tencel blend is eco-friendly, lux and long lasting. 

10" wide at widest point, 5 1/2" deep, 1 1/2" bottom.

The Lady Day ruffle is made with ultra-suede, a lux, durable, and vegan fabric made with 80% post-consumer recycled fibers (in other words, recycled bottles).  Like suede but way, way, way better.
	
Exterior made with hemp/tencel blend.  Hemp requires no pesticides, is one of the world&#8217;s strongest fibers, and ages gracefully (the more you wash it, the softer it gets).  Tencel is made using sustainable practices and is fully biodegradable.  Hemp tencel blend is eco-friendly, lux and long lasting. 

10" wide at widest point, 5 1/2" deep, 1 1/2" bottom.

Provides fast access to things I might need in case of an emergency. Like a notebook and pen to catch fleeting thoughts.

I'm not a messenger. Why would I need to carry a full-sized messenger bag every day? No. I need a bag that's easy to be around. What I need is a mini-messenger. I have decided that I don't always have to carry a big bag. Sometimes I just need a "daily basis" bag that will carry my pocketbook, keys, lunch, iPod, and cell phone.

Fits an iPad or similar sized-tablet perfectly!

I'm not a messenger. Why would I need to carry a full-sized messenger bag every day? No. I need a bag that's easy to be around. What I need is a mini-messenger. I have decided that I don't always have to carry a big bag. Sometimes I just need a "daily basis" bag that will carry my pocketbook, keys, lunch, iPod, and cell phone.

Fits an iPad or similar sized-tablet perfectly!

**NOW CLOSES WITH TWO MAGNETIC SNAPS--NO MORE VELCRO!"
After many customers told me of their distaste for Velcro, I now make this bag with 2 strong magnetic snaps.

FREE SHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES!

Finally! A proper Pansy Maiden messenger. Our Vagabond Messenger is vegan, organic, unisex and machine washable. It is made with a mandarin orange twill exterior and a butternut twill interior. The interfacing of the bag is a heavy-duty canvas so that the bag will keep its shape when your out and about, engaging in your vagabond ways. The inside compartment of the bag offers ample room for a 13" laptop and a few large books. The adjustable strap can be worn anywhere from 31" to  52" long!

Now let's talk pockets.

There are two pockets on each side of this bag with flaps closures sealed with Velcro. On the back of the bag, you'll find a large, water resistant zipper pocket that  fits an iPad (or other tablet of your choice) (11" x 8") perfectly. Once you lift the main flap (Velcro closure), you'll find a nice sized pocket on the front exterior wall that is perfect for your cell, keys, or subway pass (if you're a city vagabond like me). Once inside the bag, you'll notice four large pockets that will help you keep all those little items in your life nice an organized. Which in turn will make you a happy vagabond. So, all-in-all, this bag includes eight pockets!

Approximate Dimensions: 16" across the top, 14" across the bottom, 11" deep, 4" gusset, 4" wide (sides)

Because there are so many pockets and because this bag is machine washable, it would make a great diaper bag for a mom or a dad. Best of all, it doesn't scream, "I am carrying diaper rash cream!"

This bag is a part of my Little Birds Collection and therefore, a little lady-sized version exists in my shop (see last picture). You can find it by clicking on the "Little Bird's Collection" link in the right-hand side bar. 

All Pansy Maiden bags are made-to-order by one or two people in my home-based studio in Medford, MA. Please allow 2-3 week for construction and shipment of all Pansy Maiden bags.

Finally! A proper Pansy Maiden messenger. Our Vagabond Messenger is vegan, organic, unisex and machine washable. It is made with a mandarin orange twill exterior and a butternut twill interior. The interfacing of the bag is a heavy-duty canvas so that the bag will keep its shape when your out and about, engaging in your vagabond ways. The inside compartment of the bag offers ample room for a 13" laptop and a few large books. The adjustable strap can be worn anywhere from 31" to  52" long!

Now let's talk pockets.

There are two pockets on each side of this bag with flaps closures sealed with Velcro. On the back of the bag, you'll find a large, water resistant zipper pocket that  fits an iPad (or other tablet of your choice) (11" x 8") perfectly. Once you lift the main flap (Velcro closure), you'll find a nice sized pocket on the front exterior wall that is perfect for your cell, keys, or subway pass (if you're a city vagabond like me). Once inside the bag, you'll notice four large pockets that will help you keep all those little items in your life nice an organized. Which in turn will make you a happy vagabond. So, all-in-all, this bag includes eight pockets!

Approximate Dimensions: 16" across the top, 14" across the bottom, 11" deep, 4" gusset, 4" wide (sides)

I wanna shake sugaree. Doesn't that sound delightful? You can be the shake and I'll be the sugaree. We can take turns. We will go to that concert we've been talking about for weeks and tuck this bag right under our arms and shake it! I need only my pocketbook, phone, and keys. Maybe some powder to freshen my nose. And perhaps a stick of gum or two. OH, and maybe a hair brush too??? Nice to have that option. And people will look at us with wild, happy eyes and want to shake too. Shake Sugaree!

I wanna shake sugaree. Doesn't that sound delightful? You can be the shake and I'll be the sugaree. We can take turns. We will go to that concert we've been talking about for weeks and tuck this bag right under our arms and shake it! I need only my pocketbook, phone, and keys. Maybe some powder to freshen my nose. And perhaps a stick of gum or two. OH, and maybe a hair brush too??? Nice to have that option. And people will look at us with wild, happy eyes and want to shake too. Shake Sugaree!
