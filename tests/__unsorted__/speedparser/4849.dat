<p>I know that from the few regular readers I have around here, I might get some severe flack. And from all others who have probably written this site off as another one of those useless and uniformed vanity projects, I&#8217;ll probably get a &#8220;told you so&#8221;. Still, I&#8217;m not going to back down.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but if you have a larger collection of music, you might well have an imaginary section or two entitled &#8220;Perfect Dinner Music&#8221; or &#8220;Soft as Soft Can&#8221;. I do.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m about to tell you a few things about a CD that has been so severely criticized by just about every mainstream and dedicated critic that it&#8217;s almost become a point to ridicule said effort. It is certainly in the vain of the kind of criticism that I abhor; you know, the kind that simply can&#8217;t get off its high horse, the one that aims the most poisonous of arrows at someone who might have had simple passion driving him- or herself, even with commercial interest at heart.<span id="more-1799"></span>Not that I care.</p>
<p>Within my large collection I have a small (imaginary) section that holds what I would call &#8220;the perfect dinner CD&#8221;; a session that is so unobtrusive to be almost inaudible. The kind of session that is quietly lyrical; the kind of CD that simply doesn&#8217;t have a single moment to scare people off, the one that probably adheres to the simplest tastes and is accepted by even those ears that start screaming at a simple note that rises above all others.</p>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve written this introduction, it almost sounds like I am defending &#8220;Muzak&#8221;, elevator music or even the least of musical efforts. I&#8217;m not. And I don&#8217;t intend to. I&#8217;m just verbally trying to fend off those voices that think that Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane are the most stimulating artists to put on after a week of excruciating work, at dinner with the person(s) of your choice, in moments that simply don&#8217;t call for spectacular showman- and musicianship.</p>
<p>Yes, I like simple stuff.<br />
And Frank Chastenier&#8217;s &#8220;for you&#8221; (2004) is deceptively simple, soft-boiled and unobtrusive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always liked introspective people and musicians. Many of the ones I have taken a liking to these past decades, from Paul Desmond to Bill Evans, from little-known Carsten Dahl (Denmark) toÂ  Ed Thigpen, himself a master drummer of ballads and introspective playing, Tord Gustavsen, who is quite cerebral, and many others. Yes, the people I&#8217;m lobbing into one basket here are wildly different talents, but it is the basic vibe I got off them that has kept them at the forefront of my musical universe. It was that quiet, relaxed, knowledgeable and totally subdued playing that attracted me to their style(s) in the first place.</p>
<p>Frank Chastenier is not a world-renowned pianist. Although it is certainly a pity, I do not believe he is really known outside of German/European insider circles. Chastenier, who has been a member of perhaps the only really stellar big band we have to show for ourselves over here nowadays, the &#8220;WDR Bigband&#8221;, is also one of the most active, busy and in-demand pianists we have had here for decades, someone who is revered by anyone he has recorded and played with, a uniquely gifted musician who can handle the most complex arrangements, who can throw out a multitude of those himself and someone who can adapt to the most serene as well as the most outrageous settings, both musically and compositorically.</p>
<p>An old-school sideman.<br />
One who is trusted across the board and who is called when things get steamy.</p>
<p>And he put out &#8220;for you&#8221;, a session that has attracted more vitriol in many circles than others have collected in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Simple me, again, has a hard time understanding that intense amount of ammunition that has been fired at him, simply because I enjoy that very recording so much. It&#8217;s the kind of session that garners positive reviews by those people who are deemed &#8220;simple&#8221; by jazz critics and that negative reviews are thrown at by those people who deem his kind of music &#8220;Muzak&#8221;, &#8220;forgettable&#8221;, unworthy of attention.</p>
<p>I beg to differ.<br />
Once again.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have tonal extravaganza here, no free blowing and (extreme) playing, the dynamics are level and not a single musical framework is busted wide-open.</p>
<p>What we have here is a man who, in a comfortable and relaxed setting, is throwing out a whole load of tasty flourishes, who is obviously very aware of what he can do &#8230; and then decides to withhold in favor of the totality and tonality of the session. We have a musician who doesn&#8217;t HAVE to prove anything, simply because he has done so time and again. The &#8220;WDR Bigband&#8221; is nothing to sneeze at and if you have ever seen them in a live setting, Quincy Jones and Frank Foster were the types of musicians who might very well have taken a very deep bow and said &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I bought Frank Chastenier&#8217;s debut album, I was actively searching for something that is quiet, that is relaxed, that is unobtrusive, that is informed &#8230; that retains musicianship that is based on decades of artistry. For a while I abstained from hitting that &#8220;Buy Me Now!&#8221; button, simply because some &#8211; certainly not all, as many were extremely favorable &#8211; reviews trashed this release so severely that I thought I might as well shoot myself in the head before dishing out my hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe it takes a certain disposition to really get into this release, but if it does, I certainly have it. In a world that is so tumultuous already, loud enough to make even a quiet human being squeal in pain, it is my inner self that never stops trying to unearth music to counter that busy atmosphere.</p>
<p>I found Bugge Wesseltoft, I found Tord Gustavsen, I discovered Jan Johansson, I enjoy the hell out of Bill Evans, and I added Frank Chastenier to the roster.</p>
<p>Since I bought this CD, there hasn&#8217;t been a quiet evening without a full run through his recording. None. It always ends up on my CD player at those moments</p>
<p>&#8220;For You&#8221;, released by Universal Jazz Germany in 2004, is a classic trio album recorded by Frank Chastenier (piano), John Goldsby (bass) and Hans Dekker (drums). There are guests, like Tim Lefebvre (bass) and Till BrÃ¶nner (trumpet), and the string section of &#8220;<em>Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg</em>&#8220;, but they blend in so smoothly that one doesn&#8217;t notice much (spoken from a positive vantage point).</p>
<p>You do have to be German to appreciate one of my personal highlights on this CD, Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Mensch</em>&#8220;, which, in its original form, was one of the biggest hits here a while back, but a bunch of standards, &#8220;The Way You Look Tonight&#8221; (Jerome Kern/Dorothy Fields), &#8220;I&#8217;ll Never Smile Again&#8221; (Ruth Lowe), and &#8220;Someday My Prince Will Come&#8221; (Frank E. Churchill/Larry Morey) might alleviate that deficit.</p>
<p>If we add &#8220;<em>Bei dir war es immer so schÃ¶n</em>&#8221; (Theo Mackeben / Hans Fritz Beckmann), an old 20s song, and &#8220;<em>Berlin, dein Gesicht hat Sommersprossen</em>&#8221; (Hildegard Knef / Charly Niessen) plus a Chastenier original, &#8220;For You&#8221;, which gave this CD its title, and the final track, &#8220;Alone Again (Naturally)&#8221;, the smash-hit put out there by Gilbert O&#8217;Sullivan, we are given both a melancholic and melodic first-take approach to music that has shaped Chastenier&#8217;s musical universe. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I understand where he is coming from and I really appreciate his take on what he has presented here.</p>
<p>If we get back to that &#8220;<em>perfect dinner CD</em>&#8221; opener, which was definitely not meant as a denigrating line, it is Chastenier&#8217;s masterfully soft touch, with a bunch of consciously-placed erratic notes inbetween, which &#8211; to me &#8211; manages to isolate the musical center of each tune, the essence of it all. And Chastenier does so in such an inconspicuous manner to allow one to just have this session play, play and &#8230; play again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan, and although I don&#8217;t think the follow-up album<br />
manages to live entirely up to my expectations (to stay with the dinner and food imagery, that second release has an air of &#8220;seconds&#8221;), I highly recommend this CD which, if you are so inclined, can put you and your guests at ease without dumbing everything and anything down.</p>
<p>And, because I&#8217;ve eaten more than my share these past few years, &#8220;for you&#8221; is also one of the very, very few CDs of choice when I write, work &#8230; or am otherwise ready to have a quiet evening all to me, myself, and I.</p>
<p>There could be worse.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/recycling_davis.jpg" rel="lightbox[1795]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1796" title="Recycling" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/recycling_davis.jpg" alt="Recycling" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most irritating aspects of most music labels&#8217; reissue policies (if there is, indeed, a &#8220;policy&#8221; of any kind present, aside from generating the most cash with the least amount of effort) is the constant need of company bigwigs to recycle releases for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s akin to yelling into an empty forest, especially since just about every music collector is likely to get a hernia sooner or later when faced with the 756th reissue of &#8220;Kind of Blue&#8221;, but it also needs to be said around here:</p>
<p>It is maddening to see how much music remains unreleased, is left to shady European offshore labels to reissue in more or less adequate format or which, in a worst-case scenario, is just lost to the sands of time and tape deterioration because the management, as is customary, couldn&#8217;t give a flying leap about the music it has been and is selling. A product is a product, and if the ($) signs are right, the same music will be reissued again. And again.<br />
And again.<span id="more-1795"></span></p>
<p>Of course, there are reissues of reissues that do make sense: the ones that improve on a former shoddy tape transfer, the ones that add unreleased worthwhile (!) tracks, the ones that restore original artwork, the ones that actually complete a supposedly already complete edition (which was missing tracks discovered after the last reissue or had simply been forgotten on the last reissue because of editorial stupidity); all in all, the ones that improve upon a prior edition.</p>
<p>Alas, most of what is released time and time again is not only devoid of any of the above but often even reduced in quality. Stick the unremastered CD into a flimsy cardboard box, together with a bunch of others, call it &#8220;Collection&#8221; of some sort and sell it for 10% of the price. Someone will surely bite (or bite themselves in the ass for having paid 90% more when it was first released). In short, it&#8217;s a quick stab at another couple of thousand bucks paid by the few hundred people that somehow missed the earlier sixty-eight reissues.</p>
<p>Of course it is commendable to help new generations get acquainted with great music, but leaving a trusted core group of music aficionados and collectors in the dust by simply not releasing much sought-after music that they can then add to what they have already amassed in their lifetimes, is simply dumb. Those people are the ones who filled the pockets of the upper label echelons, who are now raining on their parade, and with all the huffin&#8217; and puffin&#8217; about declining sales, it is surprising (to say the least) that labels are seemingly digging their own graves by rudely shoving the demanding collectors and fans out of their way to, for example, supplying stacks of totally superfluous &#8220;Pink Floyd Immersion&#8221; sets to unsuspecting music shops (the few shops that are still around, that is).</p>
<p>For years I have tried to find some rare west coast jazz sessions on digital media and instead of finding them, I stumbled over another 100 Hip-O-Select re-boxings of reissued and re-boxed earlier reissues of reissues. How many Wes Montgomery reissues of the same material does the world really need, even if he happens to have been one of the greatest guitarists who ever lived, which he certainly was?</p>
<p>How many totally outrageous box sets like the most recent Elvis Presley one can the world stomach before the music industry finally completes its imploding process? Yes, that set was remastered well and apparently had pretty good editorial work go into it, but who the hell pays $800 and more (later reduced for a while before it disappeared into thin air altogether) to have all of the material &#8230; again? People have, as it is now sold out, but it&#8217;s not like 95% of it hasn&#8217;t been available elsewhere time and again. The same goes for that &#8220;Complete Miles Davis&#8221; shoebox that would have forced me &#8211; had the box not been a total packaging disaster that was only fixed temporarily &#8211; to sell the then 80% redundant single disks I bought previously to make room (and find cash) for this new extravaganza? Why reissue this stuff again and leave the rest of recorded history in musty vaults?</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s the usual collector nagging and quibbling, but when I look through my most recent newsletter subscriptions, the mail updates from major labels as well as relevant forum posts on new reissues, I&#8217;m beginning to think that labels like Sony/Columbia simply don&#8217;t have more than three or four master tapes by one or two artists in their hands anymore. The rest seems to have evaporated. They are apparently forced to reissue the same Santana compilation (now with fewer liner notes [none, actually], with fewer tunes [1 CD instead of two] and cheaper packaging, although it still outwardly looks like the double-CD reissue that came out, what, 10 years ago &#8230; and is still available all over the place) because they simply don&#8217;t seem to have anything they can reissue or, God forbid, release for the first time. Zilch. The vault seems to be a super-huge storage space with three tapes in it. They probably turned off the air-conditioning in it as well. Lights out. Slam the door.</p>
<p>If there ever was a reason to start diving into more or less shady wells for more worthwhile &#8220;releases&#8221;, it&#8217;s now. It is this kind of money-grabbing and stupid reissue policy that caters only to the dumbest, the simplest &#8230; and the most gullible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Objective&#8221; commentators always cite one reason for this kind of label behavior, and that is &#8220;economic viability&#8221;. Catering to those three people who are looking for a rare west coast session simply doesn&#8217;t help a or any label survive, they say. Hm. I wonder how they survived the past 80 and more years? In my eyes, by balancing their roster. Ever since they stopped doing that, all their money seems to be on one or two racehorses that generate enough cash flow &#8230; directly into the pockets of investors, management and &#8230;. well, whatever or whomever. It certainly isn&#8217;t invested into broadening their appeal for a diverse group of collectors and, spoken subjectively, a probably very large group of music fans that could surely generate the kinds of returns if attempts were to be made at catering to their interests and needs.</p>
<p>Hell, I&#8217;ve gotten off the train long ago because I have better things to do than sit and wait (in the case of the Beatles remasters, <em>how</em> many decades did it take for something sensible to come along?) for something to happen that simply won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Looking at the purchases of the past two or three years, I&#8217;ve reduced my shopping activities by 98%, or more. There must be thousands like me that have started both spending their money elsewhere or on other things and looking elsewhere for their &#8220;fix&#8221;. I have, for example, spent more of my money on good wines to go along with the music I already have than on reissued music I would have liked to have, had it been available. I&#8217;m subsidizing several excellent vineyards in my area that way with money that would, surely, have gone straight into the pockets of the powers that are the music industry.</p>
<p>All the music industry then does in return is to lament the death of a totally outdated business model and accuse 13-year old kids and 92-year old grandmothers of having brought about the industry&#8217;s downfall by downloading illegally what they would never have bought in the first place.</p>
<p>What a laughable concept and what a schizophrenic and self-delusional way of looking (with the extremest form of tunnel vision) at their own market. The patient seems to be dead, and although I&#8217;d love to dance on all of their graves to celebrate that stupidity got the better of them, it&#8217;s still a sad thing to see.</p>
<div class="blue-box"><strong>Note:</strong> The image used for this post is the cover of the 50th anniversary edition. The spot where it stated that was removed and replaced by a generic recycling symbol.</p>
<p>As far as I recall, the same spot was used previously to announce the 45th, the 40th, the 35th, the 30th, the 25th, the 20th, the 15th, the 10th and the 5th anniversary of that recording.</p>
<p>I would have liked to replace it all with a resounding &#8220;Sony/Columbia sucks!&#8221;, but that might possibly have been too much of a moot point.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/lotr-music-of.jpg" rel="lightbox[1773]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1774" title="The Music of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (website)" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/lotr-music-of.jpg" alt="The Music of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (website)" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>To veer off the beaten path again for a brief moment, I would like to draw your attention to a site I literally &#8220;tripped&#8221; over the other day, &#8220;<a title="The Music of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (website)." href="http://student.mica.edu/jjennette/Soundtrack/home.html">The Music of &#8216;The Lord of the Rings&#8217;</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This website, oddly enough hosted on a student sub-domain, although copyrighted and supposedly licensed (which I somehow doubt, myself being the eternal cynic and all), gives you a detailed insight into the conception and composition of the entire score which did, if you recall, garner two Academy Awards and got quite a bit of praise from critics around the globe. Many people would consider this to be Howard Shore&#8217;s masterpiece.<span id="more-1773"></span></p>
<p>Even if you neither are into soundtracks nor really care about the score which accompanies this three-part fantasy extravaganza, it is nevertheless a fascinating glimpse into the musical universe that certainly did help make the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; trilogy the fan-favorite it was and remains today.</p>
<p>The site offers a glossary of musical terms used and then, for each of the three parts, presents a comprehensive analysis, a detailed look at themes, motifs and texts. It also describes the instrumentation and presents the performers for each and every score snippet.</p>
<p>The site is based on the annotations provided by the booklets that were and are included in the &#8220;Complete Recordings&#8221; 4-CD box sets for each part of the trilogy. Today, of course, each collectors&#8217; box set has a much nastier price tag attached to it than the one it already had way back when.</p>
<p>To make this site more interactive, score snippets are provided in *.mp3 format to illustrate points made in the liner notes.</p>
<p>I have quite a few soundtracks, all of which I only listen to sparingly. Somehow, after a while, I often lose patience, more or less quickly, and switch to something else. Still, larger chunks of these three box sets have grabbed and held my attention time and again and &#8220;<a title="The Music of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (website)." href="http://student.mica.edu/jjennette/Soundtrack/home.html">The Music of The Lord of the Rings</a>&#8221; has actually made me pull them out once more to have both a closer look and a closer listen.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, if you happen to be so inclined.</p>
<div class="blue-box">A note for the &#8220;geeks&#8221; and &#8220;freaks&#8221;: Whenever I run across a site that I believe might not be around as long as we might all hope, I use a nifty piece of free software to mirror the entire site to my hard drives.</p>
<p>This is something one should do sparingly, simply because it puts quite some strain on the hosting server and might actually cause problems for the person running the site or might force him or her to have to pay an additional fee to their hosting company.</p>
<p>Depending on the software, mirroring a site can be a pain in the neck to set up properly, especially if you do not want the software to follow external links and, accidentally, copy the entire &#8220;New York Times&#8221; website, which might easily set you several terabyte back.</p>
<p>In case you are interested in trying this yourself, I recommend a bare-bones piuece of free software called &#8220;<a title="HTTrack web site copie software (free)." href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a>&#8221; (currently version 3.44-1), which despite its somewhat old-fashioned interface, packs quite a punch. If you know what you are doing, you can fine-tune the minutest aspects of mirroring a site.</p>
<p>When done, the software will present you with a start page from which you can launch a 1:1 copy (if you set the project up properly) of the mirrored website which now resides safely on your own PC &#8230; in its entirety.</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Once in a while, one stumbles upon a fabulous website unsuspectingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="DFTMC: Don't forget the Motor City (website)" href="http://www.dftmc.info/">Don&#8217;t Forget the Motor City: The Ultimate Guide to Motown (and related) recordings 1956-1972. Eigth Edition (June 2011)</a>&#8220;, compiled by Keith Huges and published by Richie Hardin, is such a website. From the first click into the staggering wealth of discographical information on this website you just know that you have landed on an Internet presence that has been and is a real labor of love.<span id="more-1766"></span>Besides offering some brief information about <a title="The DFTMC format." href="http://www.dftmc.info/online.html">the DFTMC format</a> and a more detailed look at <a title="DFTMC: &quot;About&quot;." href="http://www.dftmc.info/about.html">discographical considerations</a> that went into the publication of this website, the home page offers a direct entry point into the various listings via either song listings or artist listings, both of which are organized alphabetically.</p>
<p>I am certainly not an expert on the Motown catalog, aside from the fact that I have quite a bit of it, but whenever I want to quickly check or cross-reference this or that piece of information I found in a booklet or liner notes, DFTMC has become my one-stop to get a quick fix.</p>
<p>The songs pages look like this &#8230;<br />
<a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/dftmc-songs.jpg" rel="lightbox[1766]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1767" title="DFTMC: Don't forget the Motor City (song listings)" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/dftmc-songs.jpg" alt="DFTMC: Don't forget the Motor City (song listings)" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>and the artists pages like this (with clickable links to the corresponding song entries) &#8230;<br />
<a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/dftmc-artists.jpg" rel="lightbox[1766]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1768" title="DFTMC: Don't forget the Motor City (artists listings)" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/dftmc-artists.jpg" alt="DFTMC: Don't forget the Motor City (artists listings)" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For someone who has tried, often in vain, to present a well-kept database in a quickly-accessible format, DFTMC is a site to study to see how it is done.<br />
Simple, but very effective.</p>
<p>Highly recommended!<br />
Check it out!</p>

<p>Still, somehow, the following release completely passed me by.<br />

<p>When my parents moved to Caracas, Venezuela, in the early 1980s, I tried to visit as often as my time and our traveling budget allowed. It was the time of the Sony Walkman and, soon thereafter, the Sony Discman, and I usually had more than enough music along for the many trips to last me several weeks. Still, in the long run, I would run out and simply tune into any of the many radio stations available.</p>
<p>Besides the usual US fare being played up and down the airwaves, Venezuelan radio was infused with salsa, from right to left, from top to bottom, and 24/7. For someone unacquainted with it, most of the tunes played sounded all alike, but it didn&#8217;t take me long to get with the program. So, when my second or third visit rolled along, I found myself automatically tuning into a salsa station to accompany the soothing night sounds of frogs and <em>chicadas</em> and whatever else came creepy crawling out at night. By the way, whenever I returned to Europe, I immediately missed that soundtrack I had then enjoyed for anywhere from 4 weeks to nearly three months. Actually, Europe was, if you didn&#8217;t live downtown, sonically dead as a door nail.</p>
<p>One day, a single tune made me prick up my ears, run over to the radio and turn it up as loud as possible without gliding into distortion territory. It had an incredibly modern rhythm, a polished 80s production sound, and one hell of a catchy hook, including a wonderful finale. It was a fascinating fusion of traditional dance music with modern instruments and production values.</p>
<p>That song was &#8220;<em>Chamito Candela</em>&#8220;.<span id="more-1714"></span></p>
<p><object width="600" height="475"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DJWPxaiJERk?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DJWPxaiJERk?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="475" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>The title wasn&#8217;t difficult to remember, as it also dominated the last minute or so of the song, but the announcer never mentioned the name of the band. Instead, the track segued right into one of the trillions of commercials blasted through the radio every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The Internet was still far off, and running to the next record store was out of the question for me (I was dependent on my parents driving me through the insane traffic of Caracas), so I decided to stay glued to the radio, convinced that a track like that was going to be replayed later in the day.</p>
<p>And I was right.<br />
Actually, it became a smash hit and ruled the airwaves for quite some time.<br />
That same day then, I found out that the band was called &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221;.</p>
<h3>01) Daiquiri: Band History</h3>
<p>Daiquiri, a band about which not much is available on the Internet besides a <a title="Daiquiri on the Spanish (ES) Wikipedia." href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiquir%C3%AD_%28banda%29">rather weak Spanish Wikipedia entry</a> and <a title="Best online resource." href="http://sincopa.com/latin_pop/artists_lat/daiquiri.htm">a section</a> on <a title="Sincopa: The Guide to Venezuelan Music" href="http://sincopa.com/">Sincopa: The Guide to Venezuelan Music</a>, was formed in 1983 by Alberto Slezynger, who was also the band&#8217;s leader.</p>
<p>Slezynger was clearly striving for a modernized approach to the Caribbean, tropical and salsa music everyone loved in and outside of Venezuela, incorporating the then relatively new sounds of the Yamaha DX-7, an instrument that was beginning to rear its head on almost every mainstream pop and fusion production of the 80s, other electronic keyboards and organs, electric guitars, bass and drums. When compared to the traditional music I had been listening to day in and day out, like most other people, this music was fresh, hot &#8230; and new, without losing its roots and still being instantly recognizable.</p>
<p><a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/daiquiri-band.jpg" rel="lightbox[1714]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1726" title="Daiquiri: Band" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/daiquiri-band.jpg" alt="Daiquiri: Band" width="600" height="401" /></a></p>
<p>The musicians Alberto Slezynger assembled around himself to get that new sound were, for the most part, session musicians, some of which were educated at American music colleges, who had all already proven themselves on the Venezuelan market. On their second release, &#8220;La Casa del Ritmo&#8221;, which included the song I wrote about above, those musicians were, in addition to Alberto Slezynger (lead vocals, keyboards, percussion), Silvano Monasterios (piano, keyboards), Pedro Vilela (guitar), Danilo Aponte (bass), Carlos &#8220;Nene&#8221; Quintero, Gustavo Calle (percussion), Gerardo LÃ³pez (percussion and background vocals) and Manolo Alvarez (backing vocals).</p>
<p>&#8220;La Casa del Ritmo&#8221; (SonogrÃ¡fica, 1984) is still one of my favorite LPs today and as I have thousands of LPs and CDs, that&#8217;s something to write home about. There wasn&#8217;t a weak track on this wonderful LP and &#8220;<em>Agua Que No Has De Beber</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>La Casa Del Ritmo</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>Zambo Montuno</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>Chamo Candela</em>&#8220;, and &#8220;<em>El Amor</em>&#8221; became instant personal favoritres. Coupled with &#8220;<em>Puro Deseo De Amar</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>Vente Conmigo</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>Caso Perdido</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>Como El Viento</em>&#8221; off their debut album, simply entitled &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221; (SonogrÃ¡fica, 1983), you have a veritable parade of excellent tracks to spice up any party, Latin or not.</p>
<p><object width="600" height="475"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kjBwN9d92T0?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kjBwN9d92T0?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="475" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>With 5 regular albums under their belt, Daiquiri have become a fixture in Venezuelean music history not only of the 80s, although they slipped somewhat off my radar after their first two LPs. On January 1, 1988, Daiquiri&#8217;s bassist, Danilo Aponte, who is still on their third LP, &#8220;La Noche&#8221; (SonogrÃ¡fica, 1985), died in a car crash and Daiquiri integrated a new bassist, Rafael &#8220;Rafucho&#8221; Figliola, into the band. They switched labels from SonogrÃ¡fica to EMI-Rodven and put out two more records, Mi Tumbao (EMI-Rodven, 1987) and DaiquirÃ­ 5 (EMI-Rodven, 1989).</p>
<p>When I started looking around for any information on &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221; a few years ago, I read that Alberto Slezynger had emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Miami, Florida, where he founded &#8220;<a title="Personal Music website." href="http://www.personalmusic.com/">Personal Music</a>&#8220;, &#8220;a multi-faceted, Miami-based full-service digital recording facility [...] providing music servicesÂ  for the creative industries [...]&#8220;. He still successfully runs that company today as its CCO.</p>
<p>The rest of the musicians dispersed to the four winds and continued what they did best, play and produce music. All of them reappeared on other releases by various artists.</p>
<p>Slezynger himself has not separated from Daiquiri&#8217;s music. In 2004 he lead a group of musicians interpreting the old &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221; classics at several concerts in Miami and he even popped around Europe for a Latin American and Caribbean Festival in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<h3>02) Getting Re-Acquainted with &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221; on CD</h3>
<p>Although I have Daiquiri&#8217;s first two LPs at home, I have often searched the Internet thin for any CD of their earlier material, simply because my two LPs are worn down to their bare ingredients. Unfortunately, unearthing CD releases of their material is not easy at all, but in 2009 the stars aligned right and an old friend from Venezuela, Natalia, did not forget to run around Caracas to pick up what she could find there for me before we met up in Heidelberg, Germany, that summer.</p>
<p>The two CDs she brought along were &#8220;Daiquiri. Lo MÃ¡ximo &#8211; 16 Grandes Exitos&#8221; (SonogrÃ¡fica, 2004, CD) and &#8220;Daiquiri. La Historia&#8221; (Latin World, 2004, CD).</p>
<p>The first one of those, &#8220;Lo MÃ¡ximo&#8221;, was probably the highlight of my music collecting that year, simply because it is a grabbag of the hits I referred to above. Taken off their first three SonogrÃ¡fica albums and supplemented with a tune entitled &#8220;She-Fire-Remix&#8221;, a comparatively forgettable track, it&#8217;s perhaps the only CD release still somewhat available and worth getting.</p>
<p><object width="600" height="475"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ARouhoj6_k?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ARouhoj6_k?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="475" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>The second one, &#8220;La Historia&#8221; is one of those odd butcher jobs that is interesting but simply not comparable to what made Daiquiri famous. Although it does feature all the big hits, all of them have been spiced up and added on to, so much so that to me personally, it just doesn&#8217;t sound much like &#8220;Daiquiri&#8221; anymore. In fact, most of it sounds like it was rerecorded. It reeks of the old &#8220;fast buck&#8221; technique, cashing in on the reputation of the band and trying to score additional airplay by updating the sound for the 21st century. It is not a bad album per se, but I have a basic aversion to these kinds of releases that try to change what once was. Just call me old-fashioned.</p>
<h3>03) Daiquiri: Albums</h3>
<p>From 1983 to 1989, Daiquiri released 5 regular albums. I am not aware of any CD reissues of those albums, but I am sure there must have been some, although looking around the Internet to see if any did roll around unearthed &#8230; nothing.</p>
<p>Should that be the case, I think a well-edited and decent-sounding reissue of at least their first two albums is in order. Considering Daiquiri&#8217;s reputation, it is a shame that those are simply not available.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">03) Daiquiri: Compilation Albums</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As far as I know, 5 compilation albums were released between 1986 and 2004, one LP and four CDs. I have three of the five listed here, so I can vouch for the accuracy of the information as there is, for example, not much much available online about the first two.</p>
<div class="blue-box"><a href="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/daiquiri-lo-mejor-small01.jpg" rel="lightbox[1714]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1727" title="daiquiri-lo-mejor-small01" src="http://livingwithmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/daiquiri-lo-mejor-small01.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><strong>Daiquiri.

<em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The follwoing CD is a licensed compilation album. All tracks were licensed from Sonografica, besides tracks 4 and 6, which were licensed from Slezynger&#8217;s &#8220;Personal Music&#8221;. I am quite sure that this compilation was released in 1998, but the booklet I have had access to did not list a year. It appears that the compilation album above is often confused with this one.</p>

<p><strong>George Shearing/George Shearing Quintet. Classic Album Collection. Golden Stars/IMC Music Ltd, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>This 3-CD box (3 jewelcases in slip cover) was produced in Portugal under European public domain law, and although it does state that the music presented on these CDs was licensed from Intermusic S.A., George Shearing probably won&#8217;t see a single cent.</p>
<p>It is the first time that the first two albums included here have been reissued and the remastered sound is more than OK. I sometimes do wonder though what the earlier Shearing material could sound like. Up until today I have mostly heard cheapo remasterings only, and this one is heads above some of the <em>dreck</em> I have had the misfortune of owning. It&#8217;s not Mosaic, but for 11 Euro one can&#8217;t complain.<span id="more-1728"></span></p>
<p>The albums included are:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;An Evening With the George Shearing Quintet&#8221; (MGM, 1951), basically &#8220;[...] covers a three-year period when Shearing&#8217;s group gradually became one of the most popular in the country. Among the high-points of the enjoyable set are &#8216;Mambo Inn,&#8217; &#8216;The Continental,&#8217; &#8216;Jumpin&#8217; with Symphony Sid,&#8217; &#8216;Roses of Picardy&#8217; and &#8216;I&#8217;ll Remember April.&#8217;&#8221; (AMG).</li>
<li>&#8220;I Hear Music&#8221; (Metro, 1952) is an early-&#8217;50s and more consistently uptempo date with guitarist Chuck Wayne.</li>
<li>&#8220;The Shearing Spell&#8221; (Capitol, 1955), the Shearing Quintet&#8217;s first recording for Capitol, features George Shearing (piano), Johnny Rae (vibraphone), Toots Thielemans (guitar), Al McKibbon (bass), Bill Clark (drums) as well as Armando Peraza and Willie Bobo (percussion) on some tracks.</li>
<li>&#8220;Black Satin&#8221; (Capitol, 1956) is perhaps one of Shearing&#8217;s best-known recordings. I have never been the biggest fan of it, with its heavily-orchestrated tracks, but it does have its charm. Billy May&#8217;s string arrangements are perfectly-suited to embellish the &#8220;Shearing sound&#8221; and it is not surprising that this recording became and has remained so popular.</li>
