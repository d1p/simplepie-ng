			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;What are you doing in Washington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Working and studying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>I usually shrug. Then say, &#8220;Why not.&#8221;  Definitively. With a period, not a question mark.</p>
<p>What draws you to a place, particularly one that&#8217;s unknown to you? Nothing, really. Nothing except maybe hearsay, folklore. Nothing except maybe the potential and the possibility unique to that specific geographical circumstance.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say why this time it was Washington. It just was.</p>
<p>Washington seems like such an important place. From where things of great gravitas come. Right?</p>
<p>More realistically, Washington is the city from where interns photocopy the documents upon which the great bureaucracies of government and corporation run. I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in D.C. about a week now. Since then, I&#8217;ve turned 21&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/6187338651/" title="First beer with Mullaney by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6187338651_c70d2af88d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="First beer with Mullaney"></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and started my editorial internship at <a href="http://www.tnr.com/">The New Republic</a>, which describes itself as &#8216;a journal of politics and the arts&#8217;. You might know it from a movie called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323944/">Shattered Glass</a>, starring Anakin Skywalker pre-asthma.</p>
<p>My working space is a refurbished closet, which amazingly and impossibly fits three desks, each facing its own wall. I share the closet with two other editorial interns, three antique computers and a rotating fan.  It&#8217;s completely claustrophobic. I&#8217;ve never loved anything so much.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/6187859350/" title="TNR by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6187859350_a395033863.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="TNR"></a></p>
<p>The office is two-story &#8211; literary and the arts staff, mail room, break room, conference room/communal lunch room on the first floor, and editorial staff, M &amp; M machine, village of interns on the second. For a publication that prints twice a month, the staff is much smaller than I thought it would be. All of the content, all of the brilliant writing you see on tnr.com and the magazine is powered by this small army of writers/editors &#8230;and us interns, of course. If we&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p>Getting any kind of writing exposure &#8211; let alone a full-blown article &#8211; at The New Republic is The Editorial Intern Dream. But we sit among the best in the country &#8230;certified experts in the fields of economics, policy and politics. How does a lowly intern write and speak authoritatively under the watch of those legendary writers?</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>
<p>We read the news every minute of every hour, hoping to find a breaking story onto which we can impart what (little) commentary we can. It is difficult, though. There is so much news. I feel on the brink of media over-saturation most days. But it can not be that everything that needs to be said has been said. There is always something else.</p>
<p>Besides scrambling for pitches, I get to do other fun things, like poke around a 1927 issue of The New Republic. I repeat, <strong>1927.</strong> Keynes, as in John Maynard, used to write book reviews for The New Republic &#8230;.amazing, right?! The magazine has been around since 1914. I repeat, <strong>since 1914</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/6187339367/" title="TNR archive by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6187339367_c0c34d4bc5.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="TNR archive"></a></p>
<p>The best part about living in a city is figuring out how to get home from work. I&#8217;ve metro&#8217;d, bus&#8217;d, bikeshare&#8217;d, walked and piggy back&#8217;d my way to the apartments. It&#8217;s nightfall by the time I&#8217;m released from TNR, and I&#8217;m in bed by midnight. Which, timely enough, is right about now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/6187859140/" title="UCDC Desk by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6187859140_52e995df84.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="UCDC Desk"></a></p>
<p>Till next time, N</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back in Cali, in a massage chair, drinking orange juice with pulp, and avoiding packing for Maui at all costs.</p>
<p>Paris &#8211; bustling city, monuments, architecture, metro &#8230;or the Côte d&#8217;Azur &#8211; vivid colors, lush landscape, the sea, the sun? It&#8217;s nearly impossible to choose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll miss the coffee, the yogurt, the lack of personal space on the metro, the 1664, the Mediterranean breeze, the art, the gelato, the shopping (ah, the shopping) &#8230;but most of all these people:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The French July 4 equivalent: July 14, Bastille. On the same day in 1789, Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress/prison, which marked the beginning of the French Revolution and the modern French nation state.</p>
<p>Bastille was our last day before our final critique, so much of it was spent working in an empty classroom at the Cité. Steph and Rocky had a portrait marathon:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3087 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5948218722/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6122/5948218722_dac3aa3683.jpg" alt="IMG_3087" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3086 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947659023/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6001/5947659023_0007c73e38.jpg" alt="IMG_3086" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>And Steph did a crazy painting of Bill, too:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3089 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5948224254/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5948224254_9e8b817004.jpg" alt="IMG_3089" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>We set out toward the Eiffel Tower to watch the firework show as the sun was setting, around 10 pm.  The sky was AMAZING.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3094 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5948226616/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5948226616_6408b6f7f0.jpg" alt="IMG_3094" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The area around the Eiffel Tower was absolutely packed with people. The show was incredible, though.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3098 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947672781/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5947672781_cf8e1ec8d1.jpg" alt="IMG_3098" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3123 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5948237520/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6001/5948237520_8884ff0bb8.jpg" alt="IMG_3123" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3108 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947675553/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/5947675553_a088e9e28d.jpg" alt="IMG_3108" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3115 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947679073/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5947679073_ec388b0f81.jpg" alt="IMG_3115" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3132 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947688163/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/5947688163_da38cd33db.jpg" alt="IMG_3132" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3126 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5947685189/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5947685189_b140e08eb6.jpg" alt="IMG_3126" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The metro stations around the area were completely closed off because of the crowds. The long trek to the Gare Montparnasse took a lot of shoving and shuffling, but in the company of friends&#8230; all is well. <img src='http://nicolenguyen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><a title="IMG_3141 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5948246434/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5948246434_5ae86e495c.jpg" alt="IMG_3141" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been a Monet fan &#8211; and I&#8217;m still not. We visited the Musée de l&#8217;Orangerie nestled in the Tuileries gardens. The museum had Monet&#8217;s waterlilies murals which are pretty expansive. I just can&#8217;t get past the muddy darks and the brushy strokes.</p>
<p>We later visited the Monet&#8217;s Giverny estate in Normandie, about an hour outside of Paris. No doubt that the gardens there instantly reminded me of Monet&#8217;s paintings, but still not a fan. Maybe except for his haystacks and <a href="http://www.intermonet.com/prints/m0285090.jpg">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>Tuileries:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3035 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5945606661/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/5945606661_7e935998ab.jpg" alt="IMG_3035" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Musée de l&#8217;Orangerie, Amanda, Rocky:</p>

<p>Giverny:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3059 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5945610585/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5945610585_d4b72f977c.jpg" alt="IMG_3059" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>But the most unlikely encounter of all&#8230;. JAMIE FOXX. Practically stalked the man into the waterlily garden.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, did some retail therapy on the Champs d&#8217;Elysées with the ladies. In the mid-nineteenth century, Napoleon III commissioned Haussmann to modernize Paris and one f these renovations was the wide boulevard and sidewalks of the Champs d&#8217;Elysées &#8211; perhaps one of the most anti-pedestrian streets in Paris. You have to scramble across, praying that the cars stampeding toward you will either swerve around you or come to an abrupt halt, take refuge on a 3 foot wide center &#8220;divide&#8221;, and scramble again. Originally, the street was designed as wide as possible to make it more difficult for hungry, poor Parisians to barricade the streets in protest.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3017 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5946120374/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/5946120374_3a704ec92c.jpg" alt="IMG_3017" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Amanda, red lipstick glam queen, had been waiting to go to Sephora the whole trip to buy a lipstick color sold exclusively in Paris. Gave ourselves some mani&#8217;s because well, why not.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3014 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5946074752/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/5946074752_c331d17cf1.jpg" alt="IMG_3014" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate large outdoor cafe seating areas. For lunch, I had a french onion soup and Hannah/Amanda both ordered croque monsieur&#8217;s &#8211; fancy French grilled cheeses. Melted shredded gruyere, sandwich bread, melted sliced cheese, ham, bread.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3018 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5945519869/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6150/5945519869_95d6210753.jpg" alt="IMG_3018" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_3024 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5946077842/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6131/5946077842_d1de385433.jpg" alt="IMG_3024" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>On our way home, we stopped by the Latin Quarter/Notre Dame to do some sketching and munching. The Latin Quarter has food from every cuisine &#8211; Indian, Spanish, Greek, Vietnamese, Japenese, etc. The ultimate power lunch/dinner spot.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re tourists. Tourists are ugly <a href="http://occonline.occ.cccd.edu/online/vkomenda/Ugly%20Tourist.pdf">sometimes</a>. Who cares.</p>
<p>We had a semi-tourist Saturday morning, and visited the Musée d&#8217;Orsay which happened to have a huge Manet special exhibition. Manet is one of my favorite painters OF ALL TIME.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923580104/" title="IMG_2940 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6028/5923580104_009e29b64e.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2940"></a></p>
<p>Then we did the most tourist-y thing of all &#8211; a boat ride down the Seine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923583814/" title="IMG_2945 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6028/5923583814_1b0fb4bc5b.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2945"></a></p>
<p>Did a bunch of picture-taking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923581462/" title="IMG_2950 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5923581462_00c4ebb045.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2950"></a></p>
<p>Even our professor Bryce was in on it (he hates cheese, aka paintings of sunsets and couples holding hands):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923016177/" title="IMG_2949 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/5923016177_6e3a4e531b.jpg" width="281" height="500" alt="IMG_2949"></a></p>
<p>The boat ride was actually pretty chill, and we got to see the Musee D&#8217;Orsay from the outside, and that thing they call the Tour Eiffel &#8211; whatever that is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923584238/" title="IMG_2956 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5923584238_674d6194c2.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2956"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923018263/" title="IMG_2959 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/5923018263_90aa0d6680.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2959"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923020641/" title="IMG_2964 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6021/5923020641_a9deb2e87b.jpg" width="281" height="500" alt="IMG_2964"></a></p>
<p>We trekked to Chinatown for dinner, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made on this trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923585900/" title="IMG_2975 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/5923585900_4c875ef0bd.jpg" width="281" height="500" alt="IMG_2975"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923022461/" title="IMG_2977 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/5923022461_d067a7035e.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2977"></a></p>
<p>Wanted to take a pic of the banh cuon, but everyone just demolished it when it hit the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923587672/" title="IMG_2979 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5923587672_b1ca8c2a9e.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2979"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923024325/" title="IMG_2983 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/5923024325_e119cb2e08.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2983"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923590066/" title="IMG_2987 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6021/5923590066_47e76a1e47.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_2987"></a></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have enough cheesy photos, so we went to the Eiffel Tower after dinner to watch it sparkle like Edward in the sun. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923591290/" title="IMG_3001 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/5923591290_a1e1a0083f.jpg" width="281" height="500" alt="IMG_3001"></a></p>
<p>And a parting shot &#8211; Amanda, Ryan, and Evan eating awkwardly shaped ice cream cones:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923027395/" title="IMG_3003 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5923027395_2a5462f5bf.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_3003"></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were pampered at the chateau, but we&#8217;re real students now &#8211; and completely on our own for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I&#8217;m sticking to a strict honey pops/orange juice/peach/yogurt breakfast diet. Before heading out to catch the metro, I get a 40 eurocent mocha espressso from the magical coffee vending machine downstairs. It&#8217;s delicious, actually. Especially if it&#8217;s a zombie morning O.O</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2937 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923326644/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6014/5923326644_8a4c56a0f8.jpg" alt="IMG_2937" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>On Friday, we had our first figure drawing class abroad at the École d&#8217;Art. It&#8217;s also a fashion school so there are dress forms &#8211; everywhere. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/poindexterity/sets/72157622123244452/"> the good ol&#8217; days</a>.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2935 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923330430/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5923330430_e90bd0814d.jpg" alt="IMG_2935" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_2923 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5922766589/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5922766589_8de307b90f.jpg" alt="IMG_2923" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_2929 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923332412/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/5923332412_8777eafd3c.jpg" alt="IMG_2929" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>After studio, we went to the Centre Pompidou, which is that museum with the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Centre+Pompidou&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1158&amp;bih=714&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;source=lnms&amp;ei=0gMaToekGs_tObuS9fUI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q_AUoAQ">hamster maze </a>escalators. The Centre Pompidou has modern work up to present day. If the French museum trifecta were arranged chronologically, it would go: Louvre, Musée D&#8217;Orsay and then the Pompidou.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given up on trying to bring my camera into museums to smuggle a photo, so I just brought my iPhone along. Of course, photography is allowed at the Pompidou and to make matters worse, there were amazing sweeping views of the city and of Montmartre &#8211; not to mention the wonderful work they had in their collection.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2423 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5922779585/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5922779585_468a1e62cd.jpg" alt="IMG_2423" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_2422 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923336312/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5923336312_775fa0ab60.jpg" alt="IMG_2422" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I was in absolute awe of all the Fauvist paintings.. and the Kadinsky&#8217;s &#8230;and the Picasso&#8217;s &#8230;and looking at these artists&#8217; watercolor palattes. No wonder why the French are so cultured. They are just SURROUNDED by masterpieces.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2456 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5923333720/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6124/5923333720_dee529a167.jpg" alt="IMG_2456" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>

<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough to jam-pack into one day, that night a group of us headed to an Irish bar called Wide Open Spaces, whose space was neither wide nor open. Their one redeeming quality, however, was that it was Harry Potter night, and the bartender was dressed like this:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I visited the Louvre during <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/sets/72157624645648882/">my short trip to Paris last year</a> with my family. I remember the crowded lines, the Mona Lisa frenzy, and being in complete awe of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/4870489305/in/set-72157624645648882">Athena Nike</a>. The Louvre is so big that my 5-hour visit only warranted me one wing, so I was looking forward to what else this gigantic museum had in store.</p>
<p>My bed at the Cité Universitaire is nothing like the queen I had in La Napoule, but then I look out the window, and realize I&#8217;m in Paris. It seems trivial then to be bothered by my little cot &#8211; shoot, I&#8217;ll even sleep on a yoga mat on the floor if that means I can stay here for another day.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2870 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5914728387/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5075/5914728387_ba130d996f.jpg" alt="IMG_2870" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_2873 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5915288814/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/5915288814_31e4cc4a88.jpg" alt="IMG_2873" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The cité is so huge, that there&#8217;s a metro stop dedicated to it right in front of the main building. The metro is our gateway into the rest of the city. Even though we&#8217;re in the 15th arrondisement, on the very edge of Paris &#8211; bustling places like the Latin Quarter and the Champs Elysees are no more than 10 &#8211; 15 minutes away. Yesterday, our group of 30 tried to stick together on our way to the Louvre. The operative word being tried.  Not only do most Parisians not own cars, but they also don&#8217;t require much personal space, so they have no qualms about stuffing themselves into a jam-packed train to get to where they need to go. All 11 million of them. Our group was split up, of course, but once we emerged from the station, there the Louvre was &#8211; in all its Baroque glory. How could something so epic, so large, so extravagant been conceivable at that time? The pyramid is the most recognizable feature of the Louvre, but what the postcards don&#8217;t/can&#8217;t show is the towering building that surrounds it on all four sides.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2875 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5914728811/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5036/5914728811_303449a5bd.jpg" alt="IMG_2875" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_2880 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5914729029/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6099/5914729029_6c778f2751.jpg" alt="IMG_2880" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Me, Steph and giant Rocky:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2890 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5915290276/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5036/5915290276_f09017288d.jpg" alt="IMG_2890" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Crazy kiddo&#8217;s:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2901 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5914729803/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5038/5914729803_4744c3e3d3.jpg" alt="IMG_2901" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Our class is visiting the Louvre again next week precisely because it is so large. We spent most of our time in front of a painting of our choice to complete a sustained drawing. I chose Gericault&#8217;s Raft of the Medusa. This awful picture doesn&#8217;t do it any justice, but it does show its scale:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2911 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5915289948/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5915289948_aa13c6e3d3.jpg" alt="IMG_2911" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>It took just about forever to get the proportions right in my own 9 x 11 inch sketchbook. I can&#8217;t even imagine what it was like to work off of a canvas that large. How do you get around it?! How much paint do you have to mix beforehand?! How did they transport it back then?!</p>
<p>The Louvre has some of the greatest classical paintings of all time, but there are also random commissions by abstract expressionists like Cy Twombly, who was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cy+twombly&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivnsuo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=CesWTrTbIc7PsgaR9N3MDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1158&amp;bih=717">that guy that did scribble paintings</a>. He painted the ceiling for one of the rooms. It definitely took me aback, and it almost didn&#8217;t feel right. But good for Cy Twombly for getting that gig. He must have done something right.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2918 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5914729397/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5032/5914729397_c2d2333502.jpg" alt="IMG_2918" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>That Cy Twombly room also had GREAT ancient, tribal rings.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2919 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5915290492/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5076/5915290492_7fe32f9f7e.jpg" alt="IMG_2919" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The Louvre, being the huge, overpopulated heat incubator that it is, is a very difficult museum to maneuver around so Elaine, Hannah, Amanda and myself bounced out of there as soon as we could. We rehabilitated our overworked bodies with some crepes, and retail therapy at Minelli&#8217;s, a shoe store right at the Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame stop. Hey, a girl&#8217;s gotta do what a girl&#8217;s gotta do.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2920 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5915289432/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5115/5915289432_e3386a4e24.jpg" alt="IMG_2920" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Because of our shoe detour, we nearly missed our evening lecture. We ran &#8211; stuffing our bags and boxes into trash cans, and throwing our new purchases into Elaine&#8217;s purse along the way &#8211; and miraculously made it RIGHT on time.</p>

<p>But, here I am, blogging from PARIS. AH. PARIS. We took a 6 hour train ride from Cannes to the Paris terminal. Our neighbors were two nuns, one originally from Marseille and the other from Togo, Africa, who were on their way to a monastery in Toulon. I was passed out, head tilted back, mouth ajar, slightly drooling, and woke up the smell of a delicious something. The African nun busted out several tupperware full of rice cakes and yummy ragu which she shared with Mitzi, Steph, Sean, Ophelia, Amanda and myself. She even gave us a packet of dried mango to share. YUM. When Steph brought out her Bible, the nuns began comparing the verses in English and French, and sharing their favorite passages &#8211; it was so cool.</p>

<p>When we arrived, the weather was absolutely perfect. A little breezy, but sunny. Definitely not the hot and humid temps we were used to in the Riviera.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re staying in dorms at the Cité Université on the outskirts of Paris, which is this huge campus just full of international students.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2388 by nnmassappeal, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nnforthemasses/5909487025/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6016/5909487025_627df6de06.jpg" alt="IMG_2388" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I had random pho cravings, so a group of us metro&#8217;d to the Saint Germain with our sweet Navi Go passes where we found a Vietnamese/Chinese place that sold pho AND dumplings. They had a sweet student deal for 6.50 euro that came with a bowl of pho and a drink. Note the LYCHEE DRINK. Yum. Slurp.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we hit up the Louvre! But, before I go&#8230; for all you Davis kids out there &#8211; look what we have here, right in front of our dorms &#8211; Bistro&#8217;s little sis:</p>
