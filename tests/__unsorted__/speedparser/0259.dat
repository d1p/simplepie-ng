I am mad at me for something that I shouldn`t be mad at. &lt;br /&gt;I say this because this is not the first time that I have reported late for class.&lt;br /&gt; In fact, on a very good day, I make it just on time; never before the official stipulated time for the class. The lecturer today was to &lt;br /&gt;present some basic guidelines on how to prepare research papers. The fact that he is an experienced person in matters to do with &lt;a href="http://www.superiorpapers.com/%20" rel="nofollow"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; writing makes me particularly upset as this would have solved so many queries I have concerning this issue. &lt;br /&gt;I arrived halfway through the session and it became apparent that it would be practically hard to catch up with whatever he had said earlier before I arrived,&lt;br /&gt; I saw it wise to put down some things which would help me avoid such a scenario in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realized that if I am to change for the good, I will have to plan ahead for the week or even the whole semester. I will have to formulate a personal time table.&lt;br /&gt; This will be determined by quite a number of things. I will have to incorporate the official time table provided for the classes I will have to attend for my course into my personal timetable.&lt;br /&gt; This will also be determined by the amount of free time that I have in every week, and also the time that I will need to relax.&lt;br /&gt; Allocation of each course to its study time will also be guided by how much workload that course bears. All these aspects will have to be thought about in order to come up with a rational time plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also saw the need to use an alarm timer to alert me, not only in the morning when I have to move out of the bed, but also to configure it with the personal &lt;br /&gt;timetable in order to make alerts when I have to shift attention from one course to another.&lt;br /&gt; Well, this won&amp;rsquo;t be a problem and the phone will come in handy as far as this issue is concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realized that my lateness was not only caused by the lack of organization in my day to day operations, but also due to lack of proper information feeds concerning changes within my area of study.&lt;br /&gt; I vowed to keep consistent behavior of looking up on the notice board in case of changes concerning class timing and event&amp;rsquo;s postponement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;</description><comments>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/754760928/late-for-class/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>College Essay Battles</title><link>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/753996954/college-essay-battles/</link><guid>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/753996954/college-essay-battles/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2011 09:16:42 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Going through college and coming out of it a successful man or women is the greatest achievement in life you can ever make.&lt;br /&gt; Every day&amp;rsquo;s activity in a college is a hustle for most of us; at least that&amp;rsquo;s the way I see it.&lt;br /&gt; Having to survive with limited cash inflow, pressure from the people around and the nightmare of an uncertain future makes college life one of the most adventurous experiences you can ever have.&lt;br /&gt; Of course we&amp;rsquo;ve all got plans of a brighter future; but the things that divide us from that future are what we tend to forget to account for, because we simply aren&amp;rsquo;t capable of doing so.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have to deal with a great deal of workload. I&amp;rsquo;m obligated to make a consistent appearance to that boring lecture every week. &lt;br /&gt;There is a lecturer who thought it wise to push the deadline for submission of our &lt;a title="essays" href="http://uk.bestessays.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;essays&lt;/a&gt; backwards and I have to spend &lt;br /&gt;several sleepless nights seeing to it that my own &lt;a title="custom essay" href="http://uk.bestessays.com/essay_service.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;custom essay&lt;/a&gt; in good order before I present it to the lecturer.&lt;br /&gt; The exams are just around the corner and I have to make sure that I have all the notes I need for the revision. &lt;br /&gt;These endless school chores make college life less fun. But then, without them, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a college now, would it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then there are those members of the college staff.&lt;br /&gt; I am not sure whether it&amp;rsquo;s me alone but every now and then, I get in one of those compromising situations with the people are almost entirely in a different line of duty to what I&amp;rsquo;m in for in that college. &lt;br /&gt;The cook at the cafeteria who keeps on complaining that I frown at her, so I have to make an attempt to look in different direction whenever she&amp;rsquo;s around to avoid eye contact and all the scolding. &lt;br /&gt;The secretary at the departmental office who seems to get so worked up, more than even the lecturer,&lt;br /&gt; whenever I hand in my assignments late and I have to make an excuse in order for her to accept my work; things I do for love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Putting up with other students and college mates is the ultimate battle.&lt;br /&gt; Choosing who to befriend, who to avoid, who to tell off; the kind of things that you make your life miserable if you don&amp;rsquo;t take the right precautions and require a sober mind whenever one is about to make a serious decision concerning them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><comments>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/753996954/college-essay-battles/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Custom Essay Writing Services</title><link>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/748616696/custom-essay-writing-services/</link><guid>http://ukbestessays.xanga.com/748616696/custom-essay-writing-services/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 12:49:35 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Writing has a lot of importance in your academic life.
