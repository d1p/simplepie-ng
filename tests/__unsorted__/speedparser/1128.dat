Simple Exercise To Boost IQ</title><published>2011-06-11T14:08:43Z</published><updated>2011-06-11T14:08:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate"

href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304432304576371462612272884.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_11_1"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; in the WSJ is now online. It’s about a forthcoming PNAS paper on the n-back test and fluid intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we make ourselves smarter? In recent decades, scientists have accumulated increasing evidence that our intelligence, at least as measured by the IQ test, is sharply constrained by genetics. Although estimates vary, most studies place the heritability of intelligence at somewhere between 50% and 80%. It’s an uncomfortable fact, but not all brains are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why there’s so much buzz about a forthcoming study that complicates this assumption. Researchers at the University of Michigan found that it’s possible to boost a core feature of human intelligence through a simple mental training exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when several dozen elementary- and middle-school kids from the Detroit area used this exercise for 15 minutes a day, many showed significant gains on a widely used intelligence test. Most impressive, perhaps, is that these gains persisted for three months, even though the children had stopped training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists typically describe intelligence as consisting of two distinct components: fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. Fluid intelligence refers to the general ability to solve new problems and recognize unfamiliar patterns. Crystallized intelligence, by contrast, consists of particular kinds of knowledge. When children learn to count, for instance, they show gains on crystallized intelligence, even as their fluid intelligence remains constant. Scientists have typically regarded fluid intelligence as the aspect of our thinking that is most determined by genetics, since it can’t be easily taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet these schoolchildren showed gains in fluid intelligence roughly equal to five IQ points after one month of training. The IQs of 68.2% of the populace fall within a 30-point range, so this is a significant change. These kids weren’t learning facts they would soon forget. They were learning how to think better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These improvements were triggered by a mental exercise known as the n-back task. The exercise is not fun, even when translated into videogame format. It begins with the presentation of a visual cue. For the kids in the experiment, the cue was the precise location of a cartoon character. In the next round, the cue is altered—the cartoon character has moved to a new location. The job of the child is to press the space bar whenever the character returns to a spot where it has previously been, and to ignore the other irrelevant locations. As the children advance in the task, these locations move further back in time, forcing them to sort through an increasing amount of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this tedious exercise boost intelligence? The crucial change concerned the nature of the children’s attention. After repeatedly playing the n-back game, the young subjects were better able to focus on the necessary facts. As a result, they squandered less short-term memory on irrelevant details, such as cartoon locations they didn’t need to recall. The children “got better at separating the wheat from the chaff across a variety of different tasks,” says John Jonides, a senior author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important caveats to this research. The first is that not every kid showed such dramatic improvements after training. Initial evidence suggests that children who failed to increase their fluid intelligence found the exercise too difficult or boring and thus didn’t fully engage with the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second caveat concerns the relevance of the mental improvement. Scott Barry Kaufman, a cognitive scientist at New York University who was not involved in the research, believes that while this study has “incredibly important potential implications,” it’s unclear if the children’s performance changed on anything besides an abstract intelligence test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this research promises to change longstanding beliefs about the nature of intelligence. Our IQ scores may be bounded by our genes, but it looks as if it’s possible to significantly increase measured intelligence after only a few hours of training. “Intelligence is a lot like height,” Prof. Jonides says. “We know that how tall you are is largely determined by the height of your parents. But we also know that better nutrition can make everyone a lot taller. Perhaps the n-back task is just an ideal form of mental nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we can’t choose the brain we’ve been given, we can choose what that brain is paying attention to. All it takes is a little practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few additional notes: If you’re interested in learning more about this research – but are too impatient to wait for a future edition of PNAS – I’d suggest checking out &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/19/6829.short"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/23/4/743/"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.psy.unibe.ch/unibe/philhuman/psy/apn/content/e5616/e5621/e7504/e7774/files7775/Download_ger.pdf"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; Jaeggi, et. al. on fluid intelligence and the n-back test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of apps that feature the n-back test. I will not be linking to those. I have not played them and the scientists have not endorsed them. Caveat Emptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it’s worth reiterating an important caution raised by Scott Barry Kaufman. Although the IQ test has been widely used for decades, we still have a poor understanding of what it actually measures. As a result, there’s tremendous debate about it’s overall importance and how much of the individual variation in life success IQ scores can explain. (As one scientist told me, “The IQ test matters. It just doesn’t matter as much as people think.”) So I think it’s worth wondering if this significant increase in fluid intelligence will show significant effects out of the lab. Will it actually lead the children to do better on their algebra homework? Will it lead to more productive employees? Will it improve problem-solving across domains? None of those questions have answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there’s an interesting connection between the mental skills improved by the n-back test – the ability to control attention, and thus ensure our working memory is filled with relevant facts – and the ability to exert self-control. While we used to assume that self-control was about gritting our teeth, outlasting that damn temptation, we now know that self-control is really about “the strategic allocation of attention.” If you’re thinking about the ice cream in the fridge, you’re going to eat the ice cream, which is why you need to think about something else. (Our willpower is so weak that the only way we can resist anything is by finding a way to forget about it, directing the spotlight elsewhere.) So I’m curious if the n-back test might also improve measurements of self-control. Will it allow us to better allocate the scarce resource of working memory? Will we get better at &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; thinking about that pint of Rocky Road? Because as Angela Duckworth has &lt;a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/16/12/939.short"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, the only variable that’s more important than IQ scores when it comes to predicting academic success is self-control.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonah Lehrer</name></author><gr:likingUser>09394937741261175781</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>00872595417921631862</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13116995699575912588</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17321583073579446588</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>15366108418636140893</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>10846201441778701318</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/category/frontal-cortex/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/category/frontal-cortex/feed/</id><title type="html">Wired Science » Frontal Cortex</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1306873373217"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/343cb3d6e43f084c</id><title type="html">U.S. Fifth Circuit Finds Contractual Claim Under JOA Not Impermissible "Collateral Attack"</title><published>2011-05-31T20:22:53Z</published><updated>2011-05-31T20:22:53Z</updated><summary xml:base="http://www.theenergylawblog.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.liskow.com/bio.aspx?id=88"&gt;By Robert L.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking some heat for &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/the-simple-case-for-taking-herman-cain-seriously/"&gt;yesterday’s article&lt;/a&gt;, “The Simple Case for Taking Herman Cain Seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most complete critique comes from &lt;a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/05/dismissed.html"&gt;Jonathan Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, who focuses on past candidates who lacked electoral experience when they ran for president. Mr. Bernstein notes that these candidates haven’t done very well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Cain, however…the point isn’t really that “candidates without an electoral track record haven’t won the nomination.” It’s that they haven’t really come close. The best showings by candidates who hadn’t been elected to anything were, if I recall correctly, Jesse Jackson’s campaigns in 1984 and 1988; Steve Forbes in 1996 and 2000; and Pat Buchanan in 1996 (and, I suppose, 1992). I certainly wouldn’t count Wes Clark’s 2004 campaign; military heroes, of course, have a long history of winning nominations. I suppose Pat Robertson in 1988, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at this evidence in a somewhat more comprehensive way. I have a database of polls (you can download the Microsoft Excel version &lt;a href="http://www.538host.com/prima538.xls"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) conducted in January through June of the year before the first primary election (for example, polls conducted in January through June 1987 for the 1988 Democratic bid). I identified all candidates since 1972 who: (1) had never held elected office at the time they ran for president, (2) were included in at least one of these early polls and (3) officially declared for the presidency at some point in the cycle (as Mr. Cain has done), even if they pulled out before the first primary.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I identified a total of 14 candidates who met each of these criteria, counting Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes and Jesse Jackson twice apiece. There were some additional candidates who entered the race at a later stage and wound up winning a few votes — like Steve Forbes in 1996 — but they weren’t included in any of the early polls, so they aren’t included in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2611/5766230090_7bcc1b3286.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, none of these candidates did terribly well (although four of them won at least one state). And as Mr. Bernstein notes, some of them were better credentialed than Mr. Cain, having held leadership positions in the military (Wesley Clark), in a presidential cabinet (Elizabeth Dole), or both (Alexander Haig).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many of these candidates were quite well known to the American public, unlike Mr. Cain. All but four of the candidates — Mr. Clark in 2004, Gary Bauer in 2000, Mr. Keyes in 1996 and 2000, and John Cox in 2008 — had name recognition above 50 percent at this point in the nomination process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Mr. Cain’s polling is probably more impressive than any of them. Just three of the candidates — Mr. Jackson in 1988, Mr. Buchanan in 1996 and Mrs. Dole in 2000 — achieved 10 percent or more of the vote in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; individual poll, something Mr. Cain has now done with the release of this morning’s &lt;a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/05/27/rel9a.pdf"&gt;CNN survey of Republican voters&lt;/a&gt;, which put him at 10 percent of the vote exactly. But whereas Mr. Jackson, Mr. Buchanan and Mrs. Dole were household names, Mr. Cain is anything but, with name recognition that barely exceeds 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How unusual is this — for a candidate to hit double digits in the polling despite having such poor name recognition? It’s quite unusual, in fact. I can identify just three candidates besides Mr. Cain who had 10 percent or more of the vote in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; early primary poll in my database despite having name recognition below 50 percent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Dukakis polled at 11 to 13 percent in several surveys from April through June 1987 despite having name recognition of about 30 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Edwards polled at 10 to 14 percent in several surveys in early 2003 despite having name recognition of about 30 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John McCain polled at 12 percent in one survey in May 1999 despite having name recognition of about 40 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a very impressive group! Mr. Dukakis won his nomination. Mr. Edwards finished in second place in 2004 and became John Kerry’s vice-presidential nominee. Mr. McCain finished in second place in 2000 and became his party’s presidential candidate in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the “near misses” are also auspicious. Richard A. Gephardt and Al Gore polled in the high single digits at several points in early 1987 despite very low name recognition; they both went on to have distinguished political careers. Mr. Kerry routinely polled in the double digits in early 2003 with name recognition of not much more than 50 percent; he won his party’s nomination. George McGovern, with name recognition of about 50 percent, polled at 10 percent in a poll in March 1971; he became his party’s nominee. There are some counterexamples — Phil Gramm polled in the double digits in early 1999 with middling name recognition and his candidacy flopped — but usually this is a signature of a candidate with a great deal of upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we quite have a quandary on our hands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candidates with electoral resumes as thin as Mr. Cain’s have very poor track records. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; none of them have polling that was as impressive as Mr. Cain’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candidates with polling that looks like Mr. Cain’s — with numbers in the high single digits or low double digits despite very low name recognition — have an exceptionally good track record. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; all of them were far more credentialed than Mr. Cain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we resolve this? We &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; really resolve it empirically. I wrote in yesterday’s piece about how analysis of presidential elections is inherently limited by small sample sizes. But this is even worse: the sample size is essentially &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;. In the post-reform primary era (1972 onward), there’s &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; really been a candidate that combined such limited name recognition, such underwhelming credentials — and such impressive polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we might resolve it with theory. Mr. Bernstein, later in his article, articulates his theory of how presidential nominations are made. Although you should read his entire article to get a better sense of it, it’s one that places a relatively greater role on elites and party leaders who solicit input from the public, but also have a variety of ways to coax them toward their preferred choices. We might call this the Elites or &lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Theory&lt;/strong&gt; of presidential nominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend toward an interpretation, instead, that sees rank-and-file voters as having a more active role. (This is partly because my research suggests that &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/a-brief-history-of-primary-polling-part-iii/"&gt;early primary polls&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if adjusted for factors like name recognition, have more predictive power than political scientists generally give them credit for.) Elites can put their finger on the scale and their preferences certainly do matter — but voters still have the final say and will sometimes foil their best-laid plans. We might call this the Populist or &lt;strong&gt;Bottom-Up Theory&lt;/strong&gt; of presidential nominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are, of course, gross oversimplifications of the respective positions. But if you’re a proponent of Top-Down Theory, Mr. Cain has very little chance to win the nomination. If you buy into Bottom-Up Theory instead, he might have quite a good chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to adjudicate between the two theories, however, the problem of limited sample sizes returns again. Most of the time, there is a convergence — even in the early stages of the process — between what elites want and what rank-and-file voters want, and so these data points aren’t useful for resolving the debate. This has been especially the case on the Republican side. In &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/a-brief-history-of-primary-polling-part-i/"&gt;all but one competitive Republican primary in the reform era&lt;/a&gt;, the candidate who was leading in the early polls won (the exception being John McCain in 2008, who ran in a strong second place). But the winning candidates, also, had plenty of support from elites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the case this year. Take a look, instead, at yesterday’s Gallup poll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/7vw4_oftj0ghk98ti6sq6q.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitt Romney, a candidate who is acceptable to some but not all Republican elites, is in first place. But in second through fifth place are Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and Mr. Cain, &lt;a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/mar/05/george-f-will-potential-candidates-reflect-gops/"&gt;none of whom are considered “serious” candidates&lt;/a&gt; by many in the Republican establishment. There’s never been a Republican field that has featured remotely so much tension between popular and elite opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With candidates like Ms. Palin or Mr. Gingrich — or Donald J. Trump — you can chalk up much of their support to name recognition. That doesn’t hold for Mr. Cain, however. He is now running ahead of Tim Pawlenty, for instance, despite having considerably &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; name recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this Republican primary in general, and Mr. Cain’s candidacy in particular, is going to be extremely interesting for polling junkies and political scientists. It will teach us a lot about how presidential nominations are decided, and it will teach us a lot about the power or lack thereof of the Republican establishment against the party’s grass roots, the blogs and the Tea Party. In the meantime, we should be careful about declaring which candidates are viable and which aren’t, especially candidates so unusual as Mr. Cain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*-*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while political scientists and polling junkies can sit on the sidelines, chew their popcorn and wait to see how the nomination is resolved, another group has some more immediate decisions to make. These are the members of the political press, who must determine how much coverage to give to each candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into a minor &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fivethirtyeight/status/73914083098886144"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday with Politico’s Ben Smith about the viability of Mr. Cain’s candidacy. This debate — like most on Twitter — was not really on track to be resolved to anyone’s satisfaction. Fortunately a couple of friends &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/joshtpm/status/73914676496449537"&gt;intervened&lt;/a&gt; before either of us got a call from our editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question, however, that needs to be discussed more openly. What are the appropriate criteria by which the press should determine how much coverage — and what type of coverage — to give to each presidential candidate? Should it be based on polls? On who has taken the most concrete steps toward actually running? On the credentials of the candidates? On elite sentiment? On site traffic and click-through rates? If you accept that some candidates should be given more coverage than others (and some people don’t accept that), what should the ratios be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t claim to have all the answers. But I do think it’s important for the press to err toward the inclusive side. The reason is that the press itself plays a role in the nomination process. Getting a reasonable amount of media coverage is one of those things that makes a candidate viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a media organization reviews its coverage decisions in past campaigns, and discovers that the candidates it ignores tend not to do very well. One interpretation of this is that the press has correctly anticipated which candidates are viable and which aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interpretation, of course, is that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy: the candidates who did poorly did so in large part because the press ignored them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come across a candidate like Mr. Cain, who is now doing quite well in the polls &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; his lack of media attention, that would seem to compel more of it. It’s a clear a signal as any that press coverage has become misaligned with public sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very different case than one like Mr. Trump, whose surge in the polls coincided with an &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/medias-spotlight-shines-less-brightly-on-palin/"&gt;overwhelming amount of media attention&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Mr. Trump’s polling bounce (which has long since burst) was caused by the press attention or perhaps it wasn’t, but his case and Mr. Cain’s are in no way alike and arguably closer to being opposites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased press coverage doesn’t always turn out well for a candidate, of course — look what happened to Mr. Trump once the media started to treat him as a presidential candidate rather than a novelty. It may be time to apply the same scrutiny to Mr. Cain. Perhaps his campaign will wilt under the pressure, but my guess is that he wouldn’t mind the attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare stays roughly the same, but every time you receive medical  care you also get a bill. You don’t have to pay it, though. It’s just  there for accounting purposes. When you die, the bill gets paid out of  your estate. If your estate is small or nonexistent, you’ve gotten lots  of free medical care. If it’s large, you’ll pay for it all. If you’re  somewhere in between, you’ll end up paying for part of the care you’ve  received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this gives people incentives to spend all their money  before they die. That’s fine. I suspect they wouldn’t end up spending as  much as you’d think. What it does mean, though, is that Medicare has  first claim on their estate, not their kids. But that seems fair,  doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The overarching principle of the Do-Nothing Plan is this: Leave everything as is. Current law stands, and spending and revenue levels continue according to the Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections. Everyone walks away. Paul Ryan goes fishing. Sen. Harry Reid kicks back with a ginger ale. The rest of Congress gets back to bickering about mammograms. Miraculously, the budget just balances itself, in about a decade. ...
&lt;p&gt;So how does doing nothing actually return the budget to health? The answer is that doing nothing allows all kinds of fiscal changes that politicians generally abhor to take effect automatically. First, doing nothing means the Bush tax cuts would expire, as scheduled, at the end of next year. That would cause a moderately progressive tax hike, and one that hits most families, including the middle class. The top marginal rate would rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, and some tax benefits for investment income would disappear. Additionally, a patch to keep the alternative minimum tax from hitting 20 million or so families would end. Second, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obama's health care law, would proceed without getting repealed or defunded. The CBO believes that the plan would bend health care's cost curve downward, wrestling the rate of health care inflation back toward the general rate of inflation. Third, doing nothing would mean that Medicare starts paying doctors low, low rates. Congress would not pass anymore of the regular "doc fixes" that keep reimbursements high. Nothing else happens. Almost magically, everything evens out. ...
&lt;p&gt;...the do-nothing plan proves the point that the budget revolution does not need to be particularly revolutionary. Yes, the dollar figures are enormous, so big that it would appear to require "bold" plans that include massive new taxes or cruel new cuts. But, in fact, we don't really need to end Social Security, sell Alaska, or ship the poor to Canada to get back in the black. We just need to stick to current law--particularly the tax and health care provisions--and then we can tinker our way toward a better, healthier economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my post on &lt;a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/28/spotlight/"&gt;Spotlight search tricks&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to tell you about a really simple TextExpander snippet that I’m using to fetch PDFs super fast.&lt;a title="see footnote" href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/#fn:f1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I type &lt;code&gt;kpdf&lt;/code&gt;, it expands to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: kind:pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also puts the cursor right after &lt;code&gt;name:&lt;/code&gt;. No matter where I am on my Mac, I can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option-Space to open Spotlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;kpdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type part of the PDF’s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if all of my PDF files are magically in a single folder. So fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself doing the same kind of Spotlight searches over and over, I strongly recommend using TextExpander to take care of that recurring text for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I concur.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids are Generation Z, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z"&gt;born between 1995 and 2010&lt;/a&gt;. And I wonder: what can we see in those kids now that can tell us what they'll be like later, at work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.brazencareerist.com/pblog/z-superman-blogsized.jpg" alt="" height="700" width="545"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a history student in college (history of political thought, for all you fans of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_%28Plato%29"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;) and still an obsessive researcher of generational demographic trends (everyone should start with &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688119123/?tag=brazecaree-20"&gt;Strauss &amp;amp; Howe&lt;/a&gt;) I understand that to study history (contemporary or ancient), you must study generational shifts in thinking, because the way the generation thinks helps us to understand and explain historical action. And maybe predict future action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think a lot about what Generation Z will be like. I have written before about &lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/07/27/what-work-will-be-like-for-generation-z/"&gt;what Generation Z will be like at work &lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve been thinking, recently, that the way Gen Z is educated will change the workplace when they enter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby boomers changed politics, &lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/09/06/generation-x-updates-outdated-work-and-family-goals/"&gt;Gen X changed family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/10/23/3-ways-work-will-change-when-gen-y-is-in-charge/"&gt;Gen Y changed work&lt;/a&gt;, and Gen Z will change education.  Here’s how the education of Gen Z will affect us at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A huge wave of homeschooling will create a more self-directed workforce.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Homeschooling is going mainstream. We have known for a while that public education in the United States is largely terrible. Yes, there are pockets that are exceptional, but for the most part, we have an education crisis on our hands. But Baby Boomers were too scared to solve the crisis with homeschooling. If you homeschool your kids, you take them out of the typical ways to measure how well kids are doing in the competition. Baby Boomers couldn’t handle that, and they also wanted to work full-time, so instead of homeschooling, Baby Boomers got kids &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1940395,00.html"&gt;tons of tutoring and extra help after school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/07/07/gen-x-are-the-revolutionaries-and-the-nyt-coverage-of-shared-care-parenting-stinks/"&gt;Gen X is more comfortable working outside the system&lt;/a&gt; than Baby Boomers. Gen X women are fine quitting their jobs to take care of their kids—they have no feminist ax to grind in the workplace. And Gen X parents don’t feel a need to have their kid compete because Gen X is so noncompetitive. So homeschooling among Gen X parents is becoming mainstream. It’s no longer just for religious radicals and problem children. Homeschooling is for parents who know public schools are broken and don’t have $20,000 a year for private school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we will have a generation of kids who grew up with largely a self-learning, self-directed model. They are more accustomed to figuring out what they like to do, and doing it on their own. The &lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2006/07/31/navigating-the-quarterlife-crisis/"&gt;crisis to figure out what to do with one’s life &lt;/a&gt;will not last so long because Gen X will raise more independent and self-directed kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Homeschooling as kids will become unschooling as adults.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;We have established that school does not prepare people for work. In fact, Gen Y has been very vocal about this problem because a) they did everything they were told to do and it didn’t help them get a job and b) we have &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/2009-05-12-studentloans13_N.htm"&gt;a national crisis&lt;/a&gt; because gen y has huge debt from college and little ability to pay it back. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With alternative schooling and an emphasis on independent investigation, Generation Z will be the first group of knowledge workers who were trained to do their job before they started working.  For example, Generation Z will be great at synthesizing information because they will have been doing that—&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning"&gt;rather than memorizing&lt;/a&gt;—the whole time they were in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workplace ramification of this shift in learning is that Generation Z will have no problem directing their careers. They will know how to figure out what skill to learn next, and they will have more self-discipline to do it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gen Z enters the workforce, the older people, Gen X and Gen Y, will work to live, not live to work. This will be something Gen X and Gen Y fought hard for. To Gen Z it will be easy to do and self-learning will take center stage in their work day. So, as qualifications for the workplace will rapidly change and older people who don't keep up will be outdated, it will be Generation Z that is best at keeping up. Not because they are young, but because they understand that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling"&gt;unschooling&lt;/a&gt; is not a movement for kids, but a way to live a life, and it doesn’t stop when you start getting a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The college degree will return to its bourgeois roots; entrepreneurship will rule.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The homeschooling movement will prepare Generation Y to skip college, and Gen X is out-of-the-box enough in their parenting to support that. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the books that really changed the way I think is Zac Bissonnette's book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591842980/?tag=brazecaree-20"&gt;Debt-Free U&lt;/a&gt;. He explains why no one should go into debt for college. It’s just not worth it. He says, even if your parents have the money to pay for college, use it for something better—like buying yourself a franchise and learning something that’ll really help you establish yourself in the adult world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby Boomers are too competitive to risk pulling the college rug out from under their kids. And &lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/10/17/the-real-deal-about-gen-y-theyre-inherently-conservative/"&gt;Gen Y are rule followers&lt;/a&gt;—if adults tell them to go to college, they will go.  Gen X is very practical and is also&lt;a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/05/31/new-financial-data-highlights-generational-rifts/"&gt; the first generation in American history&lt;/a&gt; to have less money than their parents. So it makes sense that Gen X would be the generation to tell their kids to forget about college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-12-06-gen-next-entrepreneurs_x.htm"&gt;Ninety percent of Gen Y say they want to be entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt;, but only a very small percent of them will ever launch a full-fledged business, because Generation Y are not really risk takers.  However  I am guessing (based on links like &lt;a href="http://blog.lifecourse.com/2009/08/generation-x-and-the-self-employed-depression"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one) that most members of Gen X have, at some point, worked for themselves. The entrepreneurship bug will be in full force when Gen Z comes along. They will feel they have no choice but to do that or weather an unstable workplace with huge college debt. People will&lt;a href="http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2010-07-29/parents-succession-planning"&gt; trade in a college degree for on-the-job learning&lt;/a&gt;. The result will be a smarter workforce and the end of universities as &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2011/03/16/essay_on_alternatives_to_traditional_university_life_for_academics"&gt;a patronage system for philosophers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers have this way of constipating your thoughts because they take away one of the most natural thought laxatives known to man and woman alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing isn’t conducive to doodling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TextEdit can help.  Use it as a scratch pad – a temporary spot to hold numbers, bits of text, thoughts, or anything else that chips off during your productive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, TextEdit can be just a little box.  It can be any size and fit next to any other window.  It’s the easiest way to look at two things at once, and it can really accelerate your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using TextEdit as holder of temporary bits and bytes, you’re less likely to encumber your mind’s RAM.  And you’re less likely to flip back and forth between windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under pressure, people often prefer what is familiar, which can seem safer than the unfamiliar. We show that such favoring of familiarity can lead to choices precisely contrary to the source of felt pressure, thus exacerbating, rather than mitigating, its negative consequences. In Experiment 1, time pressure increased participants’ frequency of choosing to complete a longer but incidentally familiar task option (as opposed to a shorter but unfamiliar alternative), resulting in increased felt stress during task completion. In Experiment 2, pressure to reach a performance benchmark in a chosen puzzle increased participants’ frequency of choosing an incidentally familiar puzzle that both augured and delivered objectively worse performance (i.e., fewer points obtained). Participants favored this familiar puzzle even though familiarity was established through unpleasant prior experience. This “devil you know”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;preference under pressure contrasted with disfavoring of the negatively familiar option in a pressure-free situation. These results demonstrate that pressure-induced flights to familiarity can sometimes aggravate rather than ameliorate pressure, and can occur even when available evidence points to the suboptimality of familiar options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;When feeling pressured, people often most desire what is familiar. Familiarity signals safety, which gains heightened importance and appeal in stressful and high-pressure situations. Heightened favoring of familiarity under conditions of stress has been extensively documented in animal research showing neophobia as an outcome of physiological stressors (Griebel, Belzung, Misslin, &amp;amp; Vogel, 1993; Heinrichs &amp;amp; Koob, 1992; Shephard &amp;amp; Estall, 1984; Shors &amp;amp; Wood, 1995). In humans, familiarity’s “warm glow” (Titchener, 1915) has been most compellingly documented in mere-exposure paradigms (e.g., Moreland &amp;amp; Zajonc, 1976; Zajonc, 1968). Pressure, stress, and apprehension amplify the attractiveness of stimuli made familiar through prior exposure (Kruglanski, Freund, &amp;amp; Bar-Tal, 1998; Vanbeselaere, 1980). Flight to familiar comfort foods (Wansink, Cheney, &amp;amp; Chan, 2003) increases under stress, such as that arising from the pressures of college life (Kandiah, Yake, Jones, &amp;amp; Meyer, 2006). When both infants (Shore, 1994) and adults (Bornstein, 1989) desire safety, their familiarity preference increases. Conversely, by independently signaling safety, positive feelings can eliminate preferences for the familiar (de Vries, Holland, Chenier, Starr, &amp;amp; Winkielman, 2010). Norm theory (Kahneman &amp;amp; Miller, 1986) also suggests that unfamiliar choices and actions may feel less safe than familiar alternatives, because of higher anticipated regret should things go awry (Kahneman &amp;amp; Tversky, 1982; Simonson, 1992).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is a shocker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously, the Corps has told the public the London Avenue canal Safe Water Elevation (SWE) is 5 feet. That was based on a load test they did in 2007. What that means is the water shouldn't get above 5 feet in any circumstance, or a failure could occur, due to any one of a number of mechanisms. Most of the failure mechanisms trace back to the totally permeable sand in and above which the walls sit and through which Katrina's surge swept in 2005, taking out two sections of the canal walls and nearly destroying a third. Those failures happened with water far below the tops of the walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So with a five foot limitation if water starts getting high from surge, stormwater pumping, or a combination, there are two options to keep the water below 5 feet:&lt;br&gt;a) the Corps has to close the gates at the lakefront (to shut off water from the lake) or &lt;br&gt;b) the Sewerage &amp;amp; Water Board pumps have to cut back on pumping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both have happened repeatedly in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The new stuff&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the Corps hasn't told the public since they announced the 5 foot SWE in September 2007 is that they have continued studying the canal, paying for tons of  soil sampling and geotechnical analyses of the canal. Report after report has piled up. I have what I believe to be a near-complete collection of these reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this latest version of the SWE report - Version 5 - is the one that counts, and is the scariest yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It reveals that the Safe Water Elevation of the canal is actually 1.5 feet, not 5 feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, there are 7 sections of walls along both sides of the canal with SWE's below 5 feet, ranging from a high of 4 feet all the way down to 1.5 feet. The reason given in the report is that the silty layer at the bottom of the canal is so thin - less than 2 feet - that it provides no defense from water travelling through it. That's a problem, because below that silt is the sandy soil that also underlies the levees and walls. So water just goes through the silt, into the sand, and spreads under the walls, eventually pushing up the soil on the "dry," protected side of the walls. This is known as "seepage."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report also reveals that apart from a few select areas, the Corps did not conduct a comprehensive survey of the thickness of the canal bottom until February and March of 2010, despite evidence dating back years of water penetrating directly through silt to the sand below and seeping past the walls to the neighborhoods beyond. That's troubling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Corps has included a considerable "pay no attention to this report" section at the end of the report, written with a future press release in mind. This is weird beyond belief, because it basically says the report and all its work isn't really right, the walls won't fail because they haven't failed yet, and that the Corps will keep New Orleans safe, blah, blah. They even crazily suggest a breach wouldn't be so bad, because it could only happen if the lakefront gates were closed, and then only the water trapped in the canal would pour out. It's garbage. Just ignore it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The numbers are there in black and white starting on PDF page 193. And to make it simpler, they included a picture, which I have annotated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aReRFUrqRR8/TXAA1t-lcFI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/Ny2da1Ekg2c/s1600/LondonSWE_west_wall_Oct_2010.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:349px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aReRFUrqRR8/TXAA1t-lcFI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/Ny2da1Ekg2c/s400/LondonSWE_west_wall_Oct_2010.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The 1.5' SWE section - aka "Reach 13"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burrowing into the appendices to find the precise analysis that led to the 1.5 foot number (note that it is just one of &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; sub-5-foot SWE's along the canal), I discovered that along this section of the canal, a depth of 1.5 feet doesn't even put water against the wall:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_CDII6QSUuA/TXD3ji755AI/AAAAAAAAA9Y/Qe2PyHBQXEk/s1600/LondonReach13SeepGapFail.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:328px;height:400px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_CDII6QSUuA/TXD3ji755AI/AAAAAAAAA9Y/Qe2PyHBQXEk/s400/LondonReach13SeepGapFail.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Note: this graphic is taken from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; seepage analysis, but it may not be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; seepage analysis that generated the 1.5 foot number. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the height of the 3.4 foot embankment relative to the 1.5 foot SWE.] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So just normal operation of the canal would likely cause seepage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unsafe section of wall - termed "Reach 13" by the Corps - is on the west side of the canal in the 5500 block of Pratt Drive, just north of Filmore Ave. It is about 300 feet long:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rd7SVJaFhA4/TXE--m-wPGI/AAAAAAAAA-A/k6oLTs2u7q4/s1600/LondonReach13MapFromReport.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:213px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rd7SVJaFhA4/TXE--m-wPGI/AAAAAAAAA-A/k6oLTs2u7q4/s400/LondonReach13MapFromReport.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The map above is from Appendix A to the report. It is taken from images shot in late 2005 or early 2006. Of the five houses behind Reach 13 shown in that photo, all have been torn down since the photo was taken. Two - 5543 and 5551 - have been replaced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the Reach 13 neighborhood in late 2009, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=%225525+pratt%22+%22new+orleans%22&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=30.014411,-90.07073&amp;amp;sspn=0.002079,0.001768&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=5525+Pratt+Dr,+New+Orleans,+Orleans,+Louisiana+70122&amp;amp;ll=30.014242,-90.07066&amp;amp;spn=0.002079,0.001768&amp;amp;t=k&amp;amp;deg=270&amp;amp;z=19"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2OPLzEhXiM4/TYUXbbbCslI/AAAAAAAAA_A/Bp1haQU1vys/s1600/LondonReach13MapFromGoogle.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:261px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2OPLzEhXiM4/TYUXbbbCslI/AAAAAAAAA_A/Bp1haQU1vys/s400/LondonReach13MapFromGoogle.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The large amount of sand on the lot at 5525 Pratt was placed there by a Louisiana Land Trust demolition contractor after the &lt;a href="https://aca.accela.com/nola/Cap/CapDetail.aspx?Module=Permits&amp;amp;TabName=Permits&amp;amp;capID1=09BLD&amp;amp;capID2=00000&amp;amp;capID3=03717&amp;amp;agencyCode=NOLA&amp;amp;IsToShowInspection="&gt;October 26, 2009 knockdown&lt;/a&gt; of a shed on the lot. The home at 5535 Pratt was &lt;a href="https://aca.accela.com/nola/Cap/CapDetail.aspx?Module=Permits&amp;amp;TabName=Permits&amp;amp;capID1=09BLD&amp;amp;capID2=00000&amp;amp;capID3=08015&amp;amp;agencyCode=NOLA&amp;amp;IsToShowInspection="&gt;demolished&lt;/a&gt; December 19, 2009, placing this photo sometime between those two dates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is notable about this 1.5' SWE finding is that in previous London Avenue canal analyses, including &lt;a href="http://www.box.net/shared/b3g3u42139"&gt;one published in June, 2009&lt;/a&gt;, the calculated Safe Water Elevation for this same stretch of wall and levee (then known as Reach 14) was 10 feet. Now, with the improved data showing the extreme permeability of the canal bottom (the Corps' contractors actually call it an "open canal"), the idea of protection has been turned on its head. Now, it's not the walls and levees that matter, it's the bottom of the canal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summing up&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm kind of in disbelief at these developments. How many chances has the Corps had to tell the truth to the public since last October, or even since they got this result (likely months before that)? They announced a contract to remediate the canal in December, 2010, but they had nearly complete designs for that remediation way back in June, 2010. The remediation started in January, 2011 and piles are being driven today. Reach 13 is getting piles driven to -56 feet, well below the sand. But the reaches north and south aren't getting anything. Such is the patchwork pattern of the remediation, following the same pattern as the analysis effort over the last five years. We can only hope the data on the canal bottom outside those sections getting sheetpile cutoffs is correct, now and forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what about those last five years, when they were doing nothing on the canal while people have rebuilt? They can try to spin this however they like, but it just plain looks like suppressing bad news to me. Do you know how often the water in the canal gets above 1.5 feet? All the damn time, including every time there&amp;#39;s a rainstorm and the city pumps turn on. How much risk has the city unknowningly accepted since Katrina? How many times have the walls been in danger of failing? How can the Sewerage &amp;amp; Water Board now send water down the canal from their pump stations knowing that many sections of the walls (or just the embankments below the walls, like in Reach 13) cannot have water put against them? Whoever decided to withold this from the public needs to get up and publicly apologize. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.box.net/shared/5tt4liz0pq"&gt;Here's the report, including nearly all the appendices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/34394673-6379724393958107708?l=fixthepumps.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>mcbrid35</name></author><gr:likingUser>05474980847841201145</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://fixthepumps.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://fixthepumps.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Fix the pumps</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://fixthepumps.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1297724505775"><id gr:original-id="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/?p=29208">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/830a68f08b7d6431</id><category term="Commerce"/><category term="Privacy"/><category term="eLoyalty"/><title type="html">Meet the Company That Records Your Calls for Quality Assurance</title><published>2011-02-14T12:00:02Z</published><updated>2011-02-14T12:00:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.wired.com/~r/wiredbusinessblog/~3/HGBnMwFWg9M/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.wired.com/epicenter" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-29434" href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/eloyalty-call-recording/call/"&gt;&lt;img title="Customer Support" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/02/call.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m calling customer support to complain about fraudulent charges to my health insurance. Some joker has rung up multiple doctor visits to clinics in Miami, Florida — a place I’ve never even &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s according to the prearranged script. In reality, I’ve been invited to get a first hand dose of &lt;a href="http://www.eloyalty.com/"&gt;eLoyalty&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;amp;q=NASDAQ:ELOY"&gt;ELOY&lt;/a&gt;), a behavioral-analytics and customer-relations outfit that promises — among other things — to boost call-center productivity and speed customers painlessly through what many might count as their most exasperating minutes on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company touts its NASA tech and endless possibilities for making customers happy — so much so that I had to try it out myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained to pick up on verbal clues that indicate different personality types, my service rep, Lila, catches that I’m not serene like a “Yoda” or emotionally focused like an “Oprah” — two of six basic profiles in eLoyalty’s arsenal. Rather, she figures out that I’m belief-focused, with a strong helping of matter-of-factness, and helps me through the rest of call with no nonsense and no profuse apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably never heard of eLoyalty, but they’ve almost certainly heard &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; — and quickly pegged your personality by analyzing nothing more than your voice over the phone, parsing your words, pauses and even inflections on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company works with call centers that handle the nation’s biggest car-insurance firms, banks and health care organizations. They’re usually the ears listening in after the automated message promises you, “This call is being recorded for quality assurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no giant. Founded in 1990, the company is mostly privately held, and lost $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010 on revenues of $23.3 million, according to &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=113803&amp;amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2lyLmludC53ZXN0bGF3YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50L3YxLzAwMDExOTMxMjUtMTAtMjQ4MTIzL3htbA%3d%3d"&gt;SEC filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELoyalty’s premise is that training customer-service representatives, or CSRs, to quickly diagnose which of the six types of personalities a caller is leads to happier customers and shorter calls. And shorter calls matter, because when it comes to customer service, time is money — somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 to $1.50 per minute, depending on how you account for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it promises even more. ELoyalty says that its system can help companies know the core personality type of each of their customers, so they can individually tailor websites and e-mails to each one. Taken to its logical conclusions, it could promise a new model of customer targeting that’s far less invasive that web tracking — if it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be awesome.  Would love to have for my task manager and simplenote.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Macworld last week, Nuance, makers of DragonDictate for Mac and iOS announced the release of &lt;a href="http://blog.dragonmobileapps.com/2011/01/mobile-app-developer-dragon-mobile-sdk.html"&gt;their own software development kit&lt;/a&gt; to embed Dragon’s voice recognition technologies in iOS apps. I think this is a big deal. Third party app developers should now be able to add voice recognition tools to their apps with a simple call to the Dragon engine. I can think of several apps on my iPhone and iPad right now that would get way better if I could talk to them. Imagine adding new tasks to your favorite task management application, doing Web searches in your browser, or composing documents in your text editor all with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other company I’ve seen create this sort of iOS resource is Smile’s TextExpander Touch that appears to be &lt;a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/touch/applist.html"&gt;quite successful.&lt;/a&gt; If the execution is as easy as Nuance reports (I haven’t seen it myself) then we are going to be talking to our iOS devices soon.&lt;/p&gt;

Create Calendar is for emails that have an event that I want to attend.  My assistant simply creates the calendar event for me.  Create KB (Knowledge Base)  means the email should get added to our companies Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Contact &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For emails that might have someone’s Cell Phone number or other pertinent contact information that I want add to our contact list.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create To Do – 1.Week  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are emails that need a response, but it can wait to the weekend.  I still try to answer these emails before then.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create To 2. Someday&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contains emails that don’t need any response but I might want to glance over at a later time.  Nothing in here is that important.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Bayer and Lawot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are storage folders for all emails.  Once an email in the other folders has been acted upon,  it is added in Craig if it is personal or Lawot if work related.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The beauty of this system is that it keeps you in control of your inbox and allows you to filter out the fluff while leaving the important items on top.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Other Observations&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create To Do – Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I used to have a folder called Create To Do – Today where I would put emails that needed to be answered that day.  I decided to just leave them in the Inbox so I could not possibly ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone / IPad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craigbayer.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c030153ef0147e1f8fe02970b-pi"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;padding-top:0px" title="photo" border="0" alt="photo" src="http://craigbayer.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c030153ef0147e1f8fe1e970b-pi" width="177" height="264"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This system works particular well with the iPhone and  iPad and was mainly designed because of those devices.  It is very easily to read emails on my iPhone and move them to the appropriate folder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This one is a little out in left field.   I am not a fan of cars.  I own one and I travel frequently, but I think that the act of driving is a time suck.  I find that when I am living in cities with public transportation this system works extremely well and I get almost all of my emails answered on the bus rides to and from work, leaving the rest of my day extremely productive.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange / Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am using Microsoft Hosted Exchange which cost’s $5 a month a mailbox (minimum of 5 boxes) and offers 25gb of storage per Mailbox.  I am also using Outlook 2010 which has many more features to effectively manage email which I will discuss later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Thomas Goetz is the executive editor of Wired and author of “The Decision Tree: Taking Control of Your Health in the New Era of Personalized Medicine.  From the Talk Abstract “Your medical chart: it’s hard to access, impossible to read — and full of information that could make you healthier if you just knew how to use it. At TEDMED, Thomas Goetz looks at medical data, making a bold call to redesign it and get more insight from it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beating Ken Jennings at Jeopardy is simply an incredible achievement, far beyond beating Kasparov at chess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full games will air Feb 14th – 16th.  I hope they made it sing “Daisy Bell” if it loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been watching &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ibm"&gt;IBM’s YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, and I find the user comments depressing.  Very few people are grasping what they have done here.  I am trying to figure out how I would explain this to a non-technical family member.  I think it is hard to project my feelings to someone who has never tried to program a machine to act “smart”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people — including technology journalists — do not really know how computers work.  Computers, like most technology, are essentially “magic”, and this all looks like just another example of the same kind of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have a computer science degree from MIT.  I know how your desktop works, and your iPhone, and your iPad, from the transistors all the way through the operating system and the software stack.  I believe I could create Windows, or Linux, or Facebook, or Twitter, or even Google, given enough time.  Put another way, if you transported me back 100 years, I could show them how to create all of these things…  Or at least accelerate the process by a few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I could not even begin to tell you how IBM did this.  Like I said, had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would have said it was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From where I sit, Watson is magic.  I feel like I am watching a major historical event that will be lucky to register as a blip on the 24-hour news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nemo</name></author><gr:likingUser>01574183654522581150</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/https://self-evident.org/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/https://self-evident.org/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">self-evident</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://self-evident.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295229341315"><id gr:original-id="http://marshallk.com/?p=1089">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcd4a215a84da314</id><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">How to Use Twitter Plus Needlebase to Discover Fabulous Things</title><published>2011-01-16T02:33:05Z</published><updated>2011-01-16T02:33:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MarshallsWebToolBlog/~3/Arm_HLEWmbM/how-to-use-twitter-plus-needlebase-to-discover-fabulous-things" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://marshallk.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110116-dtpea8ixjcgr18wbxp2u8qyd12.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My PR buddy Julie Wohlberg asked me tonight if I knew any good journalists she should invite to a social media conference in Florida called &lt;a href="http://www.sheblogsconference.com/"&gt;SheCon&lt;/a&gt;.  ReadWriteWeb’s Sarah Perez in Tampa was apparently inaccessible, so I took a few minutes to explore some possibilities…with web applications!  I used the DIY data extraction and normalization service &lt;a href="http://needlebase.com"&gt;Needlebase&lt;/a&gt;, along with Twitter list search engine &lt;a href="http://Tlists.com"&gt;Tlists&lt;/a&gt; and of course Twitter itself to discover &lt;strong&gt;a list of journalists in the South of the US who have more than 2000 Twitter followers.&lt;/strong&gt; (Mapped above)  It wasn’t hard to do at all!  Here they are in one Twitter list you can follow:  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SheConExpo/top-se-journalists"&gt;Top South East Journalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did was use Tlists to find 3 Twitter lists of 500 journalists (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnmcquaid/journalists/members"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/latenitecoder/journalists/members"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kitson/journalists"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), curated by people I was familiar with.  Then I used Needlebase to scrape the usernames, locations, number of followers and number of tweets (just for fun) of all the people on those three lists.  Then I told Needlebase to exclude anyone with fewer than 2000 followers and show me the remaining ones on a map, grouped by the State they were in.  Then I copied their usernames into a text file and sent it to Julie.  It was super fun, similar in many ways to this post I put up here last week about &lt;a href="http://marshallk.com/corporate-social-strategists-on-twitter-resources-charts"&gt;the Twitter and LinkedIn habits of Corporate Social Strategists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method isn’t complete until you say: hey everyone reading this post, if I missed anyone – let me know and we’ll add you to the list! Machines can work pretty fast, in this case I was slowed down by making a video and talking about it but was able to do all this in about an hour.  That’s awesome, but it’s not perfect until there’s a touch of human follow-up too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does one do such things at all though?  How about I show you a screencast?  Hooray!  Below are links to 3 videos demonstrating how I did all that.  Jing, the free service I used, is limited to 5 minute videos, so there are three and the last one ends a little abruptly.  None the less, I hope that you will find them useful and will go out and scrape all kinds of wonderful things for yourself, from all kinds of web pages!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re able to, check out &lt;a href="http://www.sheblogsconference.com/"&gt;SheConf&lt;/a&gt; in May!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://screencast.com/t/oa4D4eYKhcP"&gt;Video 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://screencast.com/t/kC0trXUfDYs"&gt;Video 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://screencast.com/t/3HsOdcUYHA"&gt;Video 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watched those videos, I did that 3X with three different Twitter Lists.  Yay!  Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;

At any given moment, there's a running commentary unfolding in our stream of consciousness, an incessant soliloquy of observations, questions and opinions. But what's the best way to structure all this introspective chatter? What kind of words should we whisper to ourselves? And does all this self-talk even matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the fascinating questions asked in a new &lt;a href="http://www.psych.illinois.edu/~dalbarra/pubs/Wll%20I%20I%20will.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; led by Ibrahim Senay and Dolores Albarracin, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and published in &lt;a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/03/05/0956797610364751.abstract"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;. The experiment was straightforward. Fifty three undergrads were divided into two groups. The first group was told to prepare for an anagram-solving task by thinking, for one minute, about whether they would work on anagrams. This is the "Will I?" condition, which the scientists refer to as the "interrogative form of self-talk". The second group, in contrast, was told to spend one minute thinking that they would work on anagrams. This is the "I Will" condition, or the "declarative form of self-talk". Both groups were then given ten minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, we might assume that the "I Will" group would solve more anagrams. After all, they are committing themselves to the task, silently asserting that they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; solve the puzzles. The interrogative group, on the other hand, was just asking themselves a question; there was no commitment, just some inner uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not what happened. It turned out that that the "Will I?" group solved nearly 25 percent more anagrams. When people asked themselves a question - Can I do this? - they became more motivated to actually do it, which allowed them to solve more puzzles. This suggests that the Nike slogan should be "Just do it?" and not "Just do it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is interrogative self-talk more effective? Subsequent experiments by the scientists suggested that the power of the "Will I?" condition resides in its ability to elicit intrinsic motivation. (We are intrinsically motivated when we are doing an activity for ourselves, because we enjoy it. In contrast, extrinsic motivation occurs when we're doing something for a paycheck or any "extrinsic" reward.) By interrogating ourselves, we set up a well-defined challenge that we can master. And it is this desire for personal fulfillment - being able to tell ourselves that we solved the anagrams - that actually motivates us to keep on trying. Here is an excerpt from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Self-posed questions about a future behavior may inspire thoughts about autonomous or intrinsically motivated reasons to pursue a goal, leading to interrogative self-talk and intention forming corresponding intentions and ultimately performing the behavior. In fact, people are more likely to engage in a behavior when they have intrinsic motivation (i.e., when they feel personally responsible for their action) than when they have extrinsic motivation (i.e., when they feel external factors such as other people are responsible for their action) in diverse domains from education to medical treatment to addiction recovery to task performance&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have recognized the importance of intrinsic motivation for decades. In the 1970s, Mark Lepper, David Greene and Richard Nisbett conducted a classic study on preschoolers who liked to draw. They divided the kids into three groups. The first group of kids was told that they'd get a reward - a nice blue ribbon with their name on it - if they continued to draw. The second group wasn't told about the rewards but was given a blue ribbon after drawing. (This was the "unexpected reward" condition.) Finally, the third group was the "no award" condition. They weren't even told about the blue ribbons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of reinforcement, the scientists observed the preschoolers during a typical period of free play. Here's where the results get interesting: The kids in the "no award' and "unexpected award" conditions kept on drawing with the same enthusiasm as before. Their behavior was unchanged. In contrast, the preschoolers in the "award" group now showed much less interest in the activity. Instead of drawing, they played with blocks, or took a nap, or went outside. The reason was that their intrinsic motivation to draw had been contaminated by blue ribbons; the extrinsic reward had diminished the pleasure of playing with crayons and paper. (Daniel Pink, in his excellent book &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, refers to this as the "Sawyer Effect".)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you're faced with a difficult task, don't look at a Nike ad, and don't think about the extrinsic rewards of success. Instead, ask yourself a simple question: Will I do this? I think I will.&lt;/p&gt;
