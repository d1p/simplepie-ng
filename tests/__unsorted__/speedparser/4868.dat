		<title>Foreign Mathematics</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I got back on campus last weekend after a week stop in Istanbul. I have to say, the city is full of amazing things to see, but one thing in particular got my attention.

		<title>Russian Lottery</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Today, during my microeconomics class at UC Berkeley, I came across an interesting paradox that reminded me of one of The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk main thesis.

		<title>Working at Facebook</title>
		<description><![CDATA[It has been a while since I posted anything here. I started working at Facebook in Palo Alto last week. I have to admit it is pretty different from my previous work term.

		<title>Basic Data Structure Addition to Batfish</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Batfish is collection of data structures and algorithms written in Ruby that I started about a month ago. While trying to implement graphs in the library, I quickly realised that a number of basic data structure were missing to implement certain graph algorithms.
