&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Among my peer group [educated people in their 20s-30s] I see a &amp;quot;mono-modal&amp;quot; fixation on cycling, very  similar to the attitude many drivers have that their primary mode should  be everyone&amp;#39;s primary mode. It really is remarkable how many young,  affluent, educated folks living in inner Portland see cycling as the  only legitimate travel mode for all people everywhere. My [peers]  basically scoff at the idea that I might prefer to take the bus to and  from school when it is rainy or dark out. I see walking, biking, and  transit as three completely complementary modes that support a car-free  or car-light lifestyle, but I&amp;#39;m realizing that in Portland at least  there is a large group of people in the cycling community who see both  cars and buses as the enemy, or at least not an option worth considering  or supporting. This might help explain TriMet&amp;#39;s underinvestment in the  bus network, since politically active young people do not support  transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been away from Portland too long to have my own impression, but if this is true it&amp;#39;s certainly unfortunate.  While &lt;a href="http://www.humantransit.org/2011/01/bicycle-vs-transit-problems.html"&gt;there are some conflicts between bicycles and transit&lt;/a&gt; in road design, I have always tried to accommodate both.  I don&amp;#39;t necessarily believe bike lanes can be accommodated on every street, any more than transit is, but I do think both cycling and transit deserve and can have complete and functional networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How common is a monomodal fixation on bicycles?  If so, why does it occur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with cycling advocacy, or advocacy of any mode, until it becomes hostile toward other aspects of the full sustainable transport package.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t advocacy for the suite of sustainable transport options (walking, cycling and transit, supplemented by carsharing etc.) be more effective than endless conflicts among these modes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HumanTransit/~4/Y56HZAwMOIM" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jarrett at HumanTransit.org</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.humantransit.org/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.humantransit.org/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Human Transit</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.humantransit.org/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317664414026"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2418000157729885340.post-628674261707509531">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b42a18e93dc4bd9</id><category term="boots" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="bag" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="scarf" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="coffee" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="coat" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="seniors" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="germany" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="vancouver" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">VCC in Cologne</title><published>2011-10-03T17:53:00Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T17:53:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://vancouvercyclechic.blogspot.com/2011/10/vcc-in-cologne.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://vancouvercyclechic.blogspot.com/feeds/628674261707509531/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2418000157729885340&amp;postID=628674261707509531&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://vancouvercyclechic.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vancouvercyclechic/6195065954/" title="P1140145 by Vancouver Cycle Chic, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6195065954_b1719771fa_b.jpg" width="820" height="547" alt="P1140145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vancouvercyclechic/6194550349/" title="P1140189 by Vancouver Cycle Chic, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6194550349_b1a3987ab5_b.jpg" width="820" height="547" alt="P1140189"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vancouvercyclechic/6194549333/" title="P1140172 by Vancouver Cycle Chic, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6142/6194549333_9977ca9588_b.jpg" width="820" height="547" alt="P1140172"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Had a quick stop in Cologne.

It’s widely believed that the first Nokia Windows Phone, codenamed Sea Ray, &lt;a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2011/06/23/nokia-windows-phone-leaked-codenamed-sea-ray/"&gt;will look exactly like the recently launched Nokia N9&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that’s been on everyone’s mind is how exactly will Nokia make their Windows Phones stand out compared to what the competition brings to the table? Microsoft is keeping a tight grip on their new OS, going so far as to dictate what type of chips handset makers will be able to use when building Windows Phone devices. With such little room to breathe, the only way you can innovate is with software. Long Zheng, of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20111002/nokia-maps-for-windows-phone-7-marketplace-listing-screenshots-revealed/"&gt;iStartedSomething&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; blog, recently noticed that Nokia Maps was listed in the Windows Phone Markerplace. While you can’t install the application yet, you can look at some of the screenshots, and we’ve got to admit, it looks incredibly clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nokmap1.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question that we’re looking forward to asking Nokia’s people at Nokia World later this month is whether Nokia Maps will stay a Nokia exclusive or whether other handset makers will be able to preinstall it on their devices? If it’s the latter case, then we again return to the question posed earlier of how exactly will Nokia differentiate themselves? There’s build quality, because we all know there’s something about holding a Nokia in your hand than something made by Samsung. There’s design. There’s also imagining performance. And then there’s the elephant in the room, the Nokia brand. Lots of folks were burned by the Nokia N97, swearing never to buy another Nokia device again. Many more gave up on Nokia after seeing them fail, year after year, to compete with Android and iOS. Will Nokia’s Windows Phones make them reconsider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too early to tell, but let’s just say that this month is looking incredibly exciting for mobile enthusiasts. New iPhone, new Nexus, and now this!&lt;/p&gt;

First Adobe just had Jeffrey Veen on stage to show folks Typekit (which &lt;a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2011/10/03/adobe-acquires-typekit/"&gt;Adobe has acquired&lt;/a&gt;). I am very interested to see how the service changes (functionality and price!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we come to Nitobi. I consider Andre, Brian, and Dave, personal friends. The guys are pure awesome, and I am so excited for them on &lt;a href="http://www.phonegap.com/2011/10/03/nitobi-enters-into-acquisition-agreement-with-adobe-2/"&gt;their acquisition news&lt;/a&gt;. PhoneGap has massive potential, and I am intrigued to see what happens under the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/andre/?p=797"&gt;stewardship of Adobe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in time Ben and I almost joined Adobe. I remember giving presentations to them on how Flash could be used for massive good on the Web. This was back in the Gears days, and I thought that Flash could uses its deployment power to push Web standards. If Flash was implemented these standards, then developers could rely on them and then browsers could join in. Note that back then, browsers weren’t moving quite as fast, especially Microsoft. Things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at PhoneGap and see so much that it can become. Most people see it as a tool to wrap up a web page in a way in which it can be deployed to some devices. That is all fine, but there is more. I am actually very excited about PhoneGap plugins, and the ability to deploy native functionality. This is the type of model that we are working with @WalmartLabs. The same code can be driven differently depending on the platform. The end result is a great experience wherever you are. Right now. No need to wait for HTC to fix that darn bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I have long hoped that someone would build a WebKit port that is focused on developers. Instead of having to write for the fragmented landscape, what if you could also choose to deploy to a particular version of a WebKit++ Web runtime. Think Adobe AIR but using Web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, congrats guys, and I can’t wait to see what you come up with at Adobe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I will be blogging occasionally, The Wirecutter is not another tech blog.The Wirecutter is mostly a list of amazing gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider it a Billboard for electronics; a Casey Kasem Top 40 if Casey Kasem were a geek; a wink and a nod to those engineers who have built something wonderful. The point is to make it easier for you to buy some great gear quickly and get on with your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choices I’ve made here took days of research and years of experience, interviews, data from the best editorial and user sources around. Most gadgets I choose here aren’t the top of the line models that are loaded up with junk features or overpriced; most of the ones we’ve picked are of the &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;great enough&amp;quot; variety, because this is generally where our needs and the right prices smash into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the same gadgets I&amp;#39;d recommend to my friends and family, and these are the same gadgets I’d choose for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also developed The Wirecutter because I think the gadget news cycle is not very good at floating the best gear. Content on most blogs is arranged in reverse chronological order. But the best gadgets in any given category come out in a cadence set months apart. And the rumble of a large tech publication generally means a high noise to signal ratio–what the trolls call a slow news day. And in gadget land, almost every day is a slow news day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlines like this: &amp;quot;Exclusive: Motorola Spyder (Droid RAZR for Verizon?) features industry-first qHD Super AMOLED display, LTE, dual-core processor.&amp;quot; Or “Why Not All Jurassic Park Characters Were Created Equal.” No offense meant, but I do not want to spend my remaining days writing stuff like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, good gadgets get covered up quickly in fast moving tech publications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, The Wirecutter is going to be quiet. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll post. But I&amp;#39;ll keep the noise down. And I&amp;#39;ll make sure our list stays updated and ready for the next time you have to find your next great gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Thank you to Craige, Dan, Choire, John S, Beamer Cola and Dave at Intel for going along with this crazy idea. Special thanks to Kyle V and Brian X Chen for shouldering a lot of the research and helping to put this all together in a few days. And thank you to friends at the major testing outlets like John Falcone and his team at CNET, Sascha Segan at PC Magazine, Mark Spoonauer at Laptop Magazine, among many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we&amp;#39;ve got another design coming in the next few days. Look out for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Lam</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheWirecutter"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheWirecutter</id><title type="html">The Wirecutter</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thewirecutter.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317663824632"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-6a00d8341cca6b53ef01539209fe6b970b">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9739b3955a75d1bb</id><category term="Interfaces &amp; Interaction" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Personal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Software Development" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Making Sense of Sensors, Future of Mobile 2011</title><published>2011-10-03T15:41:12Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T15:41:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.tomhume.org/2011/10/making-sense-of-sensors-future-of-mobile-2011.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.tomhume.org/2011/10/making-sense-of-sensors-future-of-mobile-2011.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.tomhume.org/" xml:lang="en-GB" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been getting quietly interested in the sensors embedded in mobiles over the last few years, and &lt;a href="http://carsonified.com/"&gt;Carsonified&lt;/a&gt; kindly gave me a chance to think out loud about it, in a talk at &lt;a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/london-2011/"&gt;Future of Mobile&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org/"&gt;dConstruct&lt;/a&gt; I noted that &lt;a href="http://yiibu.com/"&gt;Bryan and Steph&lt;/a&gt; produce &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/letting-go-9109114"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; for their talks which work well when read (as opposed to presented), and I wanted to try and do the same; hopefully there's more of a narrative in &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/making-sense-of-sensors-9374767"&gt;my deck&lt;/a&gt; than in the past. And it goes something like this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mental models of ourselves are brains-driving-bodies, and the way we've structured our &lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"&gt;mind-bicycles&lt;/a&gt; is a bit like this too: emphasis on the "brain" (processor and memory). But this is quite limiting, and as devices multiply in number and miniaturise, it's an increasingly unhelpful analogy: a modern mobile is physically and economically more sensor than CPU. And perhaps we're due for a shift in thinking along the lines of geo-to-heliocentrism, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution"&gt;gene selection theory&lt;/a&gt;, realising that the most important bit of personal computing isn't, as we've long thought, the brain-like processor in the middle, but rather the flailing little sensor-tentacles at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no shortage of sensors; when I ran &lt;a href="https://market.android.com/search?q=sensor&amp;amp;so=1&amp;amp;c=apps"&gt;a test app&lt;/a&gt; on my Samsung Galaxy S2, I was surprised to find not just acceleration, a magnetometer and orientation but light, proximity, a gyroscope, gravity, linear acceleration and a rotation vector sensor. There's also obviously microphone, touch screen, physical keys, GPS, and all the radio kit (which can measure signal strengths) - plus cameras of course. And in combination with internet access, there's second-order uses for some of these: a wi-fi SSID can be resolved to a physical location, say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need these extra senses in our devices. The bandwidth between finger and screen is starting to become a limiting factor in the communication between man and device - so to communicate more expressively, we need to look beyond poking a touch-screen. Voice is one way that a few people (Google thus far, Apple probably real soon) are looking - and voice recognition nowadays is tackled &lt;a href="http://castroller.com/Podcasts/ItConversations/2446996-Mike%20Cohen%20-%20Speech%20Technology%20at%20Google"&gt;principally with vast datasets&lt;/a&gt;. Look around the academic literature and you'll find many MSc projects which hope to derive context from accelerometer measurements; many of them work reasonably well in the lab and fail in the real world, which leads me to wonder if there's a similar statistical approach that could be usefully taken here too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, the operating system tends to use sensors really subtly, and in ways that seem a bit magical the first time you see them. I remember vividly turning my first iPhone around and around, watching the display rotate landscape-to-portrait and back again. Apps don't tend to be quite so magical; the original Google voice search was the best example I could think of of this kind of magic in a third-party app: hold the phone up to your ear, and it used accelerometer and proximity sensors to know it was there, and prompt you to say what you were looking for - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ3Glr5Ff28"&gt;beautiful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why aren't apps as magical as the operating system use of sensors? In the case of iPhone, a lot of the stuff you might want to use is tucked away in private APIs. There was &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/google_mobile_uses_private_iphone_apis"&gt;a bit of a furore&lt;/a&gt; about that Google search app at the time, and the feature has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In fact the different ways in which mobile platforms expose sensors are, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&amp;#39;s_Law"&gt;Conway&lt;/a&gt;-like, a reflection of the organisations behind those platforms. iOS is a carefully curated Disneyland, beautifully put together but with no stepping outside the park gates. Android offers studly raw access to anything you like. And the web is &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/"&gt;still under discussion&lt;/a&gt; with a Generic Sensor API listed as "exploratory work", so veer off-piste to &lt;a href="http://www.phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; if you want to get much done in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dug around for a few examples of interesting stuff in this area: &lt;a href="http://www.gymfu.com/"&gt;GymFu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://labs.laan.com/wp/products/sonar-ruler/"&gt;Sonar Ruler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://noisetube.net/"&gt;NoiseTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/dshed/hills-are-evil"&gt;Hills Are Evil&lt;/a&gt;; and I spoke to a few of the folks behind these projects. One message which came through loud-and-clear is that the processing required for all their applications could be done on-device. This surprised me, I expected some of this analysis to be done on a server somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of real-world messiness also came up a few times: unlike a lab, the world is full of noise, and in a lab setting you would never pack your sensors so tightly together inside a single casing. GymFu found, for instance, that the case design of the second generation iPod touch fed vibrations from the speaker into the accelerometer. And NoiseTube noticed that smartphone audio recording is optimised for speech, which made it less adequate for general-purpose noise monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components vary, too, as you can see in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gFqAEuioi4"&gt;this video comparing the proximity sensor of the iPhone 3G and 4&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20017203-233.html"&gt;Apple had to apologise for&lt;/a&gt;. With operating systems designed to sit atop varying hardware from many manufacturers (i.e. Android), we can reasonably expect variance in hardware sensors to be much worse. Again, NoiseTube found that the HTC Desire HD was unsuitable for their app because it cut off sound at around 78dB - entirely reasonable for a device designed to transmit speech, not so good for their purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't forget battery life: you can't escape this constraint in mobile, and most sensor-based applications will be storying, analysing or transmitting data after gathering it - all of which takes power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.toimg.net/managed/images/10019611/w482/h298/image.jpg" width="240" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"&gt;I closed on a slight tangent, talking about a few places we can look for inspiration. I want to talk about these separately some time, but briefly they were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials"&gt;Dark Materials&lt;/a&gt; trilogy of Philip Pullman, and daemons in particular. If these little animalistic manifestations of souls, simultaneously representing their owners whilst acting independently on their behalf, aren't good analogies for a mobile I don't know what is. And who hasn't experienced &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercision"&gt;intercision&lt;/a&gt; when leaving their phone at home, eh…? Chatting to Mark Curtis about this a while back, he also reckoned that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Knife"&gt;Subtle Knife&lt;/a&gt; itself ("&lt;em&gt;a tool that can create windows between worlds&lt;/em&gt;") is another analogy for mobile lurking in the trilogy;
&lt;li&gt; The work of artists who give us new ways to play with existing senses - and I'm thinking particularly of &lt;a href="http://chriswoebken.com/animalsuperpowers.html"&gt;Animal Superpowers&lt;/a&gt; by Kenichi Okada and Chris Woebken, which I saw demonstrated &lt;a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/03/this-happened.html"&gt;a few years back&lt;/a&gt; and has stuck with me ever since;
&lt;li&gt; Artists who open up new senses. &lt;a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/"&gt;Timo Arnall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://berglondon.com/"&gt;BERG&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timo/sets/72157626020532597/"&gt;Light paintings&lt;/a&gt;. Nuff said.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all happy-clappy-future-shiny of course. I worry about who stores or owns rights to my sensor data and what future analysis might show up. When we have &lt;a href="http://jtt.rsmjournals.com/content/15/7/339.abstract"&gt;telehaematologists diagnosing blood diseases from camera phone pictures&lt;/a&gt;, what will be done with the data gathered today? Most current projects like NoiseTube sidestep the issue by being voluntary, but I can imagine incredibly convenient services which would rely on its being gathered constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary: the mental models we have for computers don’t fit the devices we have today, which can reach much further out into the real world and do stuff - whether it be useful or frivolous. We need to think about our devices differently to really get all the possible applications, but a few people are starting to do this. Different platforms let you do this in different ways, and standardisation is rare - either in software or hardware. And there’s a pile of interesting practical and ethical problems just around the corner, waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just manufacturing and public sector jobs being empheralized in this slide into the New Depression. Media people, writers, actors, artists, musicians, and other creatives are being put out of work, and moving back in with mom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Timberg, &lt;a href="http://entertainment.salon.com/2011/10/01/creative_class_is_a_lie/?source=newsletter"&gt;The creative class is a lie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] for those who deal with ideas, culture and creativity at street level  — the working- or middle-classes within the creative class — things are  less cheery. Book editors, journalists, video store clerks, musicians,  novelists without tenure — they’re among the many groups struggling  through the dreary combination of economic slump and Internet reset. The  creative class is melting, and the story is largely untold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s happening at all levels, small and large. &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/40-sad-portraits-of-closed-record-stores"&gt;Record shops&lt;/a&gt; and independent bookstores close at a steady clip; newspapers and magazines announce &lt;a href="http://newspaperlayoffs.com/"&gt;new waves of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;.  Tower Records crashed in 2006, costing 3,000 jobs. This summer’s  bankruptcy of Borders Books — almost 700 stores closed, putting roughly &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/09/16/why-big-companies-are-axing-jobs"&gt;11,000 people&lt;/a&gt; out of work — is the most &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/is-the-death-of-borders-really-good-for-independent-bookstores/245095/"&gt;tangible and recent&lt;/a&gt; example. One of the last video rental shops in Los Angeles — Rocket Video — &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/25/business/la-fi-cover-dvd-future-20110925-1"&gt;just announced that it will close&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a grand scale, some &lt;a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/11/10/12-industries-still-losing-jobs"&gt;260,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt; have been lost in traditional publishing since 2007, according to U.S. News and World Report. In newspapers alone, the website &lt;a href="http://www.newspaperlayoffs.com/"&gt;Newspaperlayoffs.com&lt;/a&gt; has tracked some 40,000 job cuts since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these employees are young people killing time behind a counter; it’s hard for them, but they will live to fight again. But education, talent and experience — criteria that help define  Florida’s creative class, making these supposedly valued workers the  equivalent of testosterone injections for cities — does not guarantee  that a “knowledge worker” can make a real living these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s  sort of like job growth in Texas,” says Joe Donnelly, a former deputy  editor at L.A. Weekly, laid off in 2008 and now pouring savings and the  money he made from a home sale into a literary magazine. “Gov. Perry  created thousands of jobs, but they’re all at McDonald’s. Now everyone  has a chance to make 15 cents. People are just pecking, hunting,  scratching the dirt for freelance work. Living week to week, month to  month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is complex, but hinges on what makes up a  society. We need the manufacturing and engineering of things in our society, too, and having exported a great deal of that to other countries we find a critical spark — and the economics that goes with it — comes from the making of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative class — at least the largest fraction of it — needs a multi-layered society to support it. Not all of our creatives are making art that appeals to the entire world. For example, some great chefs cook in small restaurants in second-tier cities, not just in the top 100 restaurants in New York, Shanghai, or London. But if people can’t afford to have dinner out, those cooks will be back working at Olive Garden or on a food truck.&lt;/p&gt;

While the buzz for months has been around an “iPhone 5,” there is a distinct possibility that Apple won’t actually announce one tomorrow — it may only reveal an upgraded version of the iPhone 4, potentially called the iPhone 4S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this happens — and I have no idea what’s actually going to happen — it seems that Apple observers and investors might be disappointed by this news. &lt;em&gt;You mean it’s been 16 months since the iPhone 4 launched and Apple still hasn’t designed a new handset?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that would be a short-sighted reaction. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any sort of iPhone 4S would likely have much higher performance than the current iPhone 4, including a faster processor, better camera, more memory, better graphics capabilities, faster networking, and better or similar battery life. In other words, a much better phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that what makes an iPhone &lt;em&gt;an iPhone&lt;/em&gt; is mostly software. Apple’s iOS is still what matters the most, and that doesn’t need a new case design to be great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The iPhone 4 is still the &lt;a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/08/npd-iphone-2q11/"&gt;best-selling single phone in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, even more than a year after it first launched. There is nothing wrong with its look or design. The retina display is still amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2009, the year that the iPhone 3GS was Apple’s high-end iPhone for the holidays, it still managed to grow December quarter iPhone shipments by 100% year-over-year. And that wasn’t even a launch quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 90% of Americans &lt;a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/8/comScore_Reports_July_2011_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share"&gt;still don’t own&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone. Heck, two-thirds of Americans still &lt;a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/08/comscore-mobile-july-2011/"&gt;don’t own a &lt;em&gt;smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So the iPhone 4 design wouldn’t seem “old” to them. (Not any more than the Motorola RAZR that they still use.) Even existing iPhone 4 users who want more speed and a newer device would be well-served by the upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This way, Apple could save a major iPhone 5 redesign for next year, potentially including 4G LTE compatibility and NFC support, two things I haven’t read rumored for any sort of iPhone 4S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And lastly, keeping the same case design may help Apple in production, so it doesn’t face any shortages this time around. Apple’s December quarter should see record iPhone demand, potentially over 25 million units. It’s important not to have any significant trouble delivering, because &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; how you lose to the competition. (Keeping the same case design may even boost — or at least help maintain — margins, too. Not the only thing that matters, but a nice bonus.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about all these leaked plastic sleeve designs for some sort of new iPhone shape? Who knows. Maybe they were based on a prototype that never materialized. Maybe Apple leaked something to send the case designers off on a tangent. Maybe it’s the new iPod touch. Maybe it’s a Samsung phone. Maybe they’re real and Apple will unveil an iPhone 5 tomorrow. We’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter what, it would be silly to be disappointed by “only an iPhone 4S.” If there’s anything Apple needs to do, it’s to increase iPhone distribution in the U.S. and further differentiate itself with software and services — not just show up with a new case design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s good to be skeptical about Adobe. They certainly have mostly fumbled so far on mobile. But they finally seem to be doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and they seem to actually understand that even if HTML5 beats Flash, people will still need creative tools to make stuff. And Adobe, so far, is still the best one to deliver those tools.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been playing with online learning since late 1990′s, but colleagues at Athabasca University and other open university systems have been at it much longer under the term of “distance learning” or “distance education”. Today, it’s rare to read commentary on education that doesn’t a) call for urgent reforms, and b) tie reforms to online learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the NYTimes details the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/opinion/the-university-of-wherever.html"&gt;University of Wherever&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on the Stanford open course in Artificial Intelligence. The article acknowledges, briefly, the history of online learning in community colleges, and then goes on to detail how “elite” universities like Stanford will disrupt education. Quoting the lead professor in the course, Sebastian Thrun, the article author states: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrun acknowledges that there are still serious quality-control problems to be licked. How do you keep an invisible student from cheating? How do you even know who is sitting at that remote keyboard? Will the education really be as compelling — and will it last? Thrun believes there are technological answers to all of these questions, some of them&lt;br&gt;
being worked out already by other online frontiersmen.&lt;br&gt;
“If we can solve this,” he said, “I think it will disrupt all of higher education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open online courses offer the prospect of scaling what was previously unscalable. The printing press enabled large scale reproduction of text. The web enabled content reproduction and sharing with dramatically reduced costs. The emerging web (web 2.0 or whatever term you prefer) allows a new kind of scaling: social interaction, and, by extension, teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m quite interested to see how the Stanford courses will manage the social aspect. The first approach – opening lectures and giving students tools or techniques for experimentation and self-evaluation – is about content scaling. The second approach of creating an ecosystem where learners can self-organize and form sub-clusters for learning activities is a more complex challenge. This challenge, however, is critical if the course is to move past traditional course model and into something quite new. The “quite new” aspect in this case is the ability for individuals to not only interact with the curriculum Thrun has created, but to build, extend, improve, challenge, and enhance the knowledge domain of the course. In addition to expanding the course knowledge domain, learners also need to engage in shared wayfinding and social sensemaking techniques to learn. Thrun is not scalable. Social interactions between learners, on the other hand, are scalable. This latter aspect is where all the fun stuff and innovation in education will happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gsiemens</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">elearnspace</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317655674866"><id gr:original-id="http://www.ecovelo.info/?p=30845">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1713fc6a9f364995</id><category term="Commuting"/><category term="Photos"/><title type="html">Monday Morning Commute: Pink Skies at Night</title><published>2011-10-03T15:22:15Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T15:22:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ecovelo/posts/~3/4tskK0418uE/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.ecovelo.info/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ecovelo.info/images/20111003-commute.jpg" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="5" width="485" height="647" alt="Monday Morning Commute"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Converting bikes to real commuter bicycles souns like a viable niche to me #butWhatDoIKnowTheBicycleBizIsHard&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the afternoon converting a friend’s &lt;a href="http://co-motion.com/index.php/singles/norwester"&gt;Co-Motion Nor’Wester&lt;/a&gt; drop-bar touring bike into an upright, all-weather city bike. He’s been primarily riding the bike in the city for the past couple of years, and with no tours on the horizon, we both thought he’d enjoy the bike more if it was set-up appropriately for the type of riding he does everyday. Here’s the parts list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ecovelo.info/2009/11/23/nitto-north-road-v-nitto-albatross/"&gt;Nitto North Road Handlebars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=935"&gt;Thomson Elite Stem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paulcomp.com/cantilever.html"&gt;Paul Canti Levers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=4515"&gt;Shimano Dura-Ace Bar-End Shifters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brookssaddles.com/catalogue-and-shop/saddles/City%20&amp;amp;%20Heavy%20Duty/B67/"&gt;Brooks B67 Saddle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/accessories/fenders/fender-sets/vo-45mm-stainless-fenders-700c.html"&gt;Velo Orange Stainless Steel Fenders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rivbike.com/product-p/gt5.htm"&gt;Cork Grips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paulcomp.com/ginolightmount.html"&gt;Paul Gino Light Mounts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fenix-LD20-180-Lumen-Flashlight/dp/B004CXNY3G"&gt;Fenix LD20 Headlights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecom1.planetbike.com/3034_1.html"&gt;Planet Bike Superflash Stealth Tail Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re both extremely happy about how the project turned out. Everything came together nicely to create what is an attractive and highly functional bike for getting around in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s taken me that long to write something that gear-ish again. With my transition to Nikon began a relationship with Sigma that I’ve been waiting to elaborate on. Now, as I near the end of that year, seems a good time to talk about the lenses I’ve been using and what I think about them. For those of you who’ve been clamouring for this post for 11 months, thanks for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sigma knocked on my door I was no stranger to their lenses, having used their 24-70/2.8 EX and 70-200/2.8 EX for early professional work. The reasons I decided to use their lenses again were simple ones. First, it gave me a chance to get into the Nikon system – when you get a box filled with Nikon-mount lenses to use, it’s easier to afford the bodies. Second, and more importantly, was my desire to walk the talk on this Gear Is Good, Vision Is Better stuff I’ve been spouting for so long. The fact is, the vast majority of my readers are not professional photographers. They’re enthusiastic amateurs of all stripes and seasons and most of them can’t simply buy the very best Nikon or Canon glass. I wanted to make images I was proud of, with gear that’s generally less expensive. I wanted to remind my readers- and show them – that the best top-shelf gear wasn’t necessary for creating beautiful work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Glenorchy, South Island, New Zealand" src="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/duchemin_1884-24-70mm-f2-8-440x292.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigma 24-70/2.8 EX DG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last year, I’ve shot mostly with Sigma’s 15mm fisheye, 20/1.8EX, 24-70/2.8EX, 85/1.4EX, and 70-200/2.8EX – along side my own Nikon 300/2.8, 24mm PC-E, and 14-24/2.8, and Zeiss 50/1.4. Those were the lenses I used day-in and day-out, though there was a long hiatus while I was recovering from the accident and not making photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do I think of the lenses? If you’re tempted to skip to the end, here it is: I never once used the Sigma lens and thought, “Man, this photograph would be more beautiful, or more compelling, had I shot it with a more expensive Nikon lens.” Not once. For the most part my Sigma lenses performed really well, created beautiful images, and usually (though not always) for much less than the top-shelf Nikon or Canon equivalents. Beauty is in the photograph, not the gear. Lenses matter, but even today’s kit lenses are capable of creating beautiful photographs. I’m not a pixel-peeper, and never have been, so please don’t ask about the best apertures for edge-to-edge sharpness. I just don’t know. If I don’t notice the loss of sharpness, it doesn’t matter to me. And if the best thing people say about my work is, “Wow, it sure is sharp,” then I’ve failed and the lens is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="duchemin_284-24-70mm-f2-8" src="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/duchemin_284-24-70mm-f2-8-440x292.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigma 24-70/2.8 EX DG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would I use these lenses for professional work? That kind of depends on what you mean by “professional.” By my definition, I did, and I would again. But remember, value is not in how inexpensive something is, but how much you get out of what you paid. In the future I will be replacing some, but not all, of the Sigma lenses – notably the 24-70 and the 70-200. Those are my go-to lenses for much of my work and I’d happily pay more to replace them with the Nikon versions. Why? First, neither lens is sealed. When I last returned from Africa, my D3s sensors were filthier than any sensor I’ve ever seen. I was working in some of the most punishing conditions I’ve ever been in and sealed lenses would have made a huge difference.  If you aren’t working in these conditions, it could be a total non-issue. After-all, not even all Canon L-series lenses, are sealed. But to me, for these two lenses, it matters. Secondly, the build quality just doesn’t measure up, and I punish my gear, so durability matters. The body of the Sigma 70-200/2.8 EX, for example is made largely of plastic. It’s lighter, for sure, but I’ve less confidence in it than I would a lens made with more weight. In the field I need my gear to be more like a tank than a toy. But if you don’t need this kind of tankishness, then you might benefit from the saved dollars and the lighter weight. Those are my own reasons, but “horses for courses” as they say, and you need to decide what’s important to you. For many of you budget may prevent you from buying the top-shelf Nikon or Canon lenses, but you’ll get huge value from a fast, constant-aperture, zoom lens that makes beautiful photographs. If this is the case, Sigma’s got some great lenses for you. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three photographs posted here were all made with the Sigma 24-70/2.8 EX DG. I’ll eventually replace it, but not because of image quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="duchemin_011-24-70mm-f2-8" src="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/duchemin_011-24-70mm-f2-8-440x616.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="616"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigma 24-70/2.8 EX DG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would I continue to shoot with these lenses? I would and I will. Absolutely. They won’t be the lenses I go to when I need them to beat the sand and grit of the Kaisut Desert, but I’ll keep using them and recommending people consider Sigma, and take them for a test-drive when they can. Some of my favourite photographs from the past year were made with these lenses, and I’m grateful to Sigma for the chance to work with them. You can see some of those images, along with images of friends like Darwin Wiggett and Younes Bounhar on the Sigma Canada site&lt;a href="http://www.sigmacanada.ca/pro-gallery/david-duchemin/"&gt; HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David</name></author><gr:likingUser>09801288515403570096</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>16478161558990426831</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">PixelatedImage Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317655518930"><id gr:original-id="http://www.japansubculture.com/?p=3504">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05221fe32c2e02e5</id><category term="Reviews"/><title type="html">Ghosts in the Shell 2 (Innocence) Review and Second Opinion</title><published>2011-10-03T03:54:50Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T03:54:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.japansubculture.com/2011/10/ghosts-in-the-shell-2-innocence-review-and-second-opinion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.japansubculture.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Amy Seaman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m biased, but the beginning of Mamoru Oshii’s&lt;em&gt; Innocence&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell 2&lt;/em&gt;, turned me off just a teensy bit. Maybe it was because I missed seeing a female protagonist kick ass. Or perhaps it was the fact that the movie just took a little too long to get started. Don’t get me wrong, Kenji Kawai’s opening sequence and song were beautiful, but somewhat lacking at the same time — what exactly it was, I’m hard-pressed to name. Talk about heightened expectations from the first movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:624px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iks8HAq7Q30&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;&lt;img title="Screen Shot 2011-10-03 at 13.11.59" src="http://www.japansubculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-03-at-13.11.59-1024x572.png" alt="" width="614" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the opening sequence of INNOCENCE (Ghost In The Shell 2). Click to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innocence&lt;/em&gt; picks up where its predecessor left off — sort of. Though it actually takes place a few years later, little has changed. Through a barely adequate textual explanation at the beginning of the reel, new viewers are introduced to Major Motoko Kusanagi, who vanished at the end of the last movie. Batou, Kusanagi’s partner, has continued his work with Public Security Section Nine in her absence, but is now partnered with Togusa, the only non-cyborg member of the team — a characteristic that forces Batou to become protective of his new sidekick (albeit somewhat grudgingly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batou and Togusa spend the majority of the film investigating Locus Solus, a corporation that creates gynoids — hyper-realistic robotic sex dolls— searching for tangible evidence that will help the police implicate the group for a chain of murders. The gynoids have been malfunctioning and killing humans. After learning that each of the eight individuals were killed by “Hadaly” gynoids that had been modified to self-destruct, the two men seek out an inspector connected to the organization, only to find that he has been killed by the yakuza — and this is when the film actually starts to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An action-filled fight soon follows, and Batou and Togusa eventually find themselves heading for the Locus Solus headquarters near the Northern Frontier — the home of ghosts, colourful celebrations, and a lot, a lot of birds. For me, the name Locus Solus — meaning “uninhabited place” in Latin and famously used by Raymond Roussel in his fantastical 1914 masterpiece — was a dead giveaway about what was to come. If dead languages and obscure French surrealist novels mean nothing to you, however, it is at this point that you should start focusing on the minute, seemingly insignificant details — and proceed to embrace Masamune Shirow’s ability to weave a good plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the first part of the series, &lt;em&gt;Innocence&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the increasingly shrinking barrier between humans and technology, addressing the question of what it means to be alive, and pulls in a bit of political commentary as well — the crew aboard the Locus Solus ship speaks Chinese and there are brief murmurs about international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the characters in the movie do not break the fourth wall, they certainly dent it with their comments about the easily modifiable, liquid nature of memory, remarks that force viewers to re-examine the earlier scenes of the film. All in all, it’s a decent watch, if not for the striking graphics and animation that emphasize the difference between traditional and futuristic — a theme that remains consistent in both Ghost in the Shell movies. Though the dialogue was well-placed and even philosophically “deep” at times, with its 100-minute runtime, the film was a bit too long and way too predictable… but maybe that’s just because I’ve read too many existentialist novels and have seen too few SF animes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SECOND OPINION: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Jake Adelstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some movies, while flawed stay with you longer than others. Often, it’s because the film touches upon something in our own experiences that makes it personal. Compared to its groundbreaking predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Ghost In The Shell, Innocence &lt;/em&gt;is less impressive. Sometimes, the dialogue is overly flowery and not even the best voice actors in Japan can make the words sound as if a real person was speaking them. I’ve known a lot of cops, few of them match Batou’s ability to make poignant metaphors. Perhaps, it’s part of becoming a cyborg: enhanced verbal eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without giving away the plot of the movie (potential spoiler alert here!), in many ways this film is a parable about human trafficking. Human trafficking, of course, is a more nuanced way of saying slavery, usually in reference to sexual slavery. In utopian science fiction, there is often an idea presented that technology will free the spirit from the flesh, and we will move beyond our base desires. &lt;em&gt;Innocence &lt;/em&gt;argues that technological progress is increasingly a way to dehumanize ourselves, others, and fulfill our lower animal desires.  The movie weaves an interesting tapestry of action, adventure and philosophical thought on what is reality, experience, and identity. The relationship between Batou and Togusa is a subtle commentary on the conflicts between a personal life and working life, between humanity and depersonalization, between duty and emotion, between solitude and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surreal journey to Locus Solus is beautifully done and it plays with the memories of the viewer and invokes a strange sense of deja vu and jamais vu at the same time, the anime equivalent of reading Abe Kobo’s &lt;em&gt;The Ruined Map&lt;/em&gt;. It takes a few minutes to realize what is happening to the characters and in some ways, that helps you feel a connection to them and their disorientating experiences. The music of Kenji Kawai is beautifully interwoven into the film and it is an eerily haunting soundtrack. This is not a film to casually watch while doing something else. The movie is very detailed and it demands the attention of the viewer, enough so that it merits a second viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the years I’ve spent working on the human trafficking issues in Japan and continue to work with the &lt;em&gt;Polaris Project Japan&lt;/em&gt;, the movie resonated with me in ways it probably won’t for other people. If the mark of a good film is that you think about it for days or even years after you saw it, it is a great film. The movie has moments of strange profundity and lines whispered more than once, almost inaudibly, reinforcing a sense of deja vu as the film unwinds.  The following line below is spoken on two occasions by two different characters, both heroes in some aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;「孤独に歩め。悪をなさず、求めるところは少なく。林の中の象のように」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk alone, do no evil, ask for little. Like an elephant walking through the forest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may simply be philosophical dressing on a relatively simple film or it may be the moral to what is essentially a very poignant modern day fairy-tale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jake Adelstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.japansubculture.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.japansubculture.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Japan Subculture Research Center</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.japansubculture.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317655385376"><id gr:original-id="tag:duncandavidson.com,2011:/blog/2011/10/wikipedia_photography">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2ad1cdc13aa6dd2a</id><title type="html">Tim Bray’s Nudge about Wikipedia and Photography</title><published>2011-10-03T02:30:00Z</published><updated>2011-10-03T17:12:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/wikipedia_photography" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://duncandavidson.com/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a blog post yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/10/01/Architecture-of-Theology"&gt;Tim Bray talks about how he licensed a photograph he made of the interior of Sagrada Família for a book cover&lt;/a&gt;. The gist of the story is that he contributed a small version of the photograph to Wikipedia. The Oxford Press found it and then contacted him to license it. Tim got paid and everyone’s happy. He goes on to argue that his experience might serve as a template for some professional photographers to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his argument, Tim mentions me by name and the fact that I’ve been reluctant to contribute to Wikipedia. It’s true. I backed off from Wikipedia and using Creative Commons licenses four years ago after some unfortunate discussions that needed the kind of thought that I didn’t have time or the mental bandwidth for. I punted thinking through the various issues until later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later recently became now thanks to an incident where &lt;a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/09/not_against_creative_commons"&gt;I was represented as being against Creative Commons licenses&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve spent the week or so since then putting a lot of thought into the intersection of permissive licensing and professional photography business models while finishing up my recent road trip. Coincidentally, some of that thinking has revolved around possibly using permissive licenses for lower resolution images while reserving higher resolution files. Tim’s argument meshes in with those thoughts quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim, congratulations on having your image used for a book cover, and thanks for the nudge. It couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s great food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

That's because the fans are coming!

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about fandom couple of years ago in conversations with my friend Britta,  who was working at the time as community manager for Delicious. She taught me that fans were among the heaviest users of the bookmarking site, and had constructed an edifice of incredibly elaborate tagging conventions, plugins, and scripts to organize their output along a bewildering number of dimensions.     If you wanted to read a 3000 word fic where Picard forces Gandalf into sexual bondage, and it seems unconsensual but secretly both want it, and it's R-explicit but not NC-17 explicit, all you had to do was search along the appropriate combination of tags (and if you couldn't find it, someone would probably write it for you).    By 2008 a whole suite of theoretical ideas about folksonomy, crowdsourcing, faceted infomation retrieval, collaborative editing and emergent ontology had been implemented by a bunch of friendly people so that they could read about Kirk drilling Spock. 

&lt;p&gt;Fan culture is extremely collaborative, and its participants had rapidly taught one another how best to combine LiveJournal, Delicious and other sites into an  network for sharing and discovery that, due to the social stigma of the hobby, remained under the radar even though it would have meant instant success for any entrepreneur sincerely willing to work with them.    Fans shared their setups and workflows with each other in much the way that startup subculture obsesses over tool chains and "stacks".   The whole thing reminds me a lot of what HyperCard was like in the nineties, right before its demise, when a large number of otherwise non-technical users had basically taught themselves to do elaborate programming with the tool, and were doing amazing things with it.   Until, of course, Apple pulled the plug.

&lt;p&gt;Avos did a similar thing last week when they relaunched Delicious while breaking every feature that made their core users so devoted to the site (networks, bundles, subscriptions and feeds).  They seemed to have no idea who their most active users were, or how strongly those users cared about the product.    In my mind this reinforced the idea that they had bought Delicious simply as a convenient installed base of 'like' buttons scattered across the internet, with the intent of building a completely new social site unrelated to saving links.

&lt;p&gt;For any bookmarking site, the fan subculture is valuable because it makes such heavy and creative use of tagging, and because they are great collaborators.    I can't think of a better way to stress-test a site then to get people filling it with Inception fanfic.    You will get thoughtful, carefully-formatted bug reports; and if you actually fix something someone might knit you a sweater.     And please witness the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oqfHHkO48fVFY3sPQqkoCuqFnQOWe4fxRxXJ-lUglg/edit?hl=en_US"&gt;50 page spec&lt;/a&gt;, complete with code samples, table of contents, summary, tutorial, and flawless formatting, the community produced in about two days after I asked them in a single tweet what features they would want to see in Pinboard&lt;a href="http://pinboard.in/#fnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;.   These people do not waste time.

&lt;p&gt;They're also smart enough to realize that in the long run, they need to take control of their own bookmarking in order to avoid these kinds of surprises.  One way they've done this is through what Britta calls the "friendliest goddamn open source project ever", an &lt;a href="http://archiveofourown.org/archive_faqs/1"&gt;Archive of our Own&lt;/a&gt;.   But this project is not quite ready to carry the full burden of everyone's bookmarks.

&lt;p&gt;Pinboard is not a social site, and it has always been about archiving, not sharing.   I don't intend to make the same mistake Avos did and suddenly try to retool the site for a brand new group while neglecting the quiet link hoarders who form the Pinboard old guard.   As a grouchy hermit, I like to think that other grouchy hermits should have a place to store stuff that will never feel like publishing or expose them to unwanted contact with other people. 

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think the fans are a very nice bunch who have been somewhat hard done by, and that their presence will be a long-term boon to the site.  Like bees in a garden, the sudden arrival of a big swarm can be alarming, but all this swarm wants is a place to set up a hive and get to work.  And I'll end this metaphor right now before it provokes any pollination slash.

&lt;p&gt;In the long run it's healthier for the site to have a more varied user base, and this is a group of users with a terrific track record of constructive feedback on other sites (notably LiveJournal) and a committment to privacy and non-commercialism that I think a lot of our original users share. 

&lt;p&gt;In a word: don't be afraid.  Nobody has pivoted, nothing is changing. Just be careful what you click on for a while.

&lt;p&gt;I'll post in a couple of days about what I'm planning to work on this fall, including my response to that epic feature spec.  In the meantime I'll be hanging around Twitter and on pinboard-dev, as ever.
