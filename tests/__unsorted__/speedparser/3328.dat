      <title>Are You Prepared for the Next Time the Earth Shakes?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Like everyone else, we were stunned by the 5.9 magnitude&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/earthquake-insurance-worth-it/"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;&#160;centered in Mineral, Va., today at around 2 p.m., and felt throughout the East Coast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Several HouseLogic bloggers live in the Washington, D.C., area, about 100 miles away from the quake&#8217;s epicenter: I&#8217;m in McLean, Va., and felt my car shaking in my driveway; Dona DeZube in Clarksville, Md., thought a gas line exploded when she felt the earth tremble; and Lara Edge, who lives in D.C., watched her neighbors run out of their homes (never leave your home!) but didn&#8217;t feel much on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Rather than running into the street, the best plan is to be prepared, like by putting together an&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/emergency-preparedness-kit/"&gt;emergency kit&lt;/a&gt;. Also read up on whether&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/earthquake-insurance-worth-it/"&gt;earthquake insurance is worth it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	And follow FEMA&#8217;s advice:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fema.gov/hazard/earthquake/eq_during.shtm"&gt;During the quake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors, and walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Stay inside until the shaking stops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;If trapped under debris, don&#8217;t light a match or kick up dust. Tap on a pipe to alert rescuers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fema.gov/hazard/earthquake/eq_after.shtm"&gt;After the quake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Open cabinets cautiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Immediately clean up spilled medicines, bleach, gasoline, or other flammable liquids. Leave if you smell gas or chemical fumes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Inspect your chimneys for damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Check for gas leaks. If you smell or hear leaking gas, turn off the gas at the outside main valve, or call the gas company from a neighbor's home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Look for electrical damage &#8212; sparks, broken or frayed wires. If you suspect damage, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;span style="font-size:14px;"&gt;Check for sewage and water lines damage. If you suspect damage, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
			&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Child-Proof Doors &amp; Windows to Keep Toddlers, Elderly from Wandering</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	If you have a toddler who thinks midnight is a great time to hit the playground without you, or a dad with Alzheimer&#8217;s who gets lost a block from home, you need to know when someone heads out the door (or a window) of your home.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	Short of moving your family into a prison, your options for keeping everyone where they belong range from simple lock products to help child-proof doors and windows that cost about a buck to sophisticated electronic surveillance equipment costing thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	These products will help give you peace of mind:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			A&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_58425-37672-490973_0__?productId=3058261&amp;amp;Ntt=hook+and+eye&amp;amp;pl=1&amp;amp;currentURL=%2Fpl__0__s%3FNtt%3Dhook%2Band%2Beye&amp;amp;facetInfo="&gt;hook and eye latch&lt;/a&gt;&#160;(about $1) installed at the top of the door out of reach of the toddler and out of sight of your wandering dad.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			Three or four&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_308993-54546-20486BBXLG_0__?productId=3090949&amp;amp;Ntt=bolt+lock&amp;amp;pl=1&amp;amp;currentURL=%2Fpl__0__s%3FNtt%3Dbolt%2Block&amp;amp;facetInfo="&gt;barrel bolt locks&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($4 each) installed so you have to slide some to the left and some to the right to get out. Put them at the top and bottom of the door where you wouldn&#8217;t normally look for a lock.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_89226-89973-1422_0__?productId=3046458&amp;amp;Ntt=window+locks&amp;amp;pl=1&amp;amp;currentURL=%2Fpl__0__s%3FNtt%3Dwindow%2Blocks&amp;amp;facetInfo="&gt;Keyed window locks&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($7) will keep toddlers and parents from opening the window, but heads up: If there&#8217;s an emergency, a window lock may block escape routes. You&#8217;ll have to decide which is the greater risk.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			A&#160;&lt;a href="http://shop.alzstore.com/door-mural---book-shelves-p11.aspx"&gt;door mural&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($40) helps disguise the front door to those with Alzheimer&#8217;s.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			These products alert you when a door or window is opened:&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			A string of&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.joann.com/joann/catalog/productdetail.jsp?pageName=search&amp;amp;flag=true&amp;amp;PRODID=zprd_02357242a"&gt;Jingle Bells&lt;/a&gt;&#160;(about $4) attached to the door will tell you when it&#8217;s opened, but test to make sure you can hear the bells from all over the house.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;a href="http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=192510-1353-06864&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;storeId=10151&amp;amp;productId=3137421&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;cmRelshp=req&amp;amp;rel=nofollow&amp;amp;cId=PDIO1"&gt;Electronic window alarms&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($7) run on batteries and let you know when a window is opened by sounding an alarm or chime.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			If you want to know when someone gets out of bed, a&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/pressure-sensitive-alarm-mat-96481.html"&gt;pressure-sensitive mat alarm&lt;/a&gt;&#160;(about $10) mat will play music or blast a 105-decibel alarm when a person (or a pet) steps on it. You can also put it under a rug in front of the door.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			A&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_192286-1353-45132_0__?productId=3080303&amp;amp;Ntt=motion+alarm&amp;amp;pl=1&amp;amp;currentURL=%2Fpl__0__s%3FNtt%3Dmotion%2Balarm&amp;amp;facetInfo="&gt;motion detector alarm&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($20) mounted over the front door or a window tells you when someone passes by, while mounting one under the bed will tell you when someone gets up at night.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Installing solar-powered&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/motion-sensor-lighting-safety-and-security-indoors-and-out/"&gt;motion-sensor lighting&lt;/a&gt;&#160;($33 at Lowe&#8217;s) around your home&#8217;s exterior will tell you when someone&#8217;s outside.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Secure the whole house&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	For $250 to $700, have a simple&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/home-security-systems-types-and-costs/"&gt;home security system&lt;/a&gt;&#160;installed, or for about $1 per square foot, have an alarm company install a full perimeter system for all doors and windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Set the system to chime rather than call the security company when a door or window opens so you don&#8217;t scare the pants off grandpa or baby with a screeching alarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Don&#8217;t be surprised if the brand-name home security companies refuse to install a system unless you agree to pay them $35 to $75 a month to monitor it. A&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.gesecuritypro.com/NorthAmerica/About/Choose.cfm?PageID=405&amp;amp;CFID=3241599&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=36339677"&gt;local company&lt;/a&gt;&#160;is more likely to install without demanding a monitoring fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	It&#8217;s not easy keeping track of someone who doesn&#8217;t understand why it&#8217;s dangerous to be outside alone. Here&#8217;s hoping some of these solutions work well enough to make your days and nights a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;What have you done to keep your family members safe from wandering?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Fourth of July: Take a Step Toward Energy &#8216;Independence&#8217;  </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	From House Logic.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/blog-flag-porch-light-istock_8a8dcae59e5d6564d3133cc5b1316795_3x2_jpg_168x112_q85.jpg" style="width: 168px; height: 112px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-top-width: 2px; border-right-width: 2px; border-bottom-width: 2px; border-left-width: 2px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; float: left; " /&gt;The Fourth of July -- Independence Day -- is a great time to reflect on how lucky we are to live in the United States of America, and what we can do to make our nation better, stronger, and more prosperous. As President Kennedy famously said many years ago, &#8220;Ask what you can do for your country.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	We&#8217;d all like to do our part. But our individual efforts sure seem small compared with the goings-on of world politics and global economies.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	How can we &#8212; average American home owners &#8212; really achieve big goals, such as influencing national energy policy and building a strong economy? After all, we&#8217;ve got our own daily stuff to deal with: work,&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/value-home-maintenance/"&gt;home repairs&lt;/a&gt;, getting the kids to softball practice, and the dog to the vet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	One good way is to reduce energy consumption in our own homes. This simple act can have a major impact. Not just in terms of helping hold the line on the&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/3-green-home-improvements-pay/"&gt;family budget&lt;/a&gt;, but in slowing the ever-spiraling costs of energy. Lessening demand &#8212; even incrementally &#8212; eases the price of energy, which can free up capital that creates jobs and helps get our economy kicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Here are examples of small contributions you can make that add up:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Ask cable or satellite providers for an energy-efficient set-top box, (the device that receives and dispatches TV signals to your DVR). Set-top boxes, which run 24 hours a day, have become a leading energy drain in the home. Newer&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&amp;amp;pgw_code=ST"&gt;Energy Star-rated models&lt;/a&gt;&#160;are at least 30% more efficient. If all set-top boxes sold in the U.S. were Energy Star-rated, energy savings would total $2 billion each year, and greenhouse gases would be reduced by an amount equivalent to 3 million cars and trucks.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Replacing an old, kaput dishwasher with an&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/"&gt;Energy Star&lt;/a&gt;-qualified model cuts the annual energy cost of the machine by 50% &#8212; to $60 from $120. If every&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&amp;amp;pgw_code=CW"&gt;clothes washer&lt;/a&gt;purchased in the U.S. this year were an efficient Energy Star model, the national energy savings would total $350 million, not to mention conserving 32 billion gallons of water.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Buying a high-efficiency gas or electric water heater, when yours reaches the end of its useful life, saves 3% to 4% on the average home&#8217;s hot water bill. Energy standards enacted by the U.S. Dept. of Energy in 2010 were designed to cut energy usage of new water heaters by 3% to 4%. Over a 30-year period, U.S. consumers should save&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.aceee.org/press/2010/04/new-national-water-heater-standards-give-efficiency-majo"&gt;$8.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;&#160;and reduce CO2 emissions by 170 million tons &#8212; that&#8217;s equal to the yearly emissions of 30 million cars.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Replacing a 60-watt incandescent light bulb with a 13-watt compact fluorescent equivalent saves $30 over the life of the bulb. Alternative: LED bulbs, although costly ($30 for 7-watts), last 3 to 4 times longer than CFLs, burn cooler, and &#8212; unlike CFLs &#8212; contain no mercury. If every home in America replaced just one&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/turning-incandescent-light-bulb/"&gt;incandescent bulb&lt;/a&gt;&#160;with an Energy Star-qualified CFL, the savings would be enough to light more than 3 million homes. The savings would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil-fuel energy production equivalent to 800,000 autos.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	More easy ways to be patriotic (and save):&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Create a breeze with a&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/ceiling-fans-keep-your-cool-save-money-too/"&gt;ceiling fan&lt;/a&gt;&#160;instead of using the AC. For every degree you raise the air conditioning thermostat above 78 degrees, you can save 3% to 8% on cooling costs.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Install a&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/no-sweat-programmable-thermostats-save-energy-costs/"&gt;programmable thermostat&lt;/a&gt;&#160;and save as much as $180 per year.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Plump up&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/attic-insulation-saves-you-money/"&gt;attic insulation&lt;/a&gt;&#160;from R-11 to R-49 and save up to $600 per year.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Turn down the thermostat on your&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/10-tips-for-saving-energy-kitchen/"&gt;refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;&#160;and save $22 per year.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Outsmart sneaky&#160;&lt;a href="http://members.houselogic.com/articles/saving-electricity-reduce-standby-power-consumption/"&gt;energy vampires&lt;/a&gt;&#160;by turning off (or putting &#8220;to sleep&#8221;) computers, printers, and other electronics when not in use: Shave another $100 from your annual energy bill.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	Let&#8217;s put the independence in Independence Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	In what ways do you save energy in your household?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>On Father&#8217;s Day, Actions Speak Louder Than Ties  </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	Father&#8217;s Day is Sunday. And you&#8217;re wondering how to thank the guy who taught you to wield a putty knife, and to shut the door and quit heating/cooling the outside &#8212; for crying out loud!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	You could buy him something. But how many World&#8217;s Greatest Dad mugs and barbecue mitts does a guy need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Instead, spend a little time. Do some chore that Dad would otherwise do. Finish a project he hasn&#8217;t had time to complete.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	You&#8217;ll save money &#8212; now&#160;that&#160;will make Dad happy &#8212; and show your father how much you care. Here are some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Hose off and hang up the hammock that&#8217;s still sitting in the basement. Scrub stubborn stains with a vinegar spritz.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Dig up that weed tree that&#8217;s popped up between the hydrangeas.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Clean gutters clogged with tree blossoms and other spring debris.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Power wash and reseal the deck.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Shine up the gas grill. A little baking soda will help get rid of burned-on chunkies.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Clean out the garage &#8212; at least sweep it.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Change the toilet flapper.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Lay sod on lawn bare spots.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Spackle, sand, and paint dents and holes in the walls.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#13;
		Hang up that picture of the grandchildren.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	What&#8217;s the best Father&#8217;s Day gift you ever gave to your Dad? Received from your child?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Testimonial, Chestnut Hill home purchase</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	Our client wrote us a wonderful testimonial about our real estate services.&#160; It can be read on here and on our&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/profile/Dwell360/Reviews?review=51642"&gt;Zillow profile&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; We appreciate the kind words.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;John provided excellent professional service over a 9 month period while we relocated from the west coast to Newton. He kept us in the listing loop but did not push the process. When we did finally settle on "the House", after viewing 120 houses, John and his partner Ed were able to work through any issues and kept the process for closing on track! We would highly recommend John and Ed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Dos and Don&#8217;ts of Homebuyer Incentives</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Homebuyer incentives can be smart marketing or a waste of money. Find out when and how to use them. &#160;By:&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.houselogic.com/authors/G_M_Filisko/"&gt;G. M. Filisko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	When you&#8217;re selling your home, the idea of adding a sweetener to the transaction&#8212;whether it&#8217;s a decorating allowance, a home warranty, or a big-screen TV&#8212;can be a smart use of marketing funds. To ensure it&#8217;s not a big waste, follow these dos and don&#8217;ts:&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Do use homebuyer incentives to set your home apart from close competition.&#160;If all the sale properties in your neighborhood have the same patio, furnishing yours with a luxury patio set and stainless steel BBQ that stay with the buyers will make your home stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Do compensate for flaws with a homebuyer incentive.&#160;If your kitchen sports outdated floral wallpaper, a $3,000 decorating allowance may help buyers cope. If your furnace is aging, a home warranty may remove the buyers&#8217; concern that they&#8217;ll have to pay thousands of dollars to replace it right after the closing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Don&#8217;t assume homebuyer incentives are legal.&#160;Your state may ban homebuyer incentives, or its laws may be maddeningly confusing about when the practice is legal and not. Check with your real estate agent and attorney before you offer a homebuyer incentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Don&#8217;t think buyers won&#8217;t see the motivation behind a homebuyer incentive.Offering a homebuyer incentive may make you seem desperate. That may lead suspicious buyers to wonder what hidden flaws exist in your home that would force you to throw a freebie at them to get it sold. It could also lead buyers to factor in your apparent anxiety and make a lowball offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Don&#8217;t use a homebuyer incentive to mask a too-high price.&#160;A buyer may think your expensive homebuyer incentive&#8212;like a high-end TV or a luxury car&#8212;is a gimmick to avoid lowering your sale price. Many top real estate agents will tell you to list your home at a more competitive price instead of offering a homebuyer incentive. A property that&#8217;s priced a hair below its true value will attract not only buyers but also buyers&#8217; agents, who&#8217;ll&#160; be giddy to show their clients a home that&#8217;s a good value and will sell quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	If you&#8217;re convinced a homebuyer incentive will do the trick, choose one that adds value or neutralizes a flaw in your home. Addressing buyers&#8217; concerns about your home will always be more effective than offering buyers an expensive toy.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Fielding a Lowball Purchase Offer on Your Home  </title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	By:&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.houselogic.com/authors/marcie_geffner/"&gt;Marcie Geffner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; color: rgb(127, 126, 126); "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;span style="font-size:16px;"&gt;Consider before you ignore or outright refuse a very low purchase offer for your home. A counteroffer and negotiation could turn that low purchase offer into a sale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Check your emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	A purchase offer, even a very low one, means someone wants to purchase your home. Unless the offer is laughably low, it deserves a cordial response, whether that&#8217;s a counteroffer or an outright rejection. Remain calm and discuss with your real estate agent the many ways you can respond to a lowball purchase offer.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Counter the purchase offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Unless you&#8217;ve received multiple purchase offers, the best response is to counter the low offer with a price and terms you&#8217;re willing to accept. Some buyers make a low offer because they think that&#8217;s customary, they&#8217;re afraid they&#8217;ll overpay, or they want to test your limits.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	A counteroffer signals that you&#8217;re willing to negotiate. One strategy for your counteroffer is to lower your price, but remove any concessions such as seller assistance with closing costs, or features such as kitchen appliances that you&#8217;d like to take with you.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Consider the terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Price is paramount for most buyers and sellers, but it&#8217;s not the only deal point. A low purchase offer might make sense if the contingencies are reasonable, the closing date meets your needs, and the buyer is preapproved for a mortgage. Consider what terms you might change in a counteroffer to make the deal work.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Review your comps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Ask your REALTOR&#174; whether any homes that are comparable to yours (known as &#8220;comps&#8221;) have been sold or put on the market since your home was listed for sale. If those new comps are at lower prices, you might have to lower your price to match them if you want to sell.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Consider the buyer&#8217;s comps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Buyers sometimes attach comps to a low offer to try to convince the seller to accept a lower purchase offer. Take a look at those comps. Are the homes similar to yours? If so, your asking price might be unrealistic. If not, you might want to include in your counteroffer information about those homes and your own comps that justify your asking price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	If the buyers don&#8217;t include comps to justify their low purchase offer, have your real estate agent ask the buyers&#8217; agent for those comps.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Get the agents together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	If the purchase offer is too low to counter, but you don&#8217;t have a better option, ask your real estate agent to call the buyer&#8217;s agent and try to narrow the price gap so that a counteroffer would make sense. Also, ask your real estate agent whether the buyer (or buyer&#8217;s agent) has a reputation for lowball purchase offers. If that&#8217;s the case, you might feel freer to reject the offer.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Don&#8217;t signal desperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	Buyers are sensitive to signs that a seller may be receptive to a low purchase offer. If your home is vacant or your home&#8217;s listing describes you as a &#8220;motivated&#8221; seller, you&#8217;re signaling you&#8217;re open to a low offer.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	If you can remedy the situation, maybe by renting furniture or asking your agent not to mention in your home listing that you&#8217;re motivated, the next purchase offer you get might be more to your liking.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; line-height: 1.429em; font-weight: normal; "&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>"Town of Wayland remains on solid financial footing"</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#8220;Moody&#8217;s Investor Services said the Town of Wayland remains on solid financial footing.&#8221;&#160; It is comforting to read this in the article &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/real_estate/2011/01/waylands-100m-development-eyed-as.html#ixzz1BhvOAD8F"&gt;Wayland's $100m development on track, eyed as revenue boost from Boston Business Journal&lt;/a&gt;&#160;today. &#160;Even though the current real estate market has required adjustments to the original plans for the Wayland Commons town center it still is moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	The strong bond rating from Moody&#8217;s also helps confirm that Wayland Massachusetts is a town worth the real estate investment.&#160; It is important to see stability in towns and communities when considering purchasing a home.&#160; Another factor that does impact the value of real estate in a given town is the &lt;a href="http://www.greatschools.org/massachusetts/wayland/schools/"&gt;school system&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Wayland&#8217;s is strong.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	In fact, the average value of a single family residence has increased by 7.6% in Wayland.&#160; That is an increase in value from $585,245 in 2009 to $629,815 in 2010 for the average sale price of the home sold.&#160; (source MLSPIN).&#160; We also noted an increase of the number of homes sold from 128 to 133.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	The facts are certainly encouraging and we remain confident in Wayland Massachusetts real estate market.&#160; We will continue to keep our eyes on the market and track the activity.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	~ See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Review &amp; Ratings on Zillow for Dwell360</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Zillow has just &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/agent-reviews-on-zillow-are-lighting-up-the-stars/2011/01/13/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+ZillowBlog+(Zillow+Blog)"&gt;enabled real estate agent reviews and ratings&lt;/a&gt; on within the profiles of agents on their site. &#160;I was surprised that already we have received a review from our past client Josh. &#160;We have helped Josh through three transactions and are flattered with &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/profile/Dwell360.com/Reviews/"&gt;his kind remarks&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;em&gt;&#8220;The guys of Dwell360 provide a level of service a cut above other agencies. They take a personal interest in finding you the perfect home to fit your needs. They have a n acute knowledge of the varying neighborhoods and properties in the Boston area, and a younger progressive attitude. I've sold one house and bought two houses with them, and continue to recommend them to everyone.&#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Thank you for the review Josh. &#160;We invite our other past clients to post their reviews and ratings on Zillow. &#160;Just &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/profile/Dwell360.com/Reviews/"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; then click write a review. &#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Snow, snow, everywhere - except Florida</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	According to CNN Florida seems to be the only state that has not gotten snow today. &#160;"After big snow and ice events in the Southeast, Plains, and Midwest this week, 49 out of the 50 states currently have snow on the ground&#160;&#8211;&#160; yes, even Hawaii, where snow falls in Mauna&#160;Loa and Mauna Kea all winter."&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/01/11/t1larg.snow.map.jpg" style="width: 445px; height: 250px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	It does make us just a little jealous of our friends in Florida. &#160;But, one of the best things about living in the Northeast is the change of seasons. &#160;It might be a lot of work but it is an amazing sight outside. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	Read the original article from CNN: &#160;&lt;a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/11/snow-present-in-49-of-the-50-u-s-states/"&gt;Snow present in 49 of the 50 U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>11 real estate Items to think about in 2011</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are considering selling and buying your home there are a few things to consider.&#160; HGTV's FrontDoor.com creates a good list to consider in their article "&lt;a href="http://www.frontdoor.com/Buy/Buying-and-Selling-Your-House-11-Resolutions-for-2011/56187/p1"&gt;Buying and Selling Your House: 11 Resolutions for 2011&lt;/a&gt;" By Geoff Williams, published: 12/21/2010.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of list of 11 items (noted below) are all items you should think about if you are looking to buy or sell a home in the next 6-12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will begin thinking about fixing up my house--now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will clean out my house now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will plan now to price my house as though we're living in 2011 and not 2007.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before I look to buy, I will seek pre-approval for my mortgage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before I look to buy, I will clean up my credit score.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will number crunch and buy a house I can afford.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will think long term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will interview more than one real estate agent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will make this a business transaction and not an emotional decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will get a pre-inspection for my own house, before I sell it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will think about moving and other logistics now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;We often talk to clients month or even just days before they are ready to list their home for sale.&#160; The one item that never changes is the need for a plan on selling and buying a home.&#160;&#160; When you take the time to think and plan out for the purchase or sale of your residential property it makes the process easier.&#160; A great real estate agent with experience in today&#8217;s market will be able to not only help you plan but actually navigate through the tricky process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dwell360.com"&gt;Dwell360&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://dwell360.com/properties"&gt;residential real estate&lt;/a&gt; brokerage based in Newton and Boston.&#160; Our experienced real estate agents service the metro suburbs and cities in and around Boston.&#160; Real estate is an exciting process and with qualified assistance you will achieve your goals and enjoy the process. &#160;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>John Lynch Quoted in Survive and Thrive in Boston</title>
      <description>&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	This fall my family and I spend a bit of time in the Boston Public Garden. &#160;We always love visiting the garden and on this&#160;visit we had the&#160;camera ready in hopes to capture some good shots for our family Holiday card. &#160;In addition to some great photos we ended up with a nice collection of photos of the Boston Public Garden that made it to a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5L4ex5Jamo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;video that is on our YouTube channel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	This&#160;prompted&#160;an interview from Allyson Koerner a writer with Survive and Thrive Boston and I was quoted a quite a few times in the article. &#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;b&gt;Read the article:&#160;&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.surviveandthriveboston.com/2010/12/the-public-garden-a-botanical.html"&gt;The Public Garden: A botanical oasis giving "lungs" to the city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;

		&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
			&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
				&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;#13;
					We always enjoy visiting the Garden and our son loves to explore. &#160;He can't get enough of the ducks, birds, and wildlife in the park. &#160;Not to forget to mention the "Make Way for Ducklings" statues. &#160;He gets so excited when he sees wildlife and the photos we captured of him finding more ducks is priceless. &#160;It was a&#160;wonderful&#160;visit and we are happy to have such a great space.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
				&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;

      <title>Newton Single Family Sold Price up 3.63%</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would you say if I said the average price of a single family home in Newton Massachusetts is up?&#160; It is true.&#160; The average sale price is up 3.63% in the Garden City.&#160; A client needed some real estate sales data and some of the figures we compare was 2009 and 2010 sales data in MLS for closings for each year for the time range of January 1 &#8211; November 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time frame noted above, the average sale price in 2009 was $845,434 and in 2010 is $876,186 for single family homes.&#160; We also noted a slight increase in the actual number of single family homes sold just 428 in 2009 and 449 homes sold in 2010.&#160; One notworthy piece of data is the days a home is on the market before going under agreement went down by 6 days from 77 in 2009 to 71 in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always interesting to see how many of these sales exceed $2,000,000.&#160; In 2009 it was 11 homes and in 2010 there was 18 homes that sold for $2,000,000 or more.&#160; This is a notable statistic as higher priced homes can influence the average sale price in the given market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010 the single family homes on the market in Newton MA sold for 97% of the most recent asking price set for the property.&#160; But, these properties actually have sold for 94% of the original asking price of the home.&#160; A good illustration that properties well priced often need to take the next step and be aggressively priced to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was just some quick real estate market sale data for Newton Massachusetts.&#160; We will provide this information more often and as the New Year is on the horizon we will have some great data to share with you about Newton, Brookline, Boston, and other cities and towns we service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to visit our new YouTube channel at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/dwell360"&gt;YouTube.com/Dwell360&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; &lt;a href="http://dwell360.com"&gt;Dwell360&lt;/a&gt; is a real estate brokerage based in Newton Ma that has experienced agents, state of the art marketing, and an understanding our the local market.&#160; &lt;a href="http://www.dwell360.com/contact"&gt;Contact us for market data. &#160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 Factors that make an impact on your homeowners insurance</title>
      <description>One factor to consider when looking buying a home is the cost of insurance.&#160; It is a topic that is often overlooked by buyers during the process of their home search.&#160; But, the cost for insurance, average of $900, is with you for the life of ownership and you take time to consider the implications.&#160; If you already own your home and it is vacant or unoccupied you should take a second look at your policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few years ago I received a quote for insurance that was leaps and bounds higher then my current policy in place.&#160; It turned out that the Boston zip codes had been confused and all was quickly remedied in my favor.&#160; That was a taste of how sensitive real estate insurance rates can be for homeowners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An independent insurance agent can often help you though the process of getting a quote for a prospective home you might be purchasing.&#160; In Massachusetts and the rest of New England when it comes to your home there is a long list of &#8220;what-ifs&#8221; and everything from natural disasters, mistakes, and human involvement play a key role.&#160;&#160; &#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSN Real Estate&#8217;s recent article, &#8220;&lt;a href="http://on-msn.com/9164rP"&gt;10 things that can lower or raise your homeowners insurance rates&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; is a great list of items to consider when looking to buy a home.&#160; Review the list below and review the article for more details of each item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://on-msn.com/9164rP"&gt;1. Is the area susceptible to hurricanes, mudslides, wildfires or other natural disasters?&lt;br /&gt;2. How's the roof? New? Wind- and hail-resistant?&lt;br /&gt;3. Is the plumbing new?&lt;br /&gt;4. Does the electrical system meet current code?&lt;br /&gt;5. How far away is the fire department?&lt;br /&gt;6. How is the neighborhood?&lt;br /&gt;7. How new is the home?&lt;br /&gt;8. Has the home been well-maintained?&lt;br /&gt;9. How secure is the home from burglary?&lt;br /&gt;10. Is a swimming pool on the property?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your home is vacant or unoccupied there are other considerations you must make.&#160; Often insurance agencies will void a policy after your home has been vacant after 30days.&#160; The REALTORS here at Dwell360 have seen many homes in both the city and suburbs of Boston.&#160; It would not be a shock to see missing copper pipes, vandalized property, leaking roofs, missing appliances, and personal items taken.&#160; In many cases issues that are sudden surprises to the seller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your home is vacant you need to make arrangements with your insurance provided.&#160; &#8220;The Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA) also known as the Massachusetts FAIR Plan (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) provides basic property insurance on eligible property for applicants who have been unable to gain insurance through the voluntary market.&#8221; The cost might be higher with a policy willing to let your own be vacant but the risk of a home not being properly insured is much greater.&#160; Here are some tips for vacant homes from &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/c7RLND"&gt;Inman News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dwell360 is a boutique residential real estate firm in Newton and Boston Massachusetts.&#160; Lead by REALTOR founders Edward Johnston and John Lynch the firm provides progressive solutions to buyers and sellers.&#160; We have current and continues experience in the cities and towns of Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chestnut Hill, Needham, Newton, Natick, Somerville, Wellesley, and other sought after &lt;/i&gt;towns.&#160; Please call 617-299-0012 or write service@dwell360.com.</description>

      <title>Is Zillow&#8217;s property valuation the &#8220;Zestimate&#8221; accurate? No, It could be off by 20%.</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Property valuation websites have a lot of information to offer.&#160; They provide details on properties, sale history, tax information, and estimate the value of the home.&#160; As a result, they become a topic of conversation with our clients on a regular basis.&#160; The only issue is we often find ourselves explaining to clients why the site is not always accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, at a Boston real estate conference, Agent Reboot, Zillow representatives talked about their service and how they are among the only who &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/DataCoverageZestimateAccuracy.htm"&gt;post about their valuations accuracy&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Zillow&#8217;s &#8220;Zestimate&#8221; that provides value estimates of single family homes, condominiums, and multi-families are often wrong.&#160; In fact Zillow has actually published their Zestimates accuracy for the Boston metro real estate market.&#160; Their median error is 8.9%.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means if a Zestimate labeled your home with a $500,000 price tag it could really sell for $44,500 more or less than that price.&#160; In fact only 30% of the Zestimates are within 5% of the sale price.&#160; They actually review that 80% of the Zestimate are within 20% of the sale price.&#160; This is a big range.&#160; This is similar to say your home is worth $500,000 and will sell between $400,000 to $600,000.&#160; An article published by &lt;a href="http://techsavvyagent.com/text/hate-zillow-do-you-really-know-why/"&gt;TechSavvyAgent&lt;/a&gt;&#160;also clearly outlines Zillow&#8217;s accurancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do like Zillow.&#160; It is a way to collect information and we like information.&#160; But, if you are looking to it for your only price resource in Boston, Newton, Cambridge, Brookline, and other Massachusetts towns it is not the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interest rates are really low &#8211; 4.5%</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All we have been hearing lately from our past and present clients,&amp;#13;
our friends, and everyone else is how great of an interest rate they can&amp;#13;
get.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Our mortgage contacts and real&amp;#13;
estate attorneys have been super busy with the recent refinance boom. &lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;We have heard people getting rates from 4 &#8211;&amp;#13;
4.50%.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The rates are really low.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;It was not too long ago people received interest rates well above 6% and&amp;#13;
higher.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;I know of one client who purchased&amp;#13;
a home with a 6.25% interest rate and now a couple of years later has refined&amp;#13;
to 4.25%.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;On a $400,000 loan that is a&amp;#13;
monthly savings of $495.11 that is $5,941.32 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;With interest rates as low as they are currently we are surprised&amp;#13;
there are not more people searching for homes.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;The markets in sections of Boston, Newton, Brookline, Cambridge, and&amp;#13;
other areas have some really positive statistics.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;That being said we would think even more&amp;#13;
buyers would be out shopping for home.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The buyers we she shopping now have an amazing advantage!&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;The real estate market in the Boston&amp;#13;
Massachusetts area offers a lot of opportunity.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;You have less competition among buyers, more flexibility in price, and&amp;#13;
low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to contact a reputable mortgage banker for&amp;#13;
information on current rates and to learn more about what mortgage programs are&amp;#13;
available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Money 100 Best Places to Live - Newton, Waltham, Brookline, &amp; Weymouth, MA make the list</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People in Massachusetts really love their home towns.&#160; They have energy and excitement when they speak about their community and there are some great places to live in the Commonwealth.&#160; Four cities in Massachusetts made it to this year&#8217;s list of &#8220;&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/index.html"&gt;America&#8217;s 100 Best Small Cities to Live&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; found in August 2010 issue of Money magazine.&#160; The City of Newton took the third place on the list, Waltham 28th, Brookline was at 39, and Weymouth was listed at 52.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money magazine &#8220;this year focused on the nation&#8217;s small cities (those with populations of 50,000 to 300,000).&#160; Reporters crunched reams of data to find the optimal combo of job opportunities, fiscal strength, top-notch schools, low crime, good health care, lots to do, and many other factors that help a town great for raising a family.&#8221;&#160; They also took a look at the overall strength of the economy and housing market in various American metro areas.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It becomes clear the real estate and economic climate in Massachusetts is a bit more promising then some other areas in the country.&#160; Money&#8217;s research pointed out that the metro area of Peabody and Boston have a &#8220;strong&#8221; economy and housing market with metro Cambridge getting the &#160;best rating of being the &#8220;strongest.&#8221;&#160; We think this is pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past year within the housing market itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/"&gt;City of Newton&lt;/a&gt; Massachusetts with a population 82,000, 13 villages, and a rich New England heritage ranked &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2545560.html"&gt;third on the list of top 100&lt;/a&gt; cities in Money magazine.&#160; The magazine highlighted the cities great schools, low crime, and strong economy as reasons for the favorable standing.&#160; It also noted pricey homes and traffic as negatives just west of Boston.&#160; We are also happy to see that it got noticed for having an &#8220;A&#8221; grade for &#8220;Arts/leisure&#8221; and for the &#8220;health&#8221; category.&#160; Schools are important in Newton, &lt;a href="http://www.greatschools.org/massachusetts/newton/"&gt;well ranked&lt;/a&gt;, and just this week the new, 413,000 square foot, &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/newton/2010/08/students_leaders_agog_at_new_n.html"&gt;$197 million dollar&lt;/a&gt;, Newton North High School opened its doors and features a college like amenities that is simply state-of-the-art.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a population of 60,000 the &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2572600.html"&gt;City of Waltham&lt;/a&gt; Massachusetts was &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2572600.html"&gt;ranked 28th&lt;/a&gt; on the Money list.&#160; It scored an &#8220;A&#8221; grade for the Arts/leisure along with health.&#160; Housing affordability, though lower then Newton, is still high compared to other cities on the top 100 list.&#160; This city has seen recent renovations to &lt;a href="http://www.greatschools.org/massachusetts/waltham/"&gt;their schools&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Moody street is filled with restaurants and nightlife, home to Brandeis and Bentley University, and economically strong do to the large of corporations that call Waltham home.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brooklinema.gov/"&gt;Brookline Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; with a 58,000 population is listed &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2509210.html"&gt;39th on the list&lt;/a&gt; top America&#8217;s 100 Best Small Cities list.&#160; It might not get the best markets for housing affordability but this town gets the grade for everything else.&#160; Exclusive condos typically exceed a price tag of $500,000 and single family homes often considered estates reach well past the multiple million dollar value.&#160; Brookline&#8217;s exciting location next to Boston, active neighborhoods, public transportation, high-owner occupancy, and great schools make this town both stable and exclusive.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth Massachusetts city on Money&#8217;s list is &lt;a href="http://www.weymouth.ma.us/"&gt;Weymouth Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL2578900.html"&gt;ranked at 52.&lt;/a&gt; Located on the south shore this area has more affordable homes and features 12 miles of ocean front.&#160; It is has reasonable commute to Boston.&#160; The location also provides its residences to beach, access to Cape Cod, and other exciting cultural and leisure actives in the area.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many fine cities and towns in Massachusetts.&#160; These are four that have been listed by Money magazine this year.&#160; We think they are great communities that deserve to be highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dwell360.com"&gt;Dwell360&lt;/a&gt; is a residential real estate brokerage in Massachusetts founded by Edward Johnston and John Lynch.&#160; Our experienced agents have a proven track record of success in the metropolitan Boston real estate market.&#160;

      <title>Dwell360 at Inman Connect in CA</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago Ed and I left William Raveis Real Estate&amp;#13;
to begin opening our new firm Dwell360 (Dwell Three Sixty.)&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;It has been an exciting few days. &lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;At this has been taking place I picked up and&amp;#13;
flew to California to attend the Inman Connect an innovative real estate conference.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Ed has been powering all the progress back at&amp;#13;
headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a successful few days.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Some clients have called looking to list&amp;#13;
their homes and buyers are heating up their searches.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;I have been hearing from real estate leaders&amp;#13;
and influencers about their companies, their products, and real estate&amp;#13;
industries growth.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Newmark of Craigslist has some great things to say&amp;#13;
about the social phenomenon around Craig&#8217;s List and real estate.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Social media has been one of the top topics&amp;#13;
at the conference and Reddit.com founder Alexis Ohanian nicely outlined how social&amp;#13;
media really can propel a topic into the minds of the public.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;These and the many other speakers have been extremely&amp;#13;
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Property search is going to change over the next few&amp;#13;
years.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;The search functionality will be&amp;#13;
more intuitive and free flowing.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Also,&amp;#13;
the need for mobile solutions is something at the top of everyone&#8217;s list here&amp;#13;
at Inman.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;I have identified a few great&amp;#13;
ways the Dwell360 will be able to leverage technologies to be at the front of&amp;#13;
the real estate marketing online and with mobile.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Technology in real estate is always changing and I am excited&amp;#13;
to see that we will be a part of the evolution.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;For your clients this will ultimately mean we will provide better results!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Get the Fenway Big League Lawn @ Home</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://www.scotts.com/smg/products/Scotts/grass_seed/Fenway_Seed_std.jpg" /&gt;I recently heard this on the radio and just found the site. &#160;Scotts the grass seed and fertilizer company is providing the &lt;a href="http://www.scotts.com/smg/templates/index.jsp?pageUrl=mlb_boston"&gt;Fenway Park Grass Seed and Lawn Fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;. &#160;If you can get your grass to look like Fenway Park that would be great. &#160;Great to look at and great for your property value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is what Scotts says about their Fenway Park Fertilizer and Grass Seed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contains the same Scotts&#174; fertilizer technology and actual grass seed varieties used at&#160;Fenway Park&#8482;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endorsed by the Director of Grounds of the&#160;Boston Red Sox&#8482;, David Mellor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premium fertilizer and grass seed blends for a lush,&#160;green lawn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MLB Authentic Collection&#8482;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It is exciting that my fellow Red Sox fans can make their homes just like Fenway. &#160;Your home's landscaping in tip top shape is well worth the investment. &#160;Good luck.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Mistakes Buyers Make</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I came across an article from CNNMoney.com titled &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/autos/1004/gallery.Costly_homebuying_mistakes/index.html"&gt;&#8220;6&amp;#13;
biggest mistakes home buyers make.&#8221;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/a&gt;After taking a look at the list I thought the six items are noteworthy.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;I am not sure if they are the biggest&amp;#13;
mistakes that a buyer can make.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;But, the&amp;#13;
list is one worth review.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Here is why I&amp;#13;
think the six items they mention are important to a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;1.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Know Your Credit Score &#8211; Your credit score one&amp;#13;
of the major factors in what a bank will review and consider when approving you&amp;#13;
for a mortgage.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Not only do you need to&amp;#13;
know your score you need to know what that score represents.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;2.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Don&#8217;t buy a car before a house &#8211; Or any other&amp;#13;
major purchase.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;When you make large&amp;#13;
purchases your credit can be affected and your cash reserves will also be&amp;#13;
affected.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;If you took a loan for that&amp;#13;
new car now you might feel more pressure to qualify for a mortgage.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;If you paid cash for that same car, keeping&amp;#13;
that cash on hand in the bank, could have better results for you qualifying for&amp;#13;
a better rate on your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;3.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Skimping on a home inspection &#8211; We spend a lot&amp;#13;
of time with our clients making sure they do not skimp on their home inspection.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;This is a critical time to learn about your&amp;#13;
home and perform any needed due diligence.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;You need to take the time to be a part of this important process.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;4.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;No Attorney &#8211; We encourage everyone to have an&amp;#13;
attorney when they are buying a property.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;Often there are many unforeseen issue that arise with the title, the&amp;#13;
sale, and the parties involved.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;A good&amp;#13;
agent will help control that but certain issues an attorney needs to&amp;#13;
handle.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Often with a great team in place&amp;#13;
you will not even notice the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;5.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;No Contingencies &#8211; You should have a home inspection&amp;#13;
contingency or mortgage contingency when you are purchasing a home.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;If you know you need a mortgage then you&amp;#13;
should never waive that element of the offer.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;Contingencies are part of your offer to protect your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;6.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&amp;#13;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Budgeting for Insurance &#8211; It is important to&amp;#13;
budget for the other items associated with home purchase.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Home owners insurance is one, don&#8217;t forget&amp;#13;
about property taxes, utility bills, and landscaping.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;If you are upsizing or first time home buyer&amp;#13;
these items might be more expensive then you are used too.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;A great buyer&#8217;s agent will help you thought the process and&amp;#13;
make sure you do not make any big mistakes.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&amp;#13;

      <title>What is going on this month?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy few months.&#160; Ed and I have put under a very solid number of properties under agreement in the last month.&#160; It has been exciting and the activity stills continues.&#160; We have put listings under agreement and buyers have secured properties.&#160; But, there is more work to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ed posted the other day he took one client out to see 26 properties in three days.&#160; A few days ago I took clients from the west coast out to see 32 properties in three days.&#160; Then we have local buyers that have put in offers on properties and each time is dealing with multiple bid situations.&#160; Then there are a few other buyers are just sitting waiting for something to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the markets we deal in (there are a few like, Newton, Brookline, Boston, Wellesley, Wayland, Waltham, Cambridge, &amp;amp; other great Massachusetts towns) there are plenty of people interested in purchasing a property, but the inventory is not great.&#160; The homes that are in great condition with a price that presents a certain amount of value to the buyer are scooped up and at times in multiple bids situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buyers visit a lot of home.&#160; They are learning about the market everyday and have been doing their homework.&#160; After visiting dozens and dozens of homes they understand their price range better than some real estate agents.&#160; Then when they walk into a well priced, great condition home, that has a great price it is gone.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buyer knows when there is something well priced.&#160; Now, I mean well priced, not free, not being given away, a price that presents a fair value.&#160; Buyers are ready and want to purchase a home.&#160; They just are willing to wait for the place that works best for their life and their pocket book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the people with those perfect homes that want to move you will stand out if you look great and are priced well. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is 26 too many?</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;Friday there was 11, Saturday was 9, and Sunday finished with 6. &#160;A combination of single family and condos in Newton and Brookline. &#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;One month ago these relocation buyers had made a special trip from Chicago to Boston to spend 3 days looking at properties. &#160;The agent that was assigned to them met them the first day, showed them four homes and then informed them that she was busy the next two days and could not show them any more homes. &#160;Left high and dry and obviously frustrated they looked for a new agent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;After being introduced to me, one month later, and without too many details they informed me that they would be in town and want to see as many houses as possible. &#160;We spent three days together, looked at 26 homes, forgetting most of them, finally choosing one, but need to wait to sell there current home back home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "&gt;Is 26 homes to many to show?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "&gt;- Ed Johnston&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Federal Aid Programs For Massachusetts Disaster Recovery </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been wet, very wet, here is Massachusetts.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;To the point that FEMA announced that federal&amp;#13;
disaster aid has been made available for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;This is a significant resource for the state&amp;#13;
to help correct the damage of these major rain storms.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;The president's action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Bristol, Essex,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester counties. Assistance can include grants for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=12571"&gt;More information from FEMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=50709"&gt;Along with the federal aid programs available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;This also could impact a buyer&#8217;s mortgage on a home in&amp;#13;
the above counties mentioned.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;It may&amp;#13;
require re-inspection by the appraiser or some other addition paperwork.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;So if your currently involved in a real&amp;#13;
estate transaction be sure to address this issue with your lender or real&amp;#13;
estate agents.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&#160;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relocating to/from Boston suburbs and cities with Dwell360</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Relocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Our relocation agents have had extensive experience with clients moving to or out of the suburbs and cities of the greater Boston area.&#160; We have been trained by top relocation companies and are certified to manage their clients.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Moving Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Every year we have clients fly in, get in our car, and ask &#8220;where too&#8221;.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	People often do not know how to start looking for a home in an area they know nothing about. Team members of Dwewll360 spend a lot of time talking and reviewing listings with our clients before they ever arrive. We learn about the communities they live in now and learn more about their ideal criteria.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	So when they fly into look at home for the first time it is educational, exciting, and productive. You experience various communities and get exposed to the flavors of the towns meeting your criteria. So when you ask &#8220;where too&#8221; you will trust it will be worth the visit.&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&lt;strong&gt;Moving Away &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	It is difficult to move never mind moving out of state. Often, you have to move quickly, with loose ends, and possibly your house still on the market. We have the systems and services that top employers call upon to guide, market, manage, and sell a home. We understand that it is difficult and we are happy to help!&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#13;
	Contact 617-299-0012 for more information.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Buyer Plan</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;As your REALTOR&#174; the Dwell360 Team can manage every aspect of your quest to find the perfect home from the beginning of your search to the closing. &#160;A buyer will be faced with a maze of forms, financing, inspections, marketing, pricing, and negotiating. It only makes sense to work with a professional who knows the Massachusetts communities and the&#160;process&#160;of&#160;acquiring&#160;a home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Preliminary Consultation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time we talk we will review your overall objectives in searching for a new home. We will spend sometime getting to know how the process will work and review each step of the process. This will be a great time for you to go over any questions you have.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Obtain a Loan Pre-approval&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A "Pre-approval" means you have met with a loan officer, your credit files have been reviewed and the loan officer believes you can readily qualify for a given loan amount with one or more specific mortgage programs. Based on this information, the lender will provide a pre-approval letter, which shows your borrowing power. You can visit as many lenders as you like and get several pre-approvals, but keep in mind that each one carries with it a new credit check, which will show up on future credit reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Establish Your Search Criteria&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A home is more than just a collection of bedrooms and bathrooms. Several properties -- each with four bedrooms, three baths, and the same price -- may well represent radically different designs, commuting distances, lot sizes, tax costs, interior dimensions, and exterior finishes. Together, we will consider your priorities and establish a criterion that works for your search. How do you stay updated? Once you establish the criteria for your search an online account will be set up to keep you informed on your current properties. Each day you will be emailed with updates on properties fitting your criteria. You will have the ability to look at pictures, property details, and other important information.&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Look at Homes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have established the search criteria we will begin visiting the listings that fit your criteria. We can visit any property that fits your criteria. Online listings and other properties that I find will be considered for our tours. Once we identify the properties of interest, I will make all the arrangements necessary for us to tour the homes. When can we look? Anytime. We can set-up days and times in advance and work around your commitments. When ready to look at homes we can set-up a tour of one home or many. In most cases 24 hours or more is needed to establish a visit. If the circumstance arises requiring an immediate visit we will make every attempt possible to arrange a visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Choose a Home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a buyer, here's what actually happens. A home has been placed on the market for which the seller has established an asking price as well as other terms. In effect, this is an offer. At this point, you have three choices: accept the seller's offer and create a contract; reject it and not make an offer; or suggest different terms and make a counter-offer. If you choose this last option, the seller may accept, reject or make a counter-offer. No aspect of the home buying process is more complex or personal than bargaining between buyers and sellers. This is the point where the value of an experienced REALTOR(R) is clearly evident because he or she knows the community, has seen numerous homes for sale, knows local values and has spent time negotiating realty transactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Make an offer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. To create an offer we prepare and present the following information in writing to the seller.&#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;a. &#160;Price&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;b. &#160;Date of Purchase and Sale&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;c. &#160;Dates of Closing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;d. &#160;Contingencies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;e. &#160;Inspection Contingencies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;f. &#160;Mortgage Contingencies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;g. &#160;Earnest money of approx. $1,000 (personal check)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;h. &#160;Signature of all buyers&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i. &#160;Negotiate any terms and conditions if necessary&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;j. &#160;Sign revised offer if applicable&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;k. &#160;Receive final offer signed by seller&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Get an accepted Offer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. Inspection - conducted within 5-10 days&lt;br /&gt;b. Buyer and agents present&lt;br /&gt;c. Radon test can be conducted at this time also&lt;br /&gt;d. Buyer pays inspection company directly&lt;br /&gt;e. Response to Inspection - within 24 hours of inspection report&lt;br /&gt;f. Provide notice of any issues needed to be addressed&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;g. Insure your comfort level with property&lt;br /&gt;h. Obtain any additional documents/information&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i. Condominium documents &amp;amp; budgets&lt;br /&gt;j. Special contingencies&lt;br /&gt;k. Mortgage Application&lt;br /&gt;l. Within a few days of accepted offer you should contact your mortgage broker and begin the full application process&lt;br /&gt;m. Choose an attorney to handle your transaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Purchase and Sale - "P&amp;amp;S"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#8226;	Normally within 2 weeks of accepted offer&lt;br /&gt;&#8226;	Deposit due at this time, traditionally 5% of purchase price&lt;br /&gt;&#8226;	All parties must sign by deadline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. &#160;Finalize all mortgage and legal paperwork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. &#160;Obtain homeowners insurance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. &#160;Deed and Closing Paperwork reviewed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;12.&#160;Close and Move&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Typically within 2-3 months of offer. At that time the final down payment is due. The deed delivered in your name to the registry of deeds. Then it is time to move in! During the entire process as your buyer's agent I will be your guide. At each step I will communicate what you will need to address and what needs to be resolved. Throughout this process I will remain proactive to keep your transaction on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	As we show your home we then contact buyers and/or their agents after a showing to obtain feedback. &#160;This often can help us address concerns the buyer has with your home. &#160;It also provides great resources for helping correct any issues with the home that prevent someone from making the offer.&#160;Once we find the buyer, an entire new set of skills are required to get your home to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Negotiations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;

	The entire process of selling your home is cumbersome. &#160;We simplify that process and are extremely attentive to the details. &#160;Paperwork, inspections, deposits, banking requirements, along with other important details are closely monitored and proactively managed.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	At all times we remain in direct contact with our clients. &#160;Communication is the corner stone of our relationship with our clients. &#160;We keep you up-to-date during the entire home process. &#160;This will help you make informed decisions and feel comfort in knowing your home is being sold by excellent REALTORS&#174;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safety &amp;amp; Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#13;
	Safety is an important part of representing your family and your home. &#160;All potential buyers are pre-screened prior to visiting the home. &#160;At open houses we have visitors sign in and we keep a watchful eye. An agent who is attentive to the security of the home will deter the would be thief.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
