<p>I have just finished reading Eric Ries' excelent new book '<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/book" target="_self">The Lean Startup</a>'.  Esentially it's a very readable, down to earth, practical crash course in lean development.  It's about working out how you can accelerate thorugh a loop of validated learning as quickly as possible with the minimum amount of waste.</p>
<p>Now there has been a lot of stuff written decrying the sloppy way lean (and agile) processes have been misapropriated by the marketng world.  But I think there is an important lesson in the lean process for planners and the development of strategy.</p>
<p>At the heart of the lean process lies the idea of the minimum viable product: the most basic thing you can put out into the world to test a hypothesis or assumption and get validated learning from the real world.  I believe that in the faster world we live in today, and the relatively ponderous way we (the ad agency industry) produce work, what needs to lie at the heart of communication development is minimum viable planning.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>It's about doing the minimum amount of work needed to get to, or inspire, an idea.  It's about cutting down the waste - things like deliberating adjective soup and brand vegetables for 3 months.</p>
<p>It's about generating hypotheses that can be tested, not sitting in an ivory tower with a damp towel on your head waiting for the answer to appear like divine inspiration.</p>
<p>It's about making stuff that can be tested in the real world, not running weeks of focus groups to hear people talk about how they think they think or might behave.</p>
<p>It's about making as few charts as possible to explain a strategy or idea - get to the work</p>
<p>It's about understanding that strategy has to evolve and morph over time (whilst being aware there's a danger that this could become an excuse for superficiality).</p>
<p>It's a bias to doing over thinking.  </p>
<p>It's about doing stuff to learn stuff.</p>
<p>It's more like experimentation than planning as we know it.</p>

<p>I've been privileged to have served on the Board of the VCU Brandcenter for the last three or so years.  I've also been lucky to have mentored students there (whether they think the same is a fair question) and visited to teach some guest clasees.</p>
<p>It's a terrific school that, for the last 8 years, has been brilliantly led by the Director, Rick Boyko.  He's helped build an amazing program, full of great students and helped the Brandcenter reside in a brilliant, purpose built home.  As a result, the students from the school are far more ready for agency life.</p>
<p>The time has come for Rick to leave the school and the search is on to find a brilliant individual to be the next Director.  If you, or someone you know, feels right for this job please encourage them to think about applying.  It's a huge job; the site perhaps aptly describes it as the biggest job in advertising.  The brief for the role is below and more details are available <a href="http://www.thewhosearch.com/" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Rick for all you've done.  And let's hope the Brandcenter gets the Director it deserves.  Here's the brief:</p>
<p>We are seeking a nationally recognized, high-energy, high profile leader who has the vision and ability to work to inspire faculty, staff and students as well as advertising agencies, marketers and the brands they represent.</p>
<p>We seek someone who has earned the respect of their peers over the course of their professional career. Someone who understands that the business of marketing communications is one built upon the integration of different disciplines working together collaboratively. We seek a strong communicator who understands the importance of transparent decision-making. One who will strive to share the responsibility of continuing to evolve the academic program with the Brandcenter’s professionally accomplished faculty. Experience with advertising or marketing education is desirable, as is experience with and a capacity for development and fundraising.</p>

<h1>The secret of Adele's success? No festivals, tweeting – or selling out</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Soul superstar reveals how staying small has made her massive</p>
<p>By Adam Sherwin</p>
<div>
<p><em>Tuesday, 24 May 2011</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>She refuses to headline Glastonbury, bans her hits from advertising campaigns and won't turn her life into a soap opera. Adele has revealed the five-point plan which turned the singer into the world's most successful – yet reticent – pop star.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Tottenham-born singer's latest album 21 has sold 5 million copies and currently sits atop the US Billboard chart for the ninth consecutive week. At 11 weeks, she holds the record for the longest consecutive stretch at number one by a female solo artist.</p>
<p>Yet relatively little is known about Adele, 23, who stopped sending personal tweets two years ago, just when her celebrity contemporaries began using Twitter as a confessional.</p>
<p>In an interview with Q magazine, Adele says that, despite huge commercial offers, she refuses to "sell out" and despises artists who exploit their fans for financial gain.</p>
<p>Rule number one in the singer's plan is no advertising tie-ins. "I think it's shameful when you sell out," she says. "It depends what kind of artist you wanna be but I don't want my name anywhere near another brand. I don't wanna be tainted or haunted." Adele attends every "strategy meeting" and approves every decision personally.</p>
<p>Rule number two is to restrict interviews and avoid Lady Gaga-style ubiquity. "I don't want to be in everyone's face. I'm a big music fan and I get really pissed off when it gets like that ... and I don't want people to get like that with me."</p>
<p>She won't tolerate the traditional marketing scam of record labels re-releasing albums with extra tracks to make fans buy a record twice. "I was furious when they did that on [her debut album] 19. I said 'No' and they did it anyway. Just mugging off your fans."</p>
<p>Rule number four: Adele won't play Glastonbury or another festival. "I will not do festivals. The thought of an audience that big frightens the life out of me. I don't think the music would work either. It's all too slow."</p>
<p>And finally arenas, such as the 18,000-capacity O2 Arena and their ilk, are also out. "We had three nights on hold at The O2 and I was like 'I wont play a festival. You think I'm gonna play a fackin' arena? Are you out of your mind?' I'd rather play 12 years at the Barfly [small venue for indie bands] than one night at The O2! So I've made all those decisions and some people are pretty mortified. They think I'm mad."</p>
<p>Paul Rees, the editor of Q, said: "What's become lost in the Lady Gaga-era is the confidence in the idea that less is more. A large element of Adele's success is that she remains something of an enigma and we don't know everything about her."</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There's an infamous story in music.  It's about this:</p>
<p><a href="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e2014e88952bf2970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="1211081vanhalen1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8345189ec69e2014e88952bf2970d" src="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e2014e88952bf2970d-320wi" title="1211081vanhalen1" /></a></p>
<p>Van Halen's infamous tour rider from the 1980s contained the immortal line: "M&amp;M's (WARNING: ABSOLUTELY NO BROWN ONES)."</p>
<p><a href="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20154327486a3970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="1211081vanhalen9" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8345189ec69e20154327486a3970c" src="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20154327486a3970c-320wi" title="1211081vanhalen9" /></a></p>
<p>Many have quoted this as a sign of arrogance and excess in rock.  But there's perhaps a different reason; a very smart piece of small thinking.  Van Halen were the first major act to really tour secondary and tertiary markets in the US and were unsure about how good and safe the venue organizers were there.  If they got to the venue and found Brown M&amp;Ms they could deduce either the rider hadn't been read carefully or was being ignored.  And this means the more important aspects of staging - lighting, safety, sound, security - could have been screwed up by an amateur (or arguably criminal) promoter.  It was the proverbial canary in the coal mine.  It was a brilliant bit of thinking small.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So the final ramble about the presentation I did last week at Future Flash.  It's the most navel gazing one of the lot as it's about what I think agencies, and particularly planners, need to do if they want to make small ideas happen.  Here goes:</p>
<p>1.  Build brands from the bottom up rather than the top down</p>
<p>Brands aren't how we define them but are things formed in people’s minds.  As Jeremy Bullmore said many years ago, "Consumers build an image [of a <em>brand</em>] as birds build nests. From the scraps and straws they chance upon." So wouldn't it make more sense to perhaps, for once, build our brands from the bottom up rather than the top down; from actions rather than brand vegetables or mission statements.  It's again about being action, rather than word, driven.  Making real things and see how they do in the world rather than spend 3 months thinking about whether your brand is amusing or funny.</p>
<p>2.  Be useful,interesting, entertaining and playful in the service of people</p>
<p>Preferably all four of the above, at least three.</p>
<p>3.  Think about what communication strategy can learn from UX design</p>
<p>Whether we try to sweeten it or not, communication strategy tends to be built on the assumption that interruption is best.  Maybe we can learn from UX design and think about communicating in a way that removes friction in a near invisible way and get credit for that, rather than shouting more cleverly.  At the very least let's focus on the right 3 degress not 360 degrees.  I still think we have a tendency as an industry to deploy the 'Dr Seuss Communication Strategy' - to put it on mats, on hats and on cats.  (Thanks Mr Robson for the inspiration for Seuss).</p>
<p>4.  Do something and interesting things will happen</p>
<p>Again be action oriented.  Make communication products, not PowerPoint.  Be biased towards actions, not meetings</p>
<p>5.  Build a culture of experimentation not planning</p>
<p>Do stuff and learn from it rather than learning and doing.  It's more realistic and the cost of trying stuff is getting lower and lower.  Place lots of bets and think about your Communication R&amp;D strategy and budget - or join the 5% Club as<a href="http://www.contagiousmagazine.com/" target="_self"> Contagious</a> likes to put it.</p>
<p>6.  Realize perfection is the enemy</p>
<p>We spend far too long trying to make things perfect - the words on a brief, the layout - rather than getting ideas out there in to the real world.  As Lorne Michaels says of Saturday Night Live, "the show doesn't go on because it's ready; it goes on because it's 1130."  We need to realize that good enough is more often than not good enough.</p>
<p>7.  Be rewarded for good behavior</p>
<p>Finally this controversial one as it's about money and how we get paid.  The way agencies by and large are compensated - time plus - encourages bad behavior: get as many people as you can to work really slowly.  On one thing.  Repeat.</p>
<p>What if we got rewarded in a way that encouraged better behavior.  What if we got paid for outcomes rather than outputs or inputs?  What if we got paid for business results driven by our portfolio management?  What if we got paid for being more efficient in the way we work and prodigious in our output?  What if we learned from builders and contractors, of all people, and got bonused for finishing stuff ahead of time?</p>
<p><a href="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e201538e7d829f970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Madisonvalleybetter" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8345189ec69e201538e7d829f970b" src="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e201538e7d829f970b-320wi" title="Madisonvalleybetter" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>This talk was all about need to break the tyranny of big and embrace small.  I genuinely believe it's what we have to do in order to remain relevant.  We have to stop conflating the outcome with the means.</p>
<p>As I've said before I think the agencies of the future will combine the storytelling skills of Madison Avenue with the inventive, purposeful experimentation and speed of Silicon Valley.  Small ideas, and big success, will live here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I think small ideas tend to have most (if not all) of the following characteristics:</p>
<p>1.  They tend to be in the service of people</p>
<p>Sounds like rule one of marketing, but too often we forget this (probably calling people 'consumers' doesn't help).  Far too often we get narcissistic about the brand (people must be interested in what we make) rather than be humble, empathetic and interested in their lives.</p>
<p>As I've talked about before, the great brands today understand what people are interested in and work back from there. Great communication ideas act as a bridge.  A bridge between what people are interested in and what you make/ sell. A bridge between your world and theirs; real life/culture and commerce.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="290" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S10QU8n3ulc" width="350" /> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.  They reduce friction</p>
<p>I wrote about this last month - how brands today seem to be learning from design and thinking about how they can remove friction between themselves and people; between what people do now and what they want them to do. Great examples of this are the <a href="http://www.ibelieveinadv.com/2010/11/museum-of-london-streetmuseum-iphone-app/" target="_self">Museum of London app</a> from Brothers and Sisters that gets art out of the museum and in to people's hands, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUwQZ57SSds" target="_self">Epic Mix app</a> for Vail that uses RFID technology rather than check ins and even an idea like <a href="http://battleofthecheetos.com/" target="_self">Battle of The Cheetos</a> that created a game where people went online rather than try and get people to visit your own site (which is a fairly futile thing to do given the average Amercian goes to 3-5 sites a day).</p>
<p>3. They're one of many</p>
<p>This is something I've talked about for a while but still believe is critical - the need for brands to do lots of things, not one big thing.  It ties back to the point about placing little bets and is about managing portfolios rather than playing roulette.  Google is a great example of this type of prodigious brand - search to Google 411 to Chrome (the list goes on).  </p>
<p>Creating brands built around a coherent stream of small ideas makes them stickier (the velcro analogy Russell Davies has used that I still think is an incredibly helpful metaphor) and more powerful - being the brand of new news and seen as having momentum and energy is the best leading indicator of future preference and usage.  It also means you are more likely to thrive in a world where 95% of things die.</p>
<p>4.  They do rather than say</p>
<p>It's about making communication products, not communicating a product</p>
<p>5.  They build long ideas</p>
<p>The long idea is a brilliant thought first articulated (I think) by <a href="http://cmocongress.com/speakers/jon-williams/" target="_self">Jon Williams</a> of Grey.  The long idea is a better objective than the big idea.  They're created by a stream of small ideas.  It creates participation and realizes that the launch of the campaign is, in reality, the beginning. It creates real pervasiveness in culture</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll write about how we can think, and make, small ideas</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I think small matters for three fundamental reasons:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.  Big problems don't require big solutions</p>
<p>One of the most important pieces of academic work in the last few decades has been in the field of behavioral economics.  It's hugely important to advertising (Rory Sutherland made it the focus of his two year Presidency of the IPA) but despite this and increasingly popular books on the subject (<a href="http://nudges.org/" target="_self">Nudge</a> by Sunstein and Thaler is as good a place as any to start) we tend to ignore its most basic premises.</p>
<p>One of these is that big behavioral change can occur through small actions.  Perhaps the most famous example is of the huge impact the default setting is on an employee's 401k enrollment.  More often than not the default is set to opt out.  When this is changed to opt in as the default, participation and saving increases dramatically.  </p>
<p>Rory Sutherland talked about the issue of people not finishing their drug prescriptions - a waste of tablets and in some cases (eg antibiotics) patients who aren't fully treated (with the ensuing further days off work, medical costs, erc.)  So why not change the instructions to read, for example, "first take the yellow tablets for 10 days and then take the red tablets for the next 10 days").  Same medication, much greater likelihood for the treatment course to be finished (this is, I believe, called "chunking").</p>
<p>2.  Culture is increasingly small</p>
<p>When I worked on Palm, I was lucky enough to interview <a href="http://mobilized.allthingsd.com/20110201/exclusive-googles-android-design-expert-outlines-the-vision-behind-honeycomb/" target="_self">Matias Duarte</a> the Head of Human Interface and User Experience (he's now doing amazing work at Google on Android).  When I asked him about the goal of his work he quickly replied, "make it invisible".</p>
<p>The same is true of Jack Dorsey's work on Square. An <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/32360/" target="_self">article</a> in the MIT Tech Review said this about the design philosophy: "Square is <em>elegant</em>. The user's flow through payment or application has been reduced to the fewest possible steps; the app has minimal features. This emphasis comes directly from Dorsey, who says, "I'm really good at simplifying things." He espouses a tremendously attractive belief that good industrial design wins customers' trust by disappearing."</p>
<p>This seems to make intuitive sense:  we know from experience that the best customer service, for example, is the service you don't notice.</p>
<p>So, in the increasingly well designed world we live in, the advertising beliefs of bigness, interruption and 'grabbing attention' seem rather at odds with an ethos of smallness (to the point of invisibility).</p>
<p>3.  Small is good for business</p>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439170428/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=peterscom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1439170428" target="_self">'Little Bets</a>', <a href="http://petersims.com/" target="_self">Peter Sims</a> talks about how great companies stumble upon  greatness.  It comes from experimentation and learning from placing little bets rather than ponderously trying to birth perfection. Google's a great example of this (originally a project to index Stanford's library). as are Starbucks and the way comedians and musicians try out new material.  It's what gets Pixar from "suck to non-suck" through huge amounts of early iteration and feedback sessions every day around rushes.</p>
<p>But being small isn't just good for start ups, it's great for big brands.  At the PSFK conference in New York last year, the designer Andy Spade made the terrific point that "a bigger a brand gets, the smaller it has to act".  It's kind of the common sense version of Coke's 'think global, act local'.  More importantly, doing lots of small stuff is what makes a brand feel personal and, more importantly, gives it energy and momentum, the best leading indicator of future preference and usage.  So being small creates unfair advantage.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'll talk about what a small idea looks like.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It may seem odd for an ad person to talk about the importance of thinking small.  After all, one of the most transformative ads for any brand (and an ad many argue changed the industry) carried this thought as a headline.</p>
<p><a href="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20154324a1a9d970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Think-small" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8345189ec69e20154324a1a9d970c" src="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20154324a1a9d970c-320wi" title="Think-small" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Yet I think as an industry we are defined by another ad.  This one:</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_39b8e5PXWw" width="350" /></p>
<p>We believe, the bigger the better.  We want a big idea .  We want to launch it in a big way to create a spectacular firework display.  We want to shout and show our stuff in front of big audiences (hence the love of the SuperBowl).</p>
<p>The problem is 'big' isn't working.  Andrew Ehrenberg has shown that it most categories a brand's market share is stationary.  Copernicus Consulting have reported that people find brands and ads far more similar than different.  McKinsey reports that CPG marketers are spending three times more on price promotion than they are on brand building.</p>
<p>The issues, I believe, is that we have confused the end with the means.  Of course we want big business results and brands and communication that feel big, pervasive and central to culture.  But, perhaps counter-intutively, we need to think and act small not big. We need to break the tyranny of the big idea and embrace small.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'll talk about why.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>One of the thoughts that really crystallized in my mind judging the Clios was that there is an increasing amount of work that sets a new role for communication - to remove, or at least reduce, the friction between brands and people.  They attempt to create frictionless brands.  This can be done in a number of ways - from doing something for a group of people and then using communication to amplify it (think things like H&amp;R Block or Dulux's Let's Color project) to using media and technology to remove barriers between the product and people (think Jay-Z's Decoded campaign or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uWzo5saKDE" target="_self">Epic Mix</a>).</p>
<p>It really felt the best work this year had really simple ideas that removed the barriers between people and brands; between what people do and what you want them to do.  Yes, there was some amazing execution and amazing use of technology but it finally seems that we are in a world where elegant solutions trump elegant things.</p>
<p>Flying back from the Clios, I was reading a piece in MIT's Technology Review about Jack Dorsey.  It talks about the ethos behind <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_self">Square</a> and says this: "Square is <em>elegant</em>. The user's flow through payment or application has been reduced to the fewest possible steps; the app has minimal features. This emphasis comes directly from Dorsey, who says, "I'm really good at simplifying things." He espouses a tremendously attractive belief that good industrial design wins customers' trust by disappearing."</p>
<p>Maybe advertising is finally catching up with industrial design.  But if it is, we are going to need to think about our models and measurement.  Intrusion and noticeability (the AIDA model we tend to default to and most research companies measure by) are rather at odds with ideas that feel a little more invisible in nature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So it's been three months since the last post. I've been caught between not having anything interesting to say and being crazy at work. It's been a time characterized by doing more than thinking, and looking more internally than externally.</p>
<p>But I feel recharged, inspired and very much humbled after spending a week judging the world's best work at this year's <a href="http://www.clioawards.com/" target="_self">Clio Awards</a>.  I was lucky enough to be invited by <a href="http://farisyakob.typepad.com/" target="_self">Faris</a> to sit on the jury judging the integrated and content and contact categories.  To me, these are two of the most important categories that help tell us where advertising might be headed.  I can't, for obvious reasons, go in to specifics as the results need to remain secret until the award ceremony on May 19th.  But I think I can talk about some general observations.  In fact, here's some video:</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uk1g_SKeqCg" title="YouTube video player" width="350" /></p>
<p>Integrated, unsurprisingly, showed how diverse this concept is nowadays.  We saw stuff that ranged from classic execute the same idea across different media to brands that did something and then used media to tell more people about it to work that was more transmedia in nature.</p>
<p>C&amp;C was perhaps the most fun to judge.  As one of our jurors, Rahul Sabnis, brilliant put it it's essentially the incubator category.  It's the stuff that seems to be at the front of the communications train showing us a new direction for the industry and as a result was hugely diverse in nature.  There was a lot of great use of technology but I think the work that stood out tended to have an incredibly simple ideas at its heart.  A simple thing that elegantly removed the barriers between what people currently do and what you want them to do.  I'll talk a bit more about this in a later post.</p>
<p>Of course, no award show roundup would be complete without the cliches you pick up after watching 400+ videos over 5 days.  And, in no particular order, are this year's:</p>
<p>QR codes.  Tattoos.  Town names that are puns or that are changed.  <a href="http://www.nomediaspend.com/" target="_self">No media spend</a>.  And then make sure you take it to the streets.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who entered work - contrary to my thoughts going in to the week, there was some brilliant work produced.  Thanks to Dan, Karl, Lisa and the rest of the Clio crew for making the week so easy and fun.  And thanks to all the judges - Faris, Jay Benjamin, Brett Craig, Amber Finlay, Guido Heffels, Jason Oke, Rahul Sabnis and Mark Taylor - for making me so much smarter during the debates we had over the work.  It's amazing how much you can learn when you are the dumbest person in the room.</p></div>

<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>

<p>It's perhaps an obvious choice but it has to be the Old Spice responses campaign.</p>
<p>It was a brilliantly simple way to turn an ad idea into something with far greater resonance and depth, something that became part of culture rather than an intrusion into it.  But perhaps the most overlooked thing about this was the way it was executed.  Rather than the usual production line process of most campaigns, this was a campaign delivered by a small, agile team for a trusting client that followed a simple set of principles and rules (you can read more about this <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_old_spice_won_the_internet.php" target="_self">here</a>).  </p>
<p><strong>App</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20148c74095a5970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Flipboard2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8345189ec69e20148c74095a5970c" src="http://garethkay.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8345189ec69e20148c74095a5970c-320wi" title="Flipboard2" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>The quite brilliant Flipboard.  Makes functionality and utility beautiful.</p>

<p>google's <a href="http://www.demoslam.com/" target="_self">Demo Slam</a> is a lovely way to celebrate all that google's technology can do.  Not only is the <a href="http://creativity-online.com/news/the-google-creative-lab/146084" target="_self">google Creative Lab</a> living up to its mission of 'reminding the world what it is they love about google', it's also arguably the 'agency' that has made the most interesting stuff this year from Parisian Love on the Superbowl to the quite brilliant Arcade Fire film.  It's full of amazing talent - people like Robert Wong, Aaron Koblin, Chris Wiggins and  Ben Malbon - and it's a crying shame that their only client is google.</p>

<p>I love this band.  Along with the Chapel Club they make me excited about music this year.  </p>
<p>Brilliant single.  I sense their debut will be one of the albums of 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Album</strong></p>
<p>Easy choice - The Suburbs by The Arcade Fire.  Feels epic and small all at once.</p>

<p><strong>On a personal note...</strong></p>
<p>I've been very lucky to have a pretty amazing 2010 personally and professionally.  Thank you to all those (you know who you are) who inspired, provoked and supported me.  And thank you to my wife, Clare, and Esme, my daughter, for all their support and putting up with me.  I don't say that anywhere near often enough.</p>
<p>I hope 2011 can be an even better year.  It's up to all of us to make it as good as it can be.  Happy New Year.</p></div>
