Anything’s Possible is filmed in Detroit and slated for release in Spring 2012. &lt;br/&gt;Ethan is starring in the film and, as the youngest actor/songwriter to compose music for a feature film, has written its music. &amp;quot;It's a Miracle,” a song he wrote for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, is included in the soundtrack. A portion of net profits from “Anything is Possible” will be donated to charities including Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.</description>

Winning this award can help move Living Philanthropic closer towards becoming it's own foundation. &lt;br/&gt;Please vote for CARLO GARCIA under the category VOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR at &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://classyawards.stayclassy.org/classy-awards/voting&quot;&gt;http://classyawards.stayclassy.org/classy-awards/voting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;click SUBMIT BALLOT and tell your friends!&lt;br/&gt;ONLINE VOTING ENDS AUG 25th&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for the support!&lt;br/&gt;More about Living Philanthropic:&lt;br/&gt;Actor and Director Carlo Garcia’s grassroots philanthropic mission to inspire others by making personal donations to hundreds of different charities is moving people nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;Carlo Garcia is a regular guy with an extraordinary idea. In 2010 he chronicled his campaign to donate a small amount to a different charity each day for an entire year, titling the project Living Philanthropic. The overwhelming positive response led him to try the experiment for a second time, however, this year he is focusing on giving a large donation each month to a total of 12 non-profits. Garcia stresses that even a small donation of $5-$10 can make a large difference to those in need. He personally donated around $4,000 during his 365 day mission, but over $15,000 was donated by others who had been moved by his work and contributed on their own.&lt;br/&gt;Through his personal blog, Garcia has encouraged his online followers to join in by donating to the organizations or giving back in non-monetary ways such as volunteering or donating goods. In regards to the future, as Garcia himself says, as long he inspires at least one person he will consider the project a success</description>

Despite warnings from her family and her friends, Maite ignores her declining fortune as ardently as she has ignored the social consequences of the Mexican Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;A CO-PRODUCTION WITH TEATRO VISTA &lt;br/&gt;For more information, please visit : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teatrovista.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.teatrovista.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/Production.aspx?prod=117&quot;&gt;http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/Production.aspx?prod=117&lt;/a&gt;</description>

CHERRYWOOD is probably unlike any place you've lived before. Or maybe it actually is all the neighborhoods you've ever lived in.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;In a world full of anxiety, when the only thing on TV is the NEWS, people stay at home waiting for trouble to be at a low enough level, and then someone decides to throw a party. Flyers are distributed at random offering hope to anyone looking to CHANGE. Posing the question: if you could change one thing about yourself, would you do it? Cherrywood is a hilarious and intriguing bender loaded with great music, social commentary, and cutting edge structure. Sure, to be one wild ride!</description>

I am embarking on a new mission to give to charity every day for a year. This mission is built on a belief that you don't have to be rich in dollars to make a difference, you only need to be rich in spirit. Give Everyday.  So, 365 Charities in 365 Days.  Philanthropy (n.) Love and benevolence toward the whole human family; universal good will; desire and readiness to do good for all mankind.  About Me: I'm just a regular joe. I grew up on the south side of Chicago. I don't come from money. I don't have a lot of money. Growing up, my family would scrape by, yet somehow us kids were always fed and clothed with a roof over our heads. So, I dedicate this journey to my mom for showing me that you can do so much even when you have very little.&lt;br/&gt;To follow my progress, please visit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingphilanthropic.com/&quot;&gt;www.livingphilanthropic.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Performances are Thursday through Saturday at 8PM and Sundays at 7PM. There is no show on Thanksgiving.&lt;br/&gt;About the Show:&lt;br/&gt;If you had to disappear from your life, would you be able to delete yourself from Facebook? In this thrilling new play, a young advertising executive reaches the breaking point and decides to buck the system. He turns to an expert who can give him a detailed lesson in the art of escape. The mission? To dispose of everything that defined his former self. It’s an adrenaline-charged, apocalyptic journey to the edge of existence. HOW TO DISAPPEAR will have you questioning everything that makes us who we are in the 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;How To Disappear won the 38th Arts Council John Whiting Award for New Theatre Writing and a 2007 Peter Brook Award. It enjoyed a sell-out world premiere at Sheffield Crucible in 2007. Its US premiere took place at PCS in Portland, Oregon in Jan 2009.&lt;br/&gt;Directed by Richard Cotovsky and features Shannon Clausen, Scott Danielson, James Eldrenkamp, Carlo Lorenzo Garcia, Kasia Januszewski, Kristina Johnson, Kevin Stark, and Britni Tozzi.&lt;br/&gt;Designers include William Anderson (set), Stefin Steberl (costumes), Matthew Gawryk (lights), Joe Court (sound). Stage Management by Allison Goetzman. Assistant Direction by Brad Bukauskas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryarrchie.com/&quot;&gt;www.maryarrchie.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>
