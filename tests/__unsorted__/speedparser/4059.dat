			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>News broke yesterday that search engine giant Yahoo was willing to be sold for the right price to the right bidder. Less than 24 hours after the dismissal of its Chief Executive, Carol Bartz, and Yahoo has decided to put itself up for sale. </strong></p><p>It has not been very successful in competing against the giant that is <a href="http://www.realwebseo.com/category/google">Google</a>, that itself created Google + to go head to head with social networks such as Facebook. It seems a vicious circle and Yahoo cannot keep up with the likes of apple and Google, so needs a bit of a shakeup and a “comprehensive strategic review”.</p><p>Believe it or not, Yahoo was the web leader when the internet first hit our PC’s, and they have been running for 17 years.  It was first created as a search portal and named “<em>David and Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web</em>” which was renamed “Yahoo” for ease. It would be a sad ending to a rather long, prosperous story. It seems that the advertising revenue, which used to be spent on Yahoo, has been spent on Google and Facebook.</p><p>Yahoo’s revenues have dived by 25% since Carol Bartz started at the company 30 months ago. Microsoft has previously offered to purchase Yahoo for $44bn, but this did not happen.</p><p>The US was Yahoo’s strongest territory, with 16% market share, but now it seems to CE who likes to have a spat of swearing now and then was sacked over the phone.</p><p><strong>Yahoo is still here, it will still be around for a while but sadly, it may end up being that forgotten teddy bear, which was so much fun back in the day, but teddy bears are no longer cool, not when smart phones and handhelds  (Google and Facebook) are around.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launched today <a href="http://www.fixmytransport.com/">Fixmytransport.com</a> is a new website, which allows commuters to report any problems or complain about the standards of their public transport whether it’s by bus, rail, tube and even ferry services.</p><p>This site encourages users to post problems so they can be delivered to the correct transport supplier and so other users can see which problems are posted online. Created by a lone designer over the past 18 months, Fixmytransport.com follows its older sibling <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/fixmystreet-for-local-council-websites/">fixmystreet.com</a>, which allows property owners to complain about elements on their street, or report any problems, which can be sent onto the local councils and fixed as soon as possible. Last year 60,000 problems were reported through fixmystreet.com such as broken street lamps and fly tipping.</p><p>Fixmytransport.com has been open for a limited time for testing, and due to someone’s comment about Woolwich Ferry’s Greenland Pier being in bad disrepair, it was renovated shortly afterwards.</p><p>These projects have had great support from local councils, MPs and for fixmytransport.com the transport for London have hopped on board.</p><p>This process uses crowd surfing where a sheet of contacts is filled in on Google. Customers can then report any problems on the site and they are there for all to see, it’s a bit like public shaming, but actually seems people are very proactive to get these particular problems sorted. This could improve services dramatically.</p><p>Other creations in this category as well as fixmystreet.com are sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?s=department%3ATreasury+section%3Awrans+speaker%3A11036+speaker%3A20280+speaker%3A21830+speaker%3A16343+speaker%3A21290+speaker%3A21979+speaker%3A20281+speaker%3A15242+speaker%3A23731+speaker%3A13377+speaker%3A22053+speaker%3A20972+speaker%3A15269&amp;pop=1">theyworkforyou.com</a>, which approach local MPs and discover what they are actually doing for the local community.</p><p>So the next time your train is late, or a bus has been terminated, don’t sit around moaning about it, get yourself on fixmytransport.com make a complaint or report a problem, because you as well as hundreds of others will be helping improve our transport systems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="float: right; margin: 8px;" title="internet-jounalism" src="http://www.junowebdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/internet-jounalism.jpg" alt="internet jounalism Has the Internet helped or harmed journalism?" width="150" height="150" /><strong>As technology continues to develop, more and more people are consuming their news online every day, meaning that the internet has become an invaluable tool for journalists.</strong> Both broadcasting and print companies are now focussing much more on their online content in order to stay a float, and keep up with the likes of bloggers and social networking sites, which have become very relevant in the world of news. Like with most changes there are both positive and negative implications, and the internet has certainly helped journalism, but it could also be argued that to some extent it has harmed it.</p><p>There are a number of positive implications that the internet has had on journalism, for one it provides mass distribution of content, meaning news companies can reach a much larger and diverse audience. Another key benefit of the internet is the ability to update news fast and the <a title="web design" href="http://www.junowebdesign.com/">web design</a> can be updated instantly without destroying content. The internet has allowed journalists to be able to break news to the public just after an event has happened, giving the phrase &#8216;breaking news&#8217; a lot more credibility. Journalists are often now armed with smartphones, digital tablets and other handheld equipment, enabling them to capture images, video footage and audio a whole lot easier and upload it from their device straight to the internet. Social network applications on smartphones have also allowed journalists to &#8216;tweet&#8217; on the go, meaning consumers can get updates as they happen.</p><p>The internet has also opened up the door for audience interaction, as people are able to leave comments at the end of news articles online, often sparking further debates. Of course audience interaction isn&#8217;t a new thing as previously readers would send letters to newspaper editors, or phone into television stations, but the process has certainly become much more speedy – a simple click of the mouse on a Facebook &#8216;like&#8217; button, under a post, can show your opinion. Most news companies, whether print or broadcast actively use social networking sites where they can send short snippets of information out, refer them to their websites, and interact with their readers.</p><p>As previously mentioned social networking has become one of the biggest things to hit the world of news and journalism. There has been an increasing rise in citizen journalism, with members of the public constantly tweeting, updating their status or writing their blogs. This of course means a lot more competition for journalists in paid positions. On many occasions news is now breaking on social networking sites before journalists have even had the time to report it, whether this be in newspapers, television, radio or even on on their websites. Many celebrities now opt to break their own news on Twitter straight to their followers, to prevent journalists from getting their exclusive stories. The rise in citizen journalism has raised a number of questions such as whether we still need &#8216;real&#8217; journalists? And it has even been questioned whether news articles are relevant today.</p><p>There&#8217;s no hiding that newspaper sales are still decreasing and that many companies are considering saving costs by not printing them, and instead moving news content online. Even university students on Print Journalism courses are being taught how to use broadcasting equipment to make them more versatile and appealing to employers in the future, when perhaps newspapers may be a rare thing. Since the costs cuts were made in the news industry many of the surviving journalists have had to become multi-skilled, learning how to video record, edit and publish their own reports.</p><p>Another issue with online journalism – for news companies – is the fact that the news is free for consumers to read. Many companies have considered charging for their online content, with the Times and the Sunday Times owned by News International taking it a step further and actually implementing charges on their websites in June 2010.</p><p><strong>So has the internet and the availability of &#8216;free&#8217; news caused more harm than good to the industry? Some would argue yes, as the rise in citizen journalism, social networking, and other online journalism runs the risk of cutting back on print journalist jobs. I personally believe a little competition never hurt anyone.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>News hit the television and radio stations yesterday as Steve Jobs CEO of apple resigned with immediate effect.</strong></p><p>It was a surprise but Jobs has been battling with pancreatic cancer for the past few years, but was incredibly private about his illness.</p><p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder of Apple and brought the iPhone, the iPad and other amazing apple products to the world.</p><p>56-year-old Steve Jobs will be replaced by Tom Cook, chief operating officer but will remain chairman of the corporation.</p><p>In his note to the company, Jobs penned, “<em>I always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as CEO of Apple, I would be the first to let you know” and unfortunately, due to health issues that day has come.&#8221;</em></p><p><strong>What does this now mean for Apple?</strong> Well customers will not notice any difference, Jobs guided the company to where is it today, one of the most innovative and popular brands in technology. Apple will continue to produce groundbreaking technologically advanced hardware for years to come, in fact, they believe they have only just scratched the surface with products such as iPod, iPhone and iPad.</p><p>The downside of such news is that Apple shares dipped down <strong>more than 5%</strong>, which suggests that investors’ confidence has decreased with Mr Jobs not being at the top commanding post in Apple.  Competitors HTC <strong>gained shares by 4.1%</strong> and Samsung <strong>grew by 3.2%</strong>.</p><p>Thanks to its innovative products, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has become one of the most desired brands in the world.  From the beginning of April until the end of Jun 2011, Apple sold 20 million iPhones, which made a profit of $7.3BN.</p><p>Steve Jobs originally co-founded Apple alongside Steve Wozniak in the 1970 and rivalled companies as personal computers became incredibly popular.</p><p>Although to friends and colleagues this is sad new, to consumers Apple will continue to produce groundbreaking products that will saturate the market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are one of those shoppers who are seduced by great packaging an engaging advert, and a celebrity endorsing a product, be aware of <a href="http://www.junowebdesign.com/mcommerce-developer">M Commerce</a>, because results have shown, snap purchases of products and services have rocketed due to the increase of shopping on your mobile smart phone.</p><p>People have been found to make comfortable expensive purchases from their homes on their laptops and PC’s, whereas the more spontaneous amongst us are quick to pick up some bargains from our iPhones, smart and android phones. 36% of people say they are confident to use their mobile phones to purchase products up to the value of £10.</p><p>54% of users said they would not be comfortable putting their credit card details through on a smart phone. There are huge security problems and worries about giving out card details across a mobile phone, but companies strive to reduce security risks by providing the option of paying with systems such as PayPal. Security seems to be the main worry amongst female shoppers rather than males.</p><p><a href="http://www.junowebdesign.com/magento-ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> has improved business profits by capturing an active new audience.</p><p>Despite these issues, ecommerce seems to be on the rise, making shopping easy, simple, and available at any time of the day, anywhere in the world, providing you have a good signal.</p><p>Companies have been developing systems whereby paying with your mobile is a real solution, with NFC- near field communication, you literally could swipe your mobile against a card reader to pay for some shopping. This is the other side of the M Commerce coin.</p><p>The strongest players in the mcommerce market currently stand at companies like EBay and amazon who have built specific sites for the mobile user. These sites are scaled down to cope with the mobile phones processing power, they are simpler, not displaying everything you would find on a typical e commerce site. However, this simplicity makes shopping incredibly easy on a mobile phone. My advice, lock away your credit card because M Commerce is here, and it’s going to be around for a long time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Not any more with Hanger King Pro, the specially shaped neck makes sure that every item stays in place and in shape, plus the hanger shoulders protect and prevent snagging on the most delicate fabrics.</p><p>Another great feature of the Hanger King Pro is the ability to hang numerous items on one hanger with its amazing drop loop system, which allows you to attach another hanger below and so on.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> The last 4 days have seen riots and destruction in London and other major cities in the UK. Unfortunately, it seems to continue, yet police are now taking a stronger approach, shipping in thousands of officers and using tactics such as water cannons to calm the riots.</strong></p><p><em>Social media</em> has had an incredible role in the past few days, and this really shows what an incredible platform it really is.</p><p>Firstly, the dark side of social media was the use of platforms to spread unrest and messages of violence, so people could group together and cause chaos. Messages were posted on such sites as <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology/2011/08/10/uk-riots-facebook-invitations-see-2-due-in-court-and-three-new-arrests-115875-23333766/">Facebook and Twitter</a>, yet people quickly forgot these messages are public viewing, this has led to the arrest of numerous people and the fast track through the courts.</p><p>Because of the public nature of these social media platforms, rioters turned to using their blackberry messenger service. This service is not public facing and is encrypted but can be traced unless the user secures the messages to another using the exchange of PIN codes. Incredibly, research has shown that one third of Britain’s youths own a Blackberry due to the fact they are more affordable than android and smart phones.</p><p>Some messages were traced by police and national press, stating areas for groups to meet up, and again these have led to numbers of arrests.</p><p>The other side of social media is that amazing feeling of community and unity. Twitter trending rose including hash tags of #londonriots #riots and a site was set up to help communities clean up after the damaged was caused.</p><p>Thousands of people have tweeted and visited the page <a href="http://www.riotcleanup.co.uk/Riot_Clean_Up.php">Riotcleanup.co.uk</a>. A quick response to the damage caused by the riots and a great sense of community, helping restore areas.</p><p>The power of social media is incredible. People search for news, it’s in our nature to be curious, and want to know if such things are affecting people we know and our areas.</p><p>Think about what you can achieve when you harness the power of social media.</p><p><strong>Extra Video Content:</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Qd0aNqDyg">BBC News on the power of social media during the riots</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong>If you are new to the internet then you could be forgiven for thinking that cookies are a type of delicious biscuit. If you&#8217;re not new to the internet then you will be aware that on 26 May 2011, the rules and regulations regarding cookies changed and that website owners have had to become more proactive in explaining to users how their details are used and stored.</p><p>We have put together a quick guide to cookies that will explain everything that you need to know about the regulation changes and what you can do to stay on the right side of the ICO.</p><p><strong>What is a cookie? </strong></p><p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that are downloaded to a device e.g. a computer or mobile phone when the user accesses certain websites. These cookies allow the website to recognise the user&#8217;s device.</p><p>There is usually nothing sinister at all about this as cookies can perform many useful functions to the user.</p><p>When you access a website, your browser is requesting information from the website&#8217;s server. The server issues the cookie file which is stored on your browser. The cookie file usually contains the alphanumerical details of the cookie, the name of the server that the cookie was sent from and the lifetime of the cookie.</p><p>Cookies usually expire within 30 days and the files are deleted from your browser&#8217;s memory.</p><p><strong>What has changed? </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Before 26 May 2011, all a website owner had to do was state that cookies were used and that users could opt out. Most website owners would drop this information into their privacy policy.</p><p>Now, cookies can only be placed on a user&#8217;s device with explicit consent. The only exception is when the use of cookies is “strictly necessary”.</p><p>The law has a very narrow interpretation of this so you may use cookies in an <a href="http://www.junowebdesign.com/magento-ecommerce">e-commerce website</a> so that the user&#8217;s browser remembers what is in their basket when they navigate from one page to another, however, you would not be able to store cookies that remember the types of products your customers were browsing.</p><p><strong>What will happen if I haven&#8217;t made any changes yet? </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The changes were implemented months ago but it&#8217;s understandable that some business owners are so busy that they wake up one morning and suddenly weeks have passed since they added something to their to-do list!</p><p>Fortunately, the government is taking a phased approach to implementing these new regulations.</p><p>If the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) were to receive a complaint then they will work with website owners to make their websites compliant.  Whilst the ICO doesn&#8217;t appear to have outlined how they intend to enforce these regulations, it is advisable to speak with your web design agency a.s.a.p. to find out exactly where you stand in relation to the new regulations.</p><p><strong>How can I make my website compliant?</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>You could infer consent from a user&#8217;s browser settings, however many browsers aren&#8217;t sophisticated enough for you assume that consent is actively given. Some browser settings may allow some types of cookie but not others. This will be an option in the future but not something you can realistically rely on right now as the current ICO regulations don&#8217;t allow it (watch this space for a predicted change though).</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The ICO website (see the screenshot) has a banner at the top of the page asking users to accept cookies from their website. This is one method you can use to get consent, however, it can be distracting and intrusive for your website&#8217;s design.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4954" title="ico-cookie-regulations" src="http://www.junowebdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ico-cookie-regulations.jpg" alt="ico cookie regulations Guide to Internet Cookies " width="588" height="224" /></p><p><strong>3.</strong> You could add your cookie information to your terms and conditions for when new users sign up to your website. Please note that you would need to alert existing users to these changes and you would need to send an email out or find another way to inform your users of how you use cookies.</p><p>There are loads of imaginative ways that you can make your website compliant with the changes. Whilst these changes have now been implemented, if a complaint hasn&#8217;t been made about your website you can&#8217;t assume that one won&#8217;t be made in the future and so you don&#8217;t have to do anything. If you are unsure about whether your website is compliant with the new regulations then speak to your <a href="http://www.junowebdesign.com/">web design</a> company.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: We do not take any responsibility for how your website complies with laws or regulations, this information is general guide only.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
