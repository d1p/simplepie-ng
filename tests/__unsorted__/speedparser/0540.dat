<p>I feel weird.  Like I should be going to teach Geography to a bunch of 15 year old students outside of Georgetown.</p>

<p>Anyway, years ago I &#8220;bought&#8221; this cat Hendrix, because I fell in love with his pushed in, flattened out, adorable face.  He sort of singled me out in PJ Pet store, probably thinking, &#8220;that bean pole looks dumb enough to spend $1350 on me&#8230; let me act cute&#8230;&#8221; (He was actually $1500 but I waited till he went on sale. Looking back, I only had to wait 6 hours for the price to drop&#8230; I could have bought a defective cat, what goes on sale that fast?) Whatever the case may be, I bought him, paraded him home and realized&#8230; oh sh*t, my room mate (cousin) is allergic.</p>
<p>So, this New Years it will be 6 years that I bought my mother the most expensive cat to ever walk out of Sherway Gardens Mall. She is in love with him, as is anyone that meets his miserable-looking face, and I don&#8217;t regret a single second of my spontaneous purchase.</p>

<p>Both a cool space in the city and a collection of Toronto&#8217;s most creative hair stylists, <a href="http://brennendemelo.com/">Brennen Demelo Studio</a> is my only stop for a hair-fix-me-up. I don&#8217;t even go in and tell him what I need, I actually just say &#8220;I need you, do what you want to my hair.&#8221; An absolute professional and an eye for perfection, Brennen is my go to. For once I have found a place where I walk home 100% satisfied, for this,  I highly recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>Located at<a href="http://brennendemelo.com/"> 316 Adelaide Street Wes</a>t, the studio is a relaxing atmosphere with a killer playlist.  This isn&#8217;t the salon where you wait 3 hours to be seated, nor does your stylist doesn&#8217;t over book, instead takes time making sure you get individualized care.  I prefer as natural as possible; even if I get highlights, you will think it was the work of the summer sun.  It is an illusion though, it is the work of <a href="http://brennendemelo.com/">Brennen Demelo</a>, the sun highlights my skin, not my hair. Nothing is worse than highlight lines&#8230; ugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://brennendemelo.com/">Brennen Demelo Studio</a> is home to some of the industry’s most talented and highly recognized stylists. Some of the teams accomplishments include; gracing covers and spreads in fashion magazines such as Elle, Luxsure and Flare, winning awards such as Canadian Editorial Stylist of the Year and Runway Stylist of the year, being an active members of Toronto Fashion Weeks backstage team, and creating looks for various fashion television shows like Project Runway Canada and Canada’s Next Top Model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Book with your friend, make a day of it, and let Brennen or his team turn your hair from surburbia to stylish in a few hours.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1020" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1020" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1020"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1020" title="church 1lrg" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/church-1lrg-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: Now Magazine</p></div>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1021" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1021"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1021" title="church2" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/church2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Walking around Toronto&#8217;s trendiest area, you must be wondering what is taking over the old Slavic Pentecostal Church that graced Queen Street West and Dovercourt.  Well&#8230; I know but I am only going to tell you a little bit.. as it gets closer to the opening you can check in here or on their (soon to be) facebook + twitter for what to expect. Church, will be transformed into a breathtaking Aperitivo Bar with food directly from Italy.  What is an Aperitif Bar?  What does Aperitif even mean?</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1024" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1024"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1024" title="IMG_3290" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3290-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;An apéritif (also spelled aperitif) is usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite. This is contrasting with digestifs, which are served at the end of a meal to aid digestion, although modern medicine discredits this supposed aid in digestion.Apéritif, by extension, is the name of the snack that can precede the meal, and all the food that can come with the drink. This includes an Amuse-bouche, such as crakers, cheese&#8230; This French word is derived from the Latin verb <em>aperire</em>, which means “to open.&#8221;- Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1022" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1022"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1022" title="IMG_3295" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3295-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-1023" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1023"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1023" title="IMG_3300" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3300-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Basically, think yummy Campari&#8217;s and Martini Biano&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Working with some of Toronto&#8217;s best designers, award-winning international chefs&#8230; stay tuned for more details, links to website, facebook and twitter.  This one I am excited for, and will most likely be furniture in this place this upcoming October.</p>
<p>Expected Opening? Check back&#8230; but aim for end of October to have your dancing shoes on and your tummy&#8217;s ready for some love.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was definitely the year for weddings. I have one more this November, and that will make it the 8th wedding I have attended this year (3 were destination weddings&#8230;OUCH!). So, with weddings out of the way for some of my nearest and dearest, the next on the normal list is BABIES!  I am putting in my application for &#8220;Best Aunt Ever&#8221; or &#8220;World&#8217;s Coolest Babysitter&#8221; now, and also telling all my soon to be mommy friends that a) I will still be drinking booze when I come over b) I will probably sit awkwardly holding their child until the kid is at least 2 years old and c) my friend Ali McEwen has created, designed and built up a business, <a href="http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/">Baby on Board Apparel</a>,  with the cutest pieces to keep almost mommies looking hot, fashionable and most of all&#8230; comfortable.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1005" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1005"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1005" title="IMG_3244" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3244-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-999" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=999"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-999" title="IMG_3240" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3240-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I called up my friend Diane, who is going to be a full on mommy in a month or so, then I called up my girl Ali to introduce the 2 over  lunch (coffee+chocolate) at my studio.  My thought process behind this: I hear from my pregger friends how unattractive and bloated they feel, and how hard it is to find cute things to wear while their bodies take a new maternal shape. I think women should feel beautiful and if not, at least comfortable while they are in this amazing time in their life and with Ali&#8217;s line <a href="http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/">BOBA</a>, they actually can.  Her cute pieces work from pre-pregnancy to third trimester to running after a toddler.  Every piece is great quality, designed for movement and changing shapes.  NO one should have to feel ugly when they are doing something so beautiful like bringing life in to the world and creating a family.<br />
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1003" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1003"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1003" title="IMG_3255" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3255-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;d think because Ali came up with <a href="http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/">BOBA</a> she would be married, maybe with 3 adorable kids running around the rec room&#8230; but actually she is the bubbly entrepreneurial unmarried gal (last of a dying breed) who I can gab over martini&#8217;s with and complain about my dates-gone-wrong to.  She came up with the great concept of <a href="http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/">BOBA</a> when her sister became pregnant and needed an alternative to the horrible pickings out there for fashionable almost moms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Founded in 2009, <a href="http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/">Baby On Board Apparel (BOBA)</a>, is a lifestyle maternity clothing line which helps transform your ordinary maternity wear into trendy, key pieces to wear on your daily routines as a future mom.</p>
<p>Born and Bred in Saskatchewan, Ms McEwen knows first hand about the necessity of warm layers and easily transitioning clothing. Being in love with Fashion since her early years, she got inspired to create a maternity clothing line, during her sister’s first pregnancy. As she created her signature UltraSound T-shirt, she saw the potential of fashionable basics growing, thus proceeding to create a line that future mommies all throughout North America will eventually fall in love with.&#8221;</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1004" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1004"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1004" title="IMG_3246" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3246-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Cheers to all you almost moms, new moms and well&#8230; my amazing mom.  You have the hardest job in the world and I commend you for it. Ladies, go get yourself some comfy fashion pieces from Ali, she is an inspiring entrepreneur, super nice person and has a great line that keeps your needs in mind, always.<a rel="attachment wp-att-1006" href="http://shirreffs.ca/?attachment_id=1006"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1006" title="IMG_3265" src="http://shirreffs.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3265-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>It was a fun night with friends and I wanted to take everything home&#8230;. In short, my Christmas shopping is pretty much done and I am deciding where to put huge art pieces around my place.</p>
<p>I nearly passed out from a day of living on hallowe&#8217;en candies and limped downstairs to soak my feet like a pioneer (not a day for heels!).  All worth it.  Great times had by all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ran downstairs tonight to meet a friend for a quick coffee, and I was so distracted by a song being played outside my building. This tall, scruffy, half drunken man playing the same song over and over and over. And although I loved the song, and he played it so well&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember for the life of me what the song was&#8230;</p>
<p>I had just ran down from my place, so I didn&#8217;t have my purse or wallet on me to go bring him change, but I felt like he deserved something. So I walked over, and said: &#8220;Hey, sorry I am just running around, and don&#8217;t actually have any change on me, but I wanted to just let you know that I love your playing.  You are really good.  Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes I swear, I can be so Disney.  He did not even look up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m retired, it&#8217;s end of the month, and I need money.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran back down to bring him something (food, because I don&#8217;t think money would have helped the cause here) and he was gone.</p>
<p>Ah well. Good luck Music Man.</p>
<p>He sits there</p>
<p>With a song</p>
<p>He sits there</p>
<p>Half crazy</p>
<p>Half beautiful</p>
<p>Only one song</p>
<p>Only the same song</p>
<p>Repeatedly</p>
<p>As people walk by</p>
<p>And he remains</p>
<p>Unnoticed</p>
<p>I walk up to him</p>
<p>With nothing to offer</p>
<p>But a thank you</p>
<p>And my heart</p>
<p>He doesn’t look up</p>
<p>End of the month</p>
<p>He has to make rent</p>
<p>Smiles are for young boys</p>
<p>Smiles are for the weak</p>
<p>He needs coin</p>
<p>Not kindness</p>
<p>He needs an end</p>
<p>To ongoing travels</p>

<p>(from the album &#8216;SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN&#8217;)</p>
<p><span id="more-960"></span></p>
<p>Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river<br />
You can hear the boats go by<br />
You can spend the night beside her<br />
And you know that she&#8217;s half crazy<br />
But that&#8217;s why you want to be there<br />
And she feeds you tea and oranges<br />
That come all the way from China<br />
And just when you mean to tell her<br />
That you have no love to give her<br />
Then she gets you on her wavelength<br />
And she lets the river answer<br />
That you&#8217;ve always been her lover<br />
And you want to travel with her<br />
And you want to travel blind<br />
And you know that she will trust you<br />
For you&#8217;ve touched her perfect body with your mind.</p>
<p>And Jesus was a sailor<br />
When he walked upon the water<br />
And he spent a long time watching<br />
From his lonely wooden tower<br />
And when he knew for certain<br />
Only drowning men could see him<br />
He said &#8220;All men will be sailors then<br />
Until the sea shall free them&#8221;<br />
But he himself was broken<br />
Long before the sky would open<br />
Forsaken, almost human<br />
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone<br />
And you want to travel with him<br />
And you want to travel blind<br />
And you think maybe you&#8217;ll trust him<br />
For he&#8217;s touched your perfect body with his mind.</p>
<p>Now Suzanne takes your hand<br />
And she leads you to the river<br />
She is wearing rags and feathers<br />
From Salvation Army counters<br />
And the sun pours down like honey<br />
On our lady of the harbour<br />
And she shows you where to look<br />
Among the garbage and the flowers<br />
There are heroes in the seaweed<br />
There are children in the morning<br />
They are leaning out for love<br />
And they will lean that way forever<br />
While Suzanne holds the mirror<br />
And you want to travel with her<br />
And you want to travel blind<br />
And you know that you can trust her<br />
For she&#8217;s touched your perfect body with her mind.<br />

<p>SIgh. Leonard Cohen. Inspiration.<br />
And God Bless Nina Simone and her angelic voice.  Transports me to another place as all good music should.</p>
