Hanvon has made the world's first color E-ink ereader
</title>
<link>http://www.avecmobile.com/index.php?id=1621</link>
<description> 
Most ebook reader devices are built on E-ink display technology. E-ink is perfect for ebooks because it has been designed with high contrast black-on-white text, flicker-free reading experience in mind. The technology doesn't emit light at all which makes it possible to read ebooks in direct sunlight and it also enables long battery life. However, one thing has been missing from E-ink displays until now: colors. Hanvon has introduced world's first ereader built on E-ink technology that can display colors.

<description> 
Whatever went wrong 10 years ago when tablet PCs were introduced for the first time by Microsoft's Bill Gates has been forgotten. The same PC manufacturers that quickly dropped tablets from their product range, are back again.
