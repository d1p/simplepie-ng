<p>Graphic novels aren&#8217;t discussed nearly quite as much as they should be. Especially when talking in a literary manner. Often put off as comic books, many graphic novels address issues that a novel couldn&#8217;t. Having the more visual element, graphic novels bring more, yet many people see them as immature and unsophisticated. While there certainly are these titles that lend to that categorization, graphic novels like <em>Maus, American Splendor, </em>and <em>Persepolis </em>break the mold and attempt to teach the reader about important things. In the case of <em>Skullkickers </em>though, the point of the graphic novel is to tell a fun story and entertain the reader.</p>
<p>Image Comics, Inc. released a limited edition hardcover collection of the first volume of the graphic novel titled <em>Skullkickers</em> with a subtitle of 1000 Opas and a Dead Body. The basic premise of this first volume is that two mercenaries, generally disliked by the people of their village, go on a mission to find the body of a chancellor that was assassinated soon after he arrived in the village. The story takes place in a medieval sort of world that has werewolves, zombies, orcs, and black magic. This is not the type of thing that you read to be inspired or think more deeply about life. It&#8217;s a story that has fantastic characters, an axe-wielding dwarf and a gun toting bald giant, a brilliant story line, and an art style that makes the entire thing a wonderful thing to read.</p>
<p>The two basic parts of a graphic novel are art and writing. First, let&#8217;s talk about the writing. It&#8217;s simple, funny and gripping all at the same time. It&#8217;s not high philosophy or overly intellectual like some of the other well known graphic novels. It&#8217;s clear that the purpose is to entertain and grab the audience and keep them reading. There is no deep message here, just a fun story to read. The characters and their progression is made interesting through their banter and the fact that they really need one another to complete the mission.</p>
<p>The art is done in a sort of Japanese manga/anime, classic American comic,  21<sup>st</sup> century digital art hybrid that should appeal to most people. Colors are bright, lines are bold and details are high, but not in an overly realistic manner. Every wound has blood spatter and explosions are bright and fiery. Blood is done in a way that makes it look shiny and more like water instead of a way that would be gross or over the top. Action is clear and constant in this story and is something that couldn&#8217;t be done in any other medium, except for maybe film.</p>
<p>Granted, stories like this are not for everyone. Officially labeled as a fantasy action-comedy, this is a very graphic novel that has lots of blood, some innuendo, a few groin kicks, and some dumb jokes. It&#8217;s all very amusing, though children under 13 shouldn&#8217;t be reading it quite yet. While these things may hinder the size of it&#8217;s audience, for those that are looking for something entertaining, easy to read and quick, <em>Skullkickers</em> is a great graphic novel and because there is certainly more coming, it&#8217;s better to jump into the story now.</p>

<p>This lovely car is the Imperia GP. A plug-in hybrid that will get  45 miles on batteries alone, from a Belgian company. With an inline four cylinder turbo engine (212 hp) and an electric engine (134 hp) it can reach 0-60 in under four seconds. Unfortunately it&#8217;s only a concept of the car that was shown at the Brussels Auto Show. But DAYEM is that thing perty. Well I like it anyways.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Facebook has gotten into some hot water over changing their terms of service (TOS) and removing the clause that said when you removed your page all licenses we be reverted to you. But why should you care?<br />
“You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content. “<br />
This is not a big deal, because you never really planned on deleting your account anytime soon did you? Almost every social networking site has a similar clause. This is really nothing new that they have done. It’s logical to say that they won’t do anything, but why was it necessary to change? If you have an argument with these changes the only thing that you can really question is why they changed the TOS.<br />
While this may be uncool, it’s perfectly legal. There is also a part in the terms of service that says they have the right to change the terms without any notice.<br />
“We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or delete portions of these Terms at any time without further notice. Your continued use of the Facebook Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.”<br />
Ok, lets get this straight. Facebook changed their terms of service on February fourth. THE FOURTH, not the 14th or 15th. It’s been almost two weeks since this happened. I find it appalling that mainstream media haven’t noticed it since today. <a href="http://www.aaronhockley.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Hockley</a> blogged about this <a href="http://www.anotherblogger.com/2009/02/09/facebook-terms-of-service-change-content-is-now-licensed-forever/" target="_blank">February 9th</a> and nobody seemed to pay attention. He mustn’t have been the only people looking at it then. Why did it take people so long to catch on to it? This proves the fact that a fervor can be created just by a few words (or withdrawal of words). There are now at least 3 different anti-changes groups within Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg has published a statement pretty much saying that they did this to make it more secure and clarify why they have these terms of service<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=54434097130" target="_blank">²</a>.<br />
If you ever uploading something on Facebook that you actually thought could make you some money, I have no sympathy for you. Why would anybody willingly give away rights to something that they think could make money? I have many pictures uploaded to facebook. I don’t think any of them are particularly newsworthy or interesting enough to make money from. Facebook will not use your pictures to defame you, that’s common logic. It is never in a companies best interest to make their customers look bad. If that’s why you are complaining then forget it. They won’t release pictures you delete to the public and they have never been shown to sell deleted pictures to tabloids. Ok, maybe they have, but I couldn’t find a source. They make millions of dollars.  In 2008 Facebook was projected to make 300-350 million dollars<a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20080131/chatty-zuckerberg-tells-all-about-facebook-finances/" target="_blank">¹</a>. They don’t need tabloid money. It’s too bad that  they legally own the pictures you have already uploaded, but if you didn’t read the TOS before you signed up, that’s your problem, not theirs.<br />
Facebook is a social media site that thrives on user created content. If you didn’t want to share it with the rest of the world, you never had to post it. It’s each users responsibility to post responsibly. (oohh, I get to be redundant).<br />
People need to pay attention to the sites that they use and make sure that they are comfortable letting a corporation like facebook have the ability to publish, produce, perform and do other crap with what you have created. I have no problem with what Facebook has of mine and I have never posted anything that I really felt was special, except for maybe some concert pictures. If you have a problem with what they have done, tell me, I want to hear a good argument against what has changed. Or back me up if you don’t really have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not an expert on this and I may be missing some key facts. I would really like to know more and if you can give me any more information I would gladly appreciate it.  If I made a mistake, please correct me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King of Kong is a wonderful documentary about the journey of one man to break the world record score in Donkey Kong. As first sight that may seem like a very boring movie, but this movie has two very different characters. Steve Wiebe is the challenger. A father of two from Redmond, Washington who recently got laid off. The record holder is a wealthy business man from Florida. His name is Billy Mitchell. Through out the movie the viewer grows a strong attachment to Steve and a deep resentment for Billy. Steve is shown breaking records all over the place in tape and live in front of a lot of people. Being a gamer myself I can understand the pressure that he was put under, but yet he proved himself to be an excellent player. Meanwhile, Billy is shown selling his hot sauce and restocking shelves. Never is he shown playing a game, any game.<br />
The way that the movie is directed makes you feel like you were with him through it all. I wanted him to beat a record so badly it was sad. I won’t say if he beat a record or not, you’ll have to see what happens for yourself. Steve is the type of person that is very easy to like. He is nice to everyone, he never gloats, and he realizes that this is a hobby. Billy, on the other hand, makes himself look like a jerk. He only sends in tapes, yet is shown driving around, eating in his restaurant and relaxing. Obviously he can’t take the challenge and I think he should probably give up the title if you can’t accept you’re not the best anymore. The worst part is that he sends out other people to watch Steve for him. I mean, honestly…?<br />
This is a documentary that plays out like a classic good vs. evil tale. It has moment of happiness, sadness, hope, depression. To make it short it’s got it all. As far as documentaries are concerned it is one that will hold your interest the whole way through and make you want the good guys to win. Go see it, tell me what you think. Did I get anything wrong?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So if you don’t know, Daft Punk has a new movie called Electroma. In short it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It really just had no point, really. All that happened was they walked. It was boring, there is no dialogue, it is about 1 hour and 10 minutes and there is only music for about 30 minutes total. There are a total of three good scenes, th rest of the time all they do is walk, drive a car, or star at each other or themselves in mirrors. Save yourself and don’t even bother getting this, it really is an hour of your life you will never get back. the only good thing about is that it was shot well and looks pretty, for the first 10 minutes you watch them walking. It just got old and really disappointed me. I expected a lot more from them after Interstella 5555 and all their music videos. Wha happen? I don’t know what made them make this and who ever wrote it must have been on a lot of stuff (”hey, let’s make them walk for half the movie without music, people like that right?”). So in short, do something better with your time like…watching paint with some music on. It’s about the same. If you disagree leave a comment and tell me why. Thanks for your time.</p>
