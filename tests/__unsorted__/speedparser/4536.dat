			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>I study marketing and art equally. So something I&#8217;ve always wondered, as I am trying to infuse beautiful words with engaging marketability, is what works better for fashion designers and companies &#8211; a bio written in first person or a bio written in third person?</p>
<p>This is a question that&#8217;s included in my client questionnaire any time I work with a client in designing and writing their brand narrative. Whether they want it to be written from their own point of view, or written from an outside point of view, helps to shape the direction of their brand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tricky thing to decide on. So what&#8217;s better? Is there really a right or wrong? What kinds of things should you consider when determining whether your bio, press release, or brand statement should be written as yourself, or as someone else writing about your brand?</p>
<p>I once listened in on a teleseminar by entrepreneurial fire-starter and author <a href="http://www.whitehottruth.com" target="_blank">Danielle Laporte</a>, who urges entrepreneurs that the way to go is by using &#8220;I&#8221; &#8211; because in her words, &#8220;We all know who wrote the bio anyway.&#8221; From a technical viewpoint, that makes sense. Why pretend that it was written by someone else? </p>
<p>Okay &#8211; so then what about the cases where someone else<em> is</em> writing the bio, like a copywriter (moi) or a PR firm, or a friend who&#8217;s a writer. <strong>In that case, is it simply more professional to have the bio written in third person? Will your company be taken more seriously?</strong></p>
<p>Before we delve into that for businesses, I think it would be interesting to get a more literary perspective on this. </p>
<h3>From a fictional point of view</h3>
<p>Authors and writers often fall into the habit of writing either in first or third person, one or the other, usually. It&#8217;s the type of thing you get comfortable with. </p>
<p><strong>First person &#8220;I&#8221; is used when:</strong></p>
<li> There is a need for personal intimacy &#8211; when it&#8217;s better for the story to feel one character&#8217;s triumphs, thoughts, failures<br />
<br />
<strong>Third person &#8220;Annching/She&#8221; is used when:</strong></p>
<li> There is a need for a wider experience outside of one character&#8217;s point of view
<li> Academics and journalists usually use third person point of view so as to remove personal opinion from their writing<br />
<br />
Another thing I found interesting was that generally (but not always), it is harder to write well from first person point of view, whether in fiction or business. And as such, third person narrative is the most common form used in fiction writing. </p>
<h3>Okay &#8211; so what about writing for brands?</h3>
<p>Think about this for a moment: A PR firm&#8217;s job is not to clarify brand meaning and message. (If they do that, then they&#8217;re good. Keep them.) Their job is to communicate and spread the word about your company in a way that benefits your company&#8217;s prospects. </p>
<p>I have a hunch that the reason why many of the brand profile and about us statements are written in the third person is simply due to the following sequence of events:</p>
<p>1. Big Company is getting bigger and needs someone to handle PR, hires a PR firm.<br />
2. PR firm writes a bio for Big Company. Bio is written in third person, because PR firm is writing about the company. PR firm has always written bios this way, no one has ever complained. And it works. Big Company feels validated seeing all their accomplishments listed out in their bio.<br />
3. Small Company is wondering how to write their bio, thinks about it, and realizes that most of the bios they&#8217;ve seen are written in the third person.<br />
4. Small Company assumes this is the industry standard, that it will help them compete in a professional arena if they follow suit.</p>
<p>But, I always like to question whether something is really working, and even if so, is there a more effective alternative? Of course there is &#8211; because, as we all know, the fashion industry is prone to fall into conventional habits that aren&#8217;t necessarily in anyone&#8217;s best interests. And as we move towards an economy with more small business owners, we have to really think about the methods that we&#8217;re using to drive business, because these small companies don&#8217;t have what big companies have to support them. </p>
<h3>The power of first person narrative</h3>
<p>A lot of people write in third person because it is more comfortable to write about themselves in that way. But it can also be a disservice when we look at the reasons why first person narrative might be a better option.</p>
<li> People connect to people. Your customers are people, aren&#8217;t they? When you write from the first person, even if your company is not you, it feels more personal, like a person is behind it.<br />
</p>
<li> We want to know why. Not everyone knows that they want to know why, but they do. The why is the underlying message that really hits the core of people. When you write about the why from a point of view other than your own, it can sound contrived.<br />
</p>
<li> The rise of solopreneurship as a viable form of entrepreneurship, reframes our ideas on what is professional. You can run a business yourself, and you don&#8217;t have to pretend to act more &#8220;professional&#8221; to prove it. Solopreneurship isn&#8217;t a lesser form of entrepreneurship. When we openly accept this and embrace it, instead of trying to hide it by removing all personal associations from our companies, we open up the rest of the world to connect with this growing breed of entrepreneur.<br />
</p>
<li> First person narrative is very powerful when it comes to evoking engagement and feeling. When you talk too much about these things in third person narrative, it can evoke the opposite feeling: disconnect. Why? Because it just seems weird. It&#8217;s like a friend telling you how your other friend feels. Do you quite believe it? Not as much as if you heard it firsthand.<br />
</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s about building brand experience</h3>
<p><strong>The central idea that drives my philosophy on this is the idea that our economy and culture is moving away from a cycle of consumption purely based on product, and into one that is based on brand experience.</p>
<p>As the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded, it is no longer a question of what dress or what necklace is the best, but rather, what brand provides the best experience to that specific customer?</strong></p>
<p>And I believe that part of that experience is based on lifestyle, mood, and <em>connection</em>. </p>
<p>I get the rationale where we think writing about Us and I and We may come across as self-centered. But, is it really? If written poorly, sure. But on the other hand, would we rather be centered or distanced &#8211; <em>from our own brands</em>? </p>
<h3>There is always a &#8220;But&#8221;</h3>
<p>For brands which are not focused on customer experience necessarily (i.e. big designers who have flagship stores all over the world and designer department stores and boutiques carrying their stuff), third person narrative is a great idea. It&#8217;s not necessarily about creating an experience, but about telling the world how great they are. They don&#8217;t need to sell themselves to you, they don&#8217;t need to build a brand experience from the ground up. They&#8217;ve already got the in. So don&#8217;t automatically assume that what they&#8217;re doing is the &#8220;right&#8221; way.</p>
<p>Even so, there&#8217;s a rise now in bigger brands and organizations who understand the power of engagement, not only in social media but in brand narrative &#8211; for example, <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/help/about_us.jsp" target="_blank">Anthropologie</a>, <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/about_us" target="_blank">Modcloth</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/about" target="_blank">Ted.com</a> all have About Us pages written from the &#8220;we&#8221; point of view. (Sidenote: Check out <a href="http://static0.modcloth.com/images/assets/0001/1949/modcloth-pressPack-11_10.pdf" target="_blank">Modcloth&#8217;s media kit</a>, which is written in third person narrative. Again, repurposing the same message, but catering it to different audiences can mean using both first and third person narrative effectively.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen cases where, written artfully, there are ways to be personal when writing from third person narrative. But in these cases, I can still find an even more effective way to write in the first person. Unless the purpose of your bio is to appeal to stockholders or media who want the straight facts (actually, it is increasingly common to have two versions &#8211; I do it commonly for my own clients), there is a completely wasted opportunity if you focus solely on the features and facts of your brand. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/solesoulmanifesto.jpg" alt="" title="solesoulmanifesto" width="500" height="500" border="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6077" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, just because you write in first person, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s working. It is hard to get first person narrative done right. I&#8217;ve seen examples where designers have just listed facts and features, in first person &#8211; which completely defeats the purpose of it in the first place. In fact, it does come across as bragging, even moreso, this way.</p>
<p>This is not an all or nothing approach. It&#8217;s about really questioning the conventional practices in the industry, and figuring out what works best in creating the right experience for your brand. </p>
<p>The important question, beyond what looks and sounds pretty is what creates the better experience for your ideal customer? Because once you create that experience, you&#8217;ve created a brand that sells itself, by engaging both the hearts and minds of your customers. </p>
<h3>Last words</h3>
<p>The soul of your brand is the core of brand experience. It&#8217;s not where you grew up, where you went to school, what press accolades you&#8217;ve gotten. Those things are details that are nice-to-knows, but they are now mistakenly thought of as need-to-knows. </p>
<p>If you think about your own experiences, what strikes you as more engaging? What do you feel more connected to &#8211; someone telling you their story firsthand, or hearing it from a third party?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy into the idea that &#8220;professionalism&#8221; is paramount in fashion. It isn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t mistake your bio as your resume in paragraphs. It shouldn&#8217;t be. Fashion is an industry that needs to inspire, that needs to connect, that needs to engage. </p>
<p>Going back to narrative in fiction, and the objectives of using either &#8211; connecting reader to character versus connecting reader to everything. People are not on your About page to learn everything they can about your business, unless they are press. That&#8217;s not what people care about. They are there to see if there is something they can find within themselves in your brand, to connect something they like into something they love. Now, that&#8217;s what creating brand experience is about.</p>
<p>P.S. Can you just imagine what my blog would read like if I wrote everything from third person narrative? It would either be very boring and dry or simply strange! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>I love that as we move forward in fashion, we are seeing more inspired lines of lingerie that are exploring different ways of viewing the pieces we wear closest to our bodies, beyond physical support and allure. </p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the very first edition of <a href="http://www.annchingwang.com/2011/09/curated-version-2-0/">Curated 2.0</a>.</strong> This week I am sharing a few of my favorite finds in the world of lingerie, each of whom has a different take on female sensuality that goes beyond Victoria&#8217;s Secret.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lovemade.me" target="_blank">Love Made Me</a> of Vancouver first became known for creating lingerie and loungewear that could transition with ease from inside to out, in styles that don&#8217;t scream, but rather subtly announce soft yet sexy. </p>
<p>Think racer-back camisoles and ruffled rompers made from jersey. With the most comfortable of styles, boyish elements, and a youthful allure, Love Made Me redefines sensuality with a more casual edge, for women who know that true luxury is comfort, style and sass.</p>
<p>I think they bridge the gap between contemporary fashion and comfort to a tee. The name itself is a reference to sticking to what you believe in, even if its a niche in the world of underthings. But in this case, this niche may be underestimated, because what woman doesn&#8217;t appreciate style and comfort?<br />

<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/the-lake-and-stars-f11-3.jpg" alt="" title="the-lake-and-stars-f11-3" width="333" height="500" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5689" />When New-York based <a href="http://www.thelakeandstars.com" target="_blank">The Lake and Stars</a> popped onto the lingerie scene, it stunned, shocked and reframed many ideas of lingerie. Stepping away from the traditional attitudes of lingerie, the luxury line is provocative, modern, and sensual. </p>
<p>The collection derives its name from a Victorian euphemism of a woman&#8217;s skill in the bedroom. Which is in itself a kind of irony &#8211; when you look at the pieces, there is something there beyond a male-driven fantasy (Even though a recent collection was inspired by fetish wear, that still rings true). </p>
<p>Mayaan and Nikki, the two designers behind the collection, wanted to create lingerie that bridged the gap between special occasion wear and everyday lingerie. So they developed a line that was made up of pieces designed much like a fashion collection would &#8211; with inspiration, styles, and moods that change with each season. </p>
<p>Open to the changing tastes of women who view every part of their wardrobe as a piece of self expression, the Lake and Stars enables this and redefines lingerie as statement pieces for everyday, with an added element of lighthearted fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Shell-Belle.jpg" alt="" title="Shell Belle" width="800" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5698" /><a href="http://www.shellbellecouture.com" target="_blank">Shell Belle Couture</a> is a vintage-inspired label taking women from beach to boudoir. </p>
<p>Created from a ‘Passion for Vintage Lingerie and the Desire for an Endless Summer’, the line is made up of fully coordinated pieces that make up a wardrobe of swimwear, lingerie and slip dresses. Each piece is handcrafted meticulously &#8211; this is luxury that understands workmanship and art. And the lifestyle of their customer. </p>
<p>Shell Belle Couture&#8217;s most recent collection was inspired by the 1930s, full of lacey pieces, romance, and blush tones. In keeping with the philosophy of moving from the beach to boudoir, the editorial for the lookbook was shot on a yacht. And the lingerie pieces actually work in that setting, even if it is in a setting that borders on fantasy. It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s beauty and luxury for the woman who desires it. </p>
<p>Looking at the images would make any of us desire it too. And although I might not be there yet, it&#8217;s a beautiful fantasy for the rest of us. Then again, the pieces make it all believable, the lifestyle rendered possible, as designer Michelle Blenkinsopp does it with such grace and ease, taking us to a more nostalgic era of fashion.

<p>When I first saw this piece by <a href="http://www.marikavera.com" target="_blank">Marika Vera</a>, which looked more like evening wear than anything else, I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate the sensuality, the simplicity, the natural elegance. </p>
<p>But then you read the description. “SAM is the sensual elegance that defines a special moment in your life”. And then it makes sense. This is <em>definitely</em> lingerie. </p>
<p>Fittingly, the company&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;Better than naked.&#8221; What&#8217;s better than naked? Well, I guess in this case it&#8217;s exquisite lingerie that lights up the imagination and makes the wearer feel beautiful.</p>
<p>The pieces are gorgeous. Feminine. Soft. Luxurious. They conjure up images of a beautiful woman who is modern, sophisticated, confident and in love with the erotic. And yet &#8211; everything still remains entirely minimal. There is nothing frou-frou or over the top about the pieces, unlike the ideas of lingerie most of us have. (Y&#8217;know: lace, ruffles, the works.)</td>

<p>#</p>
<p>So there you have it, four subtle yet very different takes on lingerie. Now that you have read about (and seen) four inspired philosophies manifested through clothing, the question is: what does what you wear as lingerie say about your attitudes toward sensuality? <img src='http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>I love getting to the point in anything where you know it&#8217;s just time to reframe and re-envision. This blog and my own journey in fashion has been shaping and morphing and though it&#8217;s always getting there, it&#8217;s nowhere near done. </p>
<p>For example, I haven&#8217;t done an edition of Curated since early August, which was meant to be a weekly round-up of links, articles and other cool things around the web on the topics my readers are interested in: media, marketing, entrepreneurship, fashion, design, creativity, etc. But, lately as I have <a href="http://www.twitter.com/annchingwang" target="_blank">become more active on Twitter</a> and aimed to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/parkerandmuse" target="_blank">create more of a community on Facebook</a>, I&#8217;ve been sharing what used to be on my blog over there. So it no longer made sense for me to repost those same things on my blog. You can kind of see where I&#8217;m going with this.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am super excited to announce a reframing of Curated, which I lovingly refer to as Curated 2.0. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be an brief editorial style round-up of 3-5 people, designers, companies, products or brands in the fashion industry, each week with a theme. I&#8217;ll be searching high and low for the best &#8211; designers with heart, businesses with savvy. I&#8217;m looking for innovation, meaning, beauty, all the good stuff. I&#8217;m looking for businesses that inspire. </p>
<p>I love the idea that I can help spread the word on some amazing people and brands, and to discover and share great work in the fashion industry. It&#8217;s a huge part of my vision, to be able to do this, and what better time to start than now?</p>
<p>The post will come every Tuesday starting September 27, and will be a breath of fresh air, to complement the more practical how-to posts for fashion businesses and personal posts on my journey that you can already find here. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>This morning, during my very <a href="http://www.whenigrowupcoach.com" target="_blank">first coaching session</a>, my coach had asked me to talk about my current business (copywriting for independent fashion brands) and my particular struggle in it (getting my creative projects done at the same time). I think I started to veer off a little bit, but after I was done, she noted the way my voice lit up when I was talking about my vision and my work.</p>
<p>Having someone tell me that was amazing because I then started to think about the power of this spark I had. I realized that I do light up when I&#8217;m talking about something I&#8217;m passionately excited about. And I feel so incredibly grateful to find something that lights me up like that. And to recognize it, and have others recognize it in me.</p>
<p><strong>What lights me up?</strong></p>
<li> Learning about media, meaning, marketing &#8211; and learning in general
<li> Putting ideas and concepts into words, so that they can be experienced accessibly
<li> Getting to use my logical and creative skills simultaneously in one vocation
<li> Turning concepts into real, live, tangible brands
<li> Enabling other people who are in love with what to do to make a profitable living from it
<li> Applying big business theories to small businesses so that they too can create brands that sell
<li> Seeing amazing designers and products make it to market and flourish
<li> Appreciating the spectrum of lovely things I can find in fashion
<li> Moving and contributing towards a better future
<li> Strawberry shortcake (Oops &#8211; wrong list!)<br />
<br />
I talk about great work all the time, but this is something kind of different. It&#8217;s not just about the quality of the work, but the energy and soul behind it that transpires from one person to another. </p>
<p>When I was talking about what it is I do and why I do it, it reminded me of fireflies and the way they light up, one by one.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like for people who light up too.</p>
<p>More and more, when I work with people who are inspired by what they do, I see the power of it. I believe that excitement breeds better work &#8211; more lights, in ourselves and in others. </p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Here are a few personal rules of lighting the spark in your business that I try to abide by:</p>
<h5>1. Do more of what you love.</h5>
<p>Another small but profound tip from Michelle (the coach): do more of what&#8217;s easy and fun for you, and less of what isn&#8217;t. You and your business will grow not only faster but feel more true to you if you focus more on doing the things that you get excited about doing. What about the things you don&#8217;t like to do? Outsource. Do less of it.</p>
<p>An example from my end: I <em>can</em> do web design. I&#8217;ve done it since I was a kid. But it&#8217;s not my big love. I could do it, or I could spend the hours I would spend on it focusing on writing, marketing, or learning about writing and marketing. I learned the hard way, after spending so much time tinkering around with the look of my website. I could never get it right until I hired a designer. And then, everything fell into place. And while she was helping me with my website, I was learning and writing.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel confined into having to do something in your business if you&#8217;re just not that interested in it. But &#8211; keep in mind that if you don&#8217;t want to do it, someone will have to. Recognize what you love and what you don&#8217;t, and design your business accordingly. </p>
<p>This is about conserving your time and energy for the things you love, which because you love, you will do more of. And the more you do of something, the better you get at it. (Heard of the 10,000 hour rule?) I think many business owners like to think of themselves as jacks-of-all-trades. But think of it this way &#8211; if you&#8217;re spending all your time doing everything your business, does your core activity, whether its design, sewing, marketing, whatever, ever really progress and get better? Or are you just doing more of the same?</p>
<p>Running a business is hard work &#8211; don&#8217;t kill yourself trying to do it all. &#8216;Cause you&#8217;ll end up not loving any of it.</p>
<h5>2. Have a bigger vision.</h5>
<p>This is one of my favorite words, and of course, something I always try to extract for my clients when they work with me to build their brand narrative. </p>
<p>Having a vision is about context and cause. Yes &#8211; you make gorgeous swimsuits &#8211; but why? </p>
<p>Most people will say that they simply love it. But when I dig deeper, I will always find answers beyond that. And I realized that love is a product of something deeper within us. Yes &#8211; we all love, but being able to articulate the vision behind that helps you zero in on a message that needs to be heard, a specific one that is all about resonating with your ideal customers and understanding what you&#8217;re <em>really</em> in the business of.</p>
<p>I write beautiful copy that speaks for independent fashion brands. That&#8217;s what I do, but my vision is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yearning for a commerce and culture that supports and inspires imagination, utility, thought, and beauty, I believe in the possibilities in building meaningful and profitable businesses in the fashion industry. My aim is to elicit and refresh our relationship with aesthetic pleasures, and to work towards a new consciousness that views these things not as a detriment to an informed, sustainable, meaningful, and inspired society, but as a unique contributor to it.</p>
<p>My part in building a new fashion paradigm is facilitating a stronger connection between fashion and the written word, through explorations in fiction, commerce, and fashion. I believe that through the search for meaning, we can build better businesses, better lives, and a better world.</p></blockquote>
<p>See how much depth and dimension my business has now? And how, even though my business might change and morph, my vision is what holds it, me, and the people who believe in my vision together? It&#8217;s powerful stuff.</p>
<p>The question is: Can you articulate your vision?</p>
<h5>3. Share the love.</h5>
<p>I felt stuck and trapped most of my life because I wasn&#8217;t free to do what I love. So though I thrived in some things, I never really felt like I was thriving. </p>
<p>As soon as I was in the position to liberate my true goals and strengths, things changed. When I talked about my work, I felt alive. And people &#8220;got it&#8221;; they &#8220;got&#8221; me. Finally. </p>
<p>Passion is magnetic &#8211; Steve Jobs wasn&#8217;t a successful leader because he knew his stuff, but because when he talked, you could just feel his passion and presence fill up the room. </p>
<p>Excitement and passion are human qualities that connect us to each other, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I love to be around people who have these qualities. I can just tell from the way someone talks, from the way they write their emails, if their business lights them up. If not, I find it very hard to connect to the true essence of their brand story, even if we have all the information to work with.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t be afraid to be human &#8211; it&#8217;s actually quite endearing and helpful. </p>
<p>Fashion is this beautiful thing. Light up the world with your business &#8211; we&#8217;re waiting for it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Is direct mail dead in the internet age? I hardly think so. Generally, direct mail marketing has a conversion rate floating at around 1%. For people who are not marketers or copywriters, conversion is the is the ratio of visitors who convert casual content views or website visits into desired actions &#8211; usually a purchase. </p>
<p>When I received a piece of mail the other day from a prominent and popular fashion magazine that I used to subscribe to, and it was written poorly, unengaged and bland, I had to wonder, if you aren&#8217;t even going to try, why bother? Is the expectation of a 1% conversion rate turning marketing efforts into something mindless and lazy? </p>
<p>With words, you can move someone from a perennial appreciator and observer to a buyer. And this was, sadly, one case that completely neglected the power of this in direct mail advertising. It felt as if the people who had written this letter had forgotten what it&#8217;s like to be a consumer, to be human. </p>
<p>I held the flimsy letter in my hand, and asked myself if I wanted to continue my subscription. After all, it didn&#8217;t cost much. A mere $20 for an entire two years&#8217; worth of leisurely reading. But at that moment, on the edge of being convinced, I was not. And I almost threw the letter away before deciding this would be a great lesson to share. </p>
<p>Following are a few things I&#8217;ve noticed about marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li> People like to be convinced &#8211; give them the opportunity to convince themselves but give them enough to allow that to happen
<li> Money alone isn&#8217;t enough (usually)
<li> You have split seconds to get their attention
<li> Once it&#8217;s gone, you&#8217;ve lost the opportunity
<li> People want to feel important
<li> Emotions play heavily into consumer decisions
</ul>
<p>I quite like this magazine, by the way &#8211; so I&#8217;m not talking about selling people things they don&#8217;t want. But there is something to be said about copywriting that actually repels me from buying.</p>
<p>For reference, here is the said letter (identity of company is protected):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/directmail-magazine.jpg" alt="" title="directmail-magazine" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5331" /></p>
<p>Whoever wrote this understands the basics of marketing, because the conventional copywriting conversion methods are there &#8211; bullet points to make it easy to read, bolded headings again with the same purpose, and an emphasis on benefits. </p>
<p>But: Do I really care if I&#8217;m on the preferred discount program? (No, to me, there&#8217;s no much difference between $20 and $24. What is the exceptional value? It&#8217;s not in the price &#8211; it&#8217;s in the content.) And are runway reports, tips, and all the newest shoes, fashion, and accessories what really sets you apart? (If I even took the time to read the bland copy, I would&#8217;ve thought to myself &#8211; I can get that anywhere.) And even though it&#8217;s technically easy to read, do I care about a money-back guarantee on the same amount as a good lunch might cost? (No! And most of your readers don&#8217;t either.)</p>
<p>And frankly, the letter sounded tacky. </p>
<p>When there used to be no other way to digest fashion news, trends and tips, people wanted to subscribe to magazines because there was something there that they couldn&#8217;t get anywhere else. Now that the internet has completely changed that, sales are down in the print media industry. So think: what is it really that sets this magazine apart from content on the internet? </p>
<p>This reminds me of something Elle Magazine creative director Joe Zee said at the Independent Fashion Bloggers conference when asked about the future of print magazines (paraphrased &#8211; he talked much too quickly for me to get the exact quote):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We need to be smarter, we need to put a social context to things, to put a voice to it. We need to step it up, we can&#8217;t be lazy anymore.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Original letter was lazy, had zero context, and no voice. It took away the opportunity for people to make a decision based on real benefits and took away a level of engagement and connection with the magazine&#8217;s platform, message, and content. They forced a decision based purely on price and assumption.</p>
<p>But, of course, a criticism is never useful unless it comes with suggestion, so I had to rewrite the letter to show the difference.</p>
<p>Exhibit B:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/directmail-magazineafter.jpg" alt="" title="directmail-magazineafter" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5346" /></p>
<p>See the difference? Better yet, <em>feel</em> the difference? </p>
<p>Obviously, this is not groundbreaking writing. But in fewer words than the original, it said way more about the unique benefits of subscribing, included the same call to action (subscribe today for the special rate), and sounded more tactile and real (you can touch a magazine and flip through it, but you can&#8217;t do the same to a website) &#8211; less like a robot spewing out why they think readers would subscribe. </p>
<p><strong>What can your readers/potential buyers <em>really</em> get from you that they can&#8217;t get everywhere else?</strong> Hint: It&#8217;s not a great price.</p>
<p>And this is just the copy &#8211; think of what we could do with the visuals and the formatting.</p>
<p>The lessons here extend beyond direct mail into other marketing efforts: Don&#8217;t be lazy. Understand what your company is <em>really</em> about. Aim higher than the norm. And, you just might be surprised. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>I don&#8217;t really subscribe to the idea that trends are necessarily dictated to be followed, but rather, trends allow fashion to be a shared collective experience. And I always love to see which textiles come in and out of fashion.</p>
<p>One of my favorite textile print resources, the <a href="http://printsourcenewyork.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Printsource blog</a> curated by <a href="http://www.patternpeople.com/" target="_blank">Pattern People</a>, presented their top 10 textile print trends for Fall/Winter 2012/13 (and by the way, they have one of the best textile design blogs on the internet). Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<h3>Tapestry</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/printsource_trends_F12_1.jpg" alt="" title="printsource_trends_F12_1" width="590" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4403" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been seeing hints of this one with the omnipresent 1970s cast on fashion as of late, but this feels more traditionalist, and a little bit more kitschy.<br />
<BR></p>
<h3>Painterly Stripes</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/printsource_trends_F12_2-1.jpg" alt="" title="printsource_trends_F12_2-1" width="590" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4407" /></p>
<p>Loving the raw look of this, as if taken directly from a painter&#8217;s canvas, a step away from the very obviously digitally rendered &#8220;artist-y&#8221; type patterns.<br />
<BR></p>
<h3>Cross Stitch</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/printsource_trends_F12_3-1.jpg" alt="" title="printsource_trends_F12_3-1" width="590" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4409" /></p>
<p>This is an interesting one because though the concept is, in essence, a little bit traditionalist, the execution of it reminds us of something quite modern in context: pixels! So cute. Would love to see this in the summer season though.<br />
<BR></p>
<h3>Big Blooms</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/printsource_trends_F12_4.jpg" alt="" title="printsource_trends_F12_4" width="590" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4411" /></p>
<p>I love this more graphic and bold take on florals, after seeing it done up quite a bit on a much smaller, more delicate scale (liberty prints). Reminds me of what Donna Karan did for DKNY last spring/summer season.<br />
<BR></p>
<h3>Pre-War Prints</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.annchingwang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/printsource_trends_F12_6.jpg" alt="" title="printsource_trends_F12_6" width="590" height="268" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4414" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a huge history buff, so it took a while for me to get the pre-war reference in this trend, but I can definitely see this as being very translatable to clothes. Out of all the above, I actually think this one might gain the most traction in ready-to-wear.</p>
<p><em>What about you &#8211; which one is your favorite? </em><br />
<BR><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p><a href="http://endmalariaday.com/" target="_blank">End Malaria</a> is a book featuring essays from 62 top business thinkers, leaders and authors on why and how to do great work, with $20 from each sale going towards <a href="http://www.malarianomore.org/" target="_blank">eradicating deaths from Malaria by 2015</a>. </p>
<p>There are many interesting and innovative things to note from this project, among them the ideas of collaboration, generosity, and business leadership.</p>
<p>I was recently browsing the essay extracts from the book, and found some nuggets of wisdom that I wanted to share with you on creativity, innovation, design thinking, vision, and doing great work.<br />
<BR></p>
<h3>Find Your Element</h3>
<blockquote><p>Think about how many of those 80 billion or so people had to meet each other and hang out, and in what different circumstances, during the course of those fifty thousand years, before your own parents ran into each other and eventually conceived you. The fact is, as the Dalai Lama puts it, being born at all is a miracle.</p>
<p>So congratulations: you made it.</p>
<p>And now that you are here, to quote the Dalai Lama again, what are you going to do with this brief life? &#8211; Sir Ken Robinson</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Choices That Matter</h3>
<blockquote><p>Thus, if we want more satisfied customers, we should limit the choices we offer to them. And if we want more effective and happier employees, we should increase the choices we offer to them. Less choice and discretion for our customers, and more choice and discretion for our employees. At the moment, we’ve got things exactly backwards. &#8211; Barry Schwartz</p></blockquote>
<h3>Here&#8217;s to the Haters</h3>
<blockquote><p>So on one side, we have the Lovers. On the other side, we have the Haters. Between them is a no-man’s land filled with dead ends and disengagement. This is where you’ll find those lukewarm lollygaggers who suck up your time, effort, and resources but give little loyalty or value in return. These are the Middlers. &#8211; Sally Hogshead</p></blockquote>
<h3>Dream Backward to Move Forward</h3>
<blockquote><p>As we survey the black hole of endless possibility, we often get overwhelmed in that moment. We don’t know where to start when we ask discovery questions, so we stop. We freeze. We get paralyzed and give up dreaming before we’ve even really begun. &#8211; Jon Acuff</p></blockquote>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Pay Attention</h3>
<blockquote><p>In recent years, however, scientists have begun to outline the surprising benefits of not paying attention. Sometimes, too much focus can backfire; all that caffeine gets in the way. For instance, researchers have found a surprising link between daydreaming and creativity—people who daydream more are also better at generating new ideas. &#8211; Jonah Lehrer</p></blockquote>
<h3>Learning in the New World of Work</h3>
<blockquote><p>Learning and development at Adobe is not just about helping employees get to the next rung of the corporate ladder—although that’s part of it. It is also about helping employees learn more about themselves within the organization to help them progress along their individual paths, fulfill their personal potential, and contribute to the greater good. &#8211; Melissa Deimler</p></blockquote>
<h3>Don&#8217;t be the Bland Leading the Bland</h3>
<blockquote><p>The enemy of persuasion is obscurity. If you have an important message to get out, it must stand out, not blend in. Most presentations today err by being boring and bland—but with a little work, your ideas can get the attention they deserve. &#8211; Nancy Duarte</p></blockquote>
<h3>What&#8217;s Your Idea Schedule?</h3>
<blockquote><p>Take a quick look at your schedule for the next two weeks. If you are like most people, your calendar is packed to the gills with endless appointments, meetings, conference calls, and deadlines. When, in this insanely busy schedule, are you planning to come up with your best ideas? &#8211; Josh Linkner</p></blockquote>
<h3>Permission to be Funny</h3>
<blockquote><p>Being unapologetically funny won’t alienate your customers—or team members. Quite the opposite. Humor is about vulnerability. Vulnerability is about humanity. And at lululemon, we design our business to support and sustain our humans—not the other way around. &#8211; Steph Irwin</p></blockquote>
<h3>Work is a Four-Letter Word</h3>
<blockquote><p>Or maybe you feel like a dead (wo)man walking, hating what you do but too scared to jump. A wobbly economy whiplashes everyone. Wall Street meltdowns, corporate greed, and icon-like presidents who crash as fallen idols make daily headlines. Just hunker down and wait it out.</p>
<p>And tomorrow you die. &#8211; Eileen McDargh</p></blockquote>
<h3>Make a Difference with Design Thinking</h3>
<blockquote><p>When deep empathy isn’t applied to guide decision making, the fear of failure exerts influence over decision processes, and rapid prototyping is rarely used to solicit quick and early feedback. Design thinking offers tools to address these challenges. It helps creators get into other people’s heads and hearts, understand their needs, and iteratively test alternative approaches to learn how best to fulfill those needs. &#8211; Andy Smith</p></blockquote>
<h3>Beta-Think</h3>
<blockquote><p>Voltaire was half right. “Le mieux est l’ennemi du bien,” he said: The best is the enemy of the good. The best is also the enemy of the better. Striving for perfection complicates and delays getting things done. Worse, the myth of perfection can shut off the process of improvement and the possibility of collaboration. &#8211; Jeff Jarvis</p></blockquote>
<h3>Heads or Tails</h3>
<blockquote><p>Are you racing to the top or racing to the bottom?</p>
<p>Are you going to become ever more compliant, ever better at fitting in, or are you prepared to commit to standing out and following your own map? Can’t do both. &#8211; Seth Godin</p></blockquote>
<p>These are all partial excerpts from the essays, and I am going to order my copy right now. </p>
<p>I love how this book helps to answer the question: Once you have enough money to live your ideal life, what is the point of what you do? Knowing the answer to this question before you get to that point changes the way we look at things. And it is, as they say, there is no greater work than saving a life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>At home with her mother, after a week of late nights and deadlines left her drained. She took the night off for once and on this particular summer night, there was nothing else to do but to watch the boob tube. They landed on the discovery channel, on a show about other Earths. And she wondered what the point of this obsession she had with worldly things like clothes meant when there was such a amazing world of wonder beyond. </p>
<p>She went to sleep that night &#8211; restless.</p>
<p>The next day, it came to her.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Puzzle pieces, Earl Grey tea with cream and sugar, you and your favorite boyfriend sweater &#8211; they all fit together in the exact right way.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>It&#8217;s been a while since one of my most popular posts made its way onto the internet circuits, and apparently fashion businesses are very curious about how to get into the media. As of October, I may no longer be offering media kit design as a service so that I can focus more on writing (although I am still available to write content for media kits). In light of my mission to help designers break down the barriers to build successful businesses, I thought I would share some more resources to help you create your own press/media kit. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li> First, here&#8217;s my original post: <a href="http://www.annchingwang.com/2011/03/media-kits-for-fashion-101-how-to-design-promote-create/" target="_blank">Media Kits for Fashion 101</a><br />
<BR></p>
<li> And oldie but goodie (that&#8217;s what 2007 is in internet years!) &#8211; Nubby Twiglet&#8217;s <a href="http://nubbytwiglet.com/2007/12/26/successfully-selling-yourself-how-to-build-a-press-kit/" target="_blank">How to Build a Press Kit </a>comes from her graphic designer perspective.<br />
<BR></p>
<li> Danielle was the winner of my media kit giveaway a few months ago, and has kindly put it up for download on her website. If you are looking for an<a href="http://finalfashion.ca/about/" target="_blank"> actual example of a digital media kit</a>, do check it out.<br />
<BR></p>
<li> I like the <a href="http://www.shoesofprey.com/content/media.html" target="_blank">simple yet effective way that Shoes of Prey did their media kit</a>, entirely online. Some may caution against this in cases where editors don&#8217;t want to click on so many links without seeing anything first. But I think it could be quite effective in many ways.<br />
<BR></p>
<li> This is one of my favorites because of the use of a designer&#8217;s statement, which I think is often under-looked: <a href="http://www.angelchang.com/PressKit.pdf" target="_blank">Angel Chang&#8217;s media kit</a>.<br />
<BR></p>
<li> We Connect Fashion&#8217;s straight to the point <a href="http://weconnectfashion.com/fido/getarticle.fcn?&#038;type=Guides&#038;SearchString=Assemble+A+Press+Kit&#038;id=737870PH0000072&#038;start=1&#038;tr=10" target="_blank">How to Assemble a Press Kit</a><br />
<BR></p>
<li> One question I get asked by my clients is &#8220;Do I need press clips to have a press kit?&#8221; And the answer is no. It helps, sure. But it is definitely not necessary. The point of a press kit is to sell yourself and to inform the recipient. Do a great job at that (Great product? Check. Writing? Check. Design? Check), and you&#8217;ll be racking up the clips in no time.<br />
<BR></p>
<li> I found a video by <a href="http://www.fashionincubator.com" target="_blank">Toronto Fashion Incubator</a> that offers some great tips. (If you&#8217;re reading this in RSS, click to view.)<br />
<BR><br />
<iframe width="560" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/I0MWZSG5b7M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<BR></p>
<li> And if you&#8217;re curious: Susan Langdon, executive director of TFI and star of the video above, wrote a short blog post on <a href="http://www.fashionincubator.com/diaries/blog/2011.shtml" target="_blank">the difference between press kits and buyer&#8217;s kits</a> (scroll down to March).</ul>
