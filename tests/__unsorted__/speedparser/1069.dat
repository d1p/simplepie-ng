<h3><strong>Perseverance</strong> [pur-suh-veer-uh<img src="http://sp.dictionary.com/dictstatic/dictionary/graphics/luna/thinsp.png" border="0" alt="" />ns] –noun</h3>

<li>steady persistence in a course of action, a purpose, a state, etc., especially in spite of difficulties, obstacles, or discouragement.</li>
<li><em>Theology /</em> continuance in a state of grace to the end, leading to eternal salvation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brilliance. Creativity. Ingenuity. Connections.</p>
<p>These are all qualities which, if you possess them, will increase your chances of succeeding as an entrepreneur. Smart, creative people who can think outside the box and utilize their network of connections are well equipped to maneuver the pitfalls of the startup business lifecycle. However, you can be all of those things and still fail if you lack the one trait which is absolutely critical to succeeding as an entrepreneur: <strong>the ability to persevere</strong> &#8211; even when you&#8217;re up against seemingly impossible odds. Unless you&#8217;re one of the .0001% of people who launch a product which goes viral immediately and shows continued growth past the initial dip, <strong>you will have moments where you want to give up</strong>. If you don&#8217;t have the ability to look deep inside of yourself and push through these moments (and the accompanying roller coaster of emotions), you will fail.</p>
<p>So what do these moments look like?</p>
<p>You go live with V1 of your product &#8211; and no one notices. You spend all day/week/month doing blogger outreach, pitching your product to the world &#8211; and no one replies. You ask friends and family to help spread the word for you &#8211; and they don&#8217;t. You think to yourself: does my product really suck this bad? Do I have it all wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Give it some time. Persevere.</strong></p>
<p>One random wednesday, you notice a little bump in traffic to your website. And then a sign-up. <strong><em>You have a customer</em></strong>. One more makes 2. Then there are 10. 10 becomes 20. You know these numbers are trivial in comparison to the growth of your competitors or the rest of the startup world, but they represent your hopes and dreams; they&#8217;re a validation of everything you&#8217;ve been working towards. But you&#8217;re also smart enough to know that 20 customers won&#8217;t keep the lights on. And so you persevere.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve gotten a taste of what success <em>might</em> feel like, you&#8217;ve raised your expectations.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If 20 people like us enough to sign up, why can&#8217;t that number be 200?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;If we signed up 10 today, then we should definitely reach 200 by next friday!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>And then it takes 45 more days to reach 200.</strong> Now when you talk to friends about your business, you begin to see doubt creep into their smiles as they listen to you describe your pace of growth. You question yourself again, because if your best friends think you might be failing, then maybe you are, right? Maybe. But maybe not. Highly successful entrepreneurs are the exception to the rule in our society. If the rule thinks you&#8217;re failing, then maybe it&#8217;s not so bad to be an exception to their thoughts. <strong>Persevere.</strong></p>
<p>6 months go by. <strong>9 months</strong>. Growth continues, but not at the &#8220;up and to the right&#8221; pace that you see from companies that get featured on Techcrunch, or that you hear about on Twitter from the startup and angel investment elite. Even so, when you lie in bed at night you think to yourself, &#8220;This is really happening. Even if our numbers are low, there are real business owners all over the world using my product.&#8221; It makes you feel good. And you should feel good! Remember when all you had was an idea? No co-founder, no ability to build a product, and no idea what you should do next? Instead of comparing yourself to the titans of the industry, compare yourself to that guy. You&#8217;ve come a long way. You&#8217;ve still got a long way to go, but the distance you&#8217;ve traveled thus far is more than most. Keep going.</p>
<p>In business, you can&#8217;t always expect that the people around you are going to share your ability to persevere. Sometimes they get tired of the struggle and go back to the safety of corporate life. Sometimes a better opportunity comes along and they jump ship for greener pastures. Either outcome is ok if you have the ability to persevere. This is your path, not theirs. It will be incredibly hard not to, but please don&#8217;t take it personally. As long as there aren&#8217;t any serious complications with ownership rights or IP, consider it a lesson learned and keep moving forward. People change, but don&#8217;t let them change you. Stay focused on the future. The future always looks brighter than the present when you choose to persevere.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy. Taking this path requires sacrifice. Humble yourself. We all need money to survive in this world. Do you think you&#8217;re &#8220;above&#8221; being a waiter, or working a pizza delivery job on the side to keep the lights on? Just how badly do you want to succeed? There&#8217;s a famous saying that my friends and I latched onto some years ago: &#8220;Successful people do what unsuccessful people won&#8217;t do, even when they don&#8217;t want to do it.&#8221; You might not want to get up at 5:30 in the morning to work a second job, but your situation may require it. Are you up to the challenge? If you have what it takes, you already know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Life goes on. Time flies by.</strong></p>
<p>And then one day, your perseverance begins to pay off. It could be as simple as reaching a metrics goals you set for yourself, all those months ago. It could mean landing a high profile customer. It could be the moment when you begin to see that your brand has taken on a life of its own; an article or media mention which takes you by surprise (in a good way). It could be the realization that you&#8217;ve passed the point of failing from a lack of customers or interest, and now face the problem of meeting customer demand for new features and premium offerings. It could be anything, but whatever it is will be totally unique to your journey. And when it happens, you&#8217;ll feel that burn of pride deep inside and think to yourself, &#8220;this just might end well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being an entrepreneur is tough &#8211; you never know what the next day has in store for you. But you&#8217;ll never find out unless you get there, and to get there you&#8217;ve gotta persevere. One of the most amazing experiences of being an entrepreneur is that no matter how many other people do it, every single journey will be unique. There are common themes and encounters which we&#8217;ll all share, but your journey will never look just like mine, and those that come after us will enter as newcomers on a stage which is continually changing. To fully experience it, you have to embrace the struggle; you have to let life happen. The only way you can truly do that is by persevering through both the good and the bad, to ensure your journey continues. Refuse to turn back. Believe in yourself and what you&#8217;re doing, and always look towards the future. It&#8217;s bright, and it&#8217;s waiting for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve picked up quite a few domains, most of which I will likely never use or make any money from. Domain buying is definitely an impulse decision, and apparently I&#8217;ve given into the impulse enough times that I&#8217;ve built up quite a stable of decent ones. Notice I say decent; none of these are home-run four letter domains that I could sell based on name alone, but with the right execution I believe that many of them could prove to be worthwhile business ventures. So, instead of sitting on them and effectively letting their potential rot away, I figured I&#8217;d share them with the world and maybe inspire you to do something about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://matthendrick.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Moreideas.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-270 aligncenter" title="Moreideas" src="http://matthendrick.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Moreideas.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Usually you get the itch to buy a domain when you&#8217;ve come up with a &#8220;kick-ass&#8221; name to pair with some &#8220;amazing&#8221; idea for a startup you&#8217;ve just had, in the hopes that one day in the future you&#8217;ll actually come back to the project to address it seriously. Let me tell you, 9.9 times out of 10 that never happens &#8211; I know from firsthand experience. So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gonna do: below is a list of what I consider to be some of the better domains I own and the accompanying ideas behind them, and I&#8217;m challenging you to do something with them. Sure, you could always take an idea and implement it elsewhere under a different name, but ideas are generally worthless and I have enough on my plate to not worry about you stealing one from me. What I <strong>would</strong> prefer to do is either sell you the domain at a reasonable price, or better yet, take a very small stake in the business you create with it in exchange for rights to the name along with any additional advisory support I can provide.  I&#8217;d also love to hear your feedback and ideas in the comments below. That being said, here&#8217;s a few&#8230;..</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://3pmdeals.com" target="_blank">3PMDeals.com</a></strong> &#8211; similar to the model of Groupon or LivingSocial, 3PMDeals is a daily email you get alerting you to exclusive dinner deals being offered by restaurants in your area. Two reasons why I think this is a good idea: 3pm is the magic time of day that people start getting hungry, and begin thinking about their plans for dinner. <em>Impulse buy</em>. The short time frame before dinner creates scarcity and a sense of urgency &#8211; since there is a finite amount of deals to be offered ( tonight only), subscribers won&#8217;t have much time to debate whether to buy or not. <em>&#8220;Honey, our favorite thai place is offering 2 for 1 tonight! Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em> </em><strong><a href="http://finishdown" target="_blank">FinishDown.com</a> &#8211; </strong>this would be a niche site targeted at the entrepreneur/internet startup world. There&#8217;s a million different articles and websites out there offering advice on how to succeed in the startup world, but it&#8217;s very fragmented. If &#8220;starting up&#8221; is the starting line, then &#8220;finishdown&#8221; is the finish line, and this website would be dedicated to curating the best articles, videos, and opportunities which help entrepreneurs succeed. By category, users would rank the usefulness of the information included (how helpful is the article/link/video), eventually creating an authoritative list of the most helpful online resources for startup entrepreneurs. You could even take it a level deeper with user profiles, giving users with successful startup exits or positions more influence than noobs. Make money by advertising or job listings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://doorlisted.com" target="_blank">DoorListed.com</a></strong> &#8211; a marketplace for any bar or nightclub to sell front of the line access for any event. Fairly straightforward &#8211; club owner/manager creates a venue page with a calendar of events, and either sets the price in advance or updates it the day of in response to increased demand. Limited number of spots and limitations based on time of arrival. Buyers get unique code to print out (or use a smart phone) and show at the door. Monetized through a revenue share with the venue owner (25% of every transaction goes to the website).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://startupsoftwear.com" target="_blank">StartupSoft<em>wear</em>.com</a> &#8211; </strong>isn&#8217;t it obvious? Clothing geared towards the internet/geek culture. T-shirts with well known sayings on them, hoodies with built in pockets for gadgets, etc. I&#8217;m totally down to try this one and have lots of ideas for shirts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://localbillpay.com" target="_blank">LocalBillPay.com</a></strong> &#8211; using the Google maps API, display all of the walk-in bill payment locations around the world. In the United States alone there are close to 30 million unbanked individuals who need to use cash to make their monthly bill payments, and LocalBillPay would help find the closest nearby location to do so. Fairly simple website &#8211; the interface is just a large map with pinpoints on it, based on where you told us you live. Hard to monetize &#8211; maybe through selling featured listings or affiliate offers from credit card companies, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://loyalpublic.com" target="_blank">LoyalPublic.com</a></strong> &#8211; a celebrity/musician fan club website with a twist; members get exclusive access to tickets, deals, signings, events etc, but membership requires that you actively promote the celebrity through your social media accounts a minimum of x amounts of time per month. Membership is revoked if you don&#8217;t meet your weekly or monthly sharing requirements. This would be targeted perfectly at the teen market &#8211; think Bieber, Miley Cyrus etc, and sharing would be fairly easy to track with unique URL&#8217;s etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://marriedtojane.com" target="_blank">MarriedToJane.com</a></strong> &#8211; passionate about smoking weed? This site is for you. Basically, it&#8217;s everything marijuana related wrapped up into a slick user interface with lots of social features for sharing and connecting with potheads in your area. Sure, there are other sites out there that are similar, but the market is huge and always will be, and as more states begin to legalize it and marijuana becomes mainstream, your audience will be a key demographic many advertisers will want to tap into. The name is even well positioned to have an iconic female cartoon character as the brand representative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://faquora.com" target="_blank">FAQuora.com</a></strong> &#8211; No guarantee on the long term viability of this one, but the question and answer service Quora is on fire right now, and many early adopters are complaining about the influx of new users bringing down the quality of the community. FAQuora would essentially be like Quora &#8220;lite&#8221; &#8211; using their API, it would follow a newsfeed format of the current trending questions on Quora, and be read-only (no editing or answering). No need to follow a bunch of people or topics &#8211; simply visit the site, lurk for awhile and read. No real way to monetize, but I like the domain name.  = )</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://multifamilycentral.com" target="_blank">MultifamilyCentral.com</a></strong> &#8211; a directory for the multifamily industry &#8211; every company, property, employee, social media account etc. Tons of data &#8211; might be best executed wiki-style, but getting people to contribute would be tough. Might be nice to find a good data source to pre-populate most of the data. Monetize with ads, job listings, premium company pages &#8211; like <a href="http://crunchbase.com" target="_blank">Crunchbase</a> for Multifamily.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://skedjool.com" target="_blank">Skedjool.com</a> &#8211; </strong>an online scheduling tool. I haven&#8217;t put a ton of thought into this one, but it would be nice to target specific verticals that are appointment-heavy, like salons, spas, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://tweettheknot.com" target="_blank">TweetTheKnot.com</a></strong> &#8211; a site which aggregates all of the conversations and wedding photos that are shared via Twitter? Wedding related deals from vendors? Who knows? Decent name though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://whereimnot.com" target="_blank">WhereImNot.com</a> &#8211; </strong>a location-based app a la Foursquare, but instead of &#8220;checking in&#8221; to a real world location, you share random-generated, hilarious tidbits of what you&#8217;re NOT doing with your friends. <strong>The &#8220;anti-check-in&#8221;.</strong> When you open the app, you&#8217;re greeted with an ever-changing list of options for what you can <em><strong>not</strong></em> check in to, with options to auto-fill your friends names for extra effect &#8211; &#8220;James is most definitely <strong>not</strong> waiting in line at the sperm bank to make some going out money for the weekend.&#8221; &#8220;Aaron is surely <strong>not</strong> lying in bed next to James&#8217;(auto-filled from friend list) sister.&#8221; You get the point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://vericred.com" target="_blank">Vericred.com</a> &#8211; </strong>the market for credit and background checks is massive and essentially one big affiliate scam. The most simple use of this domain would be to search engine optimize the crap out of it and drive traffic to it &#8211; did you know that on average, for every one hundred affiliate clicks you send to myfico.com they return around $243 back to you? That&#8217;s fuckin&#8217; ridiculous. I have a lot of other ideas around new ways of verifying credit, but they&#8217;re more involved than just a frivolous affiliate site &#8211; so it might best to keep it simple for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the better domains/ideas I have, but I&#8217;ve actually held back a few of the best because I just can&#8217;t let go of them yet. I read an article recently that said we&#8217;re quickly running out of available domains for use online &#8211; I suspect there&#8217;s likely millions of URL&#8217;s owned by people just like me who had good intentions but never followed through. Are you one of them? Do any of these ideas sound viable to you? Do the domain names spark other ideas that I haven&#8217;t mentioned above or previously thought of? Let me know in the comments &#8211; and if you&#8217;re interested in working together, or discussing a possible sale/transfer of a domain, send me a message or reach out to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and let&#8217;s discuss.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-can-Quora-help-promote-local-businesses" target="_blank">answered a question</a> over on Quora entitled &#8220;How can Quora help promote local businesses?&#8221; and thought I would re-post it here in case you missed it. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments &#8211; do you agree with my suggestions or care to offer a differing opinion?</p>
<h2><strong>How can Quora help promote local businesses?</strong></h2>
<p>Quora is a great forum for demonstrating domain-specific knowledge or expertise. If I were a local business owner, I&#8217;d use Quora to expand my influence as a local resource for all things related to my business niche, adding a flavor and perspective which can only come from living in my shoes.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you own a small coffee shop in a busy downtown area of a bustling city, and are competing with the &#8216;bucks of the world. If you&#8217;re a decent writer, there&#8217;s an almost unlimited amount of topics on Quora which you could contribute to. Answer questions targeted at small business owners. Discuss how you go about conducting local advertising. Share the experience of starting your business on the entrepreneurial threads. Begin to see yourself as more than just a coffee shop owner &#8211; you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, employer, salesperson, and social media marketer. Share what you&#8217;ve learned along the way &#8211; I guarantee there are people out there who will appreciate your perspective.</p>
<p>If you use Twitter, Foursquare or Facebook to promote your business, share your experience with others. Have Foursquare promotions worked for you? What tips do you have for other local business owners trying to build a following on Twitter? Ask questions like &#8220;what makes a great coffee shop?&#8221;, or &#8220;which wi-fi setup is best geared for use in a coffee shop environment?&#8221;. Make sure you post under your real name while still tying your identity closely to your business &#8211; Quora profiles are set up well for this. [As a side benefit, posts made here will also give you some overall link juice with search engines, but please don't make SEO your primary goal.] One question or answer will lend itself to another, and before you know it you&#8217;ll have a steady following of people who trust and respect your opinion. Time goes on; your influence grows.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s very few people in this world whose personal Venn Diagram looks like yours (business owner/coffee fanatic/living in your geographic area) &#8211; use Quora as an opportunity to share your unique experience and expertise with the world, and you&#8217;ll implicitly promote your business at the same time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my personal goals is to be more active online in 2011, so I thought it might be a good idea to benchmark a few of my personal &#8220;key performance indicators&#8221; going into the year. With no further ado, here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Facebook friends</strong>: 255 (I don&#8217;t expect this to change much since I&#8217;m fairly selective about who I become friends with on Facebook.)</p>
<p><strong>Twitter followers</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">@matthendrick</a>: 366</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/turnsocial" target="_blank">@TurnSocial</a>: 1541</p>
<p><strong>Tumblr followers:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://detailsinthefabric.com" target="_blank">detailsinthefabric</a>: 51</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.turnsocial.com" target="_blank">TurningSocial</a>: 114</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://quora.com/matt-hendrick" target="_blank">Quora</a> followers:</strong> 71</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/matthendrick" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> connections</strong>: 148</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mhendrick" target="_blank">HN</a> karma: 9</p>
<p>These are my primary channels for communication online; I used to use Foursquare but haven&#8217;t in months &#8211; I just don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;ve given me a good enough reason to pull out the app and check-in anywhere. We&#8217;ll see if that changes in 2011.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that I have any specific goals in mind for number of followers across different channels, and the purpose of this exercise isn&#8217;t to actively <strong>TRY</strong> to gain more followers. However, I&#8217;m very interested in learning why some people I know have far more online connections than I do, when we tend to run in the same circle and know the same people. Am I doing it wrong? Maybe I&#8217;m not outgoing enough or don&#8217;t properly follow up with people I meet out and about? Whatever the case, I hope to learn a bit more about myself and the people I know by tracking these numbers, and will make an effort to provide an update at least once per month.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re already discussing it, I&#8217;m on<a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank"> Twitter</a>. You should join me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not a big one for predictions, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s much of a stretch to suggest that &#8220;local&#8221; is a buzzword we&#8217;ll be hearing more and more of in 2011. The online component of the small and local business market is massive and underserved, and a bevy of companies are rushing in to take advantage of the opportunity. Who will win the battle for local? Yelp? Google (Hotpot)? Facebook? A company we&#8217;ve yet to hear of? In my opinion, the market is so massive and diverse that it&#8217;s no longer a zero sum game. In 2011 there&#8217;s room for everyone in the sandbox, and although some will end up taking more share than others, we&#8217;re at least 3-5 years away from anyone rolling up the market and staking their claim as king.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very excited about what lies ahead for 2011, both as a consumer of local-focused products and an owner of a company in the space. For the last 18 months we&#8217;ve been building up a customer base and learning what works and what doesn&#8217;t, while we determine which direction we take the TurnSocial product. Over the past few months a clear path has emerged, and it&#8217;s built around the local business marketplace. I look forward to sharing more about our strategy as time goes on.</p>
<p>In any case, that&#8217;s my prediction for the coming year. I&#8217;m very excited for what lies ahead in 2011 &#8211; although times are hard for many of us, I see opportunity everywhere I look and am consistently amazed by the innovation I see all around me. The best part is, we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to a great year ahead&#8230;cheers! Happy New Year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My health and fitness goals for 2011 are fairly simple; I aim to lose at least 10 pounds of fat and replace it with 10 lbs of muscle. I currently weigh 188 pounds, at 6&#8217;2&#8243; tall. If my estimates are correct, that should bring me somewhere into the range of 10-15% body fat, which is perfectly acceptable for someone of my age and background. Many people who know me might say that I don&#8217;t have 10lbs of fat to lose, but they&#8217;re wrong &#8211; I carry a small amount of fat around my abdomen and stomach, and I expect that&#8217;s where most of it would disappear from.</p>
<p>I plan to accomplish this through a moderate combination of diet and exercise. I don&#8217;t plan on going on any extreme diets or killing myself in the gym, although I will probably take a stab at the slow-carb diet described in <a href="http://fourhourbody.com" target="_blank">The 4 Hour Body</a>. One of the biggest changes I plan to make is limiting my alcohol intake to red wine. This is probably going to be the hardest habit to tackle, since I have been known to enjoy a few pints of Blue Moon in the pub with my friends, but so be it &#8211; if I&#8217;m serious about making changes, I have to start somewhere. Since I don&#8217;t currently have a membership to a gym, I&#8217;ll have to rely on the fitness facilities in our office building, as well as running and biking outdoors. I hope by mid-year that I can afford to once again join the ClubSport in our neighborhood, but at $120/month that&#8217;s just not feasible right now.</p>
<p>Setting pure pass/fail milestones hasn&#8217;t worked for me in the past, which is why I&#8217;m sticking to the simple goal of converting existing fat to muscle, through a variety of means. At the end of the day, if I can manage to reduce my intake of the food and drinks that add fat, while at the same time increasing my activity level through a variety of exercise, I believe that my goals are attainable without major lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post frequent updates to let you know what kind of progress I make!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever get writers&#8217; block?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>In fact, I have it right now. That&#8217;s why I decided to write about it. I mean, how is it possible that I can&#8217;t come up with an interesting topic to expand upon, when there are so many amazing things going on around me at any given time? I could write about what new features we&#8217;re working on at <a href="http://turnsocial.com" target="_blank">TurnSocial</a> (which are really exciting), I could talk about the major partnerships that are lining up for us at <a href="http://blog.chargesmart.com" target="_blank">ChargeSmart</a> (also awesome), or I could share my thoughts on the general tech community here in San Francisco. I might comment on the recent rainy weather; I could discuss what it&#8217;s like to ride BART to work everyday. I&#8217;ve just started reading <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a>&#8216; new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=offsitoftimfe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X" target="_blank">The 4 Hour Body</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m sure I could share my initial reaction to what I&#8217;ve read thus far. The fact of the matter is, there&#8217;s actually a million different things I <em><strong>could</strong></em> write about, but until I opened this box and started typing, none of them popped into my head; <strong>I was stuck</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a great reminder of why so many of us get stuck in the planning phase of our various projects; until you force yourself to start doing something, you&#8217;ll continue to come up with a variety of reasons why it can&#8217;t be done. That&#8217;s exactly what happened to me today. I sat here at my desk, searching around the web for inspiration, and had pretty much come to the conclusion that I just wasn&#8217;t &#8220;inspired&#8221; enough to put finger to keyboard today. Unfortunately, if I plan on <a href="http://matthendrick.org/2010/12/setting-goals-365-blog-posts-in-2011/" target="_blank">penning 365 blog posts</a> in 2011, that&#8217;s an unacceptable outcome. So I forced myself to start &#8211; I opened up the &#8220;new post&#8221; tab in WordPress and wrote the first question that came into my mind. And here I am. I&#8217;ve pieced together these paragraphs in the last 15 minutes, completely off the top of my head, and now I&#8217;ve accomplished my goal of publishing a new blog post today. It&#8217;s short, not very interesting, and you probably wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to a friend &#8211; but there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ve felt the same way before. We can relate. And that&#8217;s part of what this blog is all about &#8211; building relationships with people of a similar mind, all across the web. <strong>Relating</strong>.</p>
<p>So thanks for taking a few minutes to stop by and read this &#8211; you inadvertently helped me accomplish my goal for today. I truly appreciate it.</p>
<p>And here I was thinking I had writers&#8217; block.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on Twitter. <a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">Join me</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I get approached by fledgling &#8220;business guy&#8221; entrepreneurs all the time asking me for advice on how they turn their idea into a living, breathing product. Usually they think a strong business plan, well laid out mock-ups, and grand ideas for monetization will eventually attract the eyes of technical co-founders or investors.  I used to be one of those guys, and I thought all of those same things. You know what? <strong>I was wrong.</strong> So now, when I hear the same story from another young entrepreneur who&#8217;s just looking to make it happen, I do my best to save them the year of time that I wasted treading water, looking for someone else to build it for me. This is what I tell them: <strong>just build</strong> <strong>something</strong>.</p>
<p>Something. Anything. Even if it&#8217;s a piece of crap. Even if it&#8217;s just a simple landing page with a logo and email collection form. Think you can&#8217;t do it because you don&#8217;t know how to write code? Sorry, but that&#8217;s bullshit. There&#8217;s a bevy of website building tools available that require no prior knowledge of even the most basic html, CSS, or PHP. <a href="http://tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>. <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a> (.com for newbies, .org for the more advanced). <a href="http://posterous.com" target="_blank">Posterous</a>. <a href="http://unbounce.com" target="_blank">Unbounce</a>. Better yet, all of these tools are free. Sure, it&#8217;s going to take you a little while to familiarize yourself with their interface, but trust me, it&#8217;s nothing that can&#8217;t be accomplished in a weekend. The hardest part of the process is making the commitment to start and not stop until you have a working website.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great example of what I would do if I was beginner. Buy your domain on <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_blank">Godaddy</a>. For $4/month, sign up for their WordPress hosting package &#8211; they&#8217;ll take care of the setup. Once it&#8217;s set up, go find a basic, free landing page theme from the WordPress directory. If you want to class it up a bit, buy one from <a href="http://themeforest.net" target="_blank">ThemeForest</a> for less than $30. If you&#8217;re comfortable with Powerpoint (if you&#8217;re not you might want to reconsider the whole startup thing), create a logo in a text box and save it as a JPEG. Use that JPEG on your website &#8211; (bam!) logo design done. Type up some copy about what you&#8217;re building and how great it&#8217;s gonna be. WordPress offers plenty of widgets to collect emails, add social profiles etc &#8211; use those to lend some credibility to your effort. All in all, this whole process should take less than 2-3 hours. It really is that easy.</p>
<p>Why do I stress the importance of &#8220;<strong>just build</strong> <em><strong>something</strong></em>&#8220;? Because being able to type in a URL and visit <strong>your</strong> website makes the whole experience real &#8211; and legitimizes what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish. If you think you&#8217;re going to be able to convince a developer to join you based simply on the idea in your head, I wish you luck &#8211; but there&#8217;s a 99% chance it won&#8217;t happen. You&#8217;ll make a much better impression on a possible co-founder, investor, or hell &#8211; even your friends and family, if you have a working website they can visit. It doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect &#8211; the fact that you made it at all tells them you&#8217;re serious about the venture.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the last 3 years. I wish someone had given me this advice when I started out, especially since what I wanted to build would have been easy to start on my own. But it is what it is. There&#8217;s never been more free tools available for the average joe to use in his efforts to start an internet business. Take advantage of them! Learn how to use them! Sign up <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">right</a> now. Just do it. <strong>Just build <em>something</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on <a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Come <a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">join</a> me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It could be that my age is finally beginning to get to me. It could be that I&#8217;m expecting my first child sometime in the next few weeks. Or, it could be that I&#8217;ve finally decided to set concrete goals for the year ahead that I actually intend to meet.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is the first in a series of blog posts I&#8217;ll be writing which detail my plans for the upcoming year (2011). The first goal I&#8217;m setting for myself in 2011 is to write a total of 365 blog posts by the end of the year &#8211; one for each day. Since I admin 3 different blogs (<a href="http://matthendrick.org" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.chargesmart.com" target="_blank">ChargeSmart</a>, and <a href="http://blog.turnsocial.com" target="_blank">TurnSocial</a>) I should have plenty to write about, and I won&#8217;t be holding myself to an editorial standard &#8211; some posts might only be a few sentences, and some will be more in-depth. I&#8217;ll be trying to find a good blend of quality mixed with quantity.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point of writing 365 blogs posts in 365 days? It&#8217;s twofold really. First, my writing style should noticeably improve over the course of the year, which will add to my future potential as a co-founder or employee. Second, generating 365 separate pages of content with my name attached will raise my level of personal exposure across the web, resulting in increased traffic to each respective site, and more followers/fans across the <a href="http://twitter.com/matthendrick" target="_blank">social properties</a> I maintain. This should help as I build my personal brand, resulting in my sphere of influence growing over time.</p>
<p>To keep things interesting I&#8217;ll share my progress throughout the year, and benchmark key indicators like Twitter followers, blog traffic, etc.  I&#8217;ll need your help! Keep me accountable &#8211; Twitter and Facebook are great places to give me a hard time. If you have any ideas or suggestions for blog posts, please send them my way!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the truly humbling experiences of being an entrepreneur is going through your user logs and then visiting their website; the place on the internet they call their own, and the place where they've installed your product.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the most savvy internet user can easily forget how truly encompassing the web is. On any given day, I visit between 20-100 different websites, interacting with countless other internet users along the way. However, since I only speak english, my experience is limited to web properties specifically designed for the english speaking world. It&#8217;s easy to forget how much of the internet exists outside of it.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we&#8217;ve had thousands of websites administrators sign up and <a title="TurnSocial" href="http://turnsocial.com" target="_blank">install the TurnSocial bar</a> on their website. One of the truly humbling experiences of being an entrepreneur is going through your user logs and then visiting their website; the place on the internet they call their own, and the place where they&#8217;ve installed our product. As entrepreneurs, we&#8217;re very hard on ourselves most of the time, and base our internal perception of success or failure on our overall position in the market, relative to the competition. Sometimes you have to step back to gain some perspective &#8211; and celebrate the small wins.</p>
<p>Whenever I hop online and visit our customer&#8217;s websites, it reminds me how truly global the internet has become. There are people using the TurnSocial bar in countries including:</p>
<p><strong>The United States (obviously), the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Holland, Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Estonia, Russia, Italy, Israel, Nigeria, India, China, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Canada</strong>&#8230;..and probably a few more that I&#8217;ve overlooked.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s amazing to me is that for 90% of these countries, English is a second language. It&#8217;s an awesome feeling when I visit a website with our product on it; even more so when it&#8217;s in a language I don&#8217;t understand, and haven&#8217;t written our website to be understood in. It reminds me how far we&#8217;ve come &#8211; we started with nothing and built it into something seen by millions of people every month, in different languages and countries all over the globe. We truly have built something for the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, and today I feel pretty good about it.</p>
