</p><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve checked out a couple apps for getting things done, and there is <em>most certainly</em> more to come. In today is <a href="http://weave.intuit.com/weave/">Weave</a>, a lovely app drawn up by a <a href="http://sabrinamajeed.com/">lovely gal</a> while working with Intuit. Yes, Intuit, the company behind such eye candy as TurboTax and QuickBooks.</p>
<p>From a company like Intuit you&#8217;d expect Weave to be an app that&#8217;s more business oriented, and it is, <em>sorta</em>. Weave does to-do&#8217;s, but it also does projects; a place for grouping all your to-do&#8217;s related to one task. The project doesn&#8217;t have to be Quarterly Financials Meeting 2011, either. Go ahead and create &#8216;Macy&#8217;s Birthday Party&#8217; or &#8216;Textbooks for Semester 1&#8242; and Weave is personal again. With your tasks you can optionally set a due date with accompanying a reminder, as well as hours spent on that task, handy for the more work-centric side of Weave. You can also go ahead and attach expenses and incomes to any project or task, a handy addition for budgeting party expenses or billing your clients.</p>
<p>Weave offers you some gorgeous pixels with <a href="http://bpxl.me/pP7hlP">a price tag marked Free</a>, so treat yourself to a lovely app without touching the bank for once.</p>

</p><p>When Patrick sent me the link to a preview of this app, it barely took seconds for me to fall in love with the pixels. <a href="http://www.sylion.com/flightcard/" title="Flight Card App" target="_blank">Flight Card</a>&#8216;s first impressions were <em>that</em> good.</p>
<p>Flight Card is a simple iPhone app that lets you look up your flight and presents the details through a &#8220;reinvented&#8221; approach to your boarding pass. It features over 90,000 flights from 1500 airlines flying through 16,000 airports. </p>
<p>Flight Card&#8217;s design is simple and subtle. Designed by <a href="http://www.jonatancastro.com/" title="Jonatan Castro's Website" target="_blank">Jonatan Castro</a>, Flight Card features very elegant color schemes and elements. There are no shiny gradients or glowing elements. Every screen in the app is pure elegance, if that&#8217;s even a thing. The information in the boarding pass is neatly laid out and pleasing to the eyes. Arrival and departure times are displayed at the bottom in a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display">split-flap display</a> style. </p>
<p>Flight Card sells for <a href="http://bpxl.me/download-flightcard" title="Download Flight Card" target="_blank">$4.99 on the iOS App Store</a> and is a fantastic way to keep a track of your upcoming flights, without the hassles of too many controls and settings. </p>

</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been following this blog for a while, you&#8217;re no stranger to the <a href="http://bjango.com" title="Bjango" target="_blank">Bjango</a> folks. They&#8217;ve been featured here on Beautiful Pixels <a href="http://beautifulpixels.com/?s=bjango" title="Search for Bjango Posts" target="_blank">multiple times</a> in the past. Their designs and apps are populated with delicious pixels and tasty elements. </p>
<p><a href="http://bpxl.me/download-sideways" title="Download Sideways Racing" target="_blank">Sideways Racing</a> is the latest game from the house of Bjango. It is a top-view racing game for iPad that you will enjoy for hours in a row. The gameplay is immersive and the pixels are just gorgeous. There are some fantastic textures used throughout the game — most that make me wish I could have skills even remotely close to make those. The menus and their taps just add to the fun. </p>
<p>Sideways Racing sells for just <a href="http://bpxl.me/download-sideways" title="Download Sideways from the App Store" target="_blank">$1.99</a> on the App Store and comes with Game Center integration. The game offers quite a different gaming experience than anything else selling on the App Store.</p>

</p><p>A few days ago, I wrote about <a href="http://beautifulpixels.com/iphone/listbook-might-be-just-what-you-needed/">ListBook</a>, a simple yet stunning to-do app for iPhone to keep a handle on your day-to-day tasks. Judging by the response, ListBook really was <em>just what</em> many of you needed. Nonetheless, here today is <a href="http://cuesapp.com/">Cues</a>, yet another sexy to-do app, this time running different objective. Cues&#8217; focus is all <strong>location</strong>. Just like the upcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#reminders">location-based reminders in iOS 5</a>, Cues will will go that bit extra by reminding you of tasks not at a set date or time, but as you go to or from a location; the point when you <em>know</em> your task will be relevant.</p>
<p>Cues does things differently straight from the name – they&#8217;re not to-do&#8217;s, they&#8217;re not tasks — they&#8217;re cues. With built-in local notifications, the app gives you a <em>cue</em> on what it is you need to do. Arranged by location in an indisputably erotic custom list layout, adding your cues is <del>quick and</del> easy. Simply enough, just tap the +, name your cue, perhaps a description, and select a &#8216;type&#8217; from one of the hot, hot icons. That&#8217;s all it would take for most to-do apps, but Cues takes it one step further. You&#8217;ll need to attach a location to your cue. If it&#8217;s not  yet in your previously constructed list of places, Cues pulls up a map of nearby locations all plotted thanks to Google Places integration; a clever addition. Once you&#8217;ve set your location, you&#8217;re free to change the alert radius – that is, how far from that point it is when Cues will notify you – select a color for your cue, and you&#8217;re golden.</p>
<p>With your cue set to chime on entry or exit to and fro a location radius, remembering <del datetime="2011-09-06T13:05:45+00:00">shit</del> stuff just got way too easy. You don&#8217;t work for the to-do app, the to-do app works <em>for</em> you.</p>
<p>I love this app, I really do, though I was left with one small gripe. Nothing that isn&#8217;t a touch off from what it should be. Perhaps in an attempt to keep it simple, you are limited to working with a map pulling just under 50% of the screen real estate, a tedious experience for far-off locations. The good news is that I&#8217;m not the only one, and that should see a change in future updates so adding cues will flow without a hitch.</p>
<p>Aside from my persnickety nitpick, Cues is damn awesome and available at <a href="http://bpxl.me/download-cues">$1.99 on the App Store</a>. It serves up beauty and brains that go rivalled, perhaps, only by Apple themselves.</p>

</p><p>I came across <a href="http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com/" title="Evolution of Web" target="_blank">this</a> beautiful visualization of the Evolution of Web today. </p>
<blockquote><p>The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and web apps, teeming with videos, photos, and interactive content. What the average user doesn&#8217;t see is the interplay of web technologies and browsers that makes all this possible.<br />
Over time web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful and immersive web experiences. Today&#8217;s web is a result of the ongoing efforts of an open web community that helps define these web technologies, like HTML5, CSS3 and WebGL and ensure that they&#8217;re supported in all web browsers.<br />
The color bands in this visualization represent the interaction between web technologies and browsers, which brings to life the many powerful web apps that we use daily.</p></blockquote>
<p>A fabulous overview of how web technologies and different browsers have evolved over the last few years. The screenshots of every major version of the browsers are particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Go <a href="http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com/" title="Evolution of Web" target="_blank">check it out</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
