			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The free/libre/open source (FLO) movement has created all the  technologies local communities need to rebuild the world from the  grassroots outward. These technologies include entire operating systems  with complete suites of free software (Linux, OpenOffice, etc), web  applications to construct enterprise grade inter/extra nets and website  (Drupal, Joomla, Django), cloud computing server platforms (OpenStack),  designs for local manufacturing of industrial equipment including  tractors (Open Source Ecology), 3D printers (RepRap), and even  automobiles (Local Motors).</p>
<p>The scale and scope of FLO  technologies is not discussed by the mainstream media because FLO  projects don&#8217;t have marketing/pr/communications campaigns anywhere close  to the scale of Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other suppliers of  proprietary solutions. The lack of knowledge about FLO provides  innovative nonprofit organizations with unique opportunities to leverage  FLO to their advantage by (1) improving the quality and reducing the  cost of their technology solutions with FLO tools, (2) increasing their  organization&#8217;s capacity to collaborate with stakeholders with FLO  techniques, and (3) promoting their use of FLO tools and techniques  within a unique social justice framework.</p>
<p>FLO tools and  techniques will be discussed in my future blog posts, but right now  here&#8217;s a small glimpse of the social justice aspect of FLO.</p>
<p>Imagine if educators could download a complete technology system to  operate a K-12 school and customize it to meet their needs with clicks  of the mouse.</p>
<p>Imagine if farmers could access designs and build procedures for all the tools they need to manage their land.</p>
<p>Imagine if medical researchers could share all their data data and knowledge with each other.</p>
<p>Only FLO technologies can provide everyone with access to the tools and  techniques they needed to create wealth and wellness for themselves and  their communities.  We view universal access to basic technologies as a  human right and the key to empowering people to escape poverty and  secure their own liberty.</p>
<p>Participating in the FLO movement is  easy. It begins with using FLO tools like Firefox, Media Wiki  (Wikipedia), WordPress and Linux and publishing useful information about  your experiences. It continues when you use FLO techniques to help FLO  projects identify bugs, evaluate interest in new features and field  questions in forums. Going deeper, you can contribute to project  documentation, build your own extensions, and publish code to  communities like Github.</p>
<p>As more people participate in the FLO  movement, more people will be empowered by technology, enabling more  people to participate in the movement, and more FLO production to take  place.  This cycle construct an ecosystem of FLO technologies that we   can all use to produce what we want, when we want, and how we want.</p>
<p>A bright future is possible if we all go with the FLO. <img src='http://vitamindwb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you listen to media&#8217;s murmuring, you&#8217;d think that the American people  were ready to give up.  The bankers are too crafty, the corporations  too powerful and the politicians too pliant.  We don&#8217;t know which way is  up, where to turn or on whom to depend.  We&#8217;re lost, sad, unhappy, and maybe a little overweight.  For a few brief moments we had HOPE that that America&#8217;s most powerful institutions could still solve our problems during commercial breaks.  Yes we can, they whispered in our ears.  Yes we can…</p>
<p><strong>As if we couldn&#8217;t. </strong> As if the American people couldn&#8217;t recognize a  lie when it&#8217;s told to our face.  As if the American entrepreneur couldn&#8217;t maneuver around the obstacles created by international bankers and  their confused economists.  As if the men and women in our Armed Forces who  committed to defending our Constitution couldn&#8217;t stand up to anyone who  demanded that they oppress their fellow citizens.  As if our farmers  couldn&#8217;t team up to develop their own technologies, save their own seeds and reap their own harvests.   As if honest people couldn&#8217;t win elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can fool some people all the time, and all the people some of  the time, but you can&#8217;t fool all the people all the time.&#8221;  I think Bob  Dylan said that.  Americans are getting smarter &#8211; not the coastal elites  who think reading the New York Times qualifies as civic participation &#8211;  but the &#8220;dumb&#8221; Americans who&#8217;ve enough common sense to recognize that Big  Government and Big Business have teamed up to steal our wealth while misdirecting us with the help of the corporate media.  But they don&#8217;t control everything on the internet, and as the veil is lifted, both the problems and solutions become much more clear.  I&#8217;m particularly interested in the solutions.</p>
<p>While Silicon Valley gets all the press for their trendy products, thousands  of programmers, engineers and developers  across the world continue to build the free, libre and open source technologies upon which local economies depend.   While multinational chemical companies receive prestigious awards for monopolizing agriculture, American farmers continue to share best  practices, organizing seed banks  and reach customers directly through farmer&#8217;s markets.  While central  bankers act like economic gods with their reactionary monetary policies,  local entrepreneurs continue to discover new opportunities to create real value for their communities.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for problems,  you&#8217;re going to find prestigious people in glossy magazines whining about the difficulties  that lie ahead.  If you&#8217;re looking for solutions, you&#8217;re going to find  unrecognized folks working  quietly and feverishly, as if the fate of the  world depended on it.  The time for criticism is over.  The time for  action is here.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the emergence of the new, participatory, local-networked economy, what Buckminster Fuller would describe as &#8220;a new model that makes the  existing models obsolete,&#8221; start reading about <strong>free/libre/open source technology </strong>and  ask yourself this simple question: what if everyone had the tools they  need to create what they want.</p>
<p>The best has yet to come.</p>

<p>Our society spends a lot of time talking about democracy but rarely defines it.  While the term comes from the Greek words ‘demos’ (people) and ‘kratos’ (power,) many political scientists have abandoned it due to widespread misuse and instead use the term polyarchy, which means &#8216;many rule.&#8217;  It was convincingly inserted into the academic lexicon by the the political scientist Robert Dahl in his 1971 book &#8216;Polyarchy.&#8217;</p>
<p>Dahl proposes that all political systems can be places on a graph with two axis: competitiveness and inclusiveness.  Competitiveness asks who can compete for political office.  Inclusiveness asks the extent to which people can determine who represents them.  We can apply the concept of &#8216;polyarchy&#8217; to by asking these questions of two different political systems, those of America and Israel.  <a href="http://questionablesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/screen-capture-104.png"><img class="alignright" title="Dahl's Polyarchy" src="http://questionablesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/screen-capture-104-300x266.png" alt="Robert Dahl's polyarchy graph from 1971" width="300" height="266" /></a>America has a two party system which makes it less competitive than Israel, which has a dozens of popular parties which enable more people with more diverse perspectives to compete.  America allows a larger percentage of it&#8217;s citizens to vote than Israel does, so America is a more inclusive state.</p>
<p>Dahl’s definition of polyarchy is good, but it&#8217;s not complete.  His theory doesn’t account for the most powerful force in politics:  information distribution.  Those who control access to information have tremendous political power because they can amplify certain elements within society and silence others.</p>
<p>Openness (transparency and accessibility) addresses the issue of information distribution.  In a state with positive openness, information flows between government and society in an efficient manner that facilitates public participation in political processes.  In a state with negative transparency, misinformation flows between government and society, enabling a secretive ruling class to exploit the general public.</p>
<p>By adding openness to Dalh’s polyarchy graph as the third dimension,  the possibility a relationship between competitiveness and inclusiveness arises within the newly created 3D space.  This relationship manifests itself in the graph z=x^3 + y^3.  In this graph, a positively transparent society appears in the top left area of the plane while a negatively transparent society appears in the bottom right area one.<a href="http://vitamindwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/poly3d1.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72" title="poly3d" src="http://vitamindwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/poly3d1.png" alt="" width="710" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what this relationship reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A society that is inclusive but not competitive has a negative transparency because a lot of people are supporting a poor selection of leaders, making the construction of false realities essential to convince people  the situation is acceptable.  Ex. the Soviet Union had a vast propaganda machine while the highly competitive.</li>
<li>A society that is competitive but not inclusive is highly transparent because each included individual receives an unusually high return on his or her ability to select good leadership leaders.  Ex. 19th century America had a very active, highly decentralized news and information distribution sector (newspapers).</li>
<li>A society that is both competitive and inclusive would be extremely open because so many citizens would be have both the ability select from a diverse set of potential candidates, leading to mass participation in the political process.  Ex. Austria has five major political parties and the highest voter turnout in the world (minus nations that make voting compulsory, and Malta, which is tiny.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re in the early stages of &#8216;participatory&#8217; politics as new tools (ex. OpenCongress) are enable the public to increase transparency and accessibility of information to levels impossible before the advent of networked technologies.  A tremendous increase in government transparency seems to be imminent.  If we turned our 3D graph into a 4D animation, we&#8217;d be able to track different societies paths towards more participatory political processes.</p>
<p>We need a common, quantitative understanding of political imperative so our government&#8217;s can create purposeful foreign policies that encourage competitiveness, inclusiveness and openness.  A simple way for national governments to advance a foreign policy based on quantitative principle would be to raise tariffs with closed nations and lower tariffs with closed ones.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one thing I learned growing up the child of &#8216;branding professionals&#8217; it&#8217;s that words can&#8217;t be trusted because clever people are willing to twist their meaning to meet their client&#8217;s demands.  I believe this simple fact is responsible for much confusion throughout human history.</p>
<p>There is a defense against the manipulation of meaning and it&#8217;s simply to stop trusting words and start trusting people.  This is a defense the Eastern masters have been practicing for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Before discounting this approach to life as impractical, ask yourself this question: how can people lie without using words?  All people can do is act.  Your only task is interpreting that action.  This becomes easier as you develop preferences.</p>
<p>I prefer people with the following qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Honest &#8211; Openness &#8211; Transparency: Are you willing to teach me what you do best?</li>
<li>Dignity &#8211; Integrity &#8211; Localism: Are you acting voluntarily and with authenticity?</li>
<li>Passion &#8211; Energy &#8211; Love: Do you feel like you&#8217;re exactly where you&#8217;re meant to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>A person or brand can use whatever lovely language they like, but if their actions aren&#8217;t embodying these qualities, they&#8217;re wasting my time and their own.</p>
<p>Life is too short to be afraid of yourself.</p>
