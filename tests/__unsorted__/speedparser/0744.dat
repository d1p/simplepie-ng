      <content type="text/html" mode="escaped" xml:lang="en-US"><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend1.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="303" /></center>

<p>A couple weekends ago, we traveled to Clarksville, VA (about 3.5 hours away from Virginia Beach) to attend the wedding of Dena&#8217;s son Stephen and his now wife, Ashley.&nbsp; They were engaged on 08/09/10, so the wedding was held on Saturday morning, 09/10/11.&nbsp; Very neat that they worked it all out that way&#8230; but I would expect nothing less from Stephen.&nbsp; We got into town early enough on Friday, that we were able to attend the Rehearsal Dinner party the night before the wedding at the house Dena had rented.&nbsp; We enjoyed delicious BBQ, coolers filled with beer, kamikaze bats, cornhole and some awesome rounds of flip cup!&nbsp; It was lots of fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend2.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="636" /></center>

<p>The wedding was absolutely adorable, the location, the music they chose, the decorations - all of it was just awesome.&nbsp; I am very happy that I was able to attend and be a part of it.&nbsp; A cute idea they had was to include in their RSVP cards for the wedding, an area for you to write a joke or some &#8220;wedding advice&#8221; for them.&nbsp; They have a site where they shared all of the jokes/advice that they received back with the RSVP&#8217;s.&nbsp; You can see all of those <a href="http://dashleyrva.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="Advice to Get Married To">here</a>.&nbsp; They are an adorable couple and I wish them all the happiness in the world!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend3.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="302" /></center>

<p>Of course I cannot talk about the wedding without mentioning how absolutely handsome a one Mr. Ethan Clavier looked in his little tuxedo&#8230; very dapper&#8230; very dapper indeed!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend4.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>I was talking to Nadine about the wedding one evening and telling her how it was at 10am and 3.5 hours away and I was trying to decide whether to go up the night before, or try to swing driving in the morning of, etc.&nbsp; She mentioned that her parent&#8217;s lake cabin was about 30 minutes away from the wedding location and suggested that we just stay there.&nbsp; That turned into, well why don&#8217;t you and Kev see if you can get rid of your kids for the weekend and come to the cabin too and we will make a weekend out of it&#8230; which is exactly what we ended up doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend5.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>I think it took Todd approximately 2.2 seconds after getting back to the cabin after the wedding, to get out of his fancy clothes and change into his fishing clothes.&nbsp; The man LOVES his fishing time and along with Kev, spent the entire rest of his day in this little boat with a cooler full of beer, a bubbling bucket full of minnows and about 5 fishing rods trolling around this lake.&nbsp; It was the funniest thing to watch them.&nbsp; Two big ass men in this little boat, with a battery powered engine, going about 1.2 miles per hour and every time they looped around and passed us on the dock you could tell they were a little bit drunker.&nbsp; You could really tell when you had to keep listening to Todd yelling across the lake about some coon dog he had (huh?) and how he fed it dry dog food and had we seen that damn dog.&nbsp; It became more and more incoherent as the day turned to night, which to us was funnier and funnier.&nbsp; With his mouth that NEVER shut, it was amazing that they caught any fish at all.&nbsp; Nadine gave him the Indian name &#8220;A River Runs Through It.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend6.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>The dock is where Nadine and I spent our day, drinking our own beer and laughing.&nbsp; Nadine was a trooper with her fishing&#8230; especially with the dead ass bait she had to work with.&nbsp; We would ask the guys for another minnow and they would circle around and without stopping, pick the sickliest, deadest minnows from the bucket and throw them at us and keep on puttering along.&nbsp; By the time it was dark, we were all a little toasty&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend7.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>That&#8217;s when we busted out the half gallon of Southern Comfort and the deck of cards and started playing some Spades.&nbsp; Whenever we play spades, it is always Nadine and I against Todd and Kev&#8230; and it is always us playing fair and them CHEATING LIKE DOGS&#8230; and then talking shit the whole time while they are CHEATING.&nbsp; Todd was the worst&#8230; dropping cards out of nowhere and swapping out cards when nobody was looking&#8230; and trying to convince Nadine with a STRAIGHT FACE that she did not throw a 10 of Clubs&#8230; and instead threw a Spade, so that she won the round and not him&#8230; since he had said he would go nil that round.&nbsp; That became the joke of the trip&#8230; WHERE IS THE 10 OF CLUBS TODD????&nbsp; Nadine changed Todd&#8217;s Indian name from &#8220;A River Runs Through It&#8221; to &#8220;Lies Like a Coon Dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spent the first part of the evening all up Todd&#8217;s ass about slowing down with the drinking, especially when I saw that he was drunk enough to think it would be delicious to mix Southern Comfort with boxed red wine.&nbsp; But the joke was on me, when we were out on the porch and all of a sudden I was completely covered in sweat (looking like Whitney Houston on crack as Nadine described it) and then puking my guts out in the woods.&nbsp; Apparently I was the one drinking WAY too much.&nbsp; I felt like hell on earth Sunday for the drive home&#8230; but who cares, it was a great weekend and well worth it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110928_wedding_weekend8.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="592" /></center>

<p>I made this little collage to send to Nadine as a reminder of the weekend.&nbsp; It pretty much sums it all up.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t even ask about the grape cigarillos&#8230; it was just another thing Todd kept yelling about, just like his lost coon dog that he feeds dry dog food.

      <content type="text/html" mode="escaped" xml:lang="en-US"><![CDATA[<p>I was going to be so good about keeping up with the updates.&nbsp; The only thing I have been good about consistently is being good during the week then spending my weekends undoing all that hard work by shoveling everything I see in my face&#8230; oh and still having a fantastic potty mouth, I am VERY consistent with that.&nbsp; I guess I will do another round up to document the second half of our summer.</p>

<center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer1.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer8.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="335" /></center>

<p>There was an exciting weekend filled with Mets games (in 110 degree heat) at the National&#8217;s Park in Washington D.C. as well as some sight seeing, and plenty of cocktails.&nbsp; I will not mention that one of the nights ended with me getting a little TOO tipsy and finding myself alone, wandering around the metro at 1am wondering which train would take me closest to my hotel, then crying to a cab driver to &#8220;please just find the one I am staying at.&#8221;&nbsp; I did eventually make it back safe&#8230; then passed out.&nbsp; I really am a JOY to hang out with.&nbsp; Maybe joy is the wrong word&#8230; it&#8217;s an experience!&nbsp; <img src="http://thescanlons.net/weblog/images/smileys/cheers.gif" width="23" height="15" alt="cheers" style="border:0;" /> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer2.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>There was lots of delicious food to eat at the pool like watermelon, corn, fresh tomatoes, squash, eggplant and anything else that Dena&#8217;s husband Adam would pick up for us whenever he had a jobsite that took him by a produce stand.&nbsp; He is so good to us&#8230; but don&#8217;t bother mentioning it to him, as he will never admit it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer3.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="335" /></center>

<p>There were plenty of nights of being lazy and letting our local pizza joint &#8220;Brother&#8217;s Pizza&#8221; feed us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer4.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>There were days and days at the pool of the kids coming up with some of the dumbest stuff.&nbsp; This particular day, they planned a HUGE party at the pool and hung a sign and went around inviting everyone.&nbsp; The party was going to have dancers and karoke (karaoke) and a live performance by Ethan and Ashton&#8217;s band &#8220;Rigbone and the Ashwipes&#8221; - I wish this was made up&#8230; but they truly came up with all this on their own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer5.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>&#8220;Mayor Bob&#8221; was around this summer again with his breath-taking lady friend (<a href="http://www.thescanlons.net/weblog/index.php?/comments/mayor_bob_his_new_first_lady/" title="Mayor Bob &amp; His New First Lady" target="_blank">remember her?</a>).&nbsp; Although he had a rough summer battling some health issues that he was WAY TOO OPEN AND DESCRIPTIVE about, he made the best of it and was still the HCP ladies man!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer6.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>There were several &#8220;adult nights out&#8221; WITHOUT the kids that involved alcohol.&nbsp; One particular night involved Dena and I believing it was a good idea to hop on a beach cruiser parked outside our local pub and have her ride me around on the handlebars.&nbsp; We are famous for fantastic ideas like that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this one ended with me not being able to move my back for a week and her tearing one of her kneecaps off.&nbsp; I was able to administer First Aid at the pub and continue on with our evening&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer7.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>So that we could move on to our next favorite thing to do when we are out&#8230; taking photos with complete strangers.&nbsp; Nadine and Dena posed for this one.&nbsp; This may just be the BEST photo of this man&#8230; that he will never see.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer9.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>There were lots of nights of taking the kids out for ice cream, either at one of the 300 frozen yogurt shops that have opened up around here, or just up to McDonalds for cheapo cones and sundaes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer10.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="335" /></center>

<p>There were more trips to Busch Gardens for roller coaster riding and fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer11.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="301" /></center>

<p>There was a summer indoor soccer season as well as summer weekend-long soccer tournaments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer12.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>There was a Hurricane scare with Hurricane Irene hitting us.&nbsp; She did not end up being as ferocious as we thought she was going to be.&nbsp; We spent the day at Gammy and Pop Pop&#8217;s house (who have a hard-wired, natural gas powered generator) to ensure that our TV and Wii time would not be interrupted with any pesky Hurricane power outages.&nbsp; We spent the entire next day cleaning up yards.</p>

<p> </p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer13.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>And finally their was Labor Day weekend, the saddest weekend of the year.&nbsp; The weekend that basically signifies that summer is over and those other less fun seasons are on their way in.&nbsp; We always help the lifeguards pack up and winterize the pool and stack all the  furniture. then before we say goodbye to the pool until next summer, the kids take their annual &#8220;final jump&#8221; into the pool.&nbsp; The jump always includes the lifeguards being fully clothed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110830_summer14.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" height="274" /></center>

<p>And it ends with some play time in the pool with the pool lights on.&nbsp; Then we have to go home and get ready for early bedtime so we can be ready for school to start the next day.</p>

<p>Which brings us to where we are now&#8230; school is in full swing, dance has started back up along with soccer and baseball.&nbsp; We are gone from the house from 7:40am until 8:00pm every single day.&nbsp; And when we finally get home it is a mad dash to shovel food in our faces, get homework done, bathe and then pass out to start it all over the next day.&nbsp; I really miss summer.

<p>That little chihuahua in the above photo is Bailey, my parent&#8217;s dog since 1997.&nbsp; My mom and I drove and picked her out and brought her home and then stuck her in the grass (which she was no taller than) and told my dad we found her in the yard and she must have fallen out of the tree&#8230; guess we need to keep her and feed her.&nbsp; She was no bigger than the palm of my hand.</p>

<p>Today she died of congenital heart failure.&nbsp; She had a massive seizure, lost use of her back legs and could not breathe.&nbsp; My dad rushed her to the vet and she was x-rayed and put on oxygen, but she did not make it.&nbsp; She was 14 years old.&nbsp; My dad is not taking it too well, as that was his little buddy around the house.&nbsp; Kaiden is not going to take it to well when I have to tell her this evening.&nbsp; Things like this really just suck.

<p>Last night, while Ashton and I were laying in my bed watching a show about Great White&#8217;s on Shark Week, he and I were chatting about Great White Sharks and he gave me some very important information:
</p><blockquote><p>
<b>ME</b>: WOW&#8230; look at that one Ashton, she was huge.&nbsp; I cannot believe how big some of those sharks are.</p>

<p><b>ASHTON</b>: WELL&#8230; they are not the biggest sharks in the ocean.</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: Oh really?</p>

<p><b>ASHTON</b>: Nope, the six-gill sharks are the biggest sharks in the ocean.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t see them a lot because they live in the inky waters.&nbsp; You have to go real deep and shine a spotlight on them to see them.&nbsp; Most sharks have five gills, but these have six like their old families from the dinosaur times.</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: Really?&nbsp; The inky waters, huh?&nbsp; How exactly do you know this tid bit of info buddy?</p>

<p><b>ASHTON</b>: I saw it on a dvd a long time ago mom.</p></blockquote>

<p>Damn if I did not google that shit this morning to see if he was correct&#8230; and guess what:</p>

<p>The sixgill shark, or Hexanchus griseus, is a common species of deep water shark. It is also one of the largest sharks that feed on prey other than plankton. This shark gets its name from the fact that is has six gill slits, unlike most other sharks which have only five. It is also known by many other names, such as cow shark and mud shark. This primitive species is one of the few surviving members of the Hexanchidae family&#8230;</p>

<p>Also, they live in the &#8220;inky waters.&#8221; <&#8212;- BEST NEW TERM EVER!!!&nbsp; I will never call it deep water again.&nbsp; It will now and forever be &#8220;the inky waters.&#8221;

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer01.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been plenty of time spent out on the boat fishing and tubing and just goofing off.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer02.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been trips to the Zoo.</p>

<p>There has been a Dance Recital - the 7th Dance Recital to be exact.&nbsp; This was Kaiden&#8217;s 7th year in dance.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer04.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been trying to maintain a running regimen in horrible heat.&nbsp; I LOVE SUMMER&#8230; I HATE RUNNING DURING SUMMER.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer05.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been plenty of time spent swimming in the pool, just like every other summer.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer06.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been plenty of nights of eating dinners at the pool as well.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer07.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435"/></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been a new friend, the Bald Eagle that likes to come and perch on the tree by the pool and hang out with us.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer08.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been backyard cookouts with friends and family.&nbsp; This particular one, Dena&#8217;s daughter Cristin and her boyfriend Justin got engaged, prior to their big move across the country for his work.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer09.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been a wedding - again Cristin and Justin went ahead and sealed the deal before the big move.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer10.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been Ashton PROVING himself to the lifeguards to be able to jump off the diving board into a 12 foot deep end.&nbsp; Guess who succeeded and earned a little bit of respect and street cred?&nbsp; That&#8217;s right&#8230; Ashton did!</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer11.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been time spent with good friends.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer12.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>... and even more time spent with good friends while playing the team drinking game FLIP CUP!&nbsp; Nadine LOOKS for reasons to plan get-togethers now just so we can play this game.&nbsp; One night we went through four cases of beer playing this game with eight people in about two hours.&nbsp; It was insane&#8230; and FUN AS HELL.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer13.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been nights down at the Oceanfront watching street performers and getting ice cream.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer14.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been lots of fireworks&#8230; or as Ashton calls them &#8220;kabooms.&#8221;</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer15.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There have been days and days of laying in chairs by the pool and letting the sun fill my body up with Vitamin D.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer16.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been an evening parasailing adventure for me and Kaiden, thanks to an old friend.&nbsp; Kaiden thought it was the best thing ever!</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer17.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been Summer Indoor Soccer every week.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer18.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>There has been a Colbie Caillat concert at Busch Gardens for Kaiden, because that is one of her favorite singers.</p>

<p><center></p><p><img src="http://thescanlons.net/blog_photos/110727_summer19.jpg" border="0" alt="image" width="435" /></p><p></center></p>

<p>And there have been milestone birthdays - Ethan has hit the double digits and is TEN YEARS OLD NOW!</p>

<p>Summer has been busy, full of memories and lots of fun so far.&nbsp; I am looking forward to keeping it going.&nbsp; Hope everyone is having a fantastic summer as well!!!&nbsp; I really am going to do a better job of updating.&nbsp; For realsies!&nbsp;  <img src="http://thescanlons.net/weblog/images/smileys/thumbsup.gif" width="23" height="15" alt="thumbs up" style="border:0;" />

<p>Ashton came home with all his artwork from the school year yesterday.&nbsp; This one made me laugh&#8230; I mean LAUGH.&nbsp; I am sure that when he wrote &#8220;scait bword&#8221; he meant &#8220;skate board&#8221; BUT&#8230; I immediately saw bword as THE B-WORD&#8230;bitch.&nbsp; And why wouldn&#8217;t I?&nbsp; Both my kids LOVE LOVE LOVE to throw around cuss words and think it is okay if they just say the first letter of the word and the word &#8220;word.&#8221;&nbsp; Remember when <a href="http://www.thescanlons.net/weblog/index.php?/comments/b_word_f_word/" target="_blank" title="B-Word &amp; F-Word">Kaiden was five and did it constantly</a>?&nbsp; Well Ashton does it too&#8230; all the time.&nbsp; So naturally, I just assumed he KNEW what the hell he was writing.</p>

<p>Plus&#8230; seriously&#8230; who goes skateboarding with a Spongebob toy and wearing a proper tie?&nbsp; Ashton does&#8230; THAT&#8217;S WHO B-WORDS!

<p>Yesterday, as my sister was driving me to the airport in Rhode Island to catch my flight home, I got a text message from someone in the 804 area code (Richmond, VA) that did not register on my phone as being a contact.&nbsp; I LOVE WHEN I GET TEXT MESSAGES LIKE THAT!!!</p>

<blockquote><p>
<b>STRANGER</b>: Hey, where did you get your square muffin pans from?</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: Dollar Tree.</p>

<p><b>STRANGER</b>: SERIOUSLY?</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: I&#8217;m dead serious.</p>

<p><b>STRANGER</b>: K. Thanx.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Kelly and I chuckled and kept on trucking to the airport.&nbsp; I deleted the texting thread and thought no more about it&#8230; until just now:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<b>STRANGER</b>: Well I went to 3 different dollar trees and none had those pans. Didn&#8217;t know what I was talking about. U sure that&#8217;s where you got it?</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: Yes.</p>

<p><b>STRANGER</b>: K.&nbsp; There are two more I haven&#8217;t checked yet. Maybe they have them.</p>

<p><b>ME</b>: Good luck.</p>

<p><b>STRANGER</b>: Thx
</p></blockquote>

<p>FREAKING AWESOME!&nbsp; Totally made my day today!
