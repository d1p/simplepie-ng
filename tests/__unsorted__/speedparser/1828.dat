         <description>For Jim&amp;#8217;s birthday this year, I went with a bit of a theme: beer. But not any old beer, IPA.

<p>First I decided that a beer of the month club would be cool if I could find one that only ships IPAs. And what do you know? Half Time Beverage does (they have 12 BOTM Clubs to choose from): <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.halftimebeverage.com/browse.cfm/free-shipping-beer-of-the-month-club-ipa-hop-head-/4,2020.html">Beer of the Month Club &#8211; Ipa Hop Head</a>. Perfect.</p>
<p>Then, I thought, &#8220;Well, I think he&#8217;d like to brew his own IPA.&#8221; So I found <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/review/product/list/id/3235/">Chinook IPA Extract Kit from Northern Brewer</a>. Great. Buuuuut, he needs a kit to brew; and this is all new to him. Obviously, Northern Brewer also sells brewing kits. So I picked one of those up, too. It even comes with a getting started DVD. This could turn into quite the hobby.</p>

<p>Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/bitter-beer">Bitter Beer</a> for more info on IPAs and other hoppy brews.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had such a great weekend in Boston this weekend. For my birthday, my husband planned a little getaway with sports, food &#038; entertainment throughout the city. So most importantly, I’d like to thank him for such a wonderful and thoughtful time. Love you, sweetie. xoxh</p>
<p>Friday we made the trip into the big city. We didn’t hit any traffic which was good, because we left a bit later than planned and had a reservation for our first dinner approaching rapidly. We checked in and got comfortable at the Historic <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/BostonParkerHouse.aspx">Omni Parker House</a>. Our room was bigger than we expected; maybe that was because we were in a handicap accessible room. The bed was super comfortable and the location was just perfect, walking distance to everything we wanted.</p>
<p>Then we headed over to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hamersleysbistro.com/home/">Hamersley&#8217;s Bistro</a> for a wonderful dinner. </p>
<p>I had
<ul>
<li>Mixed Spring Greens with Tarragon Vinaigrette and Crispy Goat Cheese,</li>
<li>Roasted Spring Dug Parsnip Soup with Maple Cream and</li>
<li>Crispy Vegetable Lasagna with Ricotta, Soft Poached Egg, Leeks, Peas and Asparagus and White Truffle and Parmesan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jim had
<ul>
<li>Three Warm Oysters Glazed with Crab Butter,</li>
<li>Asparagus, Radish and Arugula Salad with Grainy Mustard Vinaigrette and</li>
<li>Spicy Halibut and Clam Roast with Braised Greens, White Beans and Black Trumpet Mushrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We shared the Warm Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream, Burnt Caramel and Maine Sea Salt for dessert. It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had from beginning to end. I highly recommend getting to this Boston classic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p> 
<blockquote><p><b>Food &#038; Wine Magazine</b> – See us featured on the ‘Go List 2008‘ of Food &#038; Wine Magazine. Food &#038; Wine writes: ‘For two decades, this homey, wood-beamed bistro has been a standout in the city’s now-gentrifying South End. In one of the first open kitchens in Boston,Gordon Hamersley prepares hearty country French–American dishes like his signature garlic-and-lemon-roasted chicken. We loved the halibut with roasted clams.’</p></blockquote>
<p>We went back to the hotel to take a nap before heading out to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-boston">Kings</a> for a couple drinks, pool and bowling. I just love this place. It’s busy, but not crazy packed; there has been a jazzy band each time we’ve visited, not so loud that you can’t have a pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>Then, we just walked a bit up the road to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bukowskitavern.net/boston">Bukowski Tavern</a> to grab a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stonebrew.com/ruin/">Stone Ruination IPA</a>, not the best idea that late, but it’s not every bar that offers my favorite beer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we woke up late and just meandered a bit around Boston, grabbed a Greek omelet at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/steves-greek-restaurant-boston">Steve&#8217;s Greek Restaurant</a>, and headed to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mlb.mlb.com/bos/ballpark/index.jsp">Fenway Park</a> to see the Sox play the Blue Jays. We had great seats:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p> 
<p>But. It. Was. Frigid. And windy. We almost bailed because we were so cold, but we held out and saw a win – finally, a win. After the game we had to warm up and stopped at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.islandcreekoysterbar.com/">Island Creek Oyster Bar</a> for a cold beer. Huh? Well, at least it wasn’t windy.</p>
<p>Again, we went back to the hotel for a warm nap then had a nice dinner at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theoceanaire.com/locations/boston/Locations.aspx">The Oceanaire Seafood Room</a>. Even though it’s a “chain” it was really nice. We were too pooped to go out after dinner. So we watched a few episodes of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/">Storage Wars</a> (never even heard of it before because we don’t have cable; it was humorous, mindless TV for a sleepy night) &#038; boxing – Berto vs. Ortiz, quite the match.</p>
<p>Sunday, Jim had planned some dim sum at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myersandchang.com/">Myers + Chang</a>. It was really good. I haven’t had dim sum since Five Spice Cafe in Burlington, VT burned down; it was the only place around that had vegetarian dim sum. And although it wasn’t as good as 5 Spice, it was great because they had some delicious vegetarian options. The <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://funandfearlessinbeantown.blogspot.com/2010/08/myers-changs-green-papaya-slaw.html">Green Papaya Slaw</a> was super delicious. Service was terrific to boot.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day hanging out in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.faneuilhallmarketplace.com/">Faneuil Hall</a>, watching the Red Sox game at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.purpleshamrockboston.com/">Purple Shamrock</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=blackstone+grill+boston&#038;fb=1&#038;gl=us&#038;hq=blackstone+grill&#038;hnear=Boston,+MA&#038;cid=11640016603178888928">Blackstone Grill</a>, which was a bit more lively. For dinner we hit up a Todd English Restaurant, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toddenglish.com/menu.php?restaurant_id=16&#038;type=Catering">Kingfish Hall</a> which was quite a disappointment. The decor was run down (like their website, apparently), the food was not top-notch (neither of us finished our meals) and the bathroom was quite gross. I’m not sure what happened to this place, but it’s not worth dining at any longer.</p>
<p>However, all was forgotten when we got to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nba.com/celtics/?tmd=1">Celtics</a> game at the Garden. Our seats were 3 rows back from where the players entered the stadium and off the floor, just terrific.<br />
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hlkljgk/5629308316/" title="Celtics playoff game 1 - Garden by hlkljgk, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5629308316_e31517c07a.jpg" style="width:480px;" alt="Celtics playoff game 1 - Garden"></a><br />
Some friends and family even saw us on the TV broadcast. :) It was a tough game, the Celtics were behind for its entirety, but they pulled through in the last 30 seconds. Just awesome!!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p> 
<p>We had just so much fun, Again, thank you, Jim. It was a super fun birthday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, after Syna&#8217;s half day of pre-school, she went to visit Dr. Taylor, whom she just adores, for her 5 year check-up. She was a bit nervous because we were getting her prepared for the possibility of a couple vaccinations. So, we started out by going through the regular routine, found out she&#8217;s still in the <strong>99.5 percentile for height</strong> and overall healthy. Watching her answer the Dr.&#8217;s questions was entertaining; her vocabulary is quite impressive and she wasn&#8217;t reserved in the least. </p>
<p>That little green star is Syna&#8217;s height at this age. Our little outlier. :)<br />
<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5305/5617293351_ed84e215e5_o.jpg"></p>
<p>Then, Dr. Taylor said his goodbyes and 2 nurses came in to give her 2 booster vaccinations. They were brilliant; simultaneous injections in each arm. Syna hardly noticed. We both thought it would be a much bigger ordeal and had previously bargained ice cream afterward. So off we went for family day lunch and ice cream. </p>
<p>Anywho, I am writing today because I haven&#8217;t in long time and because my daughter just told me that the best part of the doctor visit was getting the shots. Yeah. Shots. I was ready for a breakdown, and she apparently loved it. :) </p>
<p>Syna highlights over the past year:<br />

<p>Friday night is date night. My dh and I have been making sure to get this intentional time together now for a few years. It&#8217;s fantastic. We miss it when something else comes up in our schedules, which isn&#8217;t too often. Most of the time it&#8217;s only a couple hours for a leisurely dinner. A little less often we throw in something more special. And every now and again we have Syna stay with a grandparent overnight.</p>
<p>Well, tonight is date night, and here is what&#8217;s planned:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">5pm &#8211; we&#8217;re off to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northamptonma.gov/">Northampton, MA</a><br />
We call it &#8220;the escape from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/01085/westfieldma">Westfield</a>&#8221; or the &#8220;15 minute mile&#8221;. We are very much looking forward to getting back north, in case you didn&#8217;t know. Spring. Spring is our deadline.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">5:30 &#8211; we stop for a hand crafted beer at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dirtytruthbeerhall.com/">The Dirty Truth</a><br />
We&#8217;re both pretty big fans of hoppy beers from micro-breweries. Here are my favorite <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/bitter-beer">Bitter Beers</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">6pm &#8211; we take a dip in the hot tubs at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eastheaven.com/">East Heaven Hot Tub Co. &amp; Paradise Spa</a> (sometimes we add in a couples massage :)<br />
We listen to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/9oMdSu">Air: Moon Safari</a>, say the water isn&#8217;t hot enough right when we get in, last about 15 minutes before we have to get out because we are so hot &#8211; every time</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">7pm &#8211; we grab a light dinner at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.moshimoshi-noho.com/">Moshi Moshi</a><br />
the best sushi in Northampton (and we&#8217;ve evolved through each and every sushi restaurant in NoHo over the years)</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">8pm &#8211; we head over to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thornesmarketplace.com/">Thornes Marketplace</a><br />
Travel downstairs to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cornucopiafoods.net">Cornucopia Foods</a> and right outside of the entrance you will find <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heavenly-chocolate.com/">Heavenly Chocolate : Handmade Artisan Chocolate</a> where we get a couple pieces of heavenly chocolate (srsly); my favorite is the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heavenly-chocolate.com/chocolates/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=35&amp;product_id=101">Pecan Carmella</a>; Jim&#8217;s is the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heavenly-chocolate.com/chocolates/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=35&amp;product_id=74">Dark Espresso Coffee</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom:8px;">8:15 &#8211; our last stop is usually <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.haymarketcafe.com/main.html">Haymarket Cafe</a><br />
They roast their own coffee, and it&#8217;s really good. Lot&#8217;s of vegan pastry and vegetarian fare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, every Friday night we have the option to do virtually whatever we want. And this is such a sweet itinerary that we seem to just want to do it all of the time. Who could blame us? ;)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Relive the stories of your life &#8211; big or small &#8211; with a professionally bound keepsake that you&#8217;ve personalized from cover to cover. A <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">photo book</span> is a unique way to remember the joy of an afternoon at the zoo, the accomplishments of school years past, and the family milestones of <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">birthday</span> bashes, reunions, and summer vacations. All it takes is your favorite pictures and an afternoon of fun.</p>
<p>Use these helpful tips to make your photo book easy and fun:</p>
<p>- A time saver: Select &#8220;auto-fill&#8221; to automatically fill your book with any unchecked pictures from your picture strip. You can then review and modify each page at your convenience.</p>
<p>This is an easy way to jump start the selection of pictures for your photo book. Now all you have to do is adjust a few and add your personal captions.</p>
<p>- Explore the possibilities: test different page backgrounds while you create your photo book by selecting alternative designs using the Background tab.</p>
<p>This way you can quickly see how to customize your photo book to suit your story. Go with bold stripes for birthdays, or textured colors for travel.</p>
<p>- Resize your books for gifts: Visit My Shutterfly, highlight the book you want to create in another size within the My Projects section and select &#8220;make a copy of your book in a different size&#8221; to easily convert your book. For example, change an 8&#215;8 photo book to a 12&#215;12 book, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This is a great way to choose the right size for the person you want to delight with the gift of your story.</p>
<p>Your first step should be to select the photo book size that&#8217;s right for your occasion&#8211;portable 4&#215;4 brag books take about 30 minutes to create and are great mementos for Dad&#8217;s office, while 12&#215;12 photo books can tell longer stories and will look perfect on your coffee table.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i3.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/lens11702621_1277229936micro-four-thirds.jpg" style="margin-right:8px;" align="left">Compared to existing, which are equipped with non-interchangeable lenses and smaller image sensors, Micro Four Thirds is intended to offer a compact solution with interchangeable lenses and the larger sensor used by Four Thirds DSLRs. Micro Four Thirds cameras are smaller and lighter than Four Thirds and DSLRs, but larger and heavier than compacts.

<h2>The Micro Four Thirds System&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.four-thirds.org/en/microft/img/index_img_structure.gif" style="margin-right:8px;" align="left">The biggest attraction of any SLR camera system is the ability to change lenses. However, if the imaging plane (focal point) varies depending on the angle of view or focal length of each lens, it would not even be possible to focus the subject. To avoid this problem, the imaging plane of all interchangeable lenses is standardized by strictly specifying the length of the flange back, or the distance from the mount plane to the film/image sensor surface.</p>
<p>Digital SLR cameras incorporate more components between the lens and the image sensing material than film SLR cameras, such as the image stabilizer, dust reduction mechanism and low-pass filter. Also, since the viewfinder of an SLR camera requires a mirror box for viewing the real image, the flange back needs to be longer to accommodate the mirror box. Compact cameras do not use the mirror box, so don&#8217;t require a long flange back. These factors have made it difficult to design SLR cameras that are as slim and compact as compact cameras.</p>
<p>However, if a digital SLR camera can be designed to exclusively use Live View for shooting, the mirror box is no longer necessary and the camera can be designed with the kind of slim profile previously considered impossible, without compromising the high picture quality. For example, when an ultra-slim pancake lens is combined with the camera, it can be stored and taken out of the inner pocket of a jacket, allowing the user to benefit from the high picture quality of SLR with a higher degree of freedom.</p>
<p>The Micro Four Thirds System is a new standard based on combining Live View shooting with the Four Thirds System, freeing users from the viewfinder and moving closer to an optimum balance between picture quality and compact size. With the Micro Four Thirds System, more people will be able to enjoy the excitement of interchangeable lenses and system extension capabilities that only SLR photography can offer, while still benefiting from the convenience and high portability of ordinary fixed-lens compact cameras.</p>

Photoshop is undoubtedly more useful graphic designers, however for making quick tweaks, nothing beats GIMP. Recently GIMP 2.6 was released, so I decided to make this tutorial for those who still haven&#8217;t discovered the magic of GIMP and don&#8217;t know how to use GIMP productively.</p>
<p>1. Rounded Corners<br />
2. Crop an Image<br />
3. Red Eye Removal<br />
4. Change the size of an image<br />
5. Reduce the file size of images&#8221;<br />
