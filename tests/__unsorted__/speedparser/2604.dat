</p>
<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p><em>Yo! This is a guest post from James. </em></p>
<p><em>You all know that <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/get-an-o-for-outstanding-and-awaken-your-inner-entrepreneur/" target="_blank">entrepreneurship isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart.</a></strong> It takes guts to work for yourself, make a living without the security of a boss and a safety net, and at the end of the day totally rock at it. </em></p>
<p><em>It takes sweat and determination, hard work and commitment. (Kind of like marriage, eh?) It also takes a brain just a wee bit off from the rest of the drum line. Thought processes that are just a tad bit different than your typical 9-5er. </em></p>
<p><em>In the post below, James outlines some of the most important differences between someone workin&#8217; a job, and someone letting the job work them. </em></p>
<p><em>In other words, how to think like an entrepreneur. Because, you know&#8230; like the title says; entrepreneurs are cool! (Don&#8217;t you agree?)</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://14clicks.com/5-non-cliche-reasons-be-an-entrepreneur/" target="_blank">Entrepreneurs are different breed</a></strong> from the people that work at jobs everyday. They see opportunities where others do not and they tolerate a tremendous amount of risk with their own money and resources at stake. Although being an entrepreneur is not for everyone, it <em>does</em> work for people that have that type of mindset.</p>
<h2>Be Willing to Take Risks</h2>
<p>As entrepreneurs, it is literally your job to take risks in order to earn a living and make a profit. There are no guarantees in entrepreneurship and there is no promise about how much money you will actually earn.</p>
<p>However, many of these risks come with a much higher income if they are executed properly. Chances are that everything may not work out, but something is bound to be successful if you keep trying. The bottom line is that you must be willing to take risks.</p>
<h2>Believe in Yourself</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurs must be self-sufficient and <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/thinking-positive-do-you-need-your-head-examined/" target="_blank">have a strong belief in themselves</a></strong> because they will be responsible for the entire organization. Starting a business in the first place requires you to believe that you will succeed because you may have to convince people to invest in your business for funding. If <em>you</em> believe in yourself, others will too.</p>
<h2>Learn How to Delegate</h2>
<p>Although many entrepreneurs start their businesses by doing almost everything themselves, this is really a habit that they must eliminate once the business has gotten off the ground.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs must learn to value their time and delegate the menial duties and administrative work to other people so they can devote more time to actually build the business. It is definitely worth the money to hire employees right away if you can afford to do so because they will allow you to focus on more important things and experience faster growth.</p>
<h2>Be Motivated and Determined to Succeed</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurs must be extremely motivated and determined to succeed because it usually quite tough in the beginning. You will have to keep going no matter what and be willing to devote a lot of time to create a successful business.</p>
<h2>Resist the Temptation of a J.O.B.</h2>
<p>Everyone usually thinks of a dream job when they graduate from school because they are looking for decent pay and stability. By the same token, jobs cause stagnation in terms of experience and income because you will have no control over what you do , when you do it, and how much money you can make.</p>
<p>Everything is determined by your boss, but <strong><a href="http://freelancefolder.com/do-you-think-like-an-entrepreneur-maybe-thats-whats-holding-you-back/" target="_blank">as an entrepreneur</a></strong> <em>you are the boss</em>. An entrepreneur can often start out with no salary at all and it becomes quite tempting to give up and go back to your job (especially in the beginning).</p>
<p>It is alright to keep a job until your business takes off, but you should not return to it later when things get hard. You need to stay in control of your life and income.</p>
<h2>Learn How to Rebound from Failure</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, failure is a major aspect of entrepreneurship because many businesses fail within the first 5 years. Failure does not mean that you are not good enough though it means you need to learn from your mistakes and work harder in the future.</p>
<p>Do not wallow in your mistakes and feel depressed because there is <em>always</em> hope. If you need help, then it is possible to hire a business consultant or attend business classes at local college or university. Even if your first business does not work, still plan on building a second business because <em>you must keep trying</em> in order to succeed.</p>
<h2>Learn How to Recognize Opportunities</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/81800" target="_blank">Entrepreneurs must learn how to recognize opportunities</a></strong> because that is how they create unique business ideas and solutions. Look for ways to earn more revenue or reduce costs in some way. Everything may not work, but you must be able to recognize when you have been presented with an opportunity.</p>
<h2>At the End of the Day&#8230;</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurship is a journey that few people take, but it is incredibly rewarding if you can master the mindset required for success and follow through with building your business.</p>
<p>In short, accept risks, recognize opportunities, and become self-sufficient and self-motivated in order to build a successful business on your own. It is not easy, but it is well worth it.</p>

<p><em>Maybe that&#8217;s you. </em></p>
<p><em>Often times however, those same entrepreneurs get stalled out, because they aren&#8217;t sure WHAT they want to do for a business that won&#8217;t bury them under a mountain of debt or cost them a surplus of time.</em></p>

<p><em>BOO YA. </em></p>
<p><em>BAM!</em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Cuz that&#8217;s how we roll.</em></p>

</p>
<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Halloooo BGB&#8217;ers! <img src='http://www.biggirlbranding.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  How&#8217;s it shakin&#8217;? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is another post by guest author Chris Hoole and his take on why planning is the shiznel for freelancers. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Diaries, efficiency, breaking up, not down&#8230; well, you&#8217;ll just have to read it sweetcakes and see what he has to say for yourself. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Now make him feel welcome ya&#8217;ll. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>You know what to do! (I hope.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some people fall into freelance work and others are pushed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whichever route you have chosen – or have been forced into – there are a few tips to help make your career as a freelancer successful and enjoyable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/avoid-a-freelance-fail-with-creativity-bread-and-buttah-and-rainbow-colored-toe-socks/">Freelancing can be very rewarding</a></strong> – there are no doubts about that – but it can take a little time to get to the point where you fully <em>appreciate</em> it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a freelancer usually makes you the envy of former colleagues, many friends and even family.  You are your own boss, you manage your own time and in many cases you have considerably more control over your income.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What those who remain chained un-gracefully to the nine to five routine don’t see, are the extra hours, the hard work and the commitment you need to make the most of working for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working for yourself means just that; you don’t get to surf the net endlessly on your employer’s time; you don’t necessarily get to take advantage of flexible scheduling; and some days when the sun is shining you still get to remain stuck in the office just like any other worker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of freelancers take the plunge and throw themselves into working for themselves from choice; others find themselves with little option thanks to redundancy, child care or other time commitments.  The tips below are aimed more at freelancers from the latter category – AKA those with more than one plate to spin.</p>
<h2>Dear Diary</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plan your week; this may seem unnecessary in the early days when you have only one or two jobs to deal with.  Not so when you have a raft of work to fit in, and other commitments to fulfil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning can be crucial and if you do care for kids, elderly relatives or anybody else, planning your working week is <em>really</em> essential.  The first thing to do is to <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/dont-get-caught-with-your-pants-down-3-lessons-every-entrepreneur-should-learn/">pencil in the unexpected</a></strong> – those familiar with juggling other commitments will already know the unexpected may as well be factored into the diary at the start of the week. <em>It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> happen!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s also certain little extra chores will eat into your working week, leaving you tearing your hair out in the early hours of the morning, still trying to finish that crucial contract. So plan for them.</p>
<h2>Working Nine to Five, or Four to Midnight</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be a freelancer now who can manage their own time and tear up the office hour schedule – but be wary.  Sometimes keeping a strict routine can help to get you settled into your new ‘free’ working life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Boring, tedious and downright annoying as this may sound, standard office hours are not a bad thing for the <strong><a href="http://applecopywriting.com/">online copywriter</a></strong>.  I’m not talking nine to five – you can still choose your hours, just stick to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They can be four in the afternoon till midnight if you like – and if that’s when you work at your best then you’ll probably find it the best way to go. A routine may not be what you were expecting from freelance work – but writing requires time, space and a lot of concentration.  Interruptions can be fatal.</p>
<h2>Breaking Up, Not Down</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Breaks are important, they&#8217;re the times when we refresh ourselves, find some inspiration and just plain relax.  They are built in to the non-freelancers lifestyle – and they are also crucial for a freelancer working in any creative field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plan time off into your schedule, or you risk burning out.  Don’t include time off to catch up on chores, care duties and the like, but good <strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/23/women-economy-health-flew-cx_hb_0123stress.html">old fashioned ‘me’ time.</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Breaks and days off keep you fresh and while you’re out and about enjoying yourself you’ll find some inspiration for an article or blog post while you are at it. Most artists and writers don’t really get time off, we’re always thinking, but this makes it more important than ever to plan some free time into your week.  When you’re relaxed you’ll find the ideas start flowing- just keep a notebook handy!</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one side to being a freelancer is that it’s not your only task.  Accounting and finances need some attention, along with other administrative tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maintaining your website and <strong><a href="http://www.marketlikeachick.com/5-tips-on-how-to-market-yourself-as-your-main-product/">marketing yourself</a></strong> are other jobs you’ll need to keep on top of, so don’t put these tasks off.  Nor should you think they can be done in your spare time – you won’t <em>have</em> any if you take that approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again planning them into the working week and having regular slots for the boring but necessary tasks can keep you on top of the chores.</p>
<h2>Efficiency Savings</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Efficiency is the key to working for yourself <em>(it’s harder than you might think at first)</em> but planning and being strict with yourself can make a serious difference – possibly the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember, none of the tips above will work for everyone, but they’re hopefully a good start for those new to freelancing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most <strong><a href="http://applecopywriting.com/">professional copywriters</a></strong>, designers, artists and freelancers of any kind will need to develop their own way of working, but the secret that the most successful freelancers share is a routine of some sort – even if it’s not apparent from the outside!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>BGB&#8217;s Note- </em></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>See? I always said there is a method to my madness! I feel so validated now.</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By working hard and planning ahead, you’ll soon be benefiting from the lifestyle that those left behind in the old office, watching seconds pass by like hours, are so envious of!</p>

<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p><em>Howdy BGB&#8217;ers.. this is a guest post by Christian Arno on a topic not yet covered on BGB&#8230; international branding. </em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ll be honest and say it wasn&#8217;t something I was thinking of when I started BGB and it&#8217;s possible it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;ve thought of either when branding your business. </em></p>
<p><em>However he nailed home some important points, so read and implement if it&#8217;s your thang BGB&#8217;ers. And do make the man feel welcome will ya? <img src='http://www.biggirlbranding.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  </em></p>
<p><em>Is this something you should be considering before <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/traditional-offline-or-contemporary-online-how-should-you-build-your-brand/">launching your branding efforts</a></strong>? Or is it something you didn&#8217;t consider before but now wish you did? Spill it in the comments below.</em></p>
<p>In this globalized age we live in, it’s possible to do business with anyone from Bangor to Bangkok. E-commerce is already well established in North America and Western Europe, but the emerging markets are fast-growing too.</p>
<p>For example, in Turkey, where ADSL was introduced as early as 2003, around half of the population is online, while in India use of the Internet has doubled since 2007.</p>
<p>But when it comes to selling online, it’s not as simple as marketing one message to everyone. Cultural understanding can make or break a brand.</p>
<p>Cultural faux pas or clumsy interpretations can damage the image of a brand irreparably &#8211; only tailored branding to suit that particular country and culture will properly ‘speak’ to the customer.</p>
<p>If you want to <strong><a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/build-an-international-brand.html">market your brand internationally</a></strong>, then think global from the very start and bear these points in mind…</p>
<h2>Have You Heard the Word?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, Western brands have gone for familiar, local-sounding names for their favourite products – think of Uncle Ben’s or Kentucky Fried Chicken.</p>
<p>Nowadays, if brands want to move across borders then they need their name to make sense across cultural and linguistic divides. Cleaning product brand Jif made no bones about the fact that they had to change their name to Cif due to the difficulties their Eastern European consumers had with the letter ‘J’.</p>
<p>In fact, they based a whole new marketing campaign around it.</p>
<p>Different branding can be important for product names in different territories. For instance, in the US consumers traditionally prefer evocative names for products, like Ford’s Mustang, whereas in Asia numerical product names are preferred, as in Sony’s camera range.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on dual branding. In the UK Walkers and Vauxhalls are the same cars as the European Continent’s Lays and Opels, bar the names. But this kind of inconsistency can cause <strong><a href="http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2008/09/ball-of-brand-c.html">brand confusion for consumers</a></strong>, so it’s worthwhile deciding upon an international brand name at the outset.</p>
<p>This is where the assistance of localization experts can be crucial – you don’t want to end up naming your product a word that is rude, contradictory or foolish in another language!</p>
<p>This is particularly applicable to slogans and phrases – the cultural connotations of direct translations can be disastrous. Allegedly, American Airline’s ‘Fly In Leather’ slogan translated to ‘vuela en cuero’ or ‘Fly Naked’ in Mexican Spanish, whilst further afield, in China KFC urged consumers to ‘Eat Your Fingers Off’ instead of their otherwise successful slogan ‘Finger Lickin’ Good’!</p>
<h2>Do Your Cultural Research</h2>
<p>Every brand has its message and buzz concepts. Let’s look, for instance, at <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></strong>. <strong><a href="http://www.marketingminds.com.au/branding/apple_branding_strategy.html">Apple’s marketing</a></strong> subliminally tells its customers that they are technologically-savvy, up-to-the-minute, busy and vivacious people.</p>
<p>Now, a person could be all of these things, whether they live in London, Lebanon or Lima. If the branding embodies something more specific, such as ‘economic’ or ‘affordable’, this could strengthen the brand in some countries, yet equally turn other markets off.</p>
<p>For example, consumer research in China shows that the majority of online shoppers will invariably go for the least expensive option when faced with a range of similar products, whereas in the Gulf states the perceived luxury of a brand, rather than the price, will be the motivating factor for purchase.</p>
<p>The key is to do your market research before launching your product and tweaking your branding, and price, accordingly.</p>
<p>Of course, taking care with the translation of your marketing collateral for foreign markets applies to more than just the brand name, slogan and packaging. Your translated website content should also be localized by native speakers, as should your content for social media marketing.</p>
<p>But with a bit of local advice and some international domain names, there’s nothing standing between you and an international audience of 2 billion consumers – as long as you take the time and effort to speak their language.</p>

</p>
<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Howdy BGB&#8217;ers&#8230; I know, you missed me. <img src='http://www.biggirlbranding.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />   </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Unfortunately I&#8217;m still pretty sickly at the moment, can&#8217;t seem to shake it.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>So big thanks to guest blogger Chris Hoole today for picking up my slack with this thought-provoking post on language, <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/copyblogger-3-steps-to-finding-your/">voice</a></strong>, and how it can affect your business success.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Ya&#8217;ll know what to do by now right?  Make him feel warm and welcome and all that jazz.  We bloggers live for that stuff! <img src='http://www.biggirlbranding.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tone of voice for copywriters, or their offline cousins, is essential.  Whatever business you run, a massive part of your marketing materials will depend on the written word.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even TV adverts start out as scripts, so getting the <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/writer-finding-your-audience/">right words to get your message across</a></strong> is crucial.  When it comes to online marketing &#8211; be it article marketing, blog posting or web copy itself, there are a number of approaches to take.  The Internet has changed language, or at least the way it gets used, more rapidly than any other previous communication technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Text-speak sometimes looks like it needs a Bletchley Park code breaker to decipher it;  while some people bemoan the ‘death’ of the English language, others see this sort of development as proof that the language is well and truly alive and kicking.  Let’s face it, you can’t text-speak in Latin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to online marketing materials there are arguments for both sides; some argue that your articles, blogs and web copy should be informal, using language and/or symbols that ‘people’ understand.  Others argue for a more formal tone, which suggest ‘authority’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So who’s right?</p>
<h2>Considering the Market</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OK, I’ll admit now that I don’t have an answer to that.  There’s too many different factors to take into account.  As a business you need to know your market and this will be one of the major factors to consider when it comes to the <strong><a href="http://blog.case.edu/webdev/2007/10/11/tone.html">tone of voice</a></strong> you adopt and the style of language you use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m not, by any stretch of the imagination, with those who see changes in language as a bad thing.  As a writer and copywriter I like to see languages evolving, I’ve even been known to invent the odd word or two from time to time.  At the same time I prefer, generally, a more formal approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if your market is likely to respond to text-speak, to understand it and most importantly to trust it, then it’s the way to go.  Trust is the key word here, because online communication has to build trust, first and foremost.  Online shopping is new, <em>(I mean its been around a few years now)</em> but it’s still new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More and more people are accessing the Internet and there’s a huge increase in the range of backgrounds and ages of the people who do.  Older generations, unfamiliar with anything more techy than a typewriter are being forced online in droves, as businesses and government agencies go virtual – to cut costs and become ‘more accessible’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The growth in the range of Internet users is taking a sharp upward curve.  These users need sites that seem ‘<strong><a href="http://authorityrules.com/">authoritative</a></strong>’ and this is where, to some extent, I think the more formal approach can be a winner.</p>
<h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Writing that is good quality, sounds authoritative, possibly journalistic in tone, can give you access to a broader range of Internet users, and help to establish trust with them.  But this also depends on the platform you’re using to communicate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For article marketing, email marketing and blog posting, it can work well.  If you’re accessing your clients through FaceBook or Twitter, it can be less useful.  As is often the case in life – and business – combining both approaches brings the best results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where making the right choices in your marketing campaigns is essential.  With the growth in Internet use and the range of platforms to work from, creating good, workable and appropriate copywriting for your business needs to be approached seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any business needs a solid business plan and a marketing strategy should underpin this.  By joining forces with established <strong><a href="http://applecopywriting.com/">seo copywriting</a></strong> agencies, you can develop the right tone of voice, the right language styles and the right mix as required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one business will be entirely the same and getting this mix right can be a serious factor in success.  Whichever route you choose, and both are probably equally important, at the end of the day ensure that you pay due care and attention to the tone of voice you take with your customers!</p>

<p>Today, every business, no matter how small, has to <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/unique-ways-to-promote-online-brand/">build brand identity</a></strong> and brand awareness on the Web. Small business used to mean local, but that is no longer the case. Small businesses now face stiff competition from all over the world regardless of their industry.</p>
<p>In order to compete and flourish in such an environment, they must adapt. In other words, they must brand build to create a lasting impression on the appropriate online audience.</p>
<p>It is a simple idea to express but one that is challenging to achieve. It is the reason why so many transitions to the online arena fail; businesses apply traditional brand-building techniques exclusively.</p>
<p>That failure is not an indication that traditional methods do not work at all but rather that they are inadequate in this constantly evolving business landscape. In order to succeed in this brave new world, the modern business must find balance between those two strategies.</p>
<h2>Traditional <em>(or Offline)</em> Brand Building</h2>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00041?gko=9efe7">concept of traditional brand building</a></strong> is broad, so let us define it. Traditional brand building and marketing is impersonal. If it were a story, it would be one told in the third-person. Traditional brand building is also highly focused.</p>
<p>As a profit-oriented organization, we do not want to expend resources building identity and awareness in areas where our markets are limited. Instead, we use newspaper, radio, television, direct mail and outdoor advertisements in those areas where we believe our market is densest and most lucrative.</p>
<h2>Modern <em>(or Online)</em> Brand Building</h2>
<p>Modern brand building is personal and social. <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/your-brand-story/">If it were a story</a></strong>, it would be one told in the first-person. Modern brand building can be focused, but it is often most effective when it is not. That is not to say that it is unfocused but rather that is organic.</p>
<p>If using a TV ad is a logical approach to brand building, then we may conceptualize Twitter as the intuitive approach. The Web is our market, and so we want disperse our identity and extend awareness as far we can.</p>
<h2>Find the Balance- Traditional and Modern Brand Building</h2>
<p>The key for every business is to achieve the right balance between the two, but the emphasis should always be with the online branding. Even a truly local business, such as a tanning salon, can use local marketing online that is more effective and cost-efficient than traditional means, even with the additional cost of webhosting and other services.</p>
<p>In addition, the “truly local” business can expand their reach and augment profits, such as selling tanning products and other beauty aids online.</p>
<h2>How Business Has Changed</h2>
<p>For many years, numerous industries did not have to worry about outside competition. A rural hardware shop may not be able to compete with the big Ace Hardware in town directly, but it did offer the clientele convenience.</p>
<p>We might be willing to pay a dollar more for that hammer because Ace Hardware was out of our way. With the Internet, however, everything is convenient. We can order just about anything we need at the best price and have it delivered right to our door.</p>
<h2>Embracing the Internet as a Business</h2>
<p>Embracing the Internet can be the solution to all of our business woes, but there is much more to it than simply choosing a cheap <strong><a href="http://www.webhostingsearch.com/">web hosting</a></strong> and slapping together a website. Even people who have been highly successful in traditional business endeavors have failed when making the transition to the Web.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons they fail is that they shoehorn their old techniques. In order to avoid this mistake, we must objectively recognize what works online, and then embrace it with all that we have.</p>
<h2>This Is a Young Person’s Game</h2>
<p>It is a young person’s game because <strong><a href="http://www.orangesoda.com/blog/11-reasons-your-small-business-should-blog/">effective business techniques</a></strong> are appearing and evolving right before our eyes. Prior to the Internet, we had marketing down to a science. Now, we must embrace change, and it is the young that are best suited to doing that.</p>
<p>However, youth really is a state of mind. Blockbuster is an old company that thought old and is paying the price. Marvel is an old company in a dying industry <em>(comic books)</em>, but their youthful approach made them an attractive purchase to Disney.</p>
<h2>Putting Verbs into Our Sentences</h2>
<p>So we’ve purchased <strong><a href="http://www.webhostingsearch.com/dedicated-server.php">dedicated server hosting</a></strong> for our business; what’s next? Well, first we need to determine if we can eschew traditional brand building altogether. Many businesses can, and that allows them to focus all of their efforts and resources online.</p>
<p>That does not, however, mean that we have to avoid local brand awareness altogether. In fact, as we mentioned earlier, we can use local online marketing strategies <em>(like Google Places)</em> to augment our broader approach.</p>
<p>Next, we need to engage our audience. We’ll use Twitter, Facebook and a host of other social networking tools. But most importantly, we need to determine how we’ll engage, and what type of response we want to elicit.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the humorous t-shit market. Online, it is highly competitive, so how do we distinguish one company from another? Well, we might attract people to Twitter by hosting weekly guest comedians that use our feed to tell their jokes.</p>
<h2>Never Abandon Core Tenets of Traditional Brand Building</h2>
<p>Our business may never use impersonal marketing, and we may never have an ad on radio or TV. Nevertheless, the core tenets of traditional brand building still have great value to us because we can apply them to our online endeavors.</p>
<p>For starters, reduce your enterprise to a concept. That concept should be <strong><a href="http://www.biggirlbranding.com/brand-appeal-website-irresistable/">pure and powerful</a></strong> but also simple and genuine. In our above example, we’re all about the funny not the t-shirts. If you need inspiration, examine the Nike swoosh logo, and consider how you might be able to use a logo on Facebook and your website.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yo!  Like this post?  Get some value from it?  Walk away with new knowledge?  Please tell the world about it if you did, so others can be enlightened too.  Those handy share buttons will do the trick.  You know I &lt;3 ya for it! Xo!</em></p></blockquote>
