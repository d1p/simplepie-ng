&lt;p&gt;Dr Ian Pinder, Managing Director of PinBellCom said, “We are thrilled that Medipex have recognised the innovation shown in Intradoc247. We know that it is great and GP surgeries are really recognising the benefits and cost savings of the efficiencies it drives… More and more practices are seeing the product in other surgeries and the contents at intradoc247.com”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intradoc247 is a GP Practice Intranet which serves to provide efficiency in QOF, Accreditation and Re-Validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article reads as follows;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intradoc 247 is an innovative software package to aid the management of data in GP surgeries and has been developed by Leeds based Pinbellcom. The system allows patient information leaflets to be stored in one place so that a GP can maximise time spent with a patient without using up valuable time looking for documents. Referral forms and care pathway document management is also built into the software, as are a range of clinical calculators including GAD-7, PHQ-9 and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intradoc 247 also allows operational QOF requirements to be handled easily allowing evidence of all procedures and systems to be stored easily. By effective use of Intradoc 247’s applications, a practice’s QOF score can be increased by 31.5 points. Furthermore, the software also allows staff easier management by keeping all the details in one place including evidence of CPR training and Hepatitis B vaccination status. A rota system is also built into Intradoc 247 to minimise the preparation time of the weekly rota and to allow staff to get a clear individual view of when they are working.
