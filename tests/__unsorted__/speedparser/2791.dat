Social media has, so to speak, been genderized. New on this week’s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576566661009105054.html?mod=WSJ_Books_LS_Books_13">best-selling non-fiction list</a> is  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/vicki-milazzo-2">Vickie Milazzo’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Success-Inside-Every-Woman/dp/1118100522">Wicked Success Is Inside Every Woman</a>, a self-help book for females which, in part, argues that women use social media more effectively than men.

As Vickie Milazzo told me when we Skyped late last week, women “excel at relationship building” because they “pretty much manage everything” in the household. In contrast with men – who tend, she says, to see collaboration as a weakness – women are natural relationship builders who thus naturally excel at social media. And that’s because, Milazzo explained to me, women use both sides of their brains while men only use one side of theirs.

<p>It had to happen. Social media has, so to speak, been genderized. New on this week’s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576566661009105054.html?mod=WSJ_Books_LS_Books_13">best-selling non-fiction list</a> is  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/vicki-milazzo-2">Vickie Milazzo’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Success-Inside-Every-Woman/dp/1118100522">Wicked Success Is Inside Every Woman</a>, a self-help book for females which, in part, argues that women use social media more effectively than men.</p>
<p>As Vickie Milazzo told me when we Skyped late last week, women “excel at relationship building” because they “pretty much manage everything” in the household. In contrast with men – who tend, she says, to see collaboration as a weakness – women are natural relationship builders who thus naturally excel at social media. And that’s because, Milazzo explained to me, women use both sides of their brains while men only use one side of theirs.</p>
<p>As a man who doesn’t excel in relationship building and who rarely uses either side of his brain, I have to confess that I’m sympathetic to Milazzo’s argument. But I suspect that not all TechCrunchTV viewers will be equally open-minded. So, is Vickie Milazzo right – are women hardwired to use social media more effectively than men?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mafiawars2.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="MafiaWars2" title="MafiaWars2" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>As we reported a few weeks ago, Zynga is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/zynga-debuts-new-version-of-3-d-facebook-game-mafia-wars/">debuting</a> a new version of its hit Facebook game Mafia Wars. Today, the social gaming giant is revealing all the details of the new, mobster-themed, crime-focused social game, <a href="http://mafiawars2.com/">Mafia Wars 2.</a> The game itself is not live now, but will be available on Facebook within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Originally launched 2008, Mafia Wars allows players to build their virtual criminal empires by collaborating with their friends to complete crime jobs, fight and rob other Mafia crews, run underground businesses and purchase virtual goods like weapons and getaway cars. Set in New York City at launch, the game expanded to new in-game locales including Cuba, Moscow, Bangkok, Las Vegas, Italy, Chicago, and Brazil in March 2011.</p>
<p>Mafia Wars 2 actually marks Zynga’s first direct sequel to a game, and introduces an even more immersive crime world with additional characters and deeper storylines. The gameplay itself is similar to to the first version of Mafia Wars and revolves around building up a virtual mafia family with other members, earning virtual cash to buy weapons, performing ‘jobs’ to earn more, and eventially building your own casino. But the gameplay is much more in-depth, expansive and in some ways, more violent and combative. Mafia Wars 2 also has a more edgy feel to it. For example, the title&#8217;s trailer is actually set to “Mountain Song,” by Jane’s Addiction.</p>
<p>Players need build up what Zynga calles their &#8220;turf economy&#8221; to collect cash and hire workers to do their dirty ork and keep their hands clean. Mafia Wars 2 features over 100 decorations/virtual goods for players to personalize their home turf, including casinos, banks and houses. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Mafia Wars 2 also marks one of the highest-levels of customization for a Zynga game at launch, providing players with more than 300 different types of weapons, armor and vehicles. Players can outfit themselves by amassing weapons, armor and abilities to help them in battle. Players can also generate from over 20 million unique looks for their avatar, including over 600 pieces of clothing.</p>
<p>Mafia Wars 2 game players travel across seven worlds, including Casino Row, Granite Square, Neon Strip, Downtown, Bluebird Meadows, Boxer Island and Westside Wharf, to take on crime bosses and build their empire. While some characters from the first version of Mafia Wars make appearances, for the most part the characters in the sequel are new. Characters include, <a href="http://mafiawars2.com/the-game/characters/zoe-sato/">Zoe Sato</a>, a daughter of a Yakuza gangster, gang member <a href="http://mafiawars2.com/the-game/characters/lucius-jackson/">Lucius Jackson</a>, and corrupt FBI agent <a href="http://mafiawars2.com/the-game/characters/arthur-roteman/">Arthur Roteman</a>. </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this version of Mafia Wars is more combative, and also is a consequence-based game, meaning your actions in the game may result in good or bad progress. Players engage in competitive and cooperative fighting and assemble a crew of friends from Facebook. Players build their crew to help them on missions, fight rivals, take on crimes bosses and visit friends’ turfs to enhance their criminal empire and character abilities. </p>
<p>Friends (crew members) can be called on to help defend a player’s turf when it’s under attack and repair it after there has been damage . The game features three fight arenas at launch, including Bone yard, Badlands and Area 51, where players fight asynchronously and attempt to rob random rivals in the game. After a rival is robbed, they’re added to the attacking player’s rival list, where they can be targeted again.</p>
<p>In terms of graphics and visualizations, Mafia Wars 2 had definitely been created with a more modern look and design, as well has more graphics and effects. In fact, there are over 100 character animations in the game, and there&#8217;s more of an emphasis on sound effects And the game has added 3D to its visualizations, giving the gameplay experience more depth.</p>
<p>For Zynga, Mafia Wars is one of its earliest titles. The game has <a href="http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/10979261223-mafia-wars">4.4 million monthly active users</a>, which compared to CityVille&#8217;s <a href="http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/291549705119-cityville">71 million monthly active users</a>, is small. Clearly, Zynga is trying to refresh interest in the title, and the gaming giant is betting on a more in-depth, visually appealing, combative game to help boots usage. Zynga has even released a <a href="http://mafiawars2.com/comic/">first-ever digital comic</a>, which reveals the back story to players’ stint in prison and the cast of characters in Mafia Wars 2. </p>
<p>At launch, Mafia Wars will be available in 16 languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Turkish, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Japanese and Thai), which is the most native translations Zynga has ever released out the gate.</p>
<p>Zynga has been on a tear of late, launching a slew of games on Facebook and mobile devices, including <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/01/zynga-debuts-largest-most-feature-rich-multi-dimensional-facebook-game-to-date-adventure-world/">Adventure World</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/12/after-frontierville-zynga-channels-the-wild-west-again-for-facebook-game-the-pioneer-trail/">The Pioneer Trail,</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/31/zynga-channels-settlers-of-catan-in-new-social-combat-game-empires-allies-debuts-in-12-languages/">Empires &amp; Allies</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/25/zynga-partners-with-tencent-to-launch-localized-chinese-version-of-cityville/">a Chinese version of CityVille,</a> a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/zynga-wants-you-to-build-your-neighborhood-with-cityville-hometown-ios-app/">CityVille iOS app</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/zynga-brings-scrabble-like-words-with-friends-to-the-web-with-new-facebook-game/">Words With Friends on Facebook,</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/06/zynga-turns-hangman-into-a-social-ios-game-with-the-debut-of-hanging-with-friends/">Hanging with Friends.</a></p>
<p>And according <a href="http://fusible.com/2011/10/zynga-buys-up-mafia-wars-shakedown-domains-drop-hints-on-android/">to this report</a>, it looks like Mafia Wars 2 may come to iOS and Android. </p>
<p>But in a <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/110927/p1#a110927p1">recent S-1 filing</a>, the social gaming giant, which filed its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/11/zyngas-new-s-1-zyngas-internal-valuation-in-march-was-11-5-billion/">S-1 to go public in July,</a> reported that <a href="http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/223371/zyngas-profits-down-by-95/">profits were down in Q2</a> of this year because of the lack of any new game launches in the first half of 2011. With the social gaming company now churning out titles, we&#8217;ll see if profits increased in Q3. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/rhapsody_logo.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="rhapsody_logo" title="rhapsody_logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>On-demand music service Rhapsody will acquire competitor Napster in an effort to expand its user base, the companies have announced. Under the terms of the agreement, Rhapsody will acquire all Napster subscribers and certain other assets. Meanwhile, Best Buy, Napster&#8217;s current owner, will receive a minority stake in Rhapsody.</p>
<p>The &#8220;other assets&#8221; that will move over to Rhapsody include Napster&#8217;s IP portfolio, however, no mention of Napster&#8217;s label contracts or deals were made in today&#8217;s announcement. Currently, Napster has a streaming music catalog of over 15 million songs, as well as apps for the desktop, mobile and TVs. The software also provides access to streaming music radio stations, thousands of playlists, offline music, charts and more.</p>
<p>Rhapsody, on the other hand, boasts a catalog of 13 million songs (according to the announcement &#8211; the website says 12 million), meaning Napster subscribers will be losing access to a good number of tracks in the transition. But Rhapsody&#8217;s other offerings, including cross-platform apps, playlists and a radio feature, are similar to what Napster previously offered.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes at a time when newer startups like Spotify, MOG and Rdio are stealing the spotlight from older brands like Napster and Rhapsody. A clue that Napster was on its way out came last week when Rhapsody <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/17/facebook-music-soundcloud-deezer-rhapsody/">was listed</a> among the services receiving Facebook Music integration while Napster was not.</p>
<p>The deal will close on November 30th, says the report. The amount Rhapsody paid was not disclosed. </p>

<p>Developed by Tsai Yao-Pin and his team of researchers, the &#8220;invisible key&#8221; is actually a bit of a misnomer, as it&#8217;s what&#8217;s built into the lock that does all the heavy lifting. The heart of the invisible key is a special chip-and-accerometer combo that Yao-Pin and his team of researchers have developed. </p>
<p>The chip is able to track users&#8217; hand movements in three dimensions, and those gestures can be stored for future use. Once those unlock gestures have been set, it&#8217;s a simple matter of flashing that same move in front of the lock at the end of the day and <em>voilà</em> &#8212; you&#8217;re back within the comforts of your own home. </p>
<p>The invisible key concept netted Yao-Pin and his school a Gold Award at this past weekend&#8217;s <a href="http://www.inventaipei.com.tw/">Taipei International Invention Show</a>. There it enjoys the company of other high caliber inventions like &#8220;a kind of foldable flat mop head with cleaning pad&#8221; and &#8220;nanostructured composite anode with nano gas channels and atmosphere plasma spray manufacturing method thereof.&#8221; Seriously.</p>
<p>Speaking as a thoughtless clod who&#8217;s lost more keys than I care to admit, I&#8217;d be the first in line to buy one of these things. Thankfully for people like me, Tsai Yao-Pin has mentioned that the project has caught the attention of a few interested companies, so we may not need to wait too long for an easier way inside.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fusecorpslogo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="fusecorpslogo" title="fusecorpslogo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>New social venture <a href="http://fusecorps.org/">Fuse Corps</a> is launching a platform to connect entrepreneurial professionals with governors, mayors and community leaders across the U.S. in an effort drive meaningful social change. The group will identify projects in various communities that address a national issue like education, health care or economic development, then recruit and pair a selected entrepreneur with those working in the public sector to collaborate on the project.</p>
<p>The idea behind the new program is not only to deal with issues on the local level, but come up with solutions that can be replicated by other local governments and scaled nationally.</p>
<p><a href="http://fusecorps.org/">Fuse Corps</a> says it will extensively interview the potential hosts to determine their needs, interests and expectations and will then seek out, match and place the so-called Fuse Corps &#8220;Fellows&#8221; with the hosting institution.</p>
<p>Hosts are expected to provide Fellows with access to senior leadership, create a supportive and positive working environment, and demonstrate a commitment to initiate the changes suggested by the Corps members, the group&#8217;s website <a href="http://fusecorps.org/host-a-fellow/">explains</a>.</p>
<p>Kicking off the launch is <a href="http://www.cityofsacramento.org/mayor/">Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson</a>, who will host two Fuse Corps Fellows in 2012, one who will help on energy reform issues and other working to reform the Sacramento Unified School District.</p>
<div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/28974304' width='400' height='225' frameborder='0'></iframe></div>
<p>Half of the 2012 pilot Fellows will come from Fuse Corps sponsoring companies including McKinsey, Starbucks, G.E., McDonald&#8217;s and others, while the other half will be selected from the <a href="http://fusecorps.org/join-fuse-corps/">applications submitted via the Fuse Corps website</a>.</p>
<p>Potential applicants should have at least 8 years professional experience in the private sector, strategic leadership and project management skills, commitment to public service, leadership qualities and more, but subject matter expertise in the particular policy area of the placement is not required.</p>
<p>Since Fuse Corps members will be coming from the private sector for their year-long stints, there is compensation available for those who require it. However, some companies will provide their employees on an &#8220;on-loan&#8221; basis instead.</p>
<p>The benefit to working in Fuse Corps, of course, is not related to income, but the participant&#8217;s ability to impact change on some of the country&#8217;s most pressing problems by getting directly involved in the governmental processes to see how they work (and how they don&#8217;t work) in order to come up with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Fuse Corps Co-founder and CEO <a href="http://fusecorps.org/about-fuse-corps/#team">Jennifer Anastasoff</a> was previously the founding CEO of EnCorps and BuildingBlocks International, where she engaged top corporate professionals in pro-bono projects. She also taught in Teach for America and served as an analyst in the California Legislature.</p>
<p>Other co-founders and advisors include a large group of well-known leaders, including best-selling author and entrepreneur <a href="http://petersims.com/">Peter Sims</a>, who recently <a href="http://petersims.com/2011/10/01/annoucing-fuse-corps-a-bold-new-approach-to-social-innovation/">blogged about</a> the launch on his personal site. In addition to Anastasoff, Sims noted in particular co-founders  <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/perspective/biography/lenny.asp">Lenny Mendonca</a>, a senior partner at McKinsey, <a href="http://executive.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-viotti">David Viotti</a>, the former Chief Learning Officer of Sun and Fuse Corps’ chief learning officer, <a href="http://www.pointsoflight.org/people/management-team/ayesha-khanna">Ayesha Khana</a>, who leads the Civic Incubator at the <a href="http://petersims.com/2011/10/01/annoucing-fuse-corps-a-bold-new-approach-to-social-innovation/www.pointsoflight.org">Points of Light Institute</a> (which is incubating Fuse Corps in its first year and providing back-end services), <a href="http://www.americaspromise.org/About-the-Alliance/Leadership/Board-of-Directors/Marguerite-Kondracke.aspx">Margeurite Kondracke</a>, CEO and now senior advisor to General Colin and Alma Powell’s education nonprofit <a href="http://www.americaspromise.org/">America’s Promise</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonal_Shah_%28economist%29">Sonal Shah</a>, who until recently led the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Social_Innovation_and_Civic_Participation">White House Office on Social Innovation and Civic Participation</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Khazei">Alan Khazei</a>, the cofounder of <a href="http://www.cityyear.org/default_ektid22295.aspx">City Year</a>, and <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/">Teach for America</a> founder and CEO, <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-organization/management-team">Wendy Kopp</a>.</p>

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. </p>
<p>PhoneGap&#8217;s open source platform allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications with HTML5 and JavaScript, and distribute these applications to a variety of platforms. To date, PhoneGap’s open source framework has been downloaded more than 600,000 times and thousands of applications have been built using PhoneGap on Android, iOS, BlackBerry and other operating systems. The company also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/30/html5-mobile-app-framework-phonegap-adds-facebook-connect-plugin/">just launched a PhoneGap Facebook Connect plugin</a> to allow HTML5 developers to simplify the log in process for their apps by allowing users to login with their Facebook credentials.</p>
<p>With PhoneGap, Adobe says it will offer will offer developers the choice of building native mobile apps using HTML5 and JavaScript with PhoneGap or using Adobe Air and Flash. As Danny Winokur, vice president and general manager, Platform, Adobe says of PhoneGap, &#8220;It’s a perfect complement to Adobe’s broad family of developer solutions, including Adobe AIR, and will allow us to continue to provide content publishers and developers with the best, cutting-edge solutions for creating innovative applications across platforms and devices.”</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close by the end of October 2011 and all of Nitobi&#8217;s employees, which are based in Canada, will join Adobe. </p>
<p>Considering the general trend of away from Flash-based mobile sites towards HTML5, it&#8217;s interesting to see Adobe push its HTML5 strategy. The company has been open recently about making more <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/21/adobes-new-html5-video-player-widget-its-kind-of-a-big-deal/">meaningful tools for HTML5 development</a>, so I&#8217;m sure we can expect more of the same from Adobe in the future. </p>
<p>Adobe also announced today that it <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111003006357/en/Adobe-Acquires-Web-Typography-Innovator-Typekit">acquired TypeKit</a>, which offers web designers a way to use a wide array of fonts on their websites. </p>

The ALMA telescope in Chile, otherwise known as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is a joint-venture project backed by Canada, Chile, the EU, Japan, Taiwan and the good ol' US of A. 

The ALMA telescope is not quite like the visible-light and infrared telescopes predominantly used toady. It uses a whole group of radio telescopes that are linked together, giving it the ability to see much longer wavelengths and thus, deliver unique photos of the universe. The purpose, quoth ALMA, is to "understand how galaxy collisions can trigger the birth of new stars." This may give us a better understanding of what the universe looked like in its infancy. ]]></description>

The ALMA telescope in Chile, otherwise known as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is a joint-venture project backed by Canada, Chile, the EU, Japan, Taiwan and the good ol&#8217; US of A. </p>
<p>The ALMA telescope is not quite like the visible-light and infrared telescopes predominantly used today. It uses a whole group of radio telescopes that are linked together, giving it the ability to see much longer wavelengths and thus, deliver unique photos of the universe. The purpose, quoth ALMA, is to &#8220;understand how galaxy collisions can trigger the birth of new stars.&#8221; This may give us a better understanding of what the universe looked like in its infancy. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jEyKMPe4WFmP9V61HVXsNCyHYpJw?docId=CNG.c7834de50dcbb3d3a3831e8bb861b7a7.931&amp;index=0">AFP</a>, the ALMA telescope is between 10 and 100 times more powerful than other similar instrumentation used elsewhere. That&#8217;s a wide range, so presumably the ALMA telescope is 10 times more powerful than the next-best telescope in its class, and 100 times more powerful than the worst. The very first images taken with ALMA were of the Antennae Galaxies, which reside about 70 million light years away in the Corvus constellation. </p>
<p>One of the scheduled projects that will incorporate the ALMA telescope includes work by David Wilner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who plans to hunt for the building blocks of solar systems. &#8220;We will use ALMA to image the &#8216;birth ring&#8217; of planetesimals that we believe orbits this young star,&#8221; said Wilner of a star 33 light years away called AU Microscopii, which is just one percent the age of the sun. &#8220;We hope to discover clumps in these dusty asteroid belts, which can be the markers of unseen planets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The location of the ALMA telescope is especially advantageous. In the Atacama desert in Chile, ALMA sits 16,400 ft. above sea-level, in an incredibly dry environment. These are ideal conditions for astronomy, although human survival could prove a bit tough. The European Extremely Large Telescope (love that name), which is set to begin operating in 2018, will also be in the Atacama desert. </p>

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/branchout-unlocks-the-linkedin-in-facebook/">Launched</a> in July 2010, BranchOut is sort of like a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/17/branchout-6-million/">LinkedIn for Facebook</a> because it allows you to network and find jobs through your friends on the social network. BranchOut&#8217;s Facebook app lets you search for companies and then shows you all your friends who either work there or know somebody who does. The application basically unlocks the massive amounts of career data about your social graph on the world&#8217;s largest social network.</p>
<p>On average, BranchOut, which is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/exclusive-branchout-raises-18m-for-facebook-focused-professional-network/">backed</a> by Accel, Norwest, Floodgate, and Redpoint, says a network of 300 Facebook friends translates to 30,000 professional connections. Recruiters, in turn, use BranchOut to promote jobs and source talent from a variety of employment sectors.</p>
<p>Via the partnership, job seekers on CareerBuilder can view jobs of interest and instantly see people in their expanded network, via BranchOut&#8217;s application, who they could contact for a potential referral or advice on getting an interview.</p>
<p>The companies say that the integration of BranchOut&#8217;s Facebook-focused technology is a perfect fit for job seekers. According to a 2011 CareerBuilder study in the U.S., 40 percent of workers who are looking for jobs said they research companies that interest them on Facebook before applying to a position; and one-in-five (21 percent) use Facebook to contact friends about job opportunities.</p>
<p>And other traditional online job platforms are definitely catching on this social trend when it comes to networking and job search. Fellow job search portal Monster recently <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/06/27/monster-beknown/">recently launched</a> a BranchOut-clone called BeKnown. The question is when LinkedIn will eventually  integrate Facebook into its professional social network.</p>

Subscribers will have access to candidate report cards, the Truth-O-Meter, fact-checking, and updates and scorecards from the Obameter and GOP Pledge-O-Meter, which track the campaign promises of President Barack Obama and Republican leaders, respectively.</p>
<p>According to Neil Brown, Times editor, the news service launch came at the request of editors from around the country. “We heard from many editors who love the Truth-O-Meter and would like to use it in their papers,” he said.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with PolitiFact jargon, the Truth-O-Meter provides fact-checking and report cards on the presidential candidates, pundits and members of Congress.</p>
<p>In addition to the above features, newspapers will also be able to syndicate articles that explore trends from the PolitiFact fact-checking findings.</p>
<p>PolitiFact, which launched in 2007 to fact-check the presidential campaign, has expanded into a full-featured web and mobile service in the years since, providing details about politicians and now, even talk shows hosts who discuss political matters. It notably won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009.</p>
<p>Syndication rates for newly-launched news service are not provided at this time, but the paper says that the lowest rates will be available prior to January 1st, 2012.</p>

Browsing over 3G has been supported since the first <a HREF="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Kindle">Kindle</a> and, to be fair, the experience was approximately abysmal. However, people love their free stuff and clearly this could be a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>In a <a HREF="http://techcrunch.com/tag/customer">customer forum</a>, an Amazon spokesperson wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Our new Kindle Touch 3G enables you to connect to the Kindle Store, download books and periodicals, and access Wikipedia &#8211; all over 3G or Wi-Fi. Experimental web browsing (outside of Wikipedia) on Kindle Touch 3G is only available over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Our Kindle Keyboard 3G will continue to offer experimental web browsing over 3G or Wi-Fi.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ll also note that they&#8217;re calling the old Kindle the &#8220;Kindle Keyboard.&#8221; Here&#8217;s hoping they don&#8217;t make a Kindle Keyboard for Kids.</p>

The company was created by former Tapulous employees, Maria Alegre, now Chartboost CEO, and Sean Fannan, CTO.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/01/tapulous-acquired-by-disney/">Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Tapulous</a>, the Chartboost founders decided to help start a platform to give other game publishers the same ability to maximize their distribution power, something that they felt was Tapulous&#8217; most valuable asset.</p>
<p>Previously Alegre worked a business and revenue associate at Tapulous. She later became head of Tapulous Labs Studio under Disney, where she was responsible for monetization and launch strategies, project management and game design. Fannan was a senior software engineer at Tapulous, where he built and managed the original server architecture, helped with scaling and coordinated the engineering of marketing deals with brands like Microsoft, Groupon, Disney and Fox.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chartboost.com/">Chartboost</a> is not an ad network, the company explains, it&#8217;s a technology platform. It provides free ad-serving technology for direct deals and cross-promotions via the Chartboost <a href="http://www.chartboost.com/support/sdk">SDK</a>. Instead of mediating direct-deals through an ad network, Chartboost publishers get a 100% revenue share on these deals.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fluik.jpg" rel="lightbox[430677]"></a></p>
<p>Included in the platform are white-labeled fullscreen interstitials, which publishers can use to promote their other titles. When they&#8217;re not being used internally, those spaces can be sold directly to other publishers and used to generate revenue. Also, says Chartboost, because the interstitials are promoting recommended games, they&#8217;re not perceived by end users as if they were ads.</p>
<p>Chartboost also offers in-depth metrics that allow publishers to track the direct deals and cross-promotions and manage their inventory accordingly. The analytics show impressions, clicks, installs, CPC, CPI and eCPM for each app. An API to track UDIDs is available, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/campaign_logic.jpg" rel="lightbox[430677]"></a></p>
<p>The company currently operates under a freemium model: the ad-server technology is free when used for direct deals or internal cross-promotion. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.chartboost.com/web/pricing-and-faq">opt-in ad network</a> offers revenue sharing with publishers, allowing them to maximize the unsold inventory that&#8217;s not used internally for cross-promotion or in direct deals. Those campaigns use metrics like Cost per Click (CPC) or Cost per Install (CPI) to determine pricing.</p>
<p>At launch, notable Chartboost publishers include TinyCo, Storm8, Pocket Gems, Gameview Studios, The Playforge, Funzio, OMGPOP, Com2us, Fluik Entertainment, Sunstorm Interactive, Ace Viral, Camigo Media, Neon Play, Lakoo, and Devsisters. Several of these are leading publishers in their own markets, and many are top 100 app makers.</p>
<p>As of August 31st, self-funded Chartboost says it&#8217;s a profitable company.</p>
<p>The platform is <a href="http://www.chartboost.com/">live on iOS</a> and will launch on Android soon.</p>

		<title>Groupon&#8217;s IPO Valuation Could End Up Being Less Than $6 Billion</title>

Now, institutional investors are wary.  A fund manager quoted in a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/groupon-s-stumbles-seen-paring-back-size-of-ipo-as-investor-interest-wanes.html">Bloomberg report</a> today suggests that Groupon might have to reduce its IPO valuation to between $3 billion and $5 billion in order to get it out the door.  That valuation would be below the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/03/did-groupon-just-spurn-googles-6-billion-in-favor-of-an-ipo/">$6 billion acquisition offer</a> Groupon turned down from Google last year.  Another fund manager says that Groupon may have to delay its IPO further or even pull it.

All of this goes to show that six months can be an eternity when it comes to the IPO window.  Since the days not so long ago when nobody blinked at its proposed $25 billion valuation, Groupon has taken a beating for some of its accounting practices, cash burn rate, and other financial details revealed in its SEC filings, which have been revised several times.  Last month, it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/groupon-loses-second-coo%C2%A0this-year-%E2%80%94-and-restates-revenue/">restated</a> the way it accounts for revenues to a more conservative set of numbers, and announced that it lost its second COO in less than a year.  And of course, the overall market's downward spiral isn't helping matters any.]]></description>

A fund manager quoted in a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/groupon-s-stumbles-seen-paring-back-size-of-ipo-as-investor-interest-wanes.html">Bloomberg report</a> today suggests that Groupon might have to reduce its IPO valuation to between $3 billion and $5 billion in order to get it out the door.  That valuation would be below the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/03/did-groupon-just-spurn-googles-6-billion-in-favor-of-an-ipo/">$6 billion acquisition offer</a> Groupon turned down from Google last year.  Another fund manager says that Groupon may have to delay its IPO further or even pull it.</p>
<p>All of this goes to show that six months can be an eternity when it comes to the IPO window.  Since the days not so long ago when nobody blinked at its proposed $25 billion valuation, Groupon has taken a beating for some of its accounting practices, cash burn rate, and other financial details revealed in its SEC filings, which have been revised several times.  Last month, it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/groupon-loses-second-coo%C2%A0this-year-%E2%80%94-and-restates-revenue/">restated</a> the way it accounts for revenues to a more conservative set of numbers, and announced that it lost its second COO in less than a year.  It is facing increased competition <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/03/google-offers-hits-miami/">from Google</a>, LivingSocial, Facebook, and hundreds of other smaller startups.  And of course, the overall stock market&#8217;s downward spiral isn&#8217;t helping matters any.</p>
<p>Delaying the IPO may not be a bad idea if Groupon can cut its costs (a big part of which is marketing and sales) to a more sustainable level.  Without slashing costs, it will find itself in a cash crunch.  The company spent <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000104746911008207/a2205238zs-1a.htm#dm79801_selected_consolidated_financial_and_other_data">$432 million</a> on marketing in the first 6 months of 2011 ($345 million of which was on online marketing to acquire new subscribers).  It had $225 million in cash.</p>
<p>Despite the IPO drama, Groupon still dominates the daily deal market and is introducing strong new products such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/27/groupon-loyalty-rewards/">Groupon Rewards</a>, which could deepen its relationships with local merchants.  If Groupon pulls its IPO and then files again in a year with profits and a much stronger financial condition, investors will have a better idea of how to value to the company.  </p>

BBM for&#8230; Android? </p>
<p>New leaked photos appear to show a beta version of BBM running on an unspecified (and clearly uncared for) Android device. The validity of these shots is questionable, as they were sent to <a href="http://www.t3.com/news/bbm-for-android-pictures-leak-ahead-of-official-rollout">T3</a> from an anonymous source and a leak of this kind would take about five minutes for a Photoshop noob to complete. However, they do add a little weight to <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/03/exclusive-blackberry-messenger-will-launch-on-android-and-ios/">ongoing rumors</a> that suggest RIM has plans to roll out its BlackBerry Messenger service on outside platforms, including Android and iOS. </p>
<p>Pictures aside, let&#8217;s just think about this purported plan for a hot second. </p>
<p>RIM won&#8217;t have trouble holding on to its enterprise customers, at least right now. The cost of switching platforms is just too high, and RIM security still can&#8217;t be beat. However, what made RIM an overnight (six-year) success was the fact that not only the enterprise, but teenagers and young people, were digging the BlackBerry. That, in a nutshell, comes down to messaging. </p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/bbm_onandroid_2.jpg" rel="lightbox[430557]"></a>If there&#8217;s ever been one thing that BlackBerrys do best for the general public, it would be messaging. Even with an iPhone, BBM has always been that one little exclusively BlackBerry feature that I&#8217;ve envied. But if BBM is available on iPhone and Android &mdash; as a <em>free</em> download, mind you &mdash; than RIM stands to gain nothing from it. </p>
<p>Android leads in market share, followed by iOS. According to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/11/gartner-android-os-sales-top-ios-rim-and-nokia/">the numbers</a>, we&#8217;re not looking at a mass exodus of Android loyalists or Apple fanboys anytime soon. BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry phones sales, on the other hand, are bleeding. People are already abandoning ship for greener, Android-flavored pastures. So what does RIM think will happen when one of its customers&#8217; favorite apps pops up on a better platform, with hundreds of hardware options? </p>
<p>In any case, the anonymous source of the photos says that the BBM for Android app is &#8220;in the final stages of testing&#8221; and &#8220;should be out by 2012.&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/screen_level1.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="screen_level1" title="screen_level1" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>It&#8217;s hard out there for a goat. You&#8217;re relegated to the background in many RPG games, chewing morosely while adventurers and soldiers light out for the darkened corners of the World, fighting dragons, the hellborn, and coprophagic demons. But now the goats are taking on the world&#8217;s vilest enemy &#8211; the Nazis &#8211; and they mean business.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jimwelch/nes-game-goats-vs-nazis?ref=email">GOATS vs NAZIS</a> is an indie NES game by Jim Welch that should take about a year to finish. Welch is asking for $14,000 to help feed and clothe him while he works on the game (where the heck does he live?) and he&#8217;s offering the game for free once he&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>The game is a top-down shooter with seven levels and a password progress system. You can eat enemy weapons to shoot them back at them and it includes some delightful chiptune songs including the <a HREF="http://www.morgoodr.com/media/gvn_boss_theme.mp3">boss theme</a>. The minimum pledge is $10 and that gets you the game ten days early along with a link to the soundtrack. </p>
<p>I think this is interesting for a few reasons. First, it&#8217;s a goofy take on such jingoistic titles like Bionic Commando (<a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3u_aiZDMyM&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">Spoiler Alert</a>) and Rush&#8217;n Attack and, more important, it&#8217;s actually built for the NES, forcing folks to rethink that platform&#8217;s current viability. Second, it&#8217;s a great way for Jim Welch to support his gaming habit and, since he&#8217;s giving the game away, it&#8217;s the only way he&#8217;ll see a penny from this while he builds it. Indie game devs need all the help they can get and this is a great way to get it.</p>
<p>Third, goats fighting Nazis is pretty bad-ass.</p>
<p>The project has hit about $200 now but I suspect it will get funded once people discover its magical storyline. It&#8217;s also a great example of how <a HREF="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> can keep independent art of all stripes alive.</p>

Offers, Google&#8217;s take on the Groupon model, initially <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/google-offers-cheap-knockoff/">launched</a> in June, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/google-offers-expands-to-austin-boston-d-c-denver-and-seattle/">expanded last month</a> into five additional cities: Austin, Boston, D.C., Denver and Seattle. Including its original test market of Portland, plus the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/google-offers-beta-expanded-from-portland-to-new-york-and-the-sf-bay-area/">Bay Area and New York City</a>, Google Offers now serves 13 areas. (New York and Bay Area markets are split up into smaller units, e.g. NYC Uptown, Midtown and Downtown).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-offers-now-available-in-miami.html">first two offers</a> in Miami include a restaurant deal at Joe&#8217;s Stone Crab, a Miami eatery since 1913, and a deal for Fandango movie tickets, at $5 each.</p>
<p>Like Groupon, Google Offers have limited windows in which you can purchase the coupon. But unlike Groupon, Google doesn&#8217;t have a tipping point for the deal. If only one person buys the deal, it&#8217;s active. Groupon&#8217;s return policy (indefinite) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/google-offers-cheap-knockoff/">is better than</a> Google Offers (60 days), as is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/google-offers-cheap-knockoff/">its customer support</a> (a toll-free number vs. having to enter your phone number via a website and wait for a call back).</p>
<p>But while Groupon is more of a standalone deals entity, Google ties Offers into its other services, including its business listing and reviews provider <a href="http://www.google.com/places/">Google Places</a>, Android (via the Google Shopper mobile app) and even <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/">Google Wallet</a>, which enables Google to track the entire cycle surrounding customer behavior, from discovery to redemption to checkout.</p>
<p>Google Offers are available <a href="http://www.google.com/offers">online</a>, or via Google Shopper app for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.shopper">Android</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-shopper/id416091721?mt=8">iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>The series C investment brings Axcient&#8217;s total funding to $33.5 million, and SaaS veteran and Scale Ventures Managing Director Rory O&#8217;Driscoll will be joining the startup&#8217;s board of directors as part of the investment. O&#8217;Driscoll also sits on the boards of companies like JasperSoft, Lumension Security, mBlox, Omniture, Picolight, ScanSafe and Vantage Media.</p>
<p>The company will be using its latest infusion of capital to triple the size of its marketing and sales team, roll out its services internationally, and grow its staff of 80 to 120+ over the next six months.</p>
<p>Today, small businesses looking to protect, back up, and optimize their most valuable asset, their data, often have to work with three or four different hardware and software solutions, combining services like Symantec BackupExec with tape or NAS or other online backup services and local hardware solutions. Cobbling these different solutions together to achieve maximum protection, backup, deduplication, and disaster recovery is a pain in the ass. Especially for how fundamental these services are to small businesses. One day without email or access to core parts of their network can be crippling to a young startup.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, the Mountain View-based startup is attempting to bring these core data protection and recovery solutions to SMBs &#8212; for a reasonable price. And while it&#8217;s still paving its road ahead in a crowded space, the startup is beginning to see some real traction. Today, 2,000 SMBs are using Axcient to protect their data, from small dental practices and sole-practitioner law firms to 4,000-employee, multi-location AV companies and VCs on Sand Hill Road. The startup has seen over 30 percent quarter-over-quarter monthly recurring revenue growth in 2011 and by the end of this year will be managing two billion customer files and over 100,000 customer laptops and servers. </p>
<p>This year, the startup has also added 1,000 partners in North America, including a strategic partnership with HP, as well as adding enhancements to its platform, including remote monitoring and management platforms and professional service automation tools. </p>
<p>Like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/14/what-cloud-nimble-grabs-25-million-for-storage-and-backup-boxes/">Nimble Storage, which we wrote about back in July</a>, for example, Axcient is attempting to make it appallingly easy for SMBs, which may not be able to afford IT teams or install a hive of servers, to combine storage, backup and disaster-recovery into a single solution. To do so, Axcient sends businesses a small device (typically about the size of a desktop hard drive), which they can set up in as little as 5 minutes and self-connects to Axcient&#8217;s cloud as well as the SMB&#8217;s network or Amazon hosting service.</p>
<p>With local, on-site hardware that can effectively use local network speeds with the added benefit of the creation of a secure tunnel to Axcient&#8217;s cloud, the startup has basically enabled SMBs to take advantage of a SaaS-based hybrid cloud model which works for companies with 250GBs of data or 20 terabytes. And the cost to the end user is $100 a month, with pricing going up somewhat for customers with larger data needs. Pretty affordable considering.</p>
<p>Axcient&#8217;s value proposition, then, is clear: For a relatively affordable price, the startup offers an all-in-one solution that supports all of your company&#8217;s different OSes, like Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux, as well support for its critical applications, like Exchange Server, SQL server &#8212; on all your different devices, like laptops, desktops, servers, etc. And it runs in the background of your system and can be accessed remotely &#8212; via your browser. </p>

Wildfire had helped advise Facebook on the development of the new Insights system, so it was prepared to provide the new data to its clients via its own suite as soon as it became available.</p>
<p>However, the Wildfire suite offers some additional features beyond the new Facebook Insights, including the ability to track and aggregate Insights across multiple fan pages, for example.</p>
<p>Facebook launched its new fan page metrics and a new ad social ad format at New York&#8217;s <a href="http://www.advertisingweek.com/">Advertising Week</a> event on Monday. The new ad format (dubbed &#8220;Expanded Premium Ad&#8221;) expands upon the previous &#8220;social ad&#8221; which showed which of your friends like a page, and provides a way for users to like and comment on the ad itself. The new ad format is larger, as it displays which friends have liked the fan page above the ad itself, with the comment box below.</p>
<p>The other major Facebook announcement from Ad Week, though, revolved around the update to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=914">Insights</a>, Facebook&#8217;s analytics dashboard for fan page owners. The dashboard now lists the total number of fans, total likes and a new &#8220;Friends of Fans&#8221; metric, which shows many people can be reached through a page&#8217;s post and more. It also shows how people ended up on the fan page, whether through an ad, a friend&#8217;s post, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Wildfire takes some of the new data points from Facebook, called &#8220;Friends of Fans,&#8221; &#8220;Engaged Users,&#8221; and &#8220;People Talking About This&#8221; and pulls them into its own analytics suite.</p>
<p>Engaged users, explains Wildfire, include anyone who responds positively by consuming content (watching a video, clicking a link, etc.), liking a post, commenting on it, or taking other actions. Some of these users will comment on the post, which brings it into their friends&#8217; News Feed, creating a discussion. These people are wrapped up in the new &#8220;People Talking About This&#8221; metric. The audience they connect with indicates the &#8220;Viral Reach&#8221; of that post.</p>
<p>In addition, the new &#8220;Friends of Fans&#8221; data shows the potential audience for any Facebook Page post.</p>
<p>In Wildfire&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com/" target="_blank">Social Marketing Suite</a>, brands with multiple fan pages can view Facebook Insights from all their pages in aggregate, including performance data, engagement, and analytics. Clients can then drill down into the pages to see the individual data points.</p>
<p>More information about the updated Suite is available on <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com">www.wildfireapp.com</a>.</p>

<p>Apple is rather tardy releasing this latest iPhone, missing its traditional summer launch date by a good two months. However, if the rumor mills are to be believed, there, the new iPhone will be very similar to the old iPhone &#8211; except where it isn&#8217;t. We compiled all of the rumors here along with stating the viability for each. Some are wide-eyed, others are realistic, while some are pure fanboy fantasy.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>The iPhone 4S Will Be A Less Expensive iPhone</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Numerous leaked SKU line ups with <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5845797/gizmodo-exclusive-looks-like-there-will-be-a-cheaper-iphone-4-made-in-brazil">iPhone prototypes</a> that are made of just plastic rather than glass and aluminum found in Brazil.</li>
<li>Apple would completely disrupt Android and Windows Phone 7 by selling a new iPhone at $100 or less.</li>
<li>The iPhone 4 still packs enough computing power for most users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsubstantiated leaks cannot be trusted</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: The stars just seem aligned for this one. The iPhone 4 is still a hot phone despite being over 15 months old. Apple just needs to repackage the current hardware into a less expensive body to completely demolish the competition.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>Redesigned, thinner iPhone 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Countless thinner cases have leaked over the previous months all purportedly&nbsp;built for the next iPhone.</li>
<li>Every successive iPhone has been thinner than the previous.</li>
<li>Apple likes to keep design cues constant between products and so the next iPhone will look similar to the iPad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>None, it&#8217;s a pretty solid claim</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Apple has never released a product thicker than the previous model and won&#8217;t start with the next iPhone.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Larger screen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The iPhone 4&#8242;s 3.5-inch screen is tiny compared to recent superphones from Motorola, Samsung, and LG.</li>
<li>Leaked cases signal that the next iPhone will be physically longer and wider. A larger screen is logical if the size of the iPhone is increasing.</li>
<li>Our own research has shown that a larger screen is &#8220;likely.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger screen could mess with apps designed for the smaller screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Apple cannot ignore the current popular trend of larger screen sizes. As long as the phone is thinner, a larger screen will not make the phone feel any bigger.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>Edge-to-edge glass</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple has always pushed the limit with its LCD&nbsp;implementation.</li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/16/rumor-iphone-5-to-sport-edge-to-edge-display/">Edge-to-edge glass</a> would give Apple something to&nbsp;tout over just using a larger screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely higher manufacturing cost, which would cut into the profit margin</li>
<li>Could lead to more broken screens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Not likely just yet. Apple pushes the limit but only as far as its financially viable.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>NFC Chip</strong><br />
<strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>NFC is the next big thing and already a feature on leading Android handsets</li>
<li>An NFC-equipped iPhone would further the advancement of mobile payments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current NFC radios are separate microchips and not&nbsp;integrated&nbsp;into a unified communication chip, which requires PCB real estate and extra battery power</li>
<li>Apple could be waiting until the payment companies make a lucrative offer <em>to them</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Apple tends to incorporate non-proprietary tech only after its viability is proven. So that&#8217;s a &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>Dual-core A5 CPU</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple tends to include a faster CPU with each iPhone release</li>
<li>iOS 5 will likely benefit from a faster, dual-core CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More powerful CPUs tend to decrease battery life</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: It&#8217;s very likely the next major iPhone will have the A5 CPU. However, Apple might stick with the A4 for a mid-model refresh like the rumored iPhone 4S</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>New home button</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaked cases and bezels show an&nbsp;elongated&nbsp;opening/button</li>
<li>Touch-sensitive bezels allows for new controls, multitouch gestures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely changes Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Keep It Simple, Stupid&#8221; design</li>
<li>Could break current apps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Don&#8217;t start designing your next Kickstarter iPhone case project around this rumor. Apple will likely stick with its traditional home button.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>8MP camera</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MP count has increased with every new iPhone release</li>
<li>An 8MP photo <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/the-mystery-of-the-8mp-iphone-4-sushi-picture/">previously appeared</a> with iPhone 5 metadata</li>
<li>Megapixel counts are unfortunately a&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;point between different phones</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher megapixel counts does not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;improve picture quality. Apple knows this. Hopefully.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: Camera sensors are constantly shrinking in size while increasing in MP count. Expect a higher count sensor but not necessarily an 8MP version.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>CDMA/GSM dual-mode radio</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The next iPhone <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/22/iphone-5-dual-mode-cdma-gsm/">will use&nbsp;Qualcomm Gobi Baseband</a> and run on both GSM and CDMA networks</li>
<li>Dual-mode phones have shown up in developer&#8217;s&nbsp;usage&nbsp;stats</li>
<li>Would allow Apple to makes/sell just one version, decreasing manufacturing costs</li>
<li>Allow Apple to sell a completely unlocked iPhone. Buy one from the Apple Store and&nbsp;activate&nbsp;it however you want</li>
<li>Carrier independence is a huge selling point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-mode mobile radios are still very rare</li>
<li>R&amp;D cost could make it financially&nbsp;unfeasible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: It&#8217;s hard to say. The upsides are huge for both Apple and consumers, but dual-mode radios are not widely used. Apple tends to use highly-available and therefore, high margin components.</p>
<hr />
<br />
<strong>Extensive voice controls</strong><br />
<strong>Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The next iPhone <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/26/the-new-iphone/">will have powerful voice controls</a> built by Siri called Assistant, which Apple <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-siri-200-million/">bought last year for $200m</a></li>
<li>The voice controls would outclass Android&#8217;s with more natural navigation paths</li>
<li>These function would need beefy hardware like the rumored A5 CPU, which creates an up-sell point for iPhone 4 owners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>None, really. Seems like a logical step for iOS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong>: It&#8217;s hard to predict future iOS features, but more beefy voice controls are probably on the road map.</p>
