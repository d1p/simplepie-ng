For the past decade this mark has hovered around 70 percent and has been higher than the level of trust in state government for each year.Does your community conduct similar polls to determine the level of trust among citizens of their OWN local government? If so, what have been some of the most interesting results?A story on the Gallup poll can be accessed via the link below:http://www.gallup.com/poll/149888/Local-State-Governments-Retain-Positive-Ratings.aspx?ref=image&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ICMA-KNQuestions/~4/l9V077a4bw4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2011 10:51:12 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/kn/Question/21390/Poll_Shows_Voters_Trust_Local_Government</feedburner:origLink></item><item><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ICMA-KNQuestions/~3/swvVibg0nU0/Asset_Management</link><author>sklinken@vbgov.com</author><title>Asset Management</title><description>I had posted a query a couple of days ago.
