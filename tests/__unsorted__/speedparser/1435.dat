As part of my upcoming talk, I asked on twitter for editor screenshots. The sample size was quite small (22) and its biased towards people I know (so heavy python influence). Here are some fun graphs anyhow. I'm actually quite surprised that Gedit made such a strong appearance and that Eclipse didn't. Its worth noting here that Textmate can't support split pane viewing. Screenshots from: Rich Leland: screenshot Alex Gaynor: screenshot @Igorgue screenshot Greg Newman: screenshot @bkmontgomery: screenshot Doug Hellmann: screenshot Joseph Kocherhans: screenshot Brett Hoerner: screenshot Ryszard Szopa: screenshot Beshr Kayali: screenshot Carl Meyer: screenshot Chris Price: screenshot @ayaz_khan: ...

I've setup a neat little one-page website using the Bottle micro-framework. The general idea of the site is you paste in a URL or string, and it will make a guess as to what encoding it uses. The heavy lifting of this web app is done by Mark Pilgrim's Universal Encoding Detector. The impetus for this, was I had strings stored in a latin-1 database, but had no clue what they meant, what encoding they were in, or anything of the sort. The final resolution to my particular issue was searching for the character codes and finding them in various ...

For those of you who keep your models in a subdirectory, you may have noticed that you can't properly load fixtures. This is because Django checks for the location of your models file to determine your app directory. To fix this, move your models directory to something like modeldir and create a models.py which imports the models from inside. Before: myapp |__ views.py |__ __init__.py |__ models/ |____ __init__.py |____ mymodel1.py |____ mymodel2.py After: myapp |__ views.py |__ __init__.py |__ modeldir/ |____ __init__.py |____ mymodel1.py |____ mymodel2.py |__ models.py Where the contents of models.py is: from myapp.modeldir.mymodel1 import * from ...

At work, we tend to have several people working on a project at once. When its time to deploy, we deploy to several servers at once. One pain point that we've come across is the ability to manage all of the settings files for these servers. My fix for it is here. The main piece of this is centered around the HOSTMAP dict. It maps a role to a hostname. Roles as we currently have them defined are based on their locations. Staging servers have a specific "recipe", local development has a different one. I could also see these being ...

A few weeks back, I had my Google account disabled. If you're anything like me, your first reaction is a lackadaisical, "That sucks." Then the realization of what that really means starts to creep in to your gut, making you nauseous. No more email. No more iGoogle homepage. No more feed reader. Next year's vacation spots you had mapped out in a comparison chart on Google Docs? Yep, those are gone too. More Nausea. This was a window into what I was feeling on July 13th when my Google account was suspended. I made a few shouts on Twitter [1][2][3], ...

So I just used tipjoy for the first time. A few thoughts. I like that they allow me to pay people without first having to dole out my credit card. This encourages me to use the service without having to pull my card out each time. I think this could lead to more (compulsive) spending. I don't like that their "cash-out" system was down. I like that they immediately followed me on twitter. It seems like a legitimate way to interact with customers when they link their twitter accounts. I like that they didn't require I input an email. I ...

Just a quick tidbit for anyone googling like I have been all morning: If you're attempting to pipe a command in a buildbot script, you need to issue it as a single string, not a list of strings. By using a single string, buildbot uses a shell, otherwise it doesn't. The &amp;gt; necessary for output redirection is a shell thing, which will only work in this method. To recap: f1.addStep(ShellCommand(command=['/home/www/bin/django', 'build_solr_schema', '&amp;gt;', '/etc/solr/conf/schema.xml'], description=['building', 'schema'], descriptionDone=['schema','built'])) becomes: f1.addStep(ShellCommand(command="/home/www/bin/django build_solr_schema &amp;gt; /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml", description=['building', 'schema'], descriptionDone=['schema','built']))

While building pyvcs and django-vcs over 4th of July weekend with Alex Gaynor [ announcement ], there were a few interesting lessons learned, mostly revolving around how setuptools works. As Jacob mentions in his post on buildout, you mostly have to cobble together the internals of setuptools from other setups. This works well at about 90% of the case. There are a few gotchas, however. find_packages('directory') will look under directory for a list of python modules to install. For our applications, we actually just wanted find_packages() You can't easily specify multiple authors for a project. We settled on author = ...

Database Views will make their appearance in the upcoming Django 1.1 release. Having used them for my latest project, there are a few gotchas when it comes to using them. In our project, we were using South for our database migrations. To ensure our database views were created, we added them to a south migration using db.execute. This worked very well for 90% of our usecase. The biggest hurdle for this ended up being testing. When syncdb runs, your unmanaged models (ie: database views) aren't generated. There were a few options available to us at this point. Provide a replacement ...
