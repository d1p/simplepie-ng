For ages, fans of the Liz Earle range (including me) have been pestering her for a tinted product of some sorts, and it’s finally happened with the launch of Sheer Skin Tint. Well…nearly…it’s not actually available to buy yet, but I’ve no doubt it’ll be fab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Complete this form to be one of the first to hear more about their new offering… word on the street is it’s due to drop mid-September.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

My pick of the bunch is L’oreal Professional’s Silver Shampoo. I’ve known about it for ages, but should have tried it much much earlier (thank you Ruth for pestering me to get it). It’s technically for grey and white hair, but is great for taking any brassiness away from highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using this in combination with L’oreal Professional’s Shine Blonde Conditioner which as well as brightening, also repairs and softens all shades of blonde. I adore the gorgeous just-left-the-salon smell that lingers throughout the day with this lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Friday treat I’ve just ordered Redken’s Blonde Glam Colour Enhancer. This is great for refreshing colour in between appointments. I use it as a treatment and leave it in for 10-15 minutes. You can choose which treatment is best for you – Perfect Platinum for ultra-pale to light blonde hair or highlights, or Rich Vanilla for warm blondes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://lip-goss.tumblr.com/post/9585106902</link><guid>http://lip-goss.tumblr.com/post/9585106902</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2011 14:43:48 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title>Cheeky</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I adore cheek products – creams, powders, highlighters, illuminators – you name it, I’ve got it. One of the most iconic cheek lovelies is of course Benefit’s Benetint - there aren’t many brands that haven’t got some sort of liquid lip and cheek stain in their range these days.  When they brought out Posietint I was over the moon – the prettiest pink, and a newer thicker formula that’s so easy to blend. On your lips it’s a softer colour than Benetint, and is buildable so you can up the glam as you please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I thought things couldn’t get any better….then Cha Cha hit the shelves. It’s Posietint, but in a lush peachy mango colour. I have a passion for all things coral, and this is just to die for.  It looks great with a tan, and adds a summery, almost tropical feel to your make-up. Again, fabulous to blend, and leaves a lovely glow on your cheeks. Dab a little on your lips and top with a clear balm or gloss and you’re good to go. In fact, a bottle of Cha Cha, tinted moisturiser and mascara and there’s your holiday make-up kit sorted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://lip-goss.tumblr.com/post/7620914801</link><guid>http://lip-goss.tumblr.com/post/7620914801</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2011 20:26:41 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title>Long Ambitions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ever since my request for a Dannii left me looking more like Joey Essex than a Minogue, I’ve been on a mission to grow my hair, and fast. That was 6th March 2010 (firmly set in my memory for also being my first wedding anniversary – brilliant day that turned out to be). It’s getting there, and I can now rock a top knot minus Kirby grips as I keep pointing out to anyone who’ll listen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my quest I’ve learnt a few tips – lots of protein, especially first thing in the morning. Omlettes and scrambled eggs are quick and easy, and also stop mid-morning snacking. It’s also completely justified my five chickens. Folic Acid is a good supplement (check with your doctor first), and strengthens nails to boot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Product-wise I love LA Science Follicle Stimulating Shampoo. It’s suitable for everyday use, and as well as being really conditioning, it has an active peptide complex to nurture your hair. The LA Science range also includes a Volumising Lash Treatment – I’ve just ordered mine, and if it’s as good as the shampoo I’m sure I’ll be raving about it here in approximately 3-8 weeks once I’m sporting Bambi style lashes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve already talked about my love of oils for the face and body, and they’re no less fabulous for your hair. MOROCCANOIL has been a massive hit. The key product in the range is the original oil treatment – it smells divine and conditions and strengthens your locks with the added bonus of reducing drying time. And it delivers – I’ve just switched to the Light Treatment for blonde or fine hair and I really notice a difference when I haven’t used it. Colour can leave hair frazzled but this has been the perfect post-highlight treatment reducing the risk of any bleach related breakages.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most are just over £2, with the Cleanse and Detox tea packs still coming in at under a fiver. The Cleanse tea is a lovely skin purifying tea of nettle, peppermint, fennel and aloe vera. I get a real glow after sipping on a few mugs of this for a couple of days, and it’s a great way of upping your water intake. Take a look at the Pukka website for their full range of teas and so much more – it’s firmly in my internet faves…&lt;/p&gt;

Part of their Sleep range, &lt;span class="description"&gt;Moroccan cedrus tree oil and Bulgarian lavender oil are the key ingredients promoting relaxation, and it really does work. The smell isn’t overpowering, and you only need a couple of pumps (it’s a small portable bottle), massaged into your temples in circular motions to help you get to, and stay asleep. When I heard my sister was leaving Molton Brown, this is the product I wanted to make sure I was stocked up on (bye bye discount). At £18.50 it’s a treat, but I’ll still be buying it half off or not!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a great base for make-up, but I’ve also taken to using it from the neck downwards. At about £17 for 30 ml, mixed with Kiehl’s Creme de Corps it’s an affordable and really effective body boost. My skin has a lovely glow when I use it, and it helps maintain my St Tropez. The potent mix of pure oils smell divine - just add a fluffy dressing gown for a home spa feel.&lt;/p&gt;

My skin saviours are always good old Special Cleansing Gel, Ultra Calming Cleanser, Medibac Overnight Clearing Gel, Skin Soothing Booster and Skin Smoothing Cream. I’m a massive Liz Earle and Decleor fan, but sometimes only Dermalogica will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauty Flash offers free next day delivery if you order by a certain time, and they really are the cheapest place I’ve found for Dermalogica. But the best bit is the samples - wow. You can coose two Dermalogica samples for every product you purchase, but when my package arrived, I’d been sent absolutely loads. I was actually considering sending a thank you card to the lovely people! Massive bonus - my overnight bag is now topped up full of lovely samples ready to make my next stint of working away just that little bit more bearable…&lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve heard of Graze snack boxes which are delivered to your door weekly, this is the same, but with products! For £10 a month (plus p&amp;p), GlossyBox sends you a selection of handpicked high-end luxury product miniatures. It’s a great way to try out new products, and if you find something you love, go and invest in the full size knowing it’s money well spent. If you want to, you can earn GlossyDots by providing product feedback, build up your dots and redeem them for free boxes. Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;
