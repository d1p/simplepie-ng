No family history, no risk factors. “Maybe I should do this every two years.” Four days later a phone call from a cheerful voice saying I needed to return for higher resolution images. “But it’s probably nothing,” she said.  More smashed flat pictures taken, more waiting. Then the doctor came in with his summary. “It’s not the worst, it’s not the best. We need to do a biopsy.”</p>
<p>My husband and I gave thanks and moved ahead into the unknown. Scheduling proved a challenge, but I wanted this over with so I could move on with my life. I took the first available slot, the 18<sup>th</sup>.  We were out of town when the next phone call came.  I had just lifted my fork with my first bite of breakfast when I saw the hospital number on my cell.  Anxious pleasantries exchanged; then the bomb fell with three words I did not understand ending with an unmistakable fourth. Carcinoma.  Appetite gone, shock filled my stomach instead.</p>
<p>In the Providence of God our days were so full I could not sink into self-absorption easily. The wedding of a delightful young woman, her parents our lifelong friends, Easter Sunday joys, and a tornado that ripped through our neighborhood on Monday night the 25<sup>th </sup>kept my eyes outward.  Our yard, fences, deck, and porch were buried and broken under the branches and trunks of thirty trees.  Of five entrances to our house only one was not blocked.  We were elated to be alive, not fearing the possibility of death.</p>
<p>Four days later I was under the knife due to the great kindness of a surgeon friend who reserved me a time slot on his surgery schedule before he left on vacation.  And then finally a phone call with good news.  Cancer cells are gone and the margins were clear.  “Go on with your life,” which for us was a long planned first ever trip to Israel, “and we’ll talk more when you get back.”</p>
<p>Early June found us back at the medical complex.  Recovery good.  Prognosis good.  “But let’s look at radiation to be sure no stray cells remain.”  Radiation is every day for 33 days.  That’s six weeks and 3 days.  And it needed to begin now, not this fall, not in January when it appeared more convenient.  Another decision.  Another adjustment of life to the unexpected.</p>
<p>This time I did not give thanks.  Instead I chose to open my hands and receive this interruption, this unforeseen plan, this path as a gift.  All I had scheduled had to be cancelled so that all my days could revolve around daily trips to the radiation therapy facility.  Another kind of numbness set in.  Cancer is an equalizer.  Sitting with other women in a waiting area, all shrouded in ugly shapeless gowns, clears the lenses.  Who are they? Who am I?  What is God up to?</p>
<p>After the first ten sessions I found a rhythm to my daily drive to the city.  Walking into the doors with cancer radiation therapy in block letters at eye level ceased to feel like an assault.  It wasn’t a time to be endured until normal returned.  “More than conquerors” described me now.  This new normal was good.  Incomprehensibly it was becoming a gift.</p>
<p>An older woman was in the ugly gown room when I returned from my daily dose one day. I had noticed her several times walking slowly, cautiously across the parking lot with a man always holding her hand.  He seemed so attentive to her, so unencumbered by her slow pace on steaming asphalt.  Was he a son or her husband?  When I asked, this one-breasted woman, aged by her 20 years of battling cancer, spoke gratefully of a husband’s tender love.  Reverence. Patience. Image of the Father’s tender care for those He loves.  A gift to her.  A gift to me.</p>
<p>The days of my gift gained speed.  Then the last week dawned.  Anticipating the arrival of all our children and grandchildren on the day after my last treatment kept me busy with grocery shopping and cooking and organizing for the arrival of the 27.  Unexpectedly I was surprised by two days of sadness.  How could I be mourning the end of protons and neurons invading my body?  Impossible.</p>
<p>Angie and Deanna walked in after giving me my final daily dose on Friday, one ringing a little bell, the other bringing a photocopied graduation certificate.  Silly little ceremony on the surface, but surprisingly meaningful to me.  I hugged them both, grateful for their kindness to me day after day.  And instead of walking out jubilant I felt that sadness again.</p>
<p>The gift had ended.  Overcomer was going back to normal and it felt odd.  Acknowledging the interruption as sacred welcomed the Holy One into my days of treatment.  I had learned the truth before that the trials God brings are always for my good and that He is more near than in the normal I love and worship.  But I forget so quickly.</p>
<p>It has been difficult to put all of this into words.  Explaining the mysteries of God’s work? Describing the unseen? My attempts seem feeble, shallow, child-like.  A rude interruption over 33 days became an experience of freedom and even joy as He lifted me above simply enduring to become an overcomer.  And I am grateful for the miracle of grace, grateful to belong to the Creator who still works wonders to behold.  Most of all I am grateful to have experienced the presence of Mystery Himself.</p>

In fact, he loves them so much that anytime he thinks he’s done something good, he thinks he deserves one. For example: If I tell Kellus to eat all of his vegetables, he&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;I eat all my vegetables&#8230;. and&#8230;?&#8221; then gives me this giant pause, as if I&#8217;m supposed to respond by saying &#8220;&#8230;and, you can get some cookies.&#8221; His eyebrows are raised, smile is wide and I could just see those wheels churning in his mind as he waits with anticipation for my response. I laugh every  single time.</p>
<p>He especially does this at bed time. He’ll come trotting in our bedroom and say, “Mommy,  go to sleep, wake up.. and..??”, while holding that long pause again. Same big eyes and stretched smile. I’d laugh again and tell him to march back to his bed. Well, this recently had me thinking. Four year olds don’t forget anything and it takes hardly anything to generate a habit with them. And so, I bow my head and take the blame.</p>
<p>Usually the day before a &#8220;big event&#8221; (i.e., trip to some place special, exciting new arts and craft project) I whisper in his ear, &#8220;God willing, go to sleep, wake up and then we&#8217;ll make bunny rabbit puppets tomorrow.&#8221; I admit, I first did this as a tactic to get him to bed. I had no idea it would turn into great anticipation for a special surprise every day!</p>
<p>So, I kept asking God, how can I teach Kellus the value of a new day even if we aren&#8217;t doing anything surprising? Then, I believe the Lord showed me how I can be the same way at times.</p>
<p>I have always been a very spontaneous person in life. When I was single and living on my own, I loved to do adventurous things sporadically&#8211; never routinely. One day I&#8217;d have a sudden urge to go hiking. The next day, it was dancing. I loved (still love) adventure. However, after I got married and had children, that type of adventure came very infrequently. These days, I get excited about &#8220;window shopping&#8221; just to get some air. However, when there is something planned, as most people do, I get really excited about it the night before&#8211;so much so that I can feel myself as giddy as Kellus gets right before he sleeps.</p>
<p>Even though there is nothing wrong with having great anticipation for great events, God is teaching me a few cool things from this. (I love it when he does this through my children.)</p>
<p><strong>1. Each day is a blessing.</strong> I first have to remember that! As a stay-at-home mom who doesn&#8217;t get out and experience &#8220;adventure&#8221; as much as I used to, I have to remember that right where I am is a blessing. My children are a blessing and it is a wonderful blessing to be able to stay home with them.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make each day count.</strong> I may not have the ability of doing big&#8211;which most times means costly&#8211;things, however every day we open our eyes is a blessing from the Lord. Psalm 118:24 says &#8220;This is the day which the Lord has made; Let us rejoice and be glad in it.&#8221; This means that regardless of how routine the days can get, we should rejoice that God graced us with it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Break the routine, sometimes</strong>. Schedules and routines aren&#8217;t bad. However, I seem to cringe at the thought of not having at least one thing go differently through the day. So, I try to do something unique for the kids as often as possible. This can be anything from a new (dollar store) activity book or a random trip to Pet Smart to look at the fish and hamsters. My children love that.</p>
<p>Every day that the Lord opens our eyes is just cause for us to rejoice. It&#8217;s a new beginning, a new try, and new opportunity to make each day a better day than yesterday. My prayer is for God to continue to teach me how to show my children to love and appreciate the smallest things in life. Although it is great to have anticipation for fun and exciting things, it&#8217;s even better to just appreciate God for his grace and thank him for whatever he has for us&#8211;one day at a time.</p>

<p>I bought this adorable calendar to keep my life in some semblance of order.  With 5 kids and all their activities, my calendar fills up super fast.  BUT I even spilled water all over my calendar so now my plans for the next 3 months are smeared and bumpy. It ain’t pretty, but it still works.</p>
<p>I know that for most of my foibles I have a good excuse – or maybe I should say I have about 20 good excuses.  I hate excuses.  I should be able to handle my life better.  Get it together girl!!!  Last week I got some news that threw me into a tailspin.  After a couple of depressing days, I woke up one morning and said, “No more!  This is my life and I’m gonna live it regardless of the difficulties, disappointments, and down-right awful stuff!  And I’m gonna smile doing it!’</p>
<p>The next day my basement flooded.</p>
<p>Let me just say that there has been water in my basement before which I&#8217;ve referred to as flooding.  This, my friends, was not that.  This was a “that is NOT a good smell wafting up from the basement” kinda flooding.  This was the “you can splash around the carpet” kinda flooding.  My preschoolers LOVED it.  My 5<sup>th</sup> grader was annoyed it interrupted his cartoons.  My high schoolers tried to cheer me up!  “Momma, you’ve wanted to get rid of stuff, remember?”  Yeah, but NOT today!!!  I had plans.  I had a to-do list – THIS was NOT on my to-do list!  This wasn’t even on my long-range list – you know that maybe-I’ll-get-it-done-when-they-all-go-to-college list.</p>
<p>After some serious help from some very kind people from my church, we managed to get things where there at least wasn’t the odor lingering upstairs.  I’m so blessed by friends willing to get messy with me.  The next day the professionals came and plugged in more things than I thought possible – fans, dehumidifiers and such.  Next week the contractor will come – that will mess up more of my daily plans, I’m sure.</p>
<p>There has been something every single week for the last 2 months – I have no more time for this foolishness!  I have stuff to do.  I will say that at this point, it’s kinda funny… kinda.</p>
<p>God just keeps reminding me that I’m not in control of things.  I’m learning to be content in the chaos – to be willing to go wherever the next minor or major crisis leads without too much drama.   I wish instead of being upset about water all over the place, I had taken the time to splash on the carpet with my kids.  Next time I will.</p>

<p>With absolute wonder and awe one young lady said, “That’s amazing…” and the look in her eye was what one might get when reading a farfetched, but much hoped for romantic novel.</p>
<p>Another young lady laughed and with a bit of a snide attitude let me know I was part of a dying breed and I was lucky.  I have consistently gotten one or the other aforementioned reactions, but in general the overarching reaction is one of wonder.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 24 hours contemplating what I have been experiencing and I am realizing my declaration of 25 years of marriage brings out something deep inside others.  It stirs their own hopes, disappointments, memories, and longings.</p>
<p>In a world where life hits us hard at every turn we all long for a soft spot with arms that hold, eyes that embrace, and a heart that loves us in spite of ourselves &#8211; forever.  God knew Adam needed that. He created Eve and it was very good.</p>
<p>But then there’s that sin thing that entered the garden… and us.</p>
<p>My marriage has been gloriously hard at times. I say gloriously, because if it had not been hard I wouldn’t have sought God to help me make it through the hard. The hard is a mighty tool in the Maker’s hand. The hard has caused me to allow Him to chisel away at the selfish parts of me.</p>
<p>My husband and I have worked through our marriage …  for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others – till death do us part. The struggle has proven our need for a Savior, made us both stronger, woven us together tighter and has allowed God’s glory to shine.</p>
<p>That’s what I want to say to the faces that look at me in wonder and say “25 years – no way?” One of the faces was that of a young woman who had been married for fourteen months and she asked me, “How in the world have you done it?” I replied, “My biggest piece of advice for you is to be completely selfless.” She looked into my eyes with a bit of a blank stare and I noticed an arch appeared in her eyebrow, her head cocked slightly to the side and a look of slight confusion drew across her fresh, unwrinkled, young face.</p>
<p>Oh how I wanted to pour truth into this young woman. Help her understand that marriage is not what the world, and inexperienced friends will whisper in her ear. It is not her opportunity to “fix” her husband and his many faults…but to love her husband unconditionally, and allow God through that process to reveal her own need for repair. To fully embrace loving her husband with wild abandon, to share daily life deeply with one another, while remaining totally committed, to remember their vows and hold fast to them.</p>
<p>We were not ready for that conversation yet&#8230; maybe God will provide opportunity for that in the future.</p>
<p>But you friend, need to hear that truth.</p>

<p>It was always this time of year that I’d hit Sam’s Club with a vengeance to finally be the mom whose school lunches were legend. When my kids were small, there was always some crazy mom up at the crack of dawn carving her kid’s bread into flowers, dinosaurs, and smiley faces.  (This, of course, was accompanied by a note with art to rival Picasso.) By middle-school, I just wasn’t hip enough to have discernment when I was in WalMart to know that “all the kids” were carrying Arctic Zone lunch bags. (I learned the hard way that you DON’T send notes in middle school. <em>Gasp!</em>) Now my girls are in high school and I still can’t compete with “Abbey’s mom’s” vegetable sandwiches complete with freshly shaved carrot relish.</p>
<p>It’s just that I’ve never been the kind of mom who woke at the crack of dawn with a song in my heart and a dinosaur shaped cookie cutter in my hand, eager to craft a lunch that might earn me a Mother-Of-The-Year trophy. On the occasional weekday that I was up before the sun, it was because one of the kids was barfing and the sheets needed to be changed. And when I went to put them in the washer, it was already occupied by towels that I forgot to take out a few days earlier. So, then I’d feel the need to soak the mildew-scented towels, and when I went to the kitchen to do that, I’d notice that the dishwasher needed unloaded. This would distract me from the towels and my sick child, inevitably resulting in a need to bring a bucket to clean up the floor, if ya know what I mean. (Oh for some of those vomit absorbent granules the schools use!) Early-bird for the day? Nope. My healthy child still barely made it to school on time and lunch would be a Lunchable I’d grabbed on the way out the door.</p>
<p>While all of this is a humorous dose of reality, I realized something a few years ago: God has equipped me to do <em>all</em> things through Christ. (Philippians 4:13) And, he wants everything I find to do with my hands to be done with all my might. (Ecclesiastes 9:10) So, that includes the stuff that’s not as natural for me as a mom, like packing lunches. I came to the conclusion that God wants even our kid’s lunches to glorify him.</p>
<p>I saw how simple it could be one day when I was at my best friends house in Nashville. I watched her pack her kid’s lunches at 10 o’clock at night and slip them into the fridge. (Pretty sure that when Kate and Grace are adults, they will find slightly soggy turkey sandwiches to be a favorite comfort food!) The next morning was so peaceful as she whipped those lunches out of the fridge a moment before she plopped her girls into her mini-van. Everyone was happy. There was some glory in the simplicity of their routine.</p>
<p>By the time I’d figured this out, my girls weren’t going to be trained to brown bag it with a turkey sandwich made the night before, so I needed a creative solution. The idea of packing the night before appealed to me. And, I <em>am</em> a great cook! I began to craft evening meals with next day’s lunch in mind. Thank God for Ziploc containers! My fridge is generally full of 4-8 options for my girls to grab as they head out the door and….THEY LOVE THEM! I have happily become knowns as “The Leftover Mom!” Not the trophy I was dreaming of, but I’ll take it!</p>
