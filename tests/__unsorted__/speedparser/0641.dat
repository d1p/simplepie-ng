    <title>Chilean Model of Social Security</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/cbigelow/chilean-model-of-social-security</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;America: Take Notes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of Chile has proven that through individual choice and privatization of public programs that economic freedom is achieved. The revolutionary privatization of Social Security in Chile has bulldozed big government and has allowed the economy and individual freedom to flourish. This country serves as a perfect model for America to look to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile transitioned from an unsustainable public pensions program to an incredibly successful private program by ushering new workers into it. The new system is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-ja-jp.html&quot;&gt;based&lt;/a&gt; on individual decision making. Entering into the work force, workers were given a private pension fund that requires them to contribute 10 to 20 percent of their income. The amount put into the fund depends on the age the employee wants to retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At retirement, the private fund is transferred into an annuity with an insurance company. The individual is given the choice to decide what insurance company to work with and what plan best fits the circumstances. If the individual is not satisfied with the company or plan, they have the freedom to change companies. This also allows competition between insurance companies, which would lead to better service and greater returns over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile set up transitional rules for insurance companies to ensure safety. Due to the radical nature of the privatization, the government wanted to direct companies into safe investment agreements in order to prevent the loss of large sums of money. Risky investments increase the chances of system failure. “If the system had failed in the first years, we would never have been able to try it again,” said Jose Pinera, Chile’s minister of labor. However, these rules provided the roots for a continual, successful retirement system. As insurance companies continue to grow more secure, they will have more freedom to broaden investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who were already paying into the public system, they were given a choice to stay public or to enter the private system. The major cost created by the transition is the money Chile loses from the people switching to the private system. The cost was financed by the selling of state-owned enterprises that would provide for those who stayed on the public pension system. Due to the success of the privatization, around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=5981&quot;&gt;93 percent&lt;/a&gt; Chilean workers switched to the new program. The public pension program will be completely eliminated the day the last person in the system passes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system has had immensely positive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-ja-jp.html&quot;&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 30px&quot;&gt;•&amp;nbsp;It generated surpluses without raising taxes, inflation, or interest rates&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Old-age pensions are 40-50 percent higher than the public pension system&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Disability and survivor pensions are 70-100 percent higher than the public pension system&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Significant decreases in the payroll tax have contributed to an unemployment rate below 5%&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Savings rates have sky rocketed and have deepened investment&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Growth rates have more than doubled in the past 10 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a critical time when America’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np&quot;&gt;debt&lt;/a&gt; is upwards of $14.7 trillion and unfunded future &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalreview.com/exchequer/246159/our-debt-more-all-money-world&quot;&gt;liabilities&lt;/a&gt; are more than triple that number, isn’t this is the kind of growth and freedom we deserve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Monday Morning Football!  </title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/dspielman/monday-morning-football</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;So, what can football teach us about education reform? &amp;nbsp;I’d argue everything. &amp;nbsp;In a recent Wall Street Journal article former NFL great Fran Tarkenton asks, “what if the NFL played by teachers’ rules?” &amp;nbsp;Thinking about this hypothetical situation it would be interesting to ponder such a world. &amp;nbsp;Tarkenton writes, &lt;em&gt;“Imagine the National Football League in an alternate reality. &amp;nbsp;Each player’s salary is based on how long he’s been in the league. &amp;nbsp;It’s about tenure, not talent.”&lt;/em&gt; An NFL without pay based on talent, what could possibly go wrong? &lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;“The same scale is used for every player, no matter whether he’s an All-Pro quarterback or the last man on the roster. &amp;nbsp;For every year a player’s been in the NFL, he gets a bump in pay. &amp;nbsp;The only difference between Tom Brady and the worst player in the league is a few years of step increases.”&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp;Wait what!? You’re telling me Tom Brady is less valuable then a washed up, no name, special team’s player on the Bengals (sorry Cincinnati)? Well, if the NFL was run by teachers unions, then that’s essentially what would happen. &amp;nbsp;No matter how good you are you wouldn’t be rewarded. &amp;nbsp;Your performance wouldn’t matter! &amp;nbsp;Outside of the St. Louis Rams or Miami Dolphins very few people would approve of this happening to the NFL, but in Mr. Tarkenton’s alternative reality this would be the norm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;“Of course, a few wild-eyed reformers might suggest the whole system was broken and needed revamping to reward results, but the players union would refuse to budge and then demonize the reform advocates: “They hate football. &amp;nbsp;They hate the players. They hate the fans.” &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;In introducing this alternative reality for football Mr. Tarkenton shows just how out of bounds, (excuse the football reference) the education system is today. &amp;nbsp;How on earth do we expect our teachers to succeed when success isn’t rewarded? &amp;nbsp;Considering just how out of touch education unions are, it is good to know that people like Fran Tarkenton are looking out for the interests of those who matter most; our children. &amp;nbsp;So, next time when watching your favorite team (for full disclosure I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan) imagine an NFL ran by teachers unions, it might just shock you! (Remember the XFL?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204226204576601232986845102.html&quot; title=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204226204576601232986845102.html&quot;&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020422620457660123298684510...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Tea Party Group Casts National Debt as a Household Budget</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/tea-party-group-casts-national-debt-as-a-household</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://democracyandpower.org/wordpress/democracy-and-power/democracy-and-power-104&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy and Power:&amp;nbsp; 104 Government Debt – An Unpaid Tax Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The history of public debt is the very history of national power: how it has been won and how it has been lost. …&amp;nbsp; But never, outside periods of total war, has the debt of the world’s most powerful states grown so immense. Never has it so heavily threatened their political systems and standards of living. Public debt cannot keep growing without unleashing terrible catastrophes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacques Attali&lt;br /&gt; French Economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/27/tea-party-group-casts-national-debt-as-household-budget/?cmpid=cmty_email_Gigya_Tea_Party_Group_Casts_National_Debt_as_a_Household_Budget#ixzz1ZN8aFcryhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/27/tea-party-group-casts-national-debt-as-household-budget/?cmpid=cmty_email_Gigya_Tea_Party_Group_Casts_National_Debt_as_a_Household_Budget&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea Party Group Casts National Debt as a Household Budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gainesville, Florida Tea Party put the national deficit and debt in perspective when they compared the income and expenses to that of a family.&amp;nbsp; The following is their assessment as reported by &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;,,, a household with an average family income of $21,700. But that &quot;family&quot; spent nearly twice that -- $38,200 -- and has an existing credit card balance of a whopping $142,710.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, these are inexact findings.&amp;nbsp; However, they do expose the gross irresponsibility of many Congresses and Presidents.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let’s look at Presidents&#039; and Congressional reactions to those of an ordinary family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denial is a natural response.&amp;nbsp; However, for a family, the credit card company is going to cancel their account.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, denial is rampant and ongoing in government.&amp;nbsp; Presidents and Members of Congresses have long denied that debt was a problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the President and Congress are borrowing 40 cent on every dollar spent.&amp;nbsp; Unlike the family, government does not have a vigilant credit card company cancelling governmen&#039;s access to credit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the government issues more treasury bonds and the world continues to purchase them.&amp;nbsp; Incredibly, the world’s investors have more confidence in the United States than most other countries.&amp;nbsp; If we stay in denial and continue expanding the debt, at some point – nobody knows when, the world will stop buying our debt and a catastrophic economic collapse will occur – nationally and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, a family without credit and expenditure would have creditors harassing them for payments and, most likely, fear the bank would foreclose on their properties.&amp;nbsp; The family would be distraught, fearful and miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Congress fearful and miserable?&amp;nbsp; No, most Members are gleefully continuing to spend more money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is President Obama distraught?&amp;nbsp; Probably, but not because he is spending America into bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; He wants to spend more.&amp;nbsp; He is distraught because Americans are indicating they will not vote for him.&amp;nbsp; Why are Americans leaving Obama?&amp;nbsp; Could it be that Americans are fearful of government’s gigantic debt?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the stressed family must consider bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; Generally, bankruptcy allows the family relief from their crushing debt. The bankruptcy court requires the family to swear under oath that they had $142,710 in debt and they would make a list all their assets.&amp;nbsp; According to the bankruptcy code, the family is allowed to keep their essential assets and cash-out the remaining assets to distribute the money to creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no bankruptcy court for the federal government.&amp;nbsp; When governments fail to honor their debt, they default.&amp;nbsp; Presently, there is an acute concern that Greece may be forced into default.&amp;nbsp; European banks are over-extended in Greek bonds and the world’s investors are unnerved.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the Euro is devalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few hundred years, great empires have defaulted, which resulted in wars, civil wars, and economic chaos.&amp;nbsp; For the United States to default would be a total disaster – nationally and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the investors of the world are still purchasing United States treasury bonds.&amp;nbsp; However, what happens if the world no longer trusts the United States and refuses to buy our bonds?&amp;nbsp; Then, the United States will be face default and all the catastrophes associated with it.&amp;nbsp; [Read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/paul-ryan-country-cant-sustain-these-high-levels-o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Ryan: Country can&#039;t sustain these high levels of debt&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reducing our debt is absolutely necessary.&amp;nbsp; Our economy, democracy and the exceptional progress in commerce, science and art are endangered.&amp;nbsp; America’s political elites have willfully caused the debt and are now treacherously ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you remember how bankruptcy allowed the debtor-family to clear its debt by listing their debts and assets?&amp;nbsp; The United States government must do the same &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We must stop the denial.&amp;nbsp; We must stop the deliberate deceptions about the debt and be honest with the American people. Let&#039;s list our debts.&amp;nbsp; This is not trivial.&amp;nbsp; The government obfuscates and misleads Americans about the true debt.&amp;nbsp; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/when-pretending-fails-to-hide-bankruptcy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read: When Pretending Fails to Hide Bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;]&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Also, the United States government must list their assets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Just like a family going through bankruptcy, nonessential government assets should be sold and the money should be used to reduce our dangerous debt.&amp;nbsp; America has millions of acres of land and much like a family going through bankruptcy, the United States government must sell most their assets.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, Yellowstone Park doesn&#039;t need to go on the chopping block, but a large portion of the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service lands could be sold to help offset our debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is of the essence.&amp;nbsp; The President and Members of Congress must become honest and responsible stewards of America’s finances.&amp;nbsp; They must list the debts and assets, and reduce the debt immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Ask your Representatives to Cosponsor the Reducing the Size of the Federal Government through Attrition Act of 2011</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/mkibbe/key-vote-yes-on-the-reducing-the-size-of-the-feder</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear FreedomWorks member, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of our million-plus FreedomWorks members nationwide, I urge you to contact your representatives and ask them to cosponsor H.R.3029, the Reducing the Size of the Federal Government through Attrition Act of 2011. Introduced by Rep. Mulvaney (R-SC), the bill would reduce the total number of federal employees by 10 percent over a five year period. It would specifically allow only one federal employee to be hired to replace every three that retire or leave their job. This bill would help to reduce the bloated federal bureaucracy, save taxpayers money and increase competition by ending wasteful service contracts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total number of federal employees has skyrocketed to a total of more than 2 million workers. Since the beginning of the economic downturn in December of 2007, the federal government has added 230,000 new federal employees. President Obama’s 2012 budget proposes an increase of 15,000 federal workers. It is time to reverse the unsustainable growth of federal employees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reducing the Size of the Federal Government through Attrition Act of 2011 would save taxpayers approximately $139 billion. Cutting the federal workforce is a popular bipartisan effort. This plan has been championed by President Obama’s Fiscal Commission as well as thousands of Americans through the Majority Leader’s YouCut program. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With our national debt now $14.7 trillion, we must dramatically cut government spending. A step in the right direction would be to reduce the number of needless federal bureaucrats. I urge you to contact your representatives and urge them to cosponsor H.R. 3029, the Reducing the Size of the Federal Government through Attrition Act of 2011 today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Kibbe&lt;br /&gt;President and CEO &lt;br /&gt;FreedomWorks&lt;br /&gt;[Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/FederalWorkforceAttritionAct.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the PDF version of this letter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;te-attached-files-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=&quot;te-attached-files&quot; class=&quot;sticky-enabled&quot;&gt;

    <title> Green Agenda Destroys Jobs</title>

While that number is not as large as those generated by health care or education, the quality of these jobs are far higher. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Obama Administration “knows” the future is in green energy.&amp;nbsp; Oops... green energy has a cost problem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;One big problem lies in the cost per kilowatt, where wind is roughly twice as expensive and solar at least three times as expensive as electricity produced with natural gas. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now, where are jobs expanding in America?&amp;nbsp; Let&#039;s look to the energy regions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the new action is on the U.S. mainland, including the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming. Increasingly, there’s excitement about finds in long-challenged sections of the Midwest such as Ohio. The Utica shale formation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chk.com/Pages/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to an estimate by &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=chk&amp;amp;tab=searchtabquotesdark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chesapeake&lt;/a&gt; Energy, could be worth roughly a half trillion dollars and be, in the words of CEO &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/profile/aubrey-mcclendon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aubrey McClendon&lt;/a&gt;, “the biggest to hit Ohio, since maybe the plow.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, increased oil and gas production expands ancillary industries and manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy boom also has sparked a spate of new factory expansions, including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toledoblade.com/State/2011/04/19/650M-plant-to-transform-Youngstown.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$650 million new steel mill&lt;/a&gt; to make pipes for gas pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The bottom line is America needs to utilize its natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surest road to recovery does not lie in the chimera of “green jobs” or by magically harvesting riches from social networks. It’s in making America a more self-reliant and productive power. The new spate of energy in the Midwest and elsewhere in the country may be one way to do this if we have the will to take full advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Obama Administration’s relentless pursuit of “green energy” has prevented economic expansion and job growth.&amp;nbsp; Besides channeling enormous sums of money for solar panels, the Obama Administration uses regulations and tax laws to prohibit an intelligent use of fossil fuels.&amp;nbsp; Only the American voter will change this harmful policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>CPAC Florida Recap</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/jeboch/freedomworks-stronger-than-ever-in-florida</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week’s CPAC event in Orlando, attended by thousands of Florida conservatives, was a huge success for FreedomWorks and our supporters. More than 2,500 copies of our activist handbook, Rules for Patriots, were distributed at our exhibition booth, along with bumper magnets, brochures and handouts on the EPA Train Wreck. Several hundred attendees signed up to join the FreedomWorks team and hundreds more&amp;nbsp;who are already part of our growing grassroots network stopped by to say hello to Chairman Dick Armey and President Matt Kibbe.&lt;!--break --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;FLOAT: right&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; title=&quot;KibbeArmeyCPAC&quot; alt=&quot;KibbeArmeyCPAC&quot; src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/KibbeArmeyCPAC_0.JPG&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;Kosher Tea, FreedomWorks’ outreach program to the Jewish community was once again a hit with our members. Hundreds of t-shirts promoting Kosher Tea were given out to local activists, and requests to host events all over the state will keep FreedomWorks active in Florida all the way through the 2012 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of our new SuperPAC “FreedomWorks for America” took place at a Friday morning press conference and received positive coverage in local and national media outlets from the Miami Herald to The Hill and the New York Times. Later in the day, our members helped FreedomWorks-endorsed Senate candidate Adam Hasner win CPAC’s straw poll in a key victory that showed Hasner to be the frontrunner for next year’s Republican nomination. Reporting on the poll, the Washington Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/23/hasner-tops-times-poll-choice-face-nelson-2012/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Hasner “benefited from endorsements from the tea party organizing group FreedomWorks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most exciting part of the entire CPAC event took place across the street at the Denny’s restaurant during lunch, where 75 activists gathered for a field hearing of the Tea Party Debt Commission. Along with FreedomWorks budget expert Dean Clancy, the activists discussed America’s ballooning debt crisis and proposed fiscally conservative solutions. The Debt Commission is part of an ongoing effort by FreedomWorks and our supporters to offer serious policy solutions consistent with tea party principles on pressing national issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>The &#039;Great Full Debt Tour&#039;: Field Reports from the Tea Party Debt Commission</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/dean-clancy/the-great-full-debt-tour-2011-field-reports-with-p</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt commission road tour is in full swing. We&#039;ve taken to calling it the &quot;Great Full Debt Tour.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Field hearing (Salt Lake City, Utah):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first field hearing of the TPDC took place in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Thursday, September 1, 2011. Hundreds of local activists and interested citizens packed into the standing-room-only meeting at Noah&#039;s Conference Center in South Jordan, Utah.&amp;nbsp;Attendees also included a large number of local elected officials and aspiring candidates for office.&amp;nbsp;Participants lined up to offer numerous ideas for specific cuts and reforms. After introductions by local activist Dan McCay and FreedomWorks President and CEO Matt Kibbe, the audience heard a presentation on the budget crisis by Dean Clancy of FreedomWorks, who presented initial findings from the group&#039;s online budget poll (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teapartydebtcommission.com/&quot; title=&quot;www.TeaPartyDebtCommission.com&quot;&gt;www.TeaPartyDebtCommission.com&lt;/a&gt;), which allows voters to prioritize spending cuts. Members of the Utah Advisory Committee of the Tea Party Debt Commission sat at the dais, listening to budget-cutting suggestions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kim Coleman - Salt Lake 9-12, Utah Rising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Kirham - Utah Rising (Mr. Kirkham is also a national TPDC commissioner)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;D.J. Schanz – Austrian Economics Club of Utah, Campaign For Liberty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peter Cannon – Davis County 9-12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dan McCay – Utah FreedomWorks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jacqueline Smith – The S.T.A.R. Forum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Austin Linford – Republican Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kim Weis – Box Elder 9-12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Stoddard – Austrian Economics Club of Utah&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mia Love - Mayor, Saratoga Springs, Utah&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd field hearing (Orlando, Florida):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd field hearing of the TPDC took place on Friday, September 23, 2011, during the Florida CPAC convention in Orlando, FL. At the Denny&#039;s restaurant across from the Orange County Convention Center,&amp;nbsp;Rev. C. L. Bryant led the opening prayer, and then&amp;nbsp;FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe addressed the crowd on the importance of influencing Washington&#039;s budget and debt debates from the grassroots up. FreedomWorks legislative counsel and health care VP Dean Clancy walked the group through a presentation (see photos below). Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey discussed the TPDC in the context of the 2012 elections. The Commission heard many constructive ideas from the audience. For example, one audience member made a compelling case for devolving federal highway funding and responsibilities to the states. Another explained the massive challenges that Medicaid poses for Florida residents and taxpayers.&amp;nbsp;Several members of the Florida Advisory Committee to the Tea Party Debt Commission were present, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharon Calvert - Tampa Tea Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karen Jaroch - Tampa 9/12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Curtis&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karin Hoffman - DCworksforUS, South Florida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_field_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23_Dick_Armey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dick Armey at 2011-09-23 TPDC field hearing&quot; title=&quot;Dick Armey at 2011-09-23 TPDC field hearing&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_field_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23_Matt_Kibbe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matt Kibbe at TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; title=&quot;Matt Kibbe at TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; title=&quot;TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd field hearing (Ogden, Utah):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission&#039;s third hearing took place on Monday, September 26, 2011, in the Black Box Theater auditorium of the Weber County Public Library, Pleasant Valley Branch, in Ogden, Utah. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) spoke at the event and listened to audience comments, as did state Sen. Dan Liljenquist and other local elected officials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/IMAG0556.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (1)&quot; title=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (1)&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/IMAG0563.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (4)&quot; title=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (4)&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/IMAG0562.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (2)&quot; title=&quot;TPDC Ogden 2011-09-26 (2)&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;Tea Party Debt Commission main page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Three Texas Counties Opted Out of Social Security </title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/three-texas-counties-opted-out-of-social-security</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://democracyandpower.org/wordpress/democracy-and-power/democracy-and-power-106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy and Power 106:&amp;nbsp; A politician receives no financial gain for good policy or punishment for bad policy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong. – Thomas Sowell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903791504576587240912688176.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Texas Counties Opted Out of Social Security&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Merrill Mathews of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; showcases three counties in Texas that opted-out of Social Security by creating personal retirement accounts for county employees.&amp;nbsp; After 30 years, the county workers in these three counties:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;”…retire with more money and have better death and disability supplemental benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the federal Social Security system, which has gigantic unfunded liabilities, the three counties are solvent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;“And those three counties—unlike almost all others in the United States—face no long-term unfunded pension liabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With essentially the same contributions, the county workers’ will receive roughly twice the retirement income as compared to those in the federal system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these three counties, the money is saved and invested.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, in America’s federal system, the Social Security taxes are transferred immediately to current retirees, and when there were surpluses, politicians use the money for other government functions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Thus, America’s federal system has no money saved and because of fewer workers supporting retirees, America has enormous unfunded liabilities.&amp;nbsp; The difference is saving and investment growth versus the federal government&#039;s taxing, transferring and spending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas counties that chose private accounts used professional money managers competing for the opportunity to invest their money.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the employees are guaranteed a minimum rate of return.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, American workers have no choice to invest a portion of his or her Social Security tax.&amp;nbsp; Just the opposite.&amp;nbsp; Government imposes taxes and federal politicians determine how and when the benefits, if any, will be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Worse, the government implies there will be benefits at retirement.&amp;nbsp; However, future politicians will determine which Americans receive benefits and the age of eligibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A saving and investing system has enormous benefits to all Americans.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, twice the amount of money for retirement is good.&amp;nbsp; Equally important are saving and investing, which helps propel commerce and industry.&amp;nbsp; A nation of savers is more dependable and solvent than a tax, raid, and distribute system, which has proven to create enormous unfunded pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, seniors and people nearing retirement fear any change to the present system.&amp;nbsp; Deplorably, politicians pander to seniors and excoriate any mention of a save and invest program.&amp;nbsp; Thus, in a time of great need to increase saving and investing, the vast majority of America’s politicians are intentionally contriving against the necessary change.&amp;nbsp; Most politicians are silently saying, “I want to be elected and in power.&amp;nbsp; Good policy and expanding economic prosperity be damned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal accounts for retirement and medical needs are absolutely essential for personal freedom and a vibrant society.&amp;nbsp; America’s critical task is how to exit the corrupt political system and create personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Indiana Tea Party Groups Hold Statewide Convention</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/mduncan/indiana-tea-party-groups-hold-statewide-convention</link>
    <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/photo_361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tea Party Convention&quot; title=&quot;Tea Party Convention&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 24, FreedomWorks joined Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate and over 300 activists from local groups across Indiana for a Tea Party Convention in Greenfield to decide which candidate they would support in the 2012 U.S. Senate race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--break --&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “The movement believes strongly in a bottom-up rather than top-down approach, and this convention -- which gives each attending group two delegates to cast votes in a straw poll -- allows for that,” Monica Boyer, a Kosciusko County tea party activist told the &lt;em&gt;Indianapolis Star&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The convention was composed of both attendees, who cheered from the gallery, and delegates who waved placards denoting their respective congressional districts. After speeches from local leaders, delegates cast their votes in a straw poll for either incumbent Senator Richard Lugar or State Treasurer Richard Mourdock. As the delegates came on stage to vote, their district placards were combined to form an American flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/3pics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Voting&quot; title=&quot;Voting&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delegates casting their votes for either Sen. Richard Lugar or Richard Mourdock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a decisive victory and an affirmation of his grassroots support, Richard Mourdock received 96 of the 97 votes cast by the delegates. After the vote, Mourdock spoke to the convention about the passion of the activists and compared their resolve to that of our Founders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/photo_39.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mourdock&quot; title=&quot;Mourdock&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mourdock addressing the media after his straw poll victory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If five people in the backroom of a bar can change the history of the world, what can come from this meeting?” Mourdock said, recalling that the American Revolution was planned by a small group of patriots in a Boston tavern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The rebuke of Sen. Lugar by the activists was seen as inevitable given his long record of opposing conservative principles.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;The nation has a problem with not only a budget deficit, a severe one, but also a massive debt problem. He&#039;s been there for 36 years, but he hasn&#039;t done much to combat that, so it&#039;s time for somebody else,&quot; said Greg Fettig, co-chair of the Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe, Vice President of Communications Adam Brandon and I addressed the convention, encouraging local activists to stay organized on the ground and in the media.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;We told the crowd, &#039;This isn&#039;t the end — it&#039;s the beginning. Everybody go out and buy a new pair of shoes because we are going to pound the turf and go door to door, make phone calls and everything else,&#039;&quot; Fettig told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>FreedomWorks to Host All-Day Grassroots Training and Tea Party Debt Commission Field Hearing in Philadelphia</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-to-host-all-day-grassroots-training-a</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT:&lt;/strong&gt; FreedomWorks and local Tea Party groups will host a full day of activist education and grassroots training this Thursday, September 29th, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speakers and panel experts will address a variety of state and national issues, and offer a free-market perspective on topics including energy policy, government spending and school choice. In addition, attendees will participate in an interactive 2012 strategy session, a live demonstration of the online organizing platform FreedomConnector and a field hearing of the newly-formed Tea Party Debt Commission (TPDC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission consists of twelve members, paralleling the structure of the new “super-committee” created by Congress as part of the recent debt ceiling compromise. Committee members are volunteer tea party activists from a variety of states across the country, including CO, CT, IN, NH, NV, NY, OH, PA, UT, and VA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN:&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday, September 29th, 2011 from 1-9pm ET. &amp;nbsp;The TPDC field hearing will be held from 4:15-5:15pm ET.&amp;nbsp; Agenda available upon request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE:&lt;/strong&gt; National Constitution Center, 525 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19106.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY: &lt;/strong&gt;As a service center to over 1.4 million activists across the country, FreedomWorks seeks to unite and empower activists nationwide to create their own grassroots army of fiscal conservatives that can win elections and transform tea party ideals into lasting political change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks has a long history of working with activists in the greater Philadelphia area on state battles like school choice and fighting environmental over-regulation, and will continue to coordinate with activists in this key battleground state in the months leading up to the 2012 elections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission’s goal is to provide a platform for citizens around the country to be heard, and to propose specific cuts to the federal budget. It aims to create a budget plan that balances the federal budget within 10 years; reduces federal spending to 18 percent of GDP; reduces the national debt to no more than 66 percent of GDP; reduces federal spending by at least $9 trillion over 10 years (including $300 billion in the first year); and does not raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission began its grassroots outreach with email submissions and an online crowd-sourcing tool allowing voters to prioritize spending cuts. Each vote cuts a program, and projects the one-year and 10-year savings that cut would generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>The IMF Ironically Wants a Bailout</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/jborowski/the-imf-ironically-wants-a-bailout</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a fundamentally flawed institution that currently serves as an international bailout fund. The global bureaucracy has spent decades bailing out reckless foreign countries and banks, of which most recently are Greece, Ireland and Portugal. But now reports are circulating that the IMF needs a bailout of their own. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMF head &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/jborowski/another-french-statist-named-head-of-the-imf&quot;&gt;Christine Lagarde&lt;/a&gt; recently signaled that the Fund is &lt;a href=&quot;http://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/hell-no-american-taxpayers-should-not-bail-out-the-imf/&quot;&gt;running low&lt;/a&gt; on bailout money. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8788223/Christine-Lagarde-IMF-may-need-billions-in-extra-funding.html&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to the Telegraph, “the IMF has warned that its $384 bn war chest designed as an emergency bail-out fund is inadequate to deliver the scale of the support required by trouble states.” While no specific details have been released yet, hold on your wallets. As Cato Institute scholar Dan Mitchell &lt;a href=&quot;http://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/hell-no-american-taxpayers-should-not-bail-out-the-imf/&quot;&gt;cautions&lt;/a&gt;, the IMF “presumably will demand more handouts from member nations – with the United States on the hook for providing the biggest share.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people do not realize that U.S. taxpayers actually pay the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/24/lawmakers-raise-concern-ex-imf-directors-golden-parachute/&quot;&gt;largest share&lt;/a&gt; of the IMF’s bills. The American mainstream media—with the exception of former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/jborowski/time-to-end-imf-bailouts&quot;&gt;sex scandal&lt;/a&gt; coverage—has largely ignored the IMF. But as Cato Institute scholar Doug Bandow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=13237&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CatoRecentOpeds+%28Cato+Recent+Op-eds%29&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, “if the IMF was only spending other people’s money, then the U.S. might remain an amused bystander. But as the largest single contributor (16.67 percent, to be exact) to the Fund, American taxpayers are on the hook for a share of that organization’s lending, which ran more than $90 billion last year.” Americans would be wise to pay closer attention to what the IMF has done with our money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans taxpayers should not be forced to bail out the IMF. Nor should they be forced to subsidize foreign banks and spendthrift governments. As economist Henry Hazlitt &lt;a href=&quot;http://mises.org/daily/4831&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “the real solution is to dismantle the International Monetary Fund system.” The IMF is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/publications/top-10-reasons-to-stop-the-international-monetary&quot;&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; international bureaucracy that has harmed taxpayers, threatened our national sovereignty and has propped up dangerous economic policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution certainly does not grant the federal government the authority to join international institutions such as the IMF. The international bureaucracy undermines our national sovereignty since our elected congressional representatives cannot even vote on these foreign bailouts. Unfortunately, the only American man with the power to veto IMF bailouts is Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Can &lt;a href=&quot;http://action.freedomworks.org/4949/fire-tim-geithner/&quot;&gt;Tim Geithner please be fired&lt;/a&gt; already?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the IMF loans and bailouts have inflamed what economists call moral hazard. The IMF has held out of the prospect of a bailout which has encouraged banks and governments to make more risky decisions. As Professor Philipp Bagus &lt;a href=&quot;http://mises.org/daily/5326&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “risky countries, and, more importantly, their creditors, view the guarantee of bailouts as an insurance policy. Investors are less cautious about investing in developing economies as the IMF has implicitly guaranteed to cover their losses in the event of a financial calamity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF should not get one more cent from U.S. taxpayers. We’d be better off if the United States would immediately withdraw from the international bailout fund which no longer serves a legitimate purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the huge response of Ohioans to an email sent out last week, thousands of yard signs and door hangers produced by FreedomWorks began arriving at distribution points around the state today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a moment to visit our website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yesforjobs.com&quot;&gt;www.yesforjobs.com&lt;/a&gt; and sign the pledge there indicating support for Issues 2 &amp;amp; 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, FreedomWorks will host an official field hearing of the Tea Party Debt Commission in Cincinnatti where yard signs and door hangers will be available for pick up. For more information or to RSVP visit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.freedomworks.org/node/177745&quot;&gt;http://connect.freedomworks.org/node/177745&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s important to remember that this fight isn&#039;t just about Issues 2 &amp;amp; 3. It&#039;s about sending a message to public servants everywhere that government exists to serve the people, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your help, this November we&#039;ll return Ohio to the taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>FreedomWorks to Host Tea Party Debt Commission Field Hearings in Utah</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-to-host-tea-party-debt-commission-fie-0</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT: &lt;/strong&gt;This week,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe and select staffers will host four Tea Party Debt Commission (TPDC) field hearings across the state of Utah. Senator Mike Lee will join his constituents for the final field hearing in Provo, UT to participate in the ongoing discussion over how to rein in government spending. Local activists are expected to attend, and encouraged to bring their own proposals for specific cuts to the federal budget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission consists of twelve members, paralleling the structure of the new “super-committee” created by Congress as part of the recent debt ceiling compromise. Committee members are volunteer tea party activists from a variety of states across the country, including CO, CT, IN, NH, NV, NY, OH, PA, UT, and VA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The committee’s goal is to create a budget plan that balances the federal budget within 10 years; reduces federal spending to 18 percent of GDP; reduces the national debt to no more than 66 percent of GDP; reduces federal spending by at least $9 trillion over 10 years (including $300 billion in the first year); and does not raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN &amp;amp; WHERE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 26, 2011: TPDC field hearing in Ogden, UT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Weber County Library, Black Box Theater, Pleasant Valley Branch, 5568 South Adams Ave. Ogden, UT&amp;nbsp; 84405&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doors open at 6:30pm MT, events run from 7-9pm MT&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 27, 2011: TPDC field hearing in Logan, UT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Riverwoods, Cottonwood and Juniper Conference Room, 615 Riverwoods Parkway (80 East), Logan, UT 84321&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doors open at 6:30pm MT, events run from 7-9pm MT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 28, 2011: TPDC field hearing in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. George, UT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;St. George City Hall, Council Chambers, 175 East 200 North, St. George, UT 84770&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doors open at 6:30pm MT, events run from 7-9pm MT&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 30, 2011: TPDC field hearing in Provo, UT with Senator Mike Lee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Provo City Center, Council Chambers, 351 West Center, Provo, UT 84601&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doors open at 6:30pm MT, events run from 7-9pm MT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY: &lt;/strong&gt;FreedomWorks believes that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;President Obama’s “super-committee” will inevitably fall prey to special interest groups, shutting American taxpayers out of the discussion over how to reduce spending and balance the budget. The Tea Party Debt Commission was created to give the American people a platform to be heard, and to propose specific cuts to the federal budget.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission began its grassroots outreach with email submissions and an online crowd-sourcing tool allowing voters to prioritize spending cuts. Each vote cuts a program, and projects the one-year and 10-year savings that cut would generate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first official field hearing took place on September 1&lt;sup&gt;st &lt;/sup&gt;in Salt Lake City, UT, with over 250 local activists in attendance. The second field hearing took place in Orlando Florida, during the Florida CPAC convention. The committee plans to continue holding field hearings in key cities across the country, including Philadelphia, PA; Cincinnati, OH; Louisville KY; Columbia, SC; and Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks recruits, educates, trains and mobilizes volunteer activists to fight for less government, lower taxes, and more freedom. Founded in 1984, FreedomWorks is headquartered in Washington, DC, and has over 1.4 million grassroots volunteers nationwide.

    <title>A Politician&#039;s Version Of Ponzi Scheme </title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/a-politicians-version-of-ponzi-scheme</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://democracyandpower.org/wordpress/democracy-and-power/democracy-and-power-104/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy and Power:&amp;nbsp; 104 Future Debt Burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A government debt is a government claim against personal income and private property – an unpaid tax bill. – Hans F. Sennholz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;All democracies institute programs for current voters and shift the debt to future workers, even the unborn.&amp;nbsp; Social Security, Medicare, prescriptions drug benefits for seniors are prime examples in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2011/09/21/a_politicians_version_of_ponzi_scheme_99269.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Politician&#039;s Version Of Ponzi Scheme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Malanga of &lt;em&gt;Real Clear Markets&lt;/em&gt; describes Social Security’s political Ponzi scheme in the following exerp:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;... it does seem to resemble what I call the politicians&#039; version of a Ponzi scheme, that is, a spending program whose long-term unsustainability is clear early on and often in subsequent years, but whose advocates leave it to some future generation of political leaders to do the tough (and politically unpopular) job of fixing it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when Social Security was initiated in the 1930’s many of the demographic estimates were correct.&amp;nbsp; The birth rate was dropping and a greater number of people were predicted to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, though, the problem lies with politicians.&amp;nbsp; Invariably, they raid any possible source of money for their &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; use.&amp;nbsp; In the 1960&#039;s, government changed budget practices allowing the confiscation of Social Security surpluses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;... changes to federal budget practices in the late 1960s essentially mean that there is no real surplus sitting anywhere waiting to be used. The federal government has spent the money on other programs and replaced it with IOUs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with three workers supporting every one retiree, Social Security is receiving less revenue than is being paid out.&amp;nbsp; Social Security promises should be honored, but there are no longer dedicated funds to fullfill those promises.&amp;nbsp; The IOUs are simply a piece of paper saying the government owes the Social Security Administration money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Social Security pays out more than it takes in from payroll taxes, the federal government has to start paying back those IOUs out of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, future workers are stuck with the tax bill created by long-gone politicians.&amp;nbsp; Malanga points out yet another defect in his piece,&amp;nbsp; which is the surplus and its&amp;nbsp; illusion of abundance, which allows for additional spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, academic research suggests that the practice of spending the Social Security surplus on other programs and replacing it with IOUs has probably encouraged increases in federal spending by creating the illusion that there was more money to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians make promises and put the burden on future workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This habit of promising big benefit-programs and then ignoring the day of reckoning is common. For instance, we have all witnessed how state and local politicians designed pension systems for public employees and hid the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; taxpayer costs of these pensions.&amp;nbsp; Those costs then only became apparent when millions of public-sector workers, who already earned their benefits, demanded to be paid out years later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our policymakers understood the demographic implications in the 1930&#039;s, surely by the mid-1960&#039;s they had an inkling of what that same transition would do to the cost of a new, health care program for the elderly, which is Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The habit of pleasing today’s voters and sticking the monetary burden on future workers is the greatest source of debt in all democracies – Europe, America and the States.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, this “habit” is actually a character-defect – elected politicians buy votes today at the expense of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the public becomes more aware of this flaw, there will be more debate as to its solution.&amp;nbsp; In America, many voters are calling for a Cut, Cap and Balance (CCB).&amp;nbsp; [Read: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;blog/teda/cut-cap-balance&quot;&gt;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/cut-cap-balance]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; The deficit must be cut immediately.&amp;nbsp; Latest year’s deficit was $1.6 trillion.&amp;nbsp; It must be cut by 50% this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cap:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Federal spending must be capped at 18% of GDP – the historical rate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Budget Amendment:&lt;/strong&gt; Congress and the President must balance the budget with the exception of emergencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Structural changes are the only methods that will prevent politicians from manipulating and misusing the money of working Americans.&amp;nbsp; Among the necessary restraints are personal accounts for retirement and medical needs.&amp;nbsp; Only through workers&#039; controlling their own retirment and medical accounts will politicians stop promising, taxing, raiding and manipulating the money of today&#039;s workers as well as future workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Tea Party Debt Commission Hits a &quot;Grand Slam&quot; in Orlando</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/dean-clancy/tea-party-debt-commission-wows-orlando-0</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Debt Commission took Orlando by storm at a local Denny&#039;s restaurant Friday near the Orange County Convention Center. Participants agreed both the food and the testimony were &quot;grand slam.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/original/TPDC_logo_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tea Party Debt Commission&quot; title=&quot;Tea Party Debt Commission&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-original&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just steps from the big Florida Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) that drew tea party types and GOP presidential hopefuls from all across the country, the lunch hour hearing was a big success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience included interested citizens, journalists, local tea party activists, all packed in a Denny&#039;s back room to discuss budgets, baselines, and the national debt.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rev. C. L. Bryant led the opening prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;nbsp;FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe addressed the crowd on the importance of influencing Washington&#039;s budget and debt debates from the grassroots up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks legislative counsel and health care VP Dean Clancy walked the group through a brief budget and debt background &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.freedomworks.org/files/TPDC_FieldHearing092311OrlandoFL.pdf&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey discussed the TPDC in the context of the 2012 elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several members of the Florida Advisory Committee to the Tea Party Debt Commission were present, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharon Calvert - Tampa Tea Party&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karen Jaroch - Tampa 9/12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Curtis&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karin Hoffman - DCworksforUS, South Florida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most of the meeting was spent in hearing numerous constructive ideas from the audience. For example, one audience member made a compelling case for devolving federal highway funding and responsibilities to the states. Another explained the massive challenges that Medicaid poses for Florida residents and taxpayers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_field_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23_Dick_Armey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dick Armey at 2011-09-23 TPDC field hearing&quot; title=&quot;Dick Armey at 2011-09-23 TPDC field hearing&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_field_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23_Matt_Kibbe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matt Kibbe at TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; title=&quot;Matt Kibbe at TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/files/imagecache/full/TPDC_hearing_Dennys_Orlando_2011-09-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; title=&quot;TPDC hearing Dennys Orlando 2011-09-23&quot; style=&quot;border-style: initial; border-color: initial;&quot; class=&quot;imagecache imagecache-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Commission, or to find a list of upcoming field hearings, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www/freedomworks.org/teapartydebtcommission&quot;&gt;Tea Party Debt Commission&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To RSVP to attend a hearing, visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.freedomworks.org/node/178280&quot;&gt;FreedomConnector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and search for the specific event by location and the key words &quot;tea party debt commission.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Bundlers poised for power over supercommittee </title>

Murray (D-WA) told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;. “The select committee is no different than anybody else” in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Sen. Kerry&#039;s (D-MA) spokesperson, Jodi Seth, said those two bundlers were disclosed after a December 2010 event honoring Kerry’s 45 years of public service. She said the senator’s votes are strictly rooted in the interests of his state and his personal beliefs — “and nothing else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the assuring words of two lobbyists - John Podesta andTony Podesta.&amp;nbsp; John was Chief of staff for Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;In an interview, Podesta (John) downplayed that lobbyists’ history of fundraising would have a real effect on the supercommittee’s final result, saying the members won’t have a “special window for bundlers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;“I don’t think they’ll be tallying to see who did what for them,” Tony Podesta added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, why bundle?&amp;nbsp; Obviously, the executives of AT&amp;amp;T, Microsoft and Duke Energy know this is an effective means to gain access to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do elected officials participate?&amp;nbsp; Simple, elected officials always need money to campaign for themselves and their party and the bundlers are providing it – &lt;strong&gt;big time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do American citizens counter-act these collusions?&amp;nbsp; Encouragingly, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We the People &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;took the first step and voted wastrel politicians out of office.&amp;nbsp; The election of 2010 was a great success.&amp;nbsp; The election of 2012 is extremely important.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We the People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; must convince the independent voter to vote for candidates supporting less taxes and more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, join &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FreedomWorks&lt;/a&gt;, which has strong and constant relationships with the increasing number of politicians dedicated to a limited government.&amp;nbsp; The combined power of grassroots voters and direct contact with politicians is the most powerful force against the lobbyist, bundlers and spendthrift politicians.&amp;nbsp; FreedomWorks is the most powerful force against the “good old boy” politics of DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Claire McCaskill: Strong Politician, or Just Following Suit? Part II</title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/cbigelow/claire-mccaskill-strong-politician-or-just-followi-0</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;McCaskill Sides with EPA Rather Than Economic Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulation waves are stirring up in Washington, America is begging for a life saver. However, with politicians like Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) aboard the good ship S.S. Big Government, the life savers are all made of stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2011, Senator McCaskill &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;amp;session=1&amp;amp;vote=00054&quot;&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; against a bill that would prohibit the EPA from issuing harmful taxes on greenhouse gas (i.e. carbon dioxide) emissions. These taxes harm healthy competition between businesses, which would drive down prices, encourage expansion, and promote job creation. Whether there is even a need to restrict such emissions is controversial, yet Sen. McCaskill sided with those who are determined to plunge ahead with costly new taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument for voting no on the bill is stated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontheissues.org/International/Claire_McCaskill_Energy_+_Oil.htm&quot;&gt;thus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 30px&quot;&gt;Sen. Lautenberg, D-NJ: “We hear the message that has been going around: Let&#039;s get rid of the EPA&#039;s ability to regulate. Who are they to tell us what businesses can do? Thank goodness that in this democratic society in which we live, there are rules and regulations to keep us as a civilized nation. The Supreme Court and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency agreed that the Clean Air Act is a tool we must use to stop dangerous pollution. This amendment, it is very clear, favors one group--the business community. The Republican tea party politicians say: ‘Just ignore the Supreme Court. Ignore the scientists. We know better.’ They want to reward the polluters by crippling EPA&#039;s ability to enforce the Clean Air Act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless what scientists, courts, or politicians say, America’s economy is floundering in a massive sea of debt and red tape. With 14 million people out of work, is it really America’s number one priority to regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the air?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>“… the president will be running for re-election as Nancy Pelosi.” </title>
    <link>http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/teda/%E2%80%9C%E2%80%A6-the-president-will-be-running-for-re-election-a</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://democracyandpower.org/wordpress/democracy-and-power/democracy-and-power-104&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy and Power:&amp;nbsp; 104 Future Debt Burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A government debt is a government claim against personal income and private property – an unpaid tax bill. – Hans F. Sennholz,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;All democracies institute programs for current voters and shift the debt to future workers, even the unborn.&amp;nbsp; Social Security, Medicare, prescriptions drug benefits for seniors are prime examples in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/the-presidents-deficit-plan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“… &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/the-presidents-deficit-plan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the president will be running for re-election as Nancy Pelosi,”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Ross Douthat, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Team Obama has made a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; 2012 campaign&amp;nbsp; decision.&amp;nbsp; Ross Douthat of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; states the theme: “Tax the rich, and Medicare forever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming to reduce the deficit, the President proposes taxing the rich, leaving Medicare intact and insignificantly tinkering with Social Security.&amp;nbsp; Hence, the President totally ignores the source for America’s enormous and dangerous debt – Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.&amp;nbsp; In his article, Douthat most closely refers to Nancy Pelosi as representing the hardcore liberal base of the Democratic Party.&amp;nbsp; However, this strategy is reminiscent of Nancy Pelosi’s claim in 2005 that Social Security was not bankrupt.&amp;nbsp; If you need a quick reminder of Pelosi&#039;s claims, read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149556,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of Pelosi and Chris Wallace in 2005, as reported by Fox News:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149556,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;PELOSI: … Your previous speaker said incorrectly that Social Security would be in the red in 2018. That&#039;s simply not true. The more money going out than coming in doesn&#039;t start until 2030. There&#039;s time for us to do this right.&amp;nbsp; …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;WALLACE: But I just want to make sure, Congresswoman Pelosi, you know, we&#039;re talking about Social Security, the Democratic social program. I didn&#039;t hear anything about raising taxes. I didn&#039;t hear anything...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;PELOSI: Of course you didn&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;WALLACE: ... about cutting benefits. There doesn&#039;t seem to be any plan that you are offering to solve the long-term solvency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;PELOSI: Chris, the issue is solvency, and the issue of solvency is one that President Reagan and Tip O&#039;Neill addressed in 1983. They took measures...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;WALLACE: But there&#039;s a problem now. I&#039;m asking you, do you have an answer?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;PELOSI: They had a crisis at that time. There is no crisis, as the president indicated to us in our private meeting with him until he went out and said, &quot;It&#039;s a crisis. It&#039;s bankrupt.&quot; That&#039;s not the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;What we have to do is come together in a bipartisan way at the table, bringing principles that say we cannot begin by slashing benefits. We must stop robbing Social Security&#039;s trust fund of its money to pay for other things to cover the enormous deficits in the Bush reckless economic polict, in my view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six and half years have passed since Pelosi&#039;s conversation with Chris Wallace and the Bush and Obama administrations with the participation of Pelosi and Congress have continued to rob the Social Security “trust fund.”&amp;nbsp; Be aware, every sane politician knows there is no trust fund and the drivers of America’s precarious debt are Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, every sane politician knows a year-long delay greatly exacerbates the debt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the deplorable state of American politics.&amp;nbsp; When Representative Ryan published his &lt;em&gt;Path to Prosperity&lt;/em&gt; with proposals to restructure Medicare, the President and Democrats simply resorted to demagoguery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we enter the 2012 election campaign with no serious discussion for reducing the debt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We the People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can put an end to these despicable political deceptions.&amp;nbsp; The 2012 election is critical to the future of democracy in America.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, only a system of personal accounts for Social Security and medical care will prevent the continuation of this political corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;og_rss_groups&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
