It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/programmes/b013pqnm">Great British Bake Off</a>, I&#8217;m afraid &#8211; I get 20 minutes into each programme before having to gnaw the sofa arm out of hunger. It is <em>insane</em> not to prepare a pudding before watching this show, so (overachiever as per usual) I&#8217;ve done two. </p>
<p>This is a recipe from <a href="http://www.nigelslater.com">His Holiness </a>that I was bitching about all the way through making &#8211; the pastry&#8217;s impossible, there&#8217;s too much juice, the topping&#8217;s too lumpy. Ye of little faith. They came out right gorgeous &#8211; unmolded like a dream, even without greasing the tins, no soggy bottoms (phnar phnar) and a great combination of crunchy crumble, tender crisp pastry and melting fruit. Add vanilla icecream for your own personal nirvana. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added ground roasted hazelnuts to Nige&#8217;s pastry and honey in the place of maple syrup. For the rhubarb version, I took a tip from GBBO contestant Janet Basu&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/rhubarb_meringue_pie_96909">rhubarb meringue pie</a>, and cooked 2cm lengths of rhubarb until just tender in the oven, before standing them up vertically in the tart tin and covering with the topping. </p>
<p>Oh, and follow along the #ggbo hashtag if you&#8217;re watching tonight, it&#8217;s half the fun. </p>

<li class="ingredient">1 lemon</li>
<li class="ingredient">For the quinces (this quantity makes two 16cm tarts):</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 lemon</li>
<li class="ingredient">3 big quinces, about 800g in total before preparing</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tbsps caster sugar</li>
<li class="ingredient">3 tbsps honey</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 dessert apples (i.e. not Bramleys)</li>
<li class="ingredient">For the rhubarb (this quantity makes two 16cm tarts):</li>
<li class="ingredient">800g rhubarb</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 oranges</li>
<li class="ingredient">4 tbsps caster sugar</li>
<li class="ingredient">For the topping:</li>
<li class="ingredient">150g plain white flour </li>
<li class="ingredient">75g room temperature butter </li>
<li class="ingredient">75g demerara sugar</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions">
<h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Preheat the oven to 200˚C and put in a metal baking sheet big enough for the two 16cm metal tart tins to sit on. </li>
<li>Make the pastry. This will (probably) seem like a nightmare and require scraping off the worksurface but don&#8217;t worry, mine turned out all tender and crisp in the end and no-one else need know exactly how much ended up stuck to bits of you or the kitchen. </li>
<li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Add the egg and mix this in well too. Dump in the flour and ground hazelnuts too and bring together into a soft ball. Knead briefly on a very floury surface to amalgamate then (attempt to) roll out and line the tins (patch, stuff, squeeze and press as needs be). Chill in fridge while you prepare the fruit. </li>
<li>For the quinces: juice the lemon into a saucepan. Peel, core and chop the quinces into small pieces (1cm or less cubes). Turn in the lemon as you go. Add the sugar and honey and simmer on a low heat for 15 minutes until tender. Meanwhile core and chop the dessert apples (leave the peel on) and add to the quinces when they&#8217;re starting to soften. Make sure the fruit is nice and soft before you stop. </li>
<li>For the rhubarb: wash the stalks and cut into lengths about 2cm long depending on how tall your tart tins are &#8211; I wanted mine to stand vertically so you need to leave a bit of room at the top for the streusel to go on too. Put in an ovenproof dish, juice the orange in too and sprinkle over the sugar. Bake until tender to the point of a knife. </li>
<li>Make the topping: rub the butter into the flour (or use a food processor) until it looks like breadcrumbs. Stir in the demerara. Beat the egg lightly and fork this through &#8211; you&#8217;ll get big lumps, but that&#8217;s ok. </li>
<li>Now fill the tart tins. For the quinces, lift out the fruit with a slotted spoon avoiding as much juice as possible (no soggy bottoms allowed). For the rhubarb, stand the segments up vertically. Sprinkle the topping over the top. Bake for 30 minutes until golden brown and crisp on top. Cool on rack for 10 minutes to let everything sit before de-tinning. </li>

<p>As card-carrying audio guide fanatics, we now won&#8217;t consider visiting anywhere that doesn&#8217;t have one. For the city itself, we downloaded the <a href="http://www.talkofthetown.se/en-start.html">Talk of the Town guide</a> which was very well produced &#8211; 56 points of interest throughout the city in excellent English that struck the right balance between historical accuracy and anecdote. We also whipped round the <a href="http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/royalpalaces/theroyalpalace.4.396160511584257f218000138.html">Royal Palace</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storkyrkan">cathedral</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/English-startpage/">National Museum</a>. The hop on hop off boat was great for getting around and saving your feet. </p>
<h4>We bought:</h4>
<p>Half the shop at <a href="http://www.norrona.com/">Norrona</a> for gorgeous skiwear. Cloudberry jam (fell in love with these orange beauties in Newfoundland, where they&#8217;re called bakeapples) and herring roe at the airport. </p>
<p><img src="http://rumandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/stockholm-collages-610x610.jpg" alt="Stockholm sightseeing" title="Stockholm sightseeing" width="604" height="604" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3057" /></p>
<h4>We ate:</h4>
<p><a href="http://restaurangprinsen.eu/">Prinsen</a><br />
We went here only because when I have a deadline, even a lovely one like going away for the weekend, I avoid it like the plague. That&#8217;s why, on ringing my first choice <a href="http://www.pelikan.se/">Pelikan</a> on Thursday night, they didn&#8217;t have a table for the Friday, so I booked Prinsen online at the last minute. Bits of the meal were yummy &#8211; the bread promised much, the herring was gorgeous (several little dishes of fish marinated in different ways with new potatoes that made me remember how good just plain potatoes <em>can</em> taste) and the crayfish were undeniably fresh. We ordered badly for our main courses though &#8211; the wallenbergare, one of veal and one of seafood, were basically giant pan-fried meatballs: a bit heavy and not our style. And desserts were pretty rubbish &#8211; tiny and a bit stale. The welcome on the street was definitely world weary, but inside our waiters were charm personified. Prinsen&#8217;s not bad at all, it&#8217;s just a bit lazy: a bistro that has been lulled into indolence by a clientele of indiscriminate tourists and blazer-wearing local couples of a certain age. </p>
<p><a href="http://restaurangvolt.se/">Volt</a><br />
Now Volt is a whole other kettle of fish. I left thinking that this, pretty much, is a perfect restaurant. Actually, scratch the qualification &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure how the people at Volt (apparently four young breakaway chefs, tired of restaurant stuffiness) could improve. </p>
<p>If Volt were my local restaurant, I&#8217;d be here with my boyfriend every two weeks or so for a subtly romantic evening &#8211; I might wear trainers if we&#8217;re tired, but stockings and heels would feel right too. I&#8217;d take visiting friends here on their first night in town, because the food is local but modern and light after travel, the ambience is elegant but easy. I&#8217;d take business clients here, because it&#8217;s a professional operation and the whole effect is quietly impressive. I&#8217;d take my mum and dad here, because it&#8217;d be one of the best meals they&#8217;ve had outside Italy. I am, as you might surmise, insanely jealous of the Stockholmers who get to live around the corner from this place. </p>
<p>The decor is spot on &#8211; simple without being &#8220;we&#8217;re, like, so down-to-earth&#8221; pretentious. A bit of exposed piping and perfectly placed worn posters of fish and mushrooms, furry sofas, dark slabs of stone to serve the bread. Low lighting, but not to ridiculous levels so you need to grope around to find cutlery or squint at the menu. Someone&#8217;s got a good eye, and has used a small budget well. And the service was delightful &#8211; knowledgable and friendly without pushiness or American over-explanation. </p>
<p>Ambience and waiters are good clues, but you <em>know</em> it&#8217;s going to be a good meal when the bread is good. The bread here &#8211; an oversized levain roll with a dark, crackly, floury crust &#8211; was deliriously tasty. Thank goodness it was big enough for two, else an undignified tug-of-war would have ensued with the loaf held between our teeth. </p>
<p>The menu comprises three items each for starter, main and pud/cheese. That&#8217;s about all my choice-addled brain can handle these days, so it&#8217;s a perfect size for me. We had three courses, although they also suggest five or seven in tasting menus. The food is inventive without being challenging (who the f***, really, wants to eat stuff that looks like other stuff?) That said, this isn&#8217;t food I would cook at home &#8211; it&#8217;s far too well thought out and exquisitely presented for that. And surely that&#8217;s the point of going to a restaurant? For starters, the broccoli/oysters/sea plants/algae was a gorgeous collection of unusual and usual perfectly cooked green stuff with a creamy oyster tartare underneath. Mackerel/horseradish/radish/cress seemed to be a riff on the local herring &#8211; two long strips of sweetly smoked (I think) mackerel sprinkled with crunchy radish and contrasting with the slightly fiery cress and horseradish. Heaven. </p>
<p>For seconds, we had one chicken/chanterelles/hazelnut/egg &#8211; chunks of the tenderest chicken ever, just teetering on the edge of being cooked, with delicate pale yellow mushrooms and a creamy hazelnut sauce. The other main, if possible, was even more perfectly conceived: plaice/peas/yoghurt/spruce were delicate fillets of flounder, with a puree of broad beans, tiny fresh peas, little clouds of fluffy natural yoghurt and the most delicate hint of pine leaves &#8211; unexpected and brilliant. </p>
<p>Desserts. Ah, the desserts. We had both: currants/marmalade/almonds/woodruf I remember as being almondy clusters spiked with jam and a fresh grapey granita. Although I could be wrong, as it was outshadowed by the corn/caramel/salt/oxalis &#8211; a creamy semifreddo (I think) of corn that enclosed tiny fresh sweetcorn kernels with a perfectly judged salted caramel sauce. We ordered another one as soon as we&#8217;d laid down our spoons from the first. </p>
<p>A restaurant that can make me like sweetcorn, let alone <em>relish</em> it and order seconds? Only at Volt, it seems. </p>
<p><img src="http://rumandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/stockholm-collages1-610x610.jpg" alt="Lydmar hotel, Stockholm" title="Lydmar hotel, Stockholm" width="604" height="604" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3063" /></p>
<h4>We stayed:</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.lydmar.com/">The Lydmar Hotel</a><br />
A fantastic location, slap bang next to the Grand Hotel, just across the bridge from the old town, Gamla Stan, and within spitting distance of all the nice shops &#8211; basically perfect whether you&#8217;re out on the town or doing touristy cultural things. </p>
<p>The common areas downstairs are mostly taken up with the restaurant although the concierge desk is always manned and very efficient and friendly. The restaurant is fab: breakfast is a buffet (included in our room price) with a really nice selection of excellent pastries, various jams, greek yoghurt, cereals and lovely fresh fruit as well as some cold cuts and cheese. Cappuccino was very decent indeed. We also fuelled here at lunch on both days, just because the position of the hotel was so handy. And for the bread basket which was <em>awesome</em> (if someone can give me the recipe for those mini malty caraway loaves I&#8217;ll be a happy bunny). The shrimp salad with egg and avocado was huge and piled high with tasty pink prawns, the steak tartare just the right side of spicy, the lavaret roe was light and fresh. Highly recommended. </p>
<p>The rooms are really lovely &#8211; it&#8217;s an old building and they&#8217;ve really tried to preserve that charm but with a modern twist. The beautiful arched windows flooded our Medium room with light, but also have ultra-effective sound insulation. (This continues with isolating doors to the room and in the corridors, making this one of the quietest hotels I&#8217;ve slept in recently, notwithstanding the open-air bar below.) Freestanding wooden wardrobes, comfy sofas and bookshelves with eclectic nicknacks mix with over-sized anglepoise lamps and a very sleek and modern dark grey tiled bathroom. Really comfy bed and wi-fi included complete the deal. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href='http://rumandreason.com/2011/09/brasato-al-barolo-piemontese-beef-stew-with-proper-polenta/'><img width="604" height="452" src="http://rumandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brasato-barolo-piemonte-1-610x457.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="Marinating the beef for the brasato" title="Marinating the beef for the brasato" /></a></div><br /><br /><p>The great thing about a good stew recipe is that, even though it requires time, it&#8217;s not all hands on time. In this dish from Piemonte, the cooking is in three parts over two days but they&#8217;re all dead easy: </p>
<p>Firstly and most wonderfully, there&#8217;s <strong>no lengthy prep</strong>: the beef* is in a single piece, the veg are very roughly chunked (not chopped) and herbs and spices go in whole. The whole lot gets covered in Barolo red wine** (local to the Piemonte area) and marinated in the fridge overnight. </p>
<p>The second step is to cook the stew itself: browning the piece of meat all over, then adding the reserved veg, marinade and some beef stock and simmering slowly for two to four hours (depending on the size of the meat). At this point the stew can go back in the fridge until you want to eat it. </p>
<p>Lastly, just before eating, the meat gets sliced separately and the sauce bubbles away to reduce it down while you prepare any accompaniments (polenta or mashed potatoes are traditional).  </p>
<p>All very doable, especially as the second stew-simmering stage can be supervised by a total culinary noob, or while you&#8217;re busy doing the housework. </p>
<p>I really like keeping the <strong>meat separate from the sauce</strong> at the end &#8211; you can judge the consistency of the sauce (dense or pourable, sieved or pureed etc) without worrying about what the meat is doing, people can serve themselves as much or as little as they want, it&#8217;s more elegant on the plate and best of all you&#8217;ll have lovely sauce leftovers to eat (see suggestions below). It is very rich &#8211; I now have conclusive proof that it&#8217;s possible to have a stew hangover. But it was so worth it for the sublime results: sorry, but I didn&#8217;t take a photo of the finished stew, basically because I am not enough of a dedicated food stylist to make brown food look nice. I also have zero staying power in front of food that smells this good. I didn&#8217;t want to photograph it, I wanted to snort it. The meat was <strong>forkably tender without being fatty, the sauce rich</strong> and I instantly regretted not having a pan big enough to double the recipe. </p>
<p>I normally have an instinctive horror of all-brown food &#8211; to Mr. R&#038;R&#8217;s eternal disappointment, I&#8217;ll sprinkle chopped parsley over anything remotely muddy looking just for a bit of green. But this time I restrained myself (I&#8217;m not sure I would have been forgiven for greenifying this dish from his home town). So the only thing we ate alongside was <strong>proper polenta</strong>. It was a revelation, worlds away from the insipid blobby mass that instant polenta produces. Very recommended, even if you&#8217;re not a starch lover. No recipe needed here &#8211; all it needs is adding to water and stirring, but here are some tips for avoiding &#8211; <em>orrore!</em> &#8211; lumps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used fine polenta, 220g for 1l water, which gave a medium density result &#8211; but check the proportions on the label. </li>
<li>Salt the water as you would pasta &#8211; i.e. a fistful of coarse salt</li>
<li>Bring the water nearly up to the boil (but not quite), and pour the polenta in a thin stream while stirring. Be patient otherwise you&#8217;ll get lumps</li>
<li>Always stir in the same direction</li>
<li>Cook over a gentle heat for at least 90 minutes &#8211; you can&#8217;t overcook polenta, and the more you cook it the more digestible it is. In fact, cooking instant polenta for a good half-an-hour will improve it no end. </li>
<li>You need to stir often, and the more often the better &#8211; but not absolutely all the time. Cover with a lid when you need to get on with other bits of your life. If it catches on the bottom of the pan, it&#8217;ll be tasty.</li>
</ul>
<p>* In Italy, the cut of meat to use is <em>cappello di prete</em>, which is a very specific area of the shoulder. Now, I have studied meat cut charts and tried to translate, but I&#8217;m just not enough of a butcher to work out the exact UK equivalent (if, indeed, it exists &#8211; the cuts in Italy differ from region to region, let alone from those commonly used in Britain). I used a 1.2kg piece of feather blade from the <a href="https://www.eastlondonsteak.co.uk/">East London Steak Co.</a> (properly aged beef, efficient online shopping and see their cute packaging below), which is a cut from the shoulder with a lovely vein of fat running through it. </p>
<p>** I know that all the modern meat books say that you shouldn&#8217;t marinate meat for long in wine, that it denatures it, or hardens it, or whatever. Well, I reckon generations of Piemontesi can&#8217;t be wrong &#8211; have you <em>tasted</em> their food? Seriously, it&#8217;s <em>insanely</em> good, and we&#8217;re not about fucking up a good tasting thing here at Rum &#038; Reason. I sloshed in the Barolo for a good 18 hours or so, with the roughly chopped veg and herbs. So there.</p>

<div class="hrecipe">
<h2 class="fn">Brasato al Barolo</h2>
<p class="summary"><em>Serves 4</em></p>
<div class="ingredients">
<h4  class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="ingredient">1.2kg (or thereabouts) piece of beef &#8211; a braising cut like feather blade</li>
<li class="ingredient">500ml Barolo red wine</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 onions</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 sticks celery</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 medium carrots</li>
<li class="ingredient">500ml beef stock</li>
<li class="ingredient">Herbs and spices (all welcome in any combination): a few sprigs thyme, rosemary, a couple of cloves and juniper berries, a few peppercorns, a couple of fresh bay leaves</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions">
<h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Peel and roughly chunk the carrots, celery and onion and place in a dish with the meat. Pour the wine over and marinate in the fridge overnight. </li>
<li>The next day, pour the marinade into a jug through a colander and reserve the vegetables. </li>
<li>Heat a good knob of butter with a tablespoon of oil in a saucepan or casserole dish large enough to take the meat. Brown the joint well on all sides, over a medium high heat. Then remove it to a plate and add the reserved vegetables, spices and herbs to the casserole, and cook these over a gentle heat until beginning to soften, adding a bit more butter or oil if things start to stick too much. </li>
<li>Add the meat and the reserved wine marinade back to the casserole as well as enough of the beef stock to cover. Salt pretty generously (if you know your stock, you&#8217;ll be able to judge that). Bring up to the boil and then fiddle with the heat so that the liquid just gently simmers away without completely coming to a standstill or being too vigorous. Leave to cook for 3 hours, turning the joint over every now and then. Cover loosely with the lid, so that the sauce starts to intensify a bit but not steam away too much. When done, take out the meat and pick out the herbs and blend the sauce until smooth. Put the meat back in: after this cooking time, the stew can be fridged for a day or so before eating. </li>
<li>To do the final preparation, heat the meat up in its sauce gently (I did this just to make absolutely sure it wouldn&#8217;t dry out). When hot, take the meat out of its sauce and slice into thick slices. Lay on a serving plate, cover in foil and put in a low oven to keep warm. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, keep heating the sauce to reduce it down &#8211; you can be really fierce with the bubbles now, and you&#8217;re after a sauce that&#8217;s pourable but quite thick. Think Bisto not a jus. </li>
<li>Serve the meat with the sauce poured over the top, with proper polenta or mashed potatoes. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Leftovers</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Leftover Barolo can obviously be drunk over the stove or used in this <a href="http://rumandreason.com/2011/08/gammon-damsons-barolo/">lovely damson sauce for cold cuts</a>. </li>
<li>Leftover sauce can be eaten as a sauce for carbs &#8211; try it with spinach and ricotta ravioli, or with fresh tagliatelle with peas, or with gnocchi. Yum. In Piemonte they also eat it just warm with a fresh cheese called <em>robiola d&#8217;Alba</em>, which is a white crumbly sheep and cows milk cheese, like a much less salty feta. I haven&#8217;t been able to track this down in the UK yet, but it&#8217;s fun trying&#8230;</li>
<li>Leftover polenta can be left in the pan and reheated very successfully by stirring in some just boiled water over a gentle heat. Easy.</li>

We just missed Hurricane Irene in the Bahamas and are now coming to you from London, in a whirlwind of crappy airline seats, leaky rented ceilings, increasingly fecked-off emails to [insert demon estate agent of choice here] and wonderful, wonderful Ocado delivery guys. </p>
<p>London means eating all those things not around in Nassau&#8230; which means that this week we have mostly been eating sausages. Sausages on their own, sausage sandwiches, pasta with sausages and peas&#8230; Delicious, yes, but not very blog-worthy really. </p>
<p>Mum to the rescue then, with a kitchen packed to the gills with goodies, including a pound of perfect purple damsons, practically bursting with juices and just waiting to be set free. I should make it perfectly clear that, had my mum not fed me copious quantities of damson crumble at the weekend*, I would not have in a million years contemplated doing anything remotely as controversial as a savoury damson dish. But since both my tastebuds and thighs have been indelibly stained with the effects of that perfect pud, I decided to experiment. Get me. </p>
<p>So, consulting The Oracle (his Nigelness&#8217;s Tender Volume II) on damsons, two sauces were cited, one with sloe gin for gammon, and one with ginger and star anise for duck. Both sounded amazing, but it&#8217;s a bank holiday and I had no intention of battling shoppers intent on discounted sweatshop items. In went, then, what I had on hand: a slug of water, a larger slug of Barolo (the rest of the bottle to be used in an upcoming brasato with polenta this week), a couple of tablespoons of dark muscovado sugar and a couple of dark sherry vinegar, a fresh bay leaf, salt and pepper. The result was a blindingly fuchsia and sharply sweet sauce, eaten just warm with some baked gammon. A bit English, a bit Piemontese and wholly yummy. </p>
<p>*in a pudding double bill, no less, with Hugh Fearnley-Whitingstall&#8217;s elderflower panna cotta with gooseberry compote. Mr. R&#038;R was in sugar heaven.</p>

<h2 class="fn">Gammon with a sauce of damsons and Barolo</h2>
<p class="summary"><em>Serves 3-4</em></p>
<div class="ingredients">
<h4  class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="ingredient">1.2kg gammon &#8211; mine was unsmoked</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 onion</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 carrot</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 stick celery</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 bay leaves</li>
<li class="ingredient">350g damsons</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tbsps dark muscovado sugar (to taste)</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tbsps dark sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar, to taste)</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 glass Barolo (or other fruity red wine)</li>
<li class="ingredient">A handful fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
<li class="ingredient">4 tbsps interesting jam (I used fig, but redcurrant jelly or quince jam would be lovely too, and what about cherry or indeed damson?)</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tbsps English mustard</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions">
<h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Put the gammon in a large saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, roughly peel and chop the onion, carrot and celery. </li>
<li>Drain the joint and cover again with cold water, adding the chopped vegetables, a bay leaf and a few peppercorns. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 55mins per kg plus 30 mins. Turn off the heat and leave in the cooking liquid until ready to glaze. </li>
<li>An hour-ish before you want to eat, preheat the oven to 180˚C. Meanwhile make the damson sauce: wash the damsons in a colander, removing stems and leaves. Place in a medium saucepan with the wine, sugar, a good grinding of salt and pepper, the other bay leaf and a splash of water. Heat until simmering nicely for 10 minutes, until all the skins have burst. Now add the vinegar and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Sieve to remove the stones. Continue to heat for about another 5 minutes until it thickens slightly (you control the consistency, pourable or jammily spoonable, by how much you reduce it down). Taste carefully (it&#8217;ll be very, very hot) and add more vinegar or sugar as you judge necessary. Set aside. </li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, mustard and jam. Remove the gammon from its cooking liquid (which you should keep, see below) and place in a roasting tin. Peel away the thick skin but leave the fat. Smear the breadcrumby jam all over and roast for 30 minutes until browning. Rest for a few minutes before carving into thick slices and serving with the warm damson sauce on the side. The crunchy crust will probably come away from the pork, but think of it a bit like the Christmas stuffing.</li>
</ol>
<h4  class="ingredients">Leftovers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the cooking liquid for the gammon to make a divine pea soup, with scraps of the gammon itself stirred into it</li>
<li>Leftover damson sauce would be yummy with cold roast meats, chicken, duck, turkey orap pork, and I reckon could be portioned out and frozen very successfully for future post-Sunday roasts. If reduced down to a jam, it would be ace in sandwiches.</li>
<li>Another idea might be to add it to a tagine-type dish, in lieu of dried fruits such as apricots or dates. A Moroccan sort of lamb stew perhaps, with some of the damson sauce stirred in to make it richly sweet and tart?</li>

I&#8217;d skim over it in one of my innumerable baking books and think, &#8220;too rich&#8221;, &#8220;precious ingredients&#8221; and &#8220;wobbly thighs&#8221; in quick succession before going on to something involving polenta or whole grains, but probably equally calorific. </p>
<p>Not only that, but I&#8217;d hide the recipe&#8217;s very existence from Mr. R&#038;R, the resident sugar addict, for his own good. When Fabio recently found out I&#8217;d been denying him devil&#8217;s food cake due to some spurious diet (that <em>he</em> instigated), he gave me the kind of look of hurt disappointment that only Labradors can muster when begging for food. The look that makes you melt instantly into a giant puddle of guilt and give in at once. I made the cake, we ate the lot in about 10 seconds flat and I started running 5 miles a day.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m generally crap at brownies &#8211; they either come out as overbaked rich cake, or underbaked and edible only with a spoon. </p>
<p>So yes, these ultra-decadent bars wouldn&#8217;t have been my first choice&#8230; but as previously noted, I&#8217;m finishing up all the bits and bobs in my cupboards before going back to Europe for the summer and I <em>just happened</em> to have a slab of chocolate, some vacuum packed chestnuts that needed to be used lest they expire as well as some sticky spice-soaked figs in the fridge&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just call it destiny. They are seriously good. Inevitably, Mr. R&#038;R has developed a serious dependency. Perhaps I need a brownie rethink? </p>

<li>This is optional and you can use the dried figs as they come, but I&#8217;d already prepared these sticky ones for an ice-cream: cover the figs for 5 minutes in just-boiled water, then simmer figs until tender in a sugar syrup (half water, half sugar) with a cinnamon stick, a strip of orange zest or other warm spices. Cool and store in the fridge.
<li>Preheat the oven to 150˚C. Meanwhile prepare the base, by lining an 8 inch / 20cm square tin with parchment. Process the graham crackers into crumbs, mix with the melted butter and press into the base of the tin in an even layer. Put in the fridge to set while you make the rest of the bars. Chop the white chocolate, chestnuts and figs. </li>
<li>When the oven is a temp, proceed. Melt the butter and chocolate together in a bain marie. </li>
<li>Whisk the butter and sugar together in a large mixing bowl until light and thick, about 5 minutes. </li>
<li>Stir in the chocolate to the butter/sugar, then fold in the figs, chestnuts and white chocolate. </li>
<li>Pile into the tin and bake for between 20-30 minutes &#8211; the top should be just starting to go a bit pale and speckly while a skewer inserted should come out covered with crumbs that are still gooey. Try not to overbake &#8211; I store these in the fridge so they&#8217;re easier to eat and cut.</li>

<li>Are you kidding? I haven&#8217;t tried this, but they&#8217;re so rich that I think these would freeze perfectly, defrost quickly and so be on hand for impromptu dinner parties, if you do that kind of thing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t throw the syrup from the sticky figs away: cook diced apple and raisins in it for a delicious compote that&#8217;s like apple strudel without the pastry. Add vanilla ice-cream. Thank me later.</li>

A plate of these hard little biscuits for the whole table, along with some sweet wine to dunk them in, is all anyone really needs. That, and a little lie down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a biscuit you must take your time over as dunking is more than a serving suggestion &#8211; it&#8217;s a requirement if you want to avoid dental work. Vin santo would be the canonical choice, but any dessert or fortified wine will do, as will a milky coffee or indeed tea. Dad would probably leave crumbs in his whisky glass. </p>
<p>This is the classic recipe. No chocolate chips, no fancy flavours, no icing. (And perfect to use up the half bag of almonds left in my pantry&#8230;)</p>

<ol class="instructions">
<li>Preheat the oven to 190˚C. When it&#8217;s nearly at temp, toast the almonds lightly, spread out on a baking sheet &#8211; about 8 minutes. Then remove and set aside the almonds. Line the baking sheet with non-stick parchment. </li>
<li>Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. </li>
<li>Beat the egg and yolk with the caster sugar and pinch of salt in an another large mixing bowl until very pale. Add the orange zest and melted butter and beat in too. Gradually add in the sifted flour mixture. Finally add the almonds and mix to disperse them evenly. </li>
<li>Divide the dough into two. Make two long squashed sausage shapes on the baking sheet, each about 3 fingers wide and 1 finger high. Brush with the beaten egg all over. Bake for half an hour until golden and firm in the centre. </li>
<li>Take out of the oven and cool briefly. Set the oven temperature to 110˚C. When it&#8217;s at temperature, cut each sausage along the diagonal into biscuits about 1.5cm wide. Lay each with one cut side up on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes on this side. Then turn them all over and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack. Store in an airtight container. </li>

Make the streusel topping while it&#8217;s heating up by rubbing in the 25g butter into the flour, almonds and sugar until it looks like breadcrumbs. Prepare a 8 inch / 20cm round springform tin by buttering and lining the base with baking parchment. </li>
<li>When the oven is at temp, start making the cake. </li>
<li>Sift the flour into a bowl. In another large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. </li>
<li>Add in eggs gradually, adding a tbsp of the flour with each addition. Stir in ground almonds and extract. Fold in the remaining flour. </li>
<li>Spoon the cake mixture into the tin, smooth out the top and lay the cherries on top. Sprinkle the streusel mixture on top of that and finally slivered almonds. Bake for 50 minutes until almonds are browned and a skewer comes out clean from the centre. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack. </li>

The countdown&#8217;s started and apart from the whole packing thing (which I&#8217;m just pretending isn&#8217;t going to happen), it means going through my kitchen cupboards and seeing what ingredients are threatening to go off before we get back in November. It&#8217;s basically going to be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Steady_Cook">Ready, Steady, Cook!</a> for the next few posts, so I apologise in advance for any culinary weirdness. (E.g. what would <em>you</em> make out of a tin of condensed milk, a handful of pistachios and a bag of instant farina? And see <a href="http://rumandreason.com/2011/08/seeded-rye-and-wheat-loaf/">this bread</a> for what to do with all those ends of bags of seeds and odd flours.)</p>
<p>Everything in the freezer has to go too &#8211; bits of stale bread, cooked beetroot, roast potatoes, blueberries and about a million egg whites &#8211; oh yes, and that 1.5kg of puff pastry I made a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, I was feeling pretty smug about making my own until I realised we&#8217;ve basically got to eat puff for every meal for a week. Bugger. Cheese straw, anyone?</p>
<p>Here we go then: this improvisation actually came out pretty much as I wanted it to. Tender asparagus spears nestled in a pillowy cloud of ricotta and parmesan, encased in billowingly crisp golden puff pastry. Sorry, I appear to be writing a country house hotel menu this evening. Anyway, 300g down, only 1.2kg to go&#8230;</p>

<div class="ingredients">
<h4  class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="ingredient">300g puff pastry</li>
<li class="ingredient">200g ricotta (supermarket stuff fine)</li>
<li class="ingredient">a bunch of asparagus</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 eggs</li>
<li class="ingredient">grated parmesan</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions">
<h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Preheat the oven to 180˚C. </li>
<li>Remove woody ends of aparagus and steam or boil them until tender, about 5 minutes. Refresh under cold water and pat dry. </li>
<li>Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface until about 3mm thick &#8211; I made mine into a rectangle about 7 x 9 inches which fit the asparagus in horizontal rows, but it&#8217;s a freeform tart which, thank goodness, hides a multitude of rolling sins. Place on a baking tray lined with non-stick paper. With a sharp knife, score a line about 3-4 cm in from the border of your pastry, to keep clear of filling so the pastry puffs up around it. </li>
<li>Mix the ricotta with a good handful of grated parmesan and one of the eggs and season well with salt and pepper. Lemon zest or juice might be nice too. Spread this all over the inner part of the pastry. Arrange the asparagus spears on top. </li>
<li>Beat the remaining egg lightly and brush over the outer border of the pastry. </li>
<li>Bake the tart for about half an hour, until puffed, golden and crispy around the outside, and the pastry has cooked through even in the middle. Cool to warm on a wire rack, so it doesn&#8217;t go soggy. </li>

<h4>Leftovers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leftover tart that doesn&#8217;t get eaten can be reheated in a hot oven for 5 minutes, then left to cool on a wire rack, to refresh its crispiness.</li>
<li>With the leftover ricotta and the asparagus spears that didn&#8217;t fit on the tart, I made a creamy pesto for pasta: I blended the cooked asparagus with a few extra florets of broccoli boiled until tender in the pasta water, a handful of pistachios and a couple of tablespoons of ricotta. Grated parmesan and olive oil to serve, as well as the last of the violet-green pistachios, chopped and sprinkled on top.</li>
</ul>

<p>The local food in Newfoundland can be generously categorized as &#8220;hearty&#8221;: let&#8217;s just say that scrunchions, or rendered pork lardons, form an integral part of the regional cuisine. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we ate really well for the most part &#8211; lobster, cod, rhubarb, bakeapples &#8211; but I was just craving healthy food when we got home. Apparently there are these green things called <em>vegetables</em>&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://rumandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/seededryewheatloaf-4-610x457.jpg" alt="Seeded wheat and rye loaf recipe from Dan Lepard" title="Seeded rye and wheat loaf from Dan Lepard" width="604" height="452" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2883" /></p>
<p>After many days of hiking though, the midday sarnie is proving difficult to give up. Instead of the god awful plastic sliced stuff that was the only bread around in Newfoundland, I would have loved to take slices of this nourishing loaf, maybe with some good sharp cheese and a crisp apple&#8230; And it&#8217;s dead easy too &#8211; no kneading, no shaping, just squish it all together and bake. I&#8217;ve adapted it slightly from the original, using different seeds, a longer soak and white wholemeal flour instead of white and spelt. Yum. </p>

<li class="ingredient">150g white wholewheat bread flour</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 tsp salt</li>
<li class="ingredient">A handful of extra seeds for the topping &#8211; I used black sesame</li>
</ul>

<div class="instructions">
<h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Toast the seeds for 15 minutes, spread out on a baking sheet at 180˚C in the oven. </li>
<li>Put the hot seeds in a large mixing bowl, cover with the water and leave to cool for an hour. </li>
<li>When the water is tepid, mix in the yeast and sugar and leave to get a head start on fermentation for 10 minutes or so. </li>
<li>Now mix in the rest of the ingredients, add a little more water if needed just to bring everything together in a stiff, not too sticky dough. Cover and leave for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Knead lightly for 10 seconds, then leave to rise for 45 minutes. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 200˚C. </li>
<li>Line a 2lb loaf tin with non stick paper. Shape the dough into a sausage of the same dimensions of your tin and squash it in. Brush with water and sprinkle with the topping seeds. Leave to prove until just very slightly risen, by a quarter (make a mark on the non stick paper). Dan says it&#8217;ll crumble if you leave it too long.</li>
<li>Bake for 45 minutes. Take out of the tin and wrap in a teatowel and leave overnight. </li>
<li>Slice quite thinly and eat with cheese, smoked fish, salted butter, speck&#8230; </li>
</ol>
