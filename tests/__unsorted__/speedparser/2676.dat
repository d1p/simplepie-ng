			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>by R.J. Villa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ed Rosenthal, you have held the title for close to 40 years as America’s Guru of Ganja; what would you like to say to NUG Magazine readers about your book, Happy Buds?</strong><br />
Beyond being an expert in growing marijuana, I’m also an expert in consuming it. Happy Buds is really the culmination of a lifetime spent smoking as much marijuana as possible. If you are a marijuana lover, you need this book; otherwise, you may find yourself smoking the wrong bud, which would be a huge disaster.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about your co-authors Anna Foster and Mamakind?</strong><br />
Anna and Mamakind are dedicated stoners without whom this book would never have been written. I should also point out that Mamakind has a new book that has just hit bookstores, Sex Pot: The Marijuana Lover’s Guide to Gettin’ It On. I highly recommend it for all my sexually active readers, including those who only engage in sex with themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The book talks about a research team; do you care to elaborate more on the background of this research team?</strong><br />
A loyal and hardworking group of ridiculously high people.</p>
<p><strong>Of all the strains listed in this book, which strains have you found that always make their way into your steady rotation of medical cannabis?</strong><br />
I enjoy all strains, so it’s hard to pick, but Jack Herer and Lemon Haze always seem to be around.</p>
<p><strong>Page 101 lists your personal Guru of Ganja coffee brew you start the day with; just curious, which coffee company do you typically buy your grounds from?</strong><br />
Trader Joe’s. Of course, caffeine is an extremely addictive substance and I strongly urge all readers to use caution when experimenting with it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your relation and connection with Cheba Hut?</strong><br />
Cheba Hut is my favorite marijuana-friendly fast food outlet. They make great salads and sandwiches and I expect that they will expand rapidly in the future – I just wish there was one in the Bay Area where I live!</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans for more volumes of Happy Buds in the future?</strong><br />
Of course! If the book is as popular as I expect it to be, I’ll absolutely write new volumes. After all, new strains of marijuana are being developed every day, so there are always new varieties to try out.</p>
<p><strong>Anything you would like to say about the seed companies or other companies featured in your book?</strong><br />
Seed breeders, both professional and amateur, are accomplishing amazing things these days. The future is bright for marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>Anything you would like to say about Quick American Publishing?</strong><br />
Long ago, I tried to get my first marijuana cultivation book published, but couldn’t find a publisher willing to take it on because they were either too scared or didn’t think there was a market. So, I formed Quick to publish my own books and here we are 30 or so books later. Quick is the premier publishing company when it comes to marijuana-related books and there are a number of younger, great authors who are also writing cultivation books that Quick publishes, like Subcool and SeeMoreBuds.</p>
<p><strong>We know you are active in writing your Ask Ed column in West Coast Cannabis and Soft Secrets as well as your coursework with Oaksterdam University; do you have any other projects or writing that you would like us to call attention to?</strong><br />
The latest edition of Marijuana Grower’s Handbook is a must-read for anyone who is interested in cultivation. Even if you are an experienced grower who thinks you know it all, I guarantee you that you will learn new techniques and concepts if you read it. Additionally, the Big Book of Buds series, which I also authored, is a great set for all marijuana enthusiasts. If people are interested in the struggle to legalize medical marijuana (as anyone reading this magazine presumably is), they should check out www.green-aid.com, which is a nonprofit I started that helps to pay the legal defense costs of defendants in high-profile medical marijuana cases.</p>
<p><strong>About Ed Rosenthal:</strong><br />
In the preface to Ed Rosenthal’s Marijuana Grower’s Handbook, R. Keith Stroup, Esq., NORML Founder and Legal Counsel, was quoted saying that “Ed Rosenthal is the best-known cultivation expert in America. He has written more than a dozen books on the topic; he is politically active and testifies as an expert in state and federal criminal cases. He was the recipient of the 2007 NORML Lifetime Achievement Award for advancing the cause of legal marijuana.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Esther Rubio-Sheffrey</strong></p>
<p>If you have had the pleasure of visiting Italy, or dining with an Italian family, you know that among the many things Italians do well, eating is one of them. Eating is an experience; there are courses; there is no rush; and you eat, eat, eat until your heart and stomach are both content.</p>
<p>Mangia Mangia is San Diego’s first gourmet Italian food truck. Owner and Chef Marko Pavlinovic says, “The literal translation means, eat, eat, but for Italians it is a way of living! Everything is mangia mangia, from the Berlusconi government to the food.”</p>
<p>Born and raised in Milan by Croatian parents who immigrated to Italy in the 1970’s, Pavlinovic is a Croatian-Italian chasing the American Dream. He speaks English with an Italian accent that is peppered with a few Italian words like “ciao” and “gratize.” The minute you order, he makes you feel at ease with his friendliness, and you would not know that his truck schedule and daily food preparations keep him busy from 5 a.m. to midnight each day.</p>
<p>“I became what Americans call a workaholic, but I love what I do. I believe in it, and I am giving everything that I possess to making Mangia Mangia successful,” Pavlinovic said, adding with a touch of humor, “Some people come here to become doctors and lawyers, but I came all the way from Italy to the U.S. to open a ‘roach coach’ – how smart is that?”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-14_11-55-16_221.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3346" title="2011-09-14_11-55-16_221" src="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-14_11-55-16_221-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></a></strong>Given the food truck trend and the following he is building, it is very smart and it is paying off. He has been serving San Diegans since March, and unexpectedly one day, he received a call from the Cooking Channel’s “Eat Street,” a show that celebrates North America&#8217;s tastiest, messiest and most irresistible street food. “When I got the call I thought it was a friend messing with me, and hung up the phone,” he recalls. “Even when they called me back, I didn’t believe it was true until the day of the shooting.”</p>
<p>“I am different than other trucks because I am not a fusion mix or whatever &#8211; I am Italian! My inspiration for food comes from what an Italian classic meal should be,” he said. “Sometimes for fun or special events, I will serve a bizarre Italian recipe like Grilled Bone Marrow over Saffron Risotto, Tempura Fried Frog Legs, Roman Tripe, or an Italian Lollipop [Tempura fried Meatballs on a stick].”</p>
<p>Pavlinovic’s goal is for Mangia Mangia to become a destination for friends and families, with more than one truck around town, and ultimately he wants Mangia Mangia to be known as a restaurant and not a truck. Like restaurants, he serves lunch and dinner, and whenever he can, he books two to three locations a day for his truck. One of his unique options is the prix fixe menu offered every Thursday night in conjunction with 57 Degrees Wine Shop in Mission Hills.</p>
<p>57 Degrees Wine Shop provides a comfortable setting for customers to purchase and drink various kinds of wine, but they do not serve food; so while you enjoy a bottle of your choice, Pavlinovic will serve you five courses at your table for $20/person(sample menus available online). It is a good way of tasting what Pavlinovic calls a slice of heaven.</p>
<p>The Food<br />
Every food truck review up to this point has been about a different spin on a burger, sandwich or French fries. In choosing Mangia Mangia, the idea of having something different, like some sort of pasta dish was extremely enticing. However, upon arriving at the truck for lunch, we both ended up with sandwiches and the ever-popular side item of fries, but that is not to say that our lunch was ordinary.</p>
<p>Pavlinovic’s biggest seller is his Chicken Parmigiana sandwich, and after tasting it, I can see why. It is true to its Italian roots. He starts with freshly baked Gibaldi&#8217;s Italian bread, which he purchases from Frank&#8217;s Bakery in Mission Hills. A layer of homemade marinara sauce with a good portion of garlic chunks is spread over the soft, chewy roll. He then adds the breaded chicken, tops it with fresh mozzarella and another layer of sauce, and the result is a simple and delicious sandwich with the right amount of gooeyness. It is very filling and well worth the $7 too.</p>
<p>While tempted by the Lobster Ravioli and the Broccoli and Sausage Lasagna, it was too hard to resist the Mangia Mangia Burger. It is a hefty beef patty boosted up with garlic onions and rosemary. Once grilled to perfection, it is topped with pancetta (salt-cured Italian bacon), melted gorgonzola, roasted red bell peppers, roasted tomatoes, and romaine lettuce. Too much to finish in one seating but too good to toss, this is a scrumptious burger, good both hot and cold, and a value at $7.</p>
<p>Both of these menu items had the option of a salad or fries as a side, and not to say that the steak cut fries were not good, but the sides were somewhat irrelevant because both main courses would have been just as good served on their own. To drink, Pavlinovic offers a variety of Italian San Pellegrino water flavors, and Coke in a glass bottle that is also imported from Italy, which, like its Mexican counterpart, is made with cane sugar.</p>
<p>“Mangia Mangia appreciates all the great comments we have received in our early stage of business, and we are really thankful to our beautiful city that gives us sunny days for serving the finest clientele,” he adds.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed a filling lunch for under $20, I am definitely going to have to try the pasta, and will likely do so on a Thursday for his prix fixe dinner menu and a bottle or two of wine. Pavlinovic is extremely tech-savvy, even his phone comes equipped with an app. that emails you a signed copy of your credit card transaction. He constantly updates his Facebook and Twitter accounts, so finding the nearest location is very easy. Follow him @ mangiatruck, and tune into the Cooking Channel on Oct. 11 at 8 p.m. to see him in action on “Eat Street.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another issue of NUG Magazine, San Diego’s Original Cannabis Publication!</p>
<p>It seems like last month flew by in the blink of an eye, and getting back in the groove of the school year schedule as a parent kicks my ass every year! Why can’t summer be longer?!?! Anyways, we are back in full swing over here at the NUG offices and are excited to bring you another great issue!</p>
<p>Our Chronisseur, the infamous Hopper, is of course reviewing some strains as usual, but was also under the needle getting tattooed by Pat Kim, the bassist for Unwritten Law and Sprung Monkey, while our contributing writer Pamela interviewed Pat about his new project Thousand Watt Stare!</p>
<p>Our other music coverage this month includes Three Legged Fox and Through the Roots.</p>
<p>Pamela also had time to interview another local attorney for her Legal Eyes column, this time talking with Lance Rogers.</p>
<p>Our artist profile this month is on Brad “SLAG” Sluder, written by Jed Sanders. Make sure to check out the article and his art at SLAGART.com.</p>
<p>We have heard and seen a bunch of rumors and press surrounding the new collective in El Cajon, Mother Earth Alternative Healing, so we sent two of our contributing writers, Pat Hegarty and Billy East, over there to get the scoop from the directors to hopefully shed some light on what they are all about.</p>
<p>We also have some great book reviews this month and a Q&amp;A with Ed Rosenthal!</p>
<p>Aaron Evans brings us another installment of Perpetual Motion and talks with Josh Opdenaker, a.k.a. JOP. His work is literally amazing and sometimes disturbing!</p>
<p>Last but not least, Mel the Bumbling Gardener wraps up his yearlong column “To Grow or Not to Grow” in this issue.</p>
<p>So kick back and twist one up and enjoy the new issue…You keep reading them and we will keep knocking them out for you every month!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Aaron Evans</strong></p>
<p>This month’s featured blower, “CREEP,” told me he sculpted this stunning blue lion pharaoh in just a few short hours, but I’m pretty sure he’s lying to me. See, I’m convinced he moonlights secretly as a tomb raider and just slipped me a stolen artifact unearthed from King Tut’s burial chamber. There’s absolutely no way this piece is from this century, and it would take one hard headed, cantankerous individual to get me to change my mind. In fact, I’m so positive I’m right that I’m sending it out for carbon dating as soon as I finish writing this article.</p>
<p>Of course, I kid. Fortunately for the readers of NUG Magazine, CREEP is bringing to life his ‘one of a kind’ creations at a prolific pace and managed to squeeze in a few extra hours into his day to make this stunning custom piece for me. I was lifted last issue when we presented J.A.G. as our featured artist, and landing these two back to back is almost surreal. If I wrote a short list of the blowers I was aiming to cover when I started this column, and only had a piece of parchment as big as your favorite rolling paper, I can guarantee you that these two would have been on that list. If glassblowing had an all-star team, it would be safe to say that you’re about to meet another one of its starting players.</p>
<p>Jacob Lee, aka “CREEP,” grabbed my attention at IGS displaying his eletroforming collaborations with “Big Pizzle.” Showcasing a battalion of zombies, ghouls, and even a centaur in his work, his line stood out to me in a crowded field fixated on emulating the monster movie era. I’m not normally drawn to much of anything with a dark theme, so the fact that I was seduced by his artistic style is a true testimony to his talent. I decided to ask him about this current trend in the culture, and what he had to say was both insightful and inspiring:</p>
<p>“Zombies are a hot trend and I think that it’s because when you go to where there are tons of people living crammed together, they seem to end up acting a little like zombies. The masses of people are, and always will be, sheeple or zombies. The people who are able to live in these times and keep their heads up, even while surrounded by zombies, will find each other and feed an alternative culture.”</p>
<p>Starting in the medium 15 years ago, CREEP spent several years exploring soft glass with friends on Vashon Island, just west of his home base in the Seattle/Yakima, Washington area. During this time, his younger brother, Joel, decided to jump behind a flame and take a few classes in soft glass’s distant cousin, torching working. After seeing the simplicity of his brother’s studio and the flexibility of the craft, he was hypnotized. A month or so later he was up and running off into a wilderness of self-exploration from which he has never looked back. Outside of a few classes over the years from the likes of renowned names in the glass community, such as “Ghost” and “Banjo,” Jacob’s style is forged from his own personal growth while reflecting external influences.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from everything under the sun, including nature, pop culture (particularly Star Wars) and Native American totem poles, his skill set is broad and diverse. Unlocking complex glass riddles, CREEP enjoys the challenge presented by constantly making custom orders for his many admirers. He figures, why not get paid to learn, as each piece insists that he pushes himself one step further into his overall evolution as an artist. Also, sighting H.R. Giger, the Swiss surrealist painter, sculptor, and set designer known for his netherworld imagery as another strong influence, Jacob attempts quite successfully to blend together these eclectic elements in each of his works. To sum it up in his own words, “I think glassblowing, at least the pipe art, is like the DJ music industry. I try to have my own sound, but I sample from other people’s music and blend it into mine. Other people sample from me and that’s fine, but make it your own.”</p>
<p>When I solidified CREEP for this month’s issue, I knew I had to take advantage of his open-mindedness to trying new things and his ability to actualize the abstract conceptual ideas fed to him by his customers. As I mentioned last month, my debut solo album, “Family Always Matters,” drops this October and I simply couldn’t resist the opportunity to request a piece based on my blue lion logo. After all, custom creations are his specialty. I sent him an advanced copy of the album to check out, and when he told me he was really digging my musical stylings, I was honored.</p>
<p>Trying to describe to someone how to make any form of art is a complex conundrum. I went through hundreds of pictures, sent numerous emails, and used countless descriptive words to outline my vision. Notions such as honorable, proud and noble were juxtaposed against words like stern, defiant, and fearless. Still, I wanted Jacob to add his own personal flavor. I wanted it to be made for me, but still carry the unmistakable trademarks of this master’s touch. What he brought to the table as</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>100% Made with Love</strong><br />
Are you looking for a great hemp seed product with integrity and quality? Jeff’s Best Hemp offers just that! I met Jeff at my local farmer’s market and was drawn to his booth by his sign that read: “Delicious and Nutritious, with Nothing Suspicious!” At least I knew he had a sense of humor.</p>
<p>I quickly learned about the care and devotion he puts into his line of products so that he can share the health benefits they provide with other individuals. He offers products that are raw, vegan, gluten-free, organic, cruelty-free, and non-GMO. If you prefer your hemp seeds lightly toasted with sea salt, garam masala flavored, or mixed with cacao – he’s got that too! Jeff takes care of every detail down to the packaging to ensure that his products represent everything that is important to him. I wanted to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>How did Jeff’s Best Hemp get started?</strong><br />
For me, it was about not being happy with the choices that were available out there.  I’ve been a vegan for almost 20 years, I’m a cancer survivor, and I always make decisions based on what I would want to find. A few years back, when I started learning a lot more about hemp and getting even more nutritionally savvy, I got to the hemp category and kept revisiting it because I love it.  I loved the nutrient density. And the more I learned, the more and more I really liked what it offered.</p>
<p>The only choices that were available then, I wasn’t really happy about. They were all in plastic, all the same stuff that had been there for years, things in canisters – people were just really flippant about it. My mom is a cancer survivor as well and I worked doing brokering for Flora [Flora Incorporated is a distributor of Udo’s Choice Products in the U.S. and Canada] for years; they do a lot of their stuff in glass &#8211; I love their work, I love Udo, and I think he’s an awesome guy. When I came to the hemp category, I was just irritated! So, I started saving my cash and about 2 years later I launched my first products.</p>
<p><strong>I love that Jeff’s Best Hemp offers such a wide range of products, flavors, and tastes; you don’t just limit yourself to hemp seeds. What two products do you recommend for our readers who aren’t familiar with you?</strong><br />
I would say the hemp protein and cold filtered hemp seed oil because of the nutritional impact; systemically and for your overall homeostasis. The benefits are so wide-ranging.</p>
<p><strong>Hemp seeds and hemp seed oils are a great source for plant-based omega-3 fatty acids. As a society, we’ve become deficient in our intake of omega-3’s, and our overconsumption of omega-6’s has made this deficiency even more pronounced. Freshness is so important with omega-3’s and spoilage is a concern. How do you ensure quality in your products?</strong><br />
We have a temperature controlled facility tucked in the hills of San Juan Capistrano under tons of metal and concrete. We keep it at a nice low temperature all the time and that’s the way you preserve freshness.</p>
<p>We also do everything in really fresh, small batches and we’re one of the only companies that really does that. Rather than having two or three thousand bottles done at the beginning of the year, we actually do them in nice small batches; so closer to two or three hundred per batch.</p>
<p><strong>It really shows that you put a lot of care in your products. Where can we find them?</strong><br />
We are at Whole Foods, Jimbo’s, Henry’s, and other natural markets. You can check out the ‘Now Available At!’ link on our website for up-to-date listings. You can also order through Amazon.com by going to the ‘Shop!’ link on our website.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Mel the Bumbling Gardener</strong><br />
<strong>Part 3 “50 day harvest”</strong></p>
<p>As you might remember from last month’s story, I have been moving my new clones from the “Veg” side of the Quick Grow’s Q-9 Greenhouse to the “Bloom” side with the 12-on and 12-off light cycle as soon as they reached the magic 7-inch size. Like I said last month, I have never tried to bloom a plant that small; I always thought the plant should be at least 12 inches tall before the bloom cycle should be started.</p>
<p>The first clones to reach their size were moved and encouraged to bloom on June 1st, an easy date to remember. This grow was on track in every way I could measure: size, color, leaf size, root mass; and just the overall look of what was growing in the chamber was great. The only thing that still puzzled me was “the gas.” I still couldn’t see or smell it at all and the gauge on the tank didn’t really move much; but what the heck, the plants that were moved to bloom seemed to grow like crazy and everyone looked really healthy.  As the days passed, I watched in true amazement as to how fast the clones turned into plants, all the while reaching for the light at the top of the chamber, growing like the magic seeds Jack planted in the story we all read when we were kids.</p>
<p>It was fun to watch the growing stages of the different rows of plants put into bloom at different times.  As the days marched on, each strain started to show its own personality and ability to bloom with the 12-on and 12-off light cycle. By the end of June, I had all 9 blooming plants well on their way to the finish line. I had rows of plants all growing at the same time in different stages of finish just like I wanted…Very cool.</p>
<p>With 30 days down, I had only (+ or -) 30 more days of growing to get that “Harvest Every 60 Days” claim from Quick Grow.  The first planted, 7-inch clones are now about 18 inches tall with the rest of the pack not too far behind. The plants on this grow look very different from what had come out of my other chambers (Spinner and Phototron). This greenhouse grows a very “Sea of Green” kind of plant; taller, not as bushy and with more distance between the buds…Very tasty looking.</p>
<p>It’s now July 8th. The first planted are just full of white hairs, sticky and dank with that smell…You know that sweet smell of success.  I have been trimming my first row of ladies just to show the younger plants what they have to aspire to in the up-and-coming days ahead. From what I could tell, my first row of planted was starting to show signs that it was finished growing and was now in the finishing days of flower. Did I say I hadn’t seen the gauge on the tank go down? Tap, tap&#8230;Nope, I can’t really say that the gas gauge is any different today than it was the day I hooked it up; I think I may have a problem.</p>
<p>“Hello Gus, (Quick Grow Hydroponics) I think I may have a problem with the gas on the Q-9 you sent me…I did just as you said to do when I got the unit…plug it in and set the time. The greenhouse has shown great success with very tasty looking buds in a very short amount of time, but…I thought the size of the buds would be much bigger than plants grown without gas.” In less than 2 seconds Gus asked me if I had remembered to turn the gas on.  Turn the gas on? Yes, yes I did. Right after I hooked up the filled CO2 tank to the regulator, I turned on the gas.  “Good job, but did you ‘set the timer’ to ‘Gas ON’?” Now you know why I’m called the “Bumbling Gardener.” No, I never set the timer to turn on the CO2 gas and that’s why the tank gauge never moved.  All I could do was shake my head; this was a real disappointment. I just realized that “Growing with Gas” just went “up in smoke.”  Oh well, Gus talked me through the timer adjustment. He even made sure the gas came on, and the vent fans were off long enough to let the gas settle on the plants before the vents powered back up. I thanked Gus for his help and went back to counting the days until harvest.</p>
<p>July 15th – The first planted row looks like it’s really in flower with rows 2 and 3 not very far behind. I was surprised at how fast the 2nd and 3rd planted rows were catching up with row 1. I am beginning to think that if I want to harvest plants all year long, I need to space the planting further apart. Maybe even 2 weeks or longer would work better, and I still think larger clones; maybe 10 to 12 inches would finish closer to the top of the chamber.</p>
<p>July 20th – Just 50 days into the grow and row 1 is finished…Nice size buds, very sticky with that great red/orange hair appeal; they look just great. If what you’re looking for is a fast turn, this chamber kicks ass; and with a few more adjustments on the planting times and size of clones, I should be able to harvest every 60 to 65 days with a bigger “gassed up” bud size.</p>
<p>Unlike my other chambers, the Quick Grow keeps me on the grow with 2 sides to this chamber. Clones turn into plants all the time, it never stops. If it’s not 18/6, it’s 12/12. All you have to do is move the plants 1 time and trim, trim, trim until harvest.</p>
<p>Come back next month to see what else I found in my new Quick Grow Greenhouse.</p>

<p>Buck-O-Nine and The Aggrolites played at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, CA. It was Friday night and a show like this deserves a toast of some type of drink. Buck-O-Nine is a legendary ska/punk band from San Diego who played in the mid-‘90s when the original Sublime was hitting up Southern Cali’s music scene too. And The Aggrolites are well-known for their “dirty reggae.” The crowd for this show, which took place on September 9th, was amazing too!</p>
<p>Buck-O-Nine is well-known in San Diego. If you haven’t heard of them, visit their website right now at <a href="http://www.buckonine.com">www.buckonine.com</a>. Otherwise, you know them! At the time, Buck-O-Nine had a different kind of ska sound during the post-grunge era. This band still carries amazing bass lines, superb horns, and amazing vocals. It was refreshing to hear their music, especially because it was clean and classic.</p>
<p>The Aggrolites took to the stage after Buck-O-Nine and the crowd was ready to keep skankin’ . The Aggrolites have amazing fans who know their “dirty reggae.” Basically, the band brings early-style reggae, rockabilly, and funk to the scene – wow, what a mix! The use of an organ is a trip and Jesse Wagner is an entertaining front-man, especially when he told all the “crazy people in the front” to make some noise…and they did! The best part was when Wagner worked up the crowd with their self-pronounced Dirty Reggae! Their fans raged at this, and you bet they demanded an encore. Songs included “Work To Do,” “Someday,” and of course, “Dirty Reggae;” and for the encore, they covered The Beatles’ “Don’t Let Me Down” in which the crowd sang along too. The most memorable part was when they gave a shout-out to a man who lost a tooth from the soft mosh-pit during Buck-O-Nine.</p>

On Wednesday, September 14, Synrgy played with Tommy Dubs at Club Kingston, a free reggae show at Winston’s Beach Club in Ocean Beach, San Diego. Synrgy was visiting from Ashland, Oregon, where the band is now based since leaving Humboldt County. The band plays dub reggae rock, and they are pretty good at it. They use classic reggae keys, a headless bass for dubbing, and they have fantastic reggae drops. At one point, the singer Brian, used a melodica in a song. Two songs were also ska/rock. I must state, the drums were a bit overpowering in relation to the rest of the instruments in the beginning and end of the set, and the two rock songs kind of threw off the reggae playlist. Overall though, the music was solid, the reggae was classic, and the lyrics were for the most part, conscientious.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Rachel Anders &amp; Scott Whytsell</strong></p>
<p>It was 4:20 and we were out and about doing “our” thing and craving some “CHRONIC” food when we met up with the owner of Chronic Tacos of San Diego’s franchise, Brett Williams. We wanted to learn more about CHRONIC TACOS and what all the buzz is about! Chronic Tacos has been around since 2001 and went international this year expanding to Canada. Chronic Tacos is known for healthy authentic Mexican food from third generation recipes. Brett and his business partner Joe Vahedi co-own the two locations in San Diego’s North Coastal County: Encinitas (corner of El Camino and Encinitas Blvd.) and the other in Solana Beach off Lomas Santa Fe (first shopping center east off 5 freeway and Lomas Santa Fe). Being the picky Californians that we are, we know good Mexican food, and we know that CHRONIC TACOS IS JUST THAT: CHRONIC! We ordered the beef “Fatty” taquitos, which were the best and biggest taquitos we’ve ever had. You could actually taste the meat (not just the shell), and each taquito was individually dressed with sour cream, homemade salsa, and guacamole. We also ordered the machaca burrito and it was SO flavorful and stellar! The nice thing about the machaca burrito is that it’s served all day and night, unlike in some other places. We both ordered different items to have variety and we both agreed – FOOD COMA! After we finished, we chatted with Brett and raved about Chronic Tacos, and thanked him for introducing them to SD.</p>
<p><a href="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/burrito.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3294" title="burrito" src="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/burrito-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a><strong>How long has Chronic Tacos been opened down south here?</strong><br />
Chronic Tacos has been opened in Encinitas for 6 months, and Chronic Tacos Solana Beach for 3 months! It’s been a busy and crazy productive few months.</p>
<p><strong>We have to ask, what is your favorite dish?</strong><br />
I LOVE the carnitas tacos! I eat them everyday- no joke. Why our carnitas are so yummy are that the carnitas is slow-cooked fresh everyday for three hours (melts in your mouth). I also love our beer-battered fish tacos!</p>
<p><strong>What are the most popular items on the menu?</strong><br />
Our carne asada tacos and our carnitas tacos! Our taquitos are so filling &#8211; “We Roll Fatties here.”</p>
<p><strong>What is the connection with pro skater and actor stuntman Weeman?</strong><br />
He owns the Redondo Beach location and it’s featured in Jackass 3 the movie!</p>
<p><strong>What makes Chronic Tacos a step above the “other” places?</strong><br />
Our name, Taco Life theme, our atmosphere, artwork, music, you can watch action sports Fuel TV, and obviously, most importantly, our higher quality of food!</p>
<p><strong>Well, its obvious Chronic Tacos thinks about the “little” things! Your tables are personalized, the artwork per store is individualized “surf theme in SD,” the napkin dispensers, soda fountain, all the decor boasts chronic tacos! You even have a convenient ice cream freezer! What have you guys not thought of?</strong><br />
We thought of our hungry customers and giving them an inviting, awesome food experience!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans for Chronic Tacos in SD?</strong><br />
We are SO excited, our next location is planned for PB and we can’t wait!</p>
<p><strong>It’s nice you have specials on Monday and Tuesday nights for your hungry customers!</strong><br />
We do whatever we can for the community such as donations and sponsoring action sports stars and events!</p>
<p><strong>Well Brett, our food was amazing. Thanks for sharing Chronic Tacos with San Diego! Congrats on all your hard work and future success. Here’s to Taco Life at Chronic Tacos!!</strong><br />
Thanks NUG Magazine! Come in whenever you are hungry and wanting Chronic Tacos!!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><a href="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/San-DIego-City-Hall.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3327" src="http://nugmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/San-DIego-City-Hall-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>By: Terrie Best, <a href="http://www.safeaccesssd.org">San Diego Americans for Safe Access</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In the afternoon session of today’s San Diego City Council Meeting, The Council voted 7 to 1 to repeal the restrictive zoning ordinance which, if allowed to pass would have identified zones for medical marijuana collectives to exist but at the same time relegated them to far flung industrial areas and forcing a closure while collectives relocated and embarked on a strenuous processing procedure to re-open in those zones.</p>
<p>City Council’s repeal of the ordinance was forced by a referendum funded by the PCA, a local group of collective operators who advocate for regulations but had issue with the initial closure and tough processing procedure to re-open. The referendum provided two choices to the Council repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.</p>
<p>This afternoon council voted for the 2nd and final time to repeal without resorting to a ballot vote.</p>
<p>In response to public comment and as the single nay vote, Marti Emerald, who had exhibited leadership on this issue, convening a Medical Marijuana Task Force last year, rejected ideas that there was political will on the Council to continue to push forward for another ordinance.</p>
<p>Ms. Emerald’s nay vote reflected her position that the issue of the ordinance belongs on the ballot, an endeavor which, if it had passed, would have cost the City upwards of eight-hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Ms. Emerald also suggested mediation between all the interested parties and identified The National Conflict Resolution Center as a possible candidate to help mediate.</p>
<p>San Diego Americans for Safe Access, Vice Chair, Marcus Boyd has made preliminary contact with the NCRC in effort to begin that process.</p>
<p>Although today the City Council ratified the repeal of the restrictive ordinance, the repeal closed off lawful zones in which to relocate. In other words, before the ordinance passed, there were no zones; when the ordinance passed it created zones; and since the passage of the referendum there are again no zones and safe access is in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>As early as last week the City Attorney’s office filed lawsuits against twelve dispensaries in the city pledging to continue litigation in waves until all dispensaries were shuttered.</p>
<p>The collectives who funded the referendum were planning on following up the repeal with their own voter initiative that would create more reasonable regulations than what the City had originally passed. As of yet, no initiative has been circulated for signatures. The PCA instead is trying to lobbying Council members to enact a resolution temporarily staying code enforcement and the lawsuits filed by the City Attorney.</p>
