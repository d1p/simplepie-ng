			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since our last post, and this time there&#8217;s a valid reason: there has been an incredible amount of change in the last couple of months.</p>
<p>We moved our company to New York City. It made sense for us to be closer to publisher clients (NYC is the center of the media universe after all) and our investors. We were also fortunate to find some amazing new colleagues to join our team as we grow our business in NYC. Dan Masarsky, Shesha Pancholi and Jen Mohan all joined NewsCred last quarter, and we&#8217;ll have a separate post introducing them. We also signed some amazing new clients across a number of different verticals, and we&#8217;re especially excited to welcome Yahoo! as a client.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;re going to be ramping up our presence in NYC and across the country in general &#8211; that means organizing events, attending meetups and exhibiting and participating at conferences.</p>
<p><strong>On March 3rd, we&#8217;re excited to be attending PaidContent 2011, one of the pre-eminent media conferences in the country. If you&#8217;re attending, please do let us know and we&#8217;d love to meet you.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also be organizing a happy hour after the conference &#8211; details TBD, but keep it free!</p>
<p><strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NewsCred is headed to the Online News Association&#8217;s <a href="http://conference.journalists.org/2010conference/overview/sponsors/" target="_blank">annual conference</a> next week (Oct 28-30th) in Washington D.C. We&#8217;re especially excited to be one of the sponsors/<a href="http://conference.journalists.org/2010conference/overview/sponsors/" target="_blank">exhibitors</a>, so come meet us at booth 33! We&#8217;ll be unveiling some incredible new products and will also officially launch our new US business, so this is a chance to introduce the new NewsCred to the online news industry.</p>
<p>As many of you know, we&#8217;ve been based in Geneva, Switzerland for the past two years. I&#8217;m thrilled to say that we recently moved our headquarters to New York City in order to be closer to our customers and partners. As a result, we&#8217;ve significantly expanded our team, and a few of us will be in Washington D.C. ready to meet you at the ONA conference. I&#8217;ll post a separate entry introducing the new additions to the NewsCred family.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very proud to say that we recently launched our a multilingual news site for a client in Sweden. Check it out here: <a href="http://nyheter.lokaldelen.se" target="_blank">http://nyheter.lokaldelen.se/</a></p>
<p>Not only is the entire site in Swedish, it is fully hosted by NewsCred (i.e. white-labaled solution), and combines both topic pages and local news. We provide aggregated local news at the city level for 10 Swedish cities, like <a href="http://nyheter.lokaldelen.se/city/04a1732e5ff6f56f1e70c89601d6da5d/stockholm/">Stockholm</a> or <a href="http://nyheter.lokaldelen.se/topic/38f27c566fa4881d1d36ab693fbfca28/malm%C3%B6">Malmo</a>. For topic pages, you can get a feel for some of the topic pages by looking at the <a href="http://nyheter.lokaldelen.se/topics">topic page directory</a>.</p>
<p>Local news is a hard problem to solve, as is topic contextualization. In this case, we&#8217;ve done both and combined with internationalization! We now have clients who use the <a href="http://platform.newscred.com">NewsCred Platform</a> for content in English, German, French, Italian and now Swedish. Great job to the NewsCred team to get this up and running in just two weeks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could have taken my last post and just changed the words &#8220;Johnston Press&#8221; to &#8220;Freedom Communications,&#8221; but that would be too cheeky. Instead I&#8217;ll just link over to Paid Content, <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-freedoms-valley-morning-star-drops-its-pay-wall/" target="_blank">who reports that another large media publisher has decided to end its paywall experiment</a>. This time it&#8217;s Freedom Communications, who tested a full paywall at the Valley Morning Star, a small town newspaper in Texas. Today, there is a banner on the site that says <a href="http://www.valleymorningstar.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;We Moved Back to a Completely Free Site.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Freedom Interactive president Doug Bennett, told Paid Content that “there are no plans to expand pay walls at this time” and described the <em>Morning Star</em> paywall as a “useful test to  determine whether there was an effective balance between a free,  advertising-supported model and a paid-use model in one of our local  markets.”</p>
<p>One by one, news sites are putting up paywalls and taking them down. We all saw this coming, but now there is empirical evidence that paywalls (at general news sites without differentiation or a clear niche) simply do not work. How many more trials will it take before Rupert Murdoch is convinced? The biggest test begins in June when he puts up the <a href="http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/61480,business,times-and-sunday-times-to-charge-1-pound-per-day-online-subscription-pay-wall" target="_blank">much-anticipated paywall around the Times</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: I was originally going to put a link to this <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6431d7f2-38b3-11df-9998-00144feabdc0.html" target="_blank">FT article</a> that last line,  but then changed it to a different source since I wasn&#8217;t sure how many of our readers would even be able to read the FT articles. Think paywalls wont change blogging behavior? Think again.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve said before on an number of occasions, I commend newspapers that are trying to take concrete actions and willing to experiment to find new business models. The more one experiments and innovates, the more momentum one builds towards solving some of the urgent problems facing the news industry. However, momentum without a clear direction is not always a good thing, especially if the momentum is taking you towards a cliff. It seems like Johnston Press was heading that way, and has stopped itself barely inches from the edge.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Johnston Press introduced a paywall around select local news sites, including the Whitby Gazette and the Southern Reporter. Users were asked to pay 5 pounds a month for access to full stories. How many subscribed? According to the a source within the newspaper, the trial was a &#8220;disaster&#8221; and subscriptions were in the &#8220;single-digits.&#8221; <em>Disaster </em>is putting it too mildly. Just to be clear, there have been no official comments from the company, which says the paywall was merely an experiment to collect data and learn about their options.</p>
<p>And now, just 5 months after its introduction, the paywall is definately gone. I was able to read full stories in all sections on the <a href="http://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/" target="_self">Whitby</a> site without any problems. The information about single-digit subscriptions comes from a source that talked to <a href="http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/news/100331paywall.shtml" target="_self">HoldTheFrontPage.co.uk</a>, a site covering the industry that also broke the news of the paywall going up. As such, I can&#8217;t comment on the accuracy, but it&#8217;s clear that the results were bad enough for Johnston to backtrack.</p>
<p>As in the case of NewsDay, it&#8217;s clear that people simply aren&#8217;t ready to take out their credit cards when there are so many alternatives. Even if the price is low, the mere introduction of cost means publishers face the same <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fredeye.firstround.com%2F2007%2F03%2Fthe_first_penny.html&amp;ei=QHizS9KlH4uwNtTk8JwE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMOzOfwxy_Jt4UAim4XOoDO2Q2Hg&amp;sig2=eknJVi0pjAg0jF7oKq6ecw" target="_blank">penny-gap problem that startups face</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a tough week for Johnston Press as they&#8217;re now <a href="http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-publishing/18-subs-go-in-johnston-press-massacre-201003317794/" target="_self">facing a potential strike</a>, have let go of people and are faced with very disgruntled staff (and a mountain of debt).</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sad to see them face so many different problems, I do wish Johnston Press the best of luck as they try and experiment further and come up with other (non-paywall) solutions. I personally know a lot of bright people who work at JP, so I&#8217;m sure there is plenty of room for innovation and I look forward to seeing what comes next.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Really interesting <a href="http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/johnston-press-dropping-paywall/" target="_self">post here from Malcolm Coles</a> about the poor landing page and conversion funnels on the Johnston press sites. Sounds familiar? I said the exact same thing about the <a href="http://blog.newscred.com/?p=239">NewsDay registration funnel</a>. Startups do a great job at A/B testing and landing page optimization &#8211; tracking metrics obsessively can make huge differences in signups. Newspaper tech guys could learn a lesson or two from the startup peers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Sportpost" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object2/1550/94/n242852130033_2393.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" />I&#8217;m excited about the launch of <a href="http://www.sportpost.com">Sportpost</a>! Its one of the first European sports sites that combines awesome videos, news, celeb blog posts, and an obsessive community. If it sounds like a lot, it is &#8211; and they&#8217;ve executed wonderfully. There&#8217;s a lot of competition in the US, with Yardbarker and Fan Nation coming to mind. However, a community sports site with heavy fan involvement in the UK or Europe is definately lacking.</p>
<p>But the biggest twist is the superstar bloggers they&#8217;ve signed up, including exclusive deals from athletes including England rugby international James Haskell, 2010 Cheltenham Gold Cup runner-up, renowned jockey A.P. McCoy and England footballer, West Ham striker Carlton Cole. The list goes on, and it&#8217;s very impressive. They also have some great HD video content, and a very impressive amount of sports news content (powered from the NewsCred Platform!). Fans can customize their Sportpost page, set up all the topics they&#8217;re interested in, and then get a custom news feed with multimedia news content and social media.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Charlie, Peter and the team for getting this off the ground. I have no doubt this is going to be a massive success, and we&#8217;re excited to be partnering with them to allow fans to ‘share your sport with the world!’</p>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://www.sportpost.com">Sportpost and check it out now</a>!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m embedding a presentation given by Google&#8217;s Chief Economist, Hal Varian, at a FTC workshop recently. He discusses the economics of the newspaper industry and presents quite a lot of interesting data. Nothing earth shattering, but a nice, concise summary of the state of affairs. Unfortunately, most of the graphs point to the right and down.</p>
<p>The most telling stat for me was the breakdown of costs. I&#8217;ve always maintained that the economics of print simply do not make sense and the cost side of the equation needs to be completely overhauled. According to Varian, 52% of the cost is made up of  production, printing and raw materials. Only 35% of the costs are dedicated to &#8220;core&#8221; functions, of which only 14% is dedicated to editorial. No other business in the world devotes a meagre 14% of resources to their core competency.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he doesn&#8217;t present too many solutions. He mentions significant product differentiation (to avoid the economics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition" target="_blank">Bertrand competition</a>) and gives examples such as local high school football scores and industry specific content. Also mentioned is the vague &#8220;something that cannot be imitated.&#8221; Here are some things I think cannot be immitated by larger, online competitors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Local sports &#8211; its unlikely that there will be a lot of similar coverage for the local high school football or soccer team</li>
<li>Local civic news &#8211; news from the town hall, police departments and other civic news that is valuable to local residents</li>
<li>Local &#8220;people&#8221; news &#8211; write about the people in the area. People would love to see themselves or people they know in the news, and I think there are some opportunities for news organizations to really focus on this.</li>
<li>Aggregate local news from media/blog partners &#8211; nothing much to add here. But make your site the one-stop-shop for all news local, and partner with high quality local bloggers.</li>
<li>Local industry news &#8211; if you are in New Jersey, obsessively cover the local pharma industry. In Detroit? Provide compelling reporting on the auto industry and take advantage of your geographic proximity to the news sources. In Boulder? Cover biotech. Send real journalists to talk to the people in the industry.</li>
<li>Local reviews &#8211; review local restaurants, shows, events.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice something common about points 1-6? Yes: local, local local. But the key is that newspapers can&#8217;t be half-hearted about this because readers will just go to the blogs or online sources that specialize in this content. Instead, newspapers should have laser-like focus on the areas where it thinks it can produce unique, differentiated content. Resources should be re-allocated away from general or national news to these high-impact sections. Of course, you can do all of this but will still sink if you can&#8217;t get rid of the dead-weight: production costs.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is the presentation:</p>

<p><span><span>Being in a startup, the most important lesson we learn every day is how much we actually don&#8217;t yet know. And that thirst for discovery and knowledge is what drives us each day.</span></span></p>
