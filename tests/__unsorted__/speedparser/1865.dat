			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>- Leveraging your participation in a conference to the benefit of yourself, your team and your network</strong></p>
<p>If all you are planning on doing at the next conference is to learn something from the sessions and the exhibits, my advice would be to save your money, focus on your work, and ‘get the dvd’. As we all know, attending conferences isn’t just about the sessions, the keynote speakers, or the product demos. The values you attain from attending conferences are all in the periphery, they are about the ‘X Factors’, those that help you , your team and your company get ahead professionally.</p>
<p>As project and program management professionals, keeping up with the latest techniques, tools and methodologies is part of what keeps us relevant and in hot demand across industries and geographies.  Managing our time to allow for professional development in addition to keeping up with demanding schedules and managing our teams, we need to ensure that we spend time the continued need to develop our skills, build our network and share our knowledge with others.</p>
<p>Attending a conference or a symposium can be a good way to get a check in all the boxes above, while also allowing you to de-couple from the work environment and the team and focus the attention to you.  The goal should be to find opportunities to attend a conference where you can add valuable skills, knowledge or connections to help you as well as your company and together achieve your common goals.</p>
<p><a href="http://svprojectmanagement.com/the-hidden-value-of-conferences-and-symposiums/virtual-conference" rel="attachment wp-att-7540"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7540" src="http://svprojectmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Virtual-conference-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>Project and Program Management professionals tend to be thirsty for knowledge and to network with others, it is after all one of our core skills, communication, and what we spend a large portion of our time doing.</p>
<p>As part of my development I have chosen a couple of conferences in the month of October and will be looking to achieve all of the objectives above, to further my knowledge, my network and add knowledge back to the field. I’ll be attending a Six Sigma/Lean conference at Cisco, an IT Strategy Conference in Chicago and the Silicon Valley PMI Annual Symposium in San Jose. It’ll be a busy month for sure.</p>
<p>Choosing to attend and participate in a conference can have a wealth of additional hidden values and benefits that most of us don’t think about when we go. I usually go into a conference with these in the back of my head and hope to utilize some of them along the way as I participate. Since many of our blog readers attend conferences both in the San Francisco Bay Area and other places in the world, I thought that I would share it with you, and perhaps you can share with me some of the hidden values and benefits you derive from attending conferences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Here are a few of the areas on my list that I’ll touch on:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tough Problems to solve:</strong> What is your current ‘nutcracker’ issue that you and your team are working on and can’t make headway on?</li>
<li><strong>Leading Change &amp; Transformation:</strong> What change are you leading in your organization, and what pitfalls and leverage points can others share?</li>
<li><strong>Growing and learning by fixing other people’s problems:</strong> What key piece of new information do you have from your experience that can help others?</li>
<li><strong>Connecting the right people:</strong> Who at the conference needs to meet? Who can you help introduce to mutually derive value.</li>
<li><strong>Conduit of knowledge:</strong> Who from your team could benefit from this? What nugget of gold can you bring back that your teams can leap-frog the current progress by using?</li>
<li><strong>Future opportunities to present your topic of interest:</strong> Determining how you can make the right connections with organizers to be a future presenter.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteering:</strong> Finding ways to help the conference organizers succeed by lending a helping hand.</li>
<li><strong>Your ‘Social Presence’:</strong> Sharing what you learn and what you think ‘live’ with your network and get immediate feedback to help your learning further.</li>
<li><strong>Mentoring and helping others succeed:</strong> Spend part of your time helping others succeed by showing them the ropes and making beneficial introductions to others in the field</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following posts I’ll share why I keep these in mind, what benefit they have for myself and those I meet, examples, and any tips I have learned along the way.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your stories and tips as well in the comments section.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://svprojectmanagement.com/the-myth-about-project-managers-2/dragon" rel="attachment wp-att-7528"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7528" src="http://svprojectmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dragon-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="105" height="105" /></a>Let’s get out of the dark ages and admit what we know. Project manager is a misnomer. We don’t manage projects, we drive change.</p>
<p>Set aside the process and tactics associated with projects and you will easily separate those who manage projects versus those who lead. Leadership is not about your credentials or accomplishments; it’s about your presence. It’s what’s inside you that makes you stand out to others. Simply stated, leadership is often defined by how others view you.</p>
<p>In today’s frenetic business environment, it gets complicated. You know you have experience and knowledge, yet others see it as arrogance. When you believe you are contributing in a real and meaningful way, others see it as butting in. When you think you are delegating effectively, others see it as shirking responsibility. Strong leaders just can’t win.</p>
<p>Only in the last five years have project managers been recognized as needing keen technical skills and top management skills to be effective. In fact, some believe grooming project managers with a 360-degree focus on all key leadership attributes is a successful recipe for creating future business leaders and CEOs. Do you have what it takes to reach this level?</p>
<p>We can teach project managers process and technique; true leadership is harder to grasp and often the differentiating factor between success and failure. Set aside your methodology, your tools, and your checklists for just a moment and consider these questions as you assess your leadership attributes:</p>
<p>• Do you inspire a shared vision?<br />
• Do you encourage both the head and the heart?<br />
• Do you inspire trust?<br />
• Do you have a long-term perspective?<br />
• Do you act as an innovator?<br />
• Do you focus on people?<br />
• Do you give purpose and meaning?<br />
• Are you committed to the cause?</p>
<p>Now that you have contemplated these questions of yourself, consider the most important question: How would others answer these questions of you? Strong leaders must obtain honest, helpful feedback. How many times have you asked for feedback today? In the last week? In the last month?</p>
<p>Take the first step to improve your leadership qualities today. Be brave and ask for feedback. Then be courageous and act upon it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://svprojectmanagement.com/pay-it-forward/pay-it-forward3" rel="attachment wp-att-7521"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7521" src="http://svprojectmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pay-it-forward3-150x150.gif" alt="" width="120" height="120" /></a>I recently had the opportunity to speak to an audience of PMO leaders. The event is designed to support PMO leaders through the exchange of best practices and expert advice. Interestingly, the majority of attendees this year were quite novice &#8211; over 55% of workshop participants had less than one year experience establishing or managing a PMO. Yet, we focused on the same short list of PMO-related challenges. Regardless of tenure or experience, all PMO leaders are hungry for information; they want to exchange best practices and share lessons learned. Every PMO leader longs to become a member of an extended project management community-to support and be supported among their peers and colleagues. After the conference and during my return flight to Boston, I contemplated the power of collaboration among PMO leaders everywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>Sure, the U.S. is in a recession; times are tough and businesses are challenged to stay afloat. This is a perfect time for PMO Leaders to extol the virtues of project management. Let&#8217;s face it, the previous set of status quo options haven&#8217;t worked well for us. All organizations want success, but none can achieve it without encountering obstacles along the way. For some organizations, the gap between promises made and delivery of those promises is too large, forcing them to fall victim to business disaster. The key is to master the skills that prevent disaster and salvage fledging companies during trying times&#8211;and project management skills are an essential part of this skill set.</p>
<p>PMO Leaders &#8211; this is your moment to gain the attention of doubting executives everywhere. Much of today&#8217;s economic crisis is due to poor business management and lack of communication. Companies are re-evaluating their strategic plans and reprioritizing their work efforts to stay afloat and remain in business. Projects are the critical building blocks in achieving an organization&#8217;s strategic plan. A strategic project management office is about building the tools, methods, and techniques for project and business success. A PMO seamlessly choreographs all the moving parts, ensuring the job gets done.</p>
<p>So, what’s the best way to capture the attention of your disbelievers? Talk to them in terms that mean something in today&#8217;s challenging business environment. Explain to them that project management is more than meeting timelines and budget; project management improves decision-making, instills accountability and enhances communication. Project management puts processes and tools in place that allows companies to get work done efficiently. It allows businesses to communicate priority projects, apply consistent project management practices and monitor project progress. The PMO is the conduit for making this happen&#8211;up, down and across the organization.</p>
<p>Back up your claims on the value of project management by identifying best practices and real-life examples of PMO success stories. We all know the value of lessons learned when closing a project. Let&#8217;s take that model and create an exchange of information for PMO leaders everywhere. Leverage the timing of a bad economy and a new year to reach out to others and exchange best practices and lessons learned. This is a great platform to exchange best practices. Pay it Forward-After all, what good are lessons learned if you don&#8217;t have a mechanism in place to shout &#8220;Danger!&#8221; when you have learned something the wrong/hard way? Alternately, what good are gold nuggets of best practices if the wealth is not shared with others?</p>
<p>So, PMO leaders, show your spirit, share the wealth and band together.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know Project Management is having a birthday? Well, sort of a birthday. It was 100  years ago, in 1911, that Frederick W. Taylor published <em>Principles of Scientific Management.</em> Early pioneers of project management, such as Henry Gantt, were followers of Dr. Taylor. Now, for historical accuracy, it should be noted that Dartmouth College (1900) and Harvard University (1908) already had dedicated graduate schools of business by the time of Taylor&#8217;s publication. However, Taylor was the first to specifically advocate the inclusion of management as a dedicated science worthy of academic inquiry.</p>
<p>This took a lot of courage in 1911. After all, the academy had been established for several thousand years, dating back to the days of Aristotle and Plato, and universities in Europe had been thriving for almost 1,000 years. The general consensus among academicians and scholars was that management was a vocation, not a scientific discipline.</p>
<p>Today, more undergraduate students choose business related majors than any other; and the MBA is the most common graduate degree. The success of business education over the last century is, in many ways, validation for the practical application of Taylor&#8217;s management theory. He advocated that strategic actions would generate reliable results. Business school leaders began applying the principles they taught students and enrollments grew dramatically.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that seem to happen in your projects? That is, when you do what you are supposed to do you get the desired result. When there is a disconnect between theory and practice you have trouble. If 100 years of research and practice has taught us anything it is that Taylor was correct: Management is a science.</p>
<p>However, we have learned since Taylor&#8217;s original studies that management is a <em>social science</em>. Companies are mini-societies, comprised of people with unique talents and aspirations. A weakness of Taylorism is that the role of the individual within the system is not truly appreciated. Taylor essentially took a negative view of employees. He had what Douglas McGregor, more than 50 years later, would call a <em>Theory X</em> perspective. This is the belief that workers are generally lazy and prefer to do as little as possible. Conversely, Theory Y managers believe that people are motivated and want to get the most of their abilities.</p>
<p>While the importance of nurturing the individual was pointed out by some of Taylor&#8217;s contemporaries in the scholarly community as early as 1912, practitioners gravitated towards a Theory X view. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1930&#8242;s that the human resource school thought (i.e. employees are a company&#8217;s greatest asset) began to take root. Today, business school professors share research findings that shows Theory X and autocratic management styles do more long-term harm than good. They espouse the value of transformational leadership and  ethical leadership models, yet far too many graduates eventually adopt Theory X attitudes and behaviors. Is this human nature, or a residual effect of early societal acceptance of the scientific management view that employees need to be prodded to perform? Probably a little bit of both.</p>
<p>While scientific management has come a long way in 100 years, it is interesting to ponder how much more successful it could have been if Taylor had emphasized the individual in his system 100 years ago. Essentially, what if Taylor had a Theory Y view of worker potential? How many failed projects could have been saved? How much wealth could have been created? Perhaps the best thing we can learn from Taylor&#8217;s work, and the 100 years of research findings since, is that human resources should not be managed like other project resources. Projects will be more successful if you manage resources, but <em>lead </em>people.</p>

<p>What will be the next big trend that drives the economy?  History tells us it will be something. From Tulipmania through the Roaring 2o&#8217;s, there are many examples of market bubbles that create enormous wealth while the bubble inflates, and significant pain when it inevitably bursts. The Internet Boom of the 1990&#8242;s and real estate frenzy of the 2000&#8242;s are the most recent examples. So, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>My bet is <em>sustainable energy</em>. Green energy has everything one would look for in a trend: A real need; inextricable linkage with corporate growth; economies of scale etc. When you look closely at the sustainable energy industry, you see some interesting parallels, in my opinion, with the commercialization of the internet. Especially, relative to the interest among innovators and early adopters. If you want to anticipate where the next big thing will be just follow the venture capital money. It&#8217;s flowing to renewable and sustainable energy related start-ups.</p>
<p>A lot of attention is paid to the potential  replacement of fossil fuels with bio-fuels. The thought of replacing foreign oil with domestically produced alternatives is exciting. However, the marketing issues are daunting.  We will get there, but maybe not as quickly as we would like in the short-term. Thankfully, there is low hanging  fruit that could be picked, which would have an immediately positive impact on our economy and natural environment: Buildings.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/projects/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.epa.gov/greeningepa/projects/?referer=');">EPA</a>, today&#8217;s buildings consume  65% of all electricity; produce 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and represent 36% of all U.S. energy use.<strong> </strong>There are immediate opportunities for companies to improve their profitability by addressing issues related to the costly and inefficient heating and lighting of buildings. Project managers are uniquely positioned to be leaders in this effort. While the ongoing maintenance of buildings is a process, it will take the skill sets of project managers to fundamentally change how stakeholders view this important issue.</p>
<p>For example, imagine the benefits if project managers from every global company implemented their own <em>Project Green </em>(i.e. internal projects to design and implement sustainable energy practices within their companies). Savings could be easily measured, and the benefits to shareholders quantified without much difficulty. Ben Franklin told us &#8220;a penny saved is a penny earned&#8221;. When it comes to energy savings&#8230;we are talking about a lot of pennies.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy provides a wealth of data and green building <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/new-york-building-stands-out-saves-energy" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/energy.gov/articles/new-york-building-stands-out-saves-energy?referer=');">case studies</a> that prove the long-term economic benefit of green building design and renovation. Energy savings of 40% a year are not unrealistic, and companies often begin seeing a positive ROI with a few years on green energy projects.</p>
<p>Project managers from every industry should be getting involved in the sustainability movement. If we use electricity and other forms of energy, don&#8217;t we have an ethical responsibility to use our knowledge, talent and expertise to assure this use isn&#8217;t negatively impacting our company&#8217;s bottom line or the planet?</p>
<p>At<a href="http://www.kenneymba.com" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.kenneymba.com?referer=');"> Kenney College</a>, we believe our experience in entrepreneurship education could be used to help project managers develop sustainability solutions. Therefore, we have  partnered with the <a href="http://www.apeiron.org/new/index/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.apeiron.org/new/index/?referer=');">Apeiron Institute for Sustainable Living</a> to create the first<em> Sustainable Energy MBA Fellowship</em>. This non-profit educational initiative is designed to equip corporate entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs in the sustainable energy movement with management, marketing, finance and entrepreneurship knowledge that will manifest in the creation of green building related projects and ventures.</p>
<p>I know some will say that not enough critical mass can be generated to make sustainable energy competitive;  and that the recent Solyndra  scandal is fodder for cynics. However, costs will drop rapidly once benefits are recognized by the early and late majority. One needs to look no further than America&#8217;s own history of electricity generation as proof. The theory of how to distribute electricity was know for decades before the first commercial power-plants were launched. The laws of diffusion of innovation and economies of scale will combine to reduce costs in sustainable energy, and the savings associated with green building and conservation are too significant to ignore.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a paradigm shift is already happening.   Sustainable energy is the future. If you want to ride the next wave&#8230;you need wade into the surf today.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to join us in developing the nation&#8217;s first sustainable energy MBA fellowship within your company please <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/drmatthewkenney" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.linkedin.com/in/drmatthewkenney?referer=');">connect with me via Linkedin</a>. This non-profit project will help a small cohort of corporate entrepreneurs develop sustainability and/or green building projects within your company. In addition to generating additional revenue streams and reducing costs, your leadership in this area of corporate social responsibility will be recognized with an award at a leading sustainable energy conference in 2012.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed that leaders of companies love to promote their commitment to ethical business practices? Go to the PDF version of an public company&#8217;s annual report and do a search for the word ethical, or ethics, and you&#8217;ll see a very nice discussion about the firm&#8217;s commitment to ethical business practices. Yet, when you look at litigation trends you see that the number of disputes has never been higher. A recent <a href="http://www.iam-magazine.com/Blog/Articles/FandJ09Trends.pdf" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.iam-magazine.com/Blog/Articles/FandJ09Trends.pdf?referer=');">Fulbright &amp; Jaworski Litigation Trends Survey</a> showed that 83% of the corporate counsel surveyed expected litigation to increase, up from 79% the previous year.</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem: Ethical conflicts arise during projects, in part, because the stakeholders don&#8217;t define the word &#8220;ethical&#8221; the same way. This is a systemic problem throughout Corporate America.</p>
<p>Is it possible that company leaders are causing ethical dilemmas by not really understanding philosophical aspects of ethics? The  importance of ethical business practices are being stressed, as are the findings that ethical leaders tend to be more successful. However, leaders don&#8217;t seem to be spending enough time stressing  the simple truth that what is ethical to one stakeholder may not be ethical to the next. That is, they are encouraging people to be ethical without delving into the philosophical foundation of ethics. Prerequisite knowledge is as important in business as it is in school. One can&#8217;t skip the theory and go straight to practice. It isn&#8217;t a sustainable strategy.</p>
<p>For example, assume you are an American project manager asked to develop a project to build a new factory in China, which will result in 100 lost American jobs. Is this ethical?  The answer is: It depends on your ethical philosophy.</p>
<p>If you are an ethical egoist you would say &#8220;yes&#8221;, as you are doing something legal and in your best interest. If you adhere to Divine Command Theory you would likely say &#8220;no&#8221;, as China is officially an atheistic state. The holder of a utilitarian view would probably say &#8220;yes&#8221; because, economically anyway, more people (i.e. customers) would benefit from the action than be harmed by it. One who adheres to Kant&#8217;s Categorical Imperative model would likely say &#8220;no&#8221;, since Chinese workers are not given the same rights and benefits as American workers.</p>
<p>So, to mitigate the risk of disputes within your projects you may want to state your ethical philosophy clearly to all stakeholders. Most American corporate managers seem to adhere to an ethical egoist or utilitarian model, which is OK. In a free society everyone has the choice to adopt a philosophical framework that they like. What they don&#8217;t have is the right to assume that everyone else will adopt the same model. Just because you justify an action as ethical doesn&#8217;t mean that it is. It just means that it&#8217;s ethical to you. Therefore, be sure to take the time to let all those you lead know your ethical philosophy. They may not agree with it, but if a conflict arises they cannot say they were unaware of it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://svprojectmanagement.com/communication-plans-%e2%80%93-passe-or-avant-garde/manwithdogonphone" rel="attachment wp-att-7432"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7432" title="manwithdogonphone" src="http://svprojectmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/manwithdogonphone.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="205" /></a>Why don’t most of us use communication plans? I know that most project managers I talk with don’t use them. Why is that? Are we in such a hurry to jump into our projects that we assume email will work – and why not cc everyone we can think of that must want to know what we’re doing?</p>
<p>In my previous blog my friend learned this lesson a bit too late.</p>
<p>The project he is leading is very high profile with lots of folks wanting recognition for having had influence over the outcome. An email was sent asking a simple question about a process with the appropriate parties copied. By the time the email returned, 3 days later, with of course other folks copied along the way, there was now an escalation because a different question had been answered, which of course had already been handled.</p>
<p>Remember the game telephone? You probably played it as a kid. This was exactly what had happened. The original question was never answered, but now a fire had to be put out, wasting even more time. So a new plan was put in place was to simply pick up the phone. And voila – two minutes later, the questions were resolved and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Why are we so reluctant to pick up a phone? Are we so attached to our technology that we think it is our only form of communication? Or are we afraid of getting stuck in the voice mail black hole that never gets answered? Regardless, I suggest you try it sometime but I digress…</p>
<p>This blog started out by talking about using communication plans in your projects. This process is usually started when you’re out talking to all the stakeholders you may be impacting during the initiation phase of the project. Hopefully, you’re gathering enough information when determining who your stakeholders are so you’ll know exactly the types of communication they are looking for.</p>
<p>Are they an executive, so they are only looking for a high level list of bulleted updates? Do they only want information on the part of the project that impacts them? Make sure you know what part of the process they really own, otherwise what happened to my friend can happen to you – a bunch of fingers pointing back at each other blaming the other person for all the things that are not going right with your project.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to tailor your communications by how best each stakeholder receives information. I’m sure most of you have taken an assessment at some point in your career – either a Myers Briggs (MBTI), the Enneagram, or a DiSC assessment. Those assessments help us better understand how individuals differ in their thinking and communication preferences. Are they detail oriented, do they need face to face, do they need you to bottom line it, or need very little at all? As part of your communication plan I’d recommend that you not only capture the how/how often they want to be communicated with, but also the what type of communication works best – via telephone, email, and the type of email – bulleted, or less formal. This can seem like a tedious process to plan at the beginning of your projects and, from what I’ve observed go wrong in projects, could save days of clean up time later.</p>

A friend of mine has gone from team member to project leader. I’ve known this person for a decade now and it’s been a fascinating process to see how he views the team now that he’s in charge, and vice versa, how the team views him.</p>
<p>Some team members seem to willingly accept the change, while others treat him as if he’s still a team member, complaining about all the little things that most of you in your right mind would never complain to your boss about – at least not without worry of getting fired. Why is it that some of us seem to accept change and are able to adapt quickly while other’s of us get stuck in what was? And how do you as a new leader gracefully navigate through the obstacles that will be thrown at you by people you thought were your friends.</p>
<p>This is the time that managing the project team knowledge area will really help you along with the tools and techniques of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Observation and conversation<br />
2) Conflict management, and<br />
3) Interpersonal skills</p>
<p>Since most of us seem to be hard wired to get things done, we forget about some of the tools and techniques of project management that will really help us out in times like these. With a clear project management plan and clear staff assignments some of the confusion of the team can quickly be clarified. It is especially important to observe your team and have conversations with them. And use your very best interpersonal skills. It may not be the time to push for managerial type dominance. Remember your team members still see you as one of them. They are confused and off balance, so using your active listening skills to uncover their concerns will be most helpful. Remember that many of them, especially if they have more seniority than you, may be wondering why they weren’t picked to lead the project, even if shortly thereafter they are glad they weren’t.</p>
<p>Patience is key – and not taking things personally. This is where your perception comes in. If you believe it is – it is, and if you believe it isn’t – it isn’t. The truth is somewhere in the middle – maybe&#8230;</p>
<p>Another tool you may want to use is exchanging the word “but” for the word “and” in your conversations with your team. The word “but” for many of us feels confrontational – try it out for a week – see if others react to you differently by making this word exchange. Remember, we’ve probably been using the word “but” as a filler – so it’s just one of those habits you may want to break.</p>
<p>Other concepts to practice are to remember that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Reality is just your interpretation<br />
2) Truth is your perception of reality, and<br />
3) Blame is a perspective – so what might be another perspective?</p>
<p>Next time I’ll explore how communication plans are a have to have rather than a nice to have…</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://svprojectmanagement.com/difficult-people-not/yinyang" rel="attachment wp-att-7388"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7388" src="http://svprojectmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/yinyang1.png" alt="yinyang" width="108" height="107" /></a>Difficult people. I really don’t like that term.</p>
<p>Think back… haven’t all of us been perceived as “difficult” at least once or twice (or, like me, often)? Were we really being difficult? From our own perspective, did we not have important reasons for taking our position? Perhaps it was because our team was moving too fast and was increasing the chance of a serious oversight. Or, perhaps we had experience that was being ignored in favor of an untried methodology. Or… well, we all have our stories.</p>
<p>My point is that the vast majority of “difficult people,” in my experience, were doing something they felt was quite reasonable – in just the same way I sometimes had to go against the stream.</p>
<p>For me, it’s been useful to think in terms of difficult situations involving people rather than difficult people. Maybe that seems overly semantic, but I don’t believe so. Language can be tightly related to perception – and perception is our reality. I believe it’s easy to demonize a difficult person; maybe even justify a less than ethical behavior on our part. Also, the difficult label might lead us to try to “fix” the person. Anyone remember how it feels to be “fixed?”</p>
<p>So, let’s think about the difficult situation instead. What’s actually happening? Describe the behavior, not our reaction to it. Sometimes, just going through this process allows us to see something different.</p>
<p>I remember an engineer that was always challenging me in meetings. GRRR! He was so difficult! I talked about killing this guy with a buddy. She asked me what exactly was happening. “I was talking about the proposal. He interrupts me and says, ‘So, your first two points are…’ “ Then, she asks, “what was it about what he did that bugged you so much?” I had to stop and think. Looking back, I just hated the interruption – I had prepared and was on a roll and this guy butts in! Oh-oh… this guy was actually slowing me down when I was on a roll (in my mind) and I was probably going too fast. Ah. I still didn’t like it. When I talked to him about it (calmly, of course), he laughed (I nearly smacked him then). He explained that he just assumed I understood the importance of emphasizing important points. We eventually became good colleagues (one technique was for him to hold a pen in both hands, which was a signal for me to slow down… and sometimes he would still have to interrupt me!).</p>
<p>Here’s what works often for me with a “difficult” person:<br />
1) Mantra: “He/she is not a difficult person…” – repeat until calm.<br />
2) Describe what happened – the behavior, not the reaction.<br />
3) What, specifically, rubs the wrong way.<br />
4) Why?<br />
5) Imagine what the “difficult” person saw/experienced.<br />
6) Reconstruct the difficult events with an alternative explanation.<br />
7) Based on (6), devise solutions (or accept the situation).<br />

<p>OK, I do realize that it’s not always so simple. On the other hand, it may be easier than dealing with demons.</p>

What can I do about them?&#8221;</dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Of course, this complaint is not too unusual. There are just so many difficult people out there, we are just bound to run into them on our projects &#8212; right?</p>
<p>There is another way to look at it. If I am running into difficult people on every project, what is the common denominator? It just might be me.</p>
<p>There is a story about two monks, one older and one quite young, who encounter a beautifully-dressed young woman standing by a stream. The woman is clearly upset and indicates a need to get to the other side. Without missing a step, the older monk picks her up in his arms and carries her to the other side.</p>
<p>As the two monks continue walking, the younger monk becomes more and more upset, Finally, after several miles, he cannot stand it and blurts out, &#8220;What were you thinking? We take a vow to stay away from women, yet you carried this pretty woman!&#8221; The first monk responds very calmly, &#8220;I let her go long ago. Why do you still carry her?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think sometimes we can get riled up and focus on things that are not that big a deal. After all, &#8220;difficult people&#8221; are not difficult all the time&#8230; or, even most of the time. Most of the time, most people are just doing the work. So, we should let some things go and that gives us more time and energy to focus on the important things.</p>
<p>Sometimes the important thing <em><strong>can</strong></em> be a &#8220;difficult&#8221; person. Let&#8217;s take a look at that one in a little different way next time.</p>
