<p>Much like in fashion, the internet has few innovators and many imitators. &nbsp;It isn't that innovators create new features and imitators copy them. &nbsp;Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture">everything is remix</a>. &nbsp;<b>What separates the two groups, as in fashion, is a difference in taste level.</b> &nbsp;Innovators design products that feel elegant and editorial, while imitators' products are poorly executed - a mashup of features that don't hang well together. &nbsp;In the fashion world, one legendary innovator possessed good taste beyond compare. &nbsp;Defined by her taste level, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel">fashion house she founded has stood as a paragon of luxury for a hundred years</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Her name is Coco Chanel. &nbsp;Most people know her as a fashion designer. &nbsp;Less widely appreciated is the fact that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chanel-Her-World-Edmonde-Charles-Roux/dp/0865651590/">Coco Chanel herself was a philosopher of taste</a>.

<!-- more -->

&nbsp;I'm serious about that. &nbsp;Having extensively researched the intellectual history of taste, Chanel's aphorisms stand out as actionable philosophy you can live by. &nbsp;It has informed my life and design practice tremendously. &nbsp;In fact, if Coco Chanel were a product designer in consumer internet, I bet she would do amazing things, because taste is what matters most. &nbsp;Think along the lines of <a href="http://www.notcot.org/">NOTCOT</a>, <a href="http://gilt.com/">Gilt Groupe</a>, and Twitter.</p>
<p>A striking many of Coco Chanel's maxims and precepts speak to product and user experience design. &nbsp;The following are what I've gleaned to be her greatest teachings:&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>On feature quality vs. quantity</b>. "Luxury lies not in richness and ornateness but in the absence of vulgarity." Translation: An elegant product doesn't necessarily need a lot of features (ornateness), but the features it does have need to work fluidly and be well thought through (absence of vulgarity). &nbsp;There can't be gaffs.</p>
<p><b>Naked prototypes</b>. "Look for the woman in the dress. If there is no woman, there is no dress." &nbsp;Great design (dress) can bring out the best in a product, but it can't mask the lack of underlying substance (woman). &nbsp;For these reasons, it can be useful to start with a <b>"naked" prototype</b> - functional and undesigned. &nbsp;Get a group of people using the naked prototype regularly to see if it adds value and feels substantive. &nbsp;For example, before developing the Palm Pilot,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)#Initial_development"> Jeff Hawkins carried around a block of wood</a> for a week and pretended to use it as if it were built out.</p>
<p><b>Too many accessories</b>. "When accessorizing, always take off the last thing you put on." &nbsp;After a website or app has built its core features (the dress), the temptation is to pursue auxiliary features (accessories) that maybe an early user has requested. &nbsp;These features are green-lighted because product designers often feel the need to be hyper-responsive to users, rather than <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_06/b3970001.htm">being the bad guy</a>. &nbsp;The head of engineering also favors auxiliary features because they offer good visibility from a planning perspective, and this person usually measures progress by lines of code completed, not by product efficacy. &nbsp;This is how accessory features sneak into products. &nbsp;Chanel warns against this outcome. She assumes that no matter who you are and what your taste level (indeed many of her clients to whom she gave this advice had very good taste), you will overdo the accessories. &nbsp;So, <b>consider editing your non-core features hawkishly</b>. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to remove ones which add little value and instead distract from the core substance of the product.</p>
<p><b>The myth of user-generated content</b>. "Those who create are rare; those who cannot are numerous. Therefore, the latter are stronger." &nbsp;A lot of social media sites assume that a lot of their users will be heavy contributors. &nbsp;They then proceed to design a product geared only toward heavy contributors. &nbsp;This is wrong-headed. &nbsp;Less than 0.5% of a site's users (often FAR less than) are heavy contributors. &nbsp;Many successful UGC sites were built on the backs of a handful of marquee users. &nbsp;Twitter, a site that has disproportionately many heavy contributors, has a passive user base that dwarfs the base of users who tweet regularly. &nbsp;In April 2010, Twitter had 100 million registered users, but almost twice that number in daily users. &nbsp;The vast majority of Twitter users tweet infrequently, or simply read the site without registering. &nbsp;This proportion of tweeters to readers makes sense because <b>one of Twitter's core value propositions is distribution</b>. &nbsp;Thus, their app must work well as a read-only app.</p>
<p><b>Heavily trafficked sites</b>. "Nothing is ugly as long as it is alive." &nbsp;Once in a while I get into an argument with product designer friends about <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>. &nbsp;Some really disagree with its draconian look and call it "ugly." They see it as a missed opportunity for something great. &nbsp;I tend to think it's unfair to criticize a site (it's not ugly) that has been consistently and heavily trafficked (it is alive). &nbsp;Maybe users feel comfortable using Craigslist as they would their old newspaper classifieds <b>precisely because it looks like their old newspaper classified</b>, and nothing more. &nbsp;As Chanel also said, "luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury."</p>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<p><small class=metadata>This post is part of the <a href=
"http://larifari.org/blog/game-like-mechanics-tutorial/">Game-Like Mechanics</a>
series.</small></p>

<br><p><img src="http://larifari.org/_/img/night-of-living-unread.png" /></p><br>

<p>Not many people think of email as a game.&nbsp; After all, games are meant to be
fun. Email, on the other hand, is laborious and stressful and makes you <a href=
"http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/email-apnea/">stop breathing</a>.&nbsp; But
email has at least one game-like quality - the thrill of victory when you defeat your
inbox, achieving <a href="http://inboxzero.com/articles/">Inbox Zero</a>.&nbsp; It's
like slaying a dragon, man.&nbsp; If you think that's hyperbolic, consider Merlin
Mann's preface to Inbox Zero - a veritable player's guide to email: "It&rsquo;s about
how to reclaim your email, your attention, and your life."</p>

<p>Email is a game of numbers where progress is measured by a single statistic - the count
of unread messages. Whereas we're pleased to see many stats (points, followers,
<a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/technology/8183583/bieber-tops-facebook-most-mentioned-list">
@mentions</a>) count up, we battle desperately to keep the number of unreads in single
digits.&nbsp; As email became ubiquitous, the <a href=
"http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT1666/iPhone%20Mail%20badge%20cropped.png">
unread indicator became iconic</a>.&nbsp; Web and mobile apps adopted it for their
app-specific inboxes.&nbsp; More recently, the <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lcrl34C9ev1qznsxfo1_500.jpg">arms race toward gamification</a> has
emboldened app designers to try the unread indicator in <a href=
"http://www.mondaynote.com/2009/08/09/paid-news-on-mobile-why-it-could-fly/">ever more
aggressive contexts</a>.&nbsp; Unread tweets.&nbsp; Unread system notifications. Unread
recent activity?&nbsp; Things have gotten out of hand.</p>

<p>As with all design patterns, the unread indicator can be used well, and it can be
overdone.&nbsp; The rest of this post discusses some key considerations surrounding the
indicator's use.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;">The Great Unread Message Inflation</h2>
<p>You open up Twitter's Android app and see 2100
unread tweets since last night.&nbsp; <b>It seems you've been attacked by the
night of the living unread!</b>&nbsp; Immediately <a href=
"http://www.bobcesca.com/images/gruesome_scanners_431x300.jpg">your head
explodes</a>.&nbsp; Unread messages feel like this decade's <a href=
"http://www.nirsoft.net/articles/spam/viagra_spam.html">Viagra spam</a>.&nbsp;
Everything on the internet *wants* to be an unread message.&nbsp; But they needn't
be.&nbsp; It's a bit awkward to think of tweets as messages that need to be queued for
reading.&nbsp; First, unless a tweet is addressed (@reply is like "To"; @mention is
like "Cc"), there isn't really a recipient so much as an audience.&nbsp; Second,
Twitter is not meant to be "read" in its entirety, and <a href=
"http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">many loved it
precisely for not being an inbox</a>.&nbsp; Third, unaddressed tweets don't require
priority in the same sense that emails do.&nbsp; After all, missing an important email
could get you fired or damage a friendship.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;">The stress factor</h2>
<p>At its best, the unread indicator reminds
users that an app is full of activity and participation.&nbsp; It draws the user's
attention, invites them to act, and gives them a sense of control.&nbsp; But app
designers should also weigh potential costs to the user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>few unreads [useful, motivating] &lt;----&gt; tons unread [stressful,
intimidating]</p>

<p>The indicator carries psychological baggage from its original use in email.&nbsp; A few
unreads might create a constructive sense of urgency.&nbsp; But when inboxes overwhelm
their owners, urgency is replaced by stress, frustration, and intimidation.&nbsp; My
friend <a href="http://lindastone.net/">Linda Stone</a> observed hundreds of people
using email and found that <a href=
"http://lindastone.net/2009/11/30/diagnosis-email-apnea/">80% (!) of them held their
breath or hyperventilated while doing so</a>.&nbsp; So the stressful association of
email seems pretty widespread.&nbsp; In short, unread indicators are not necessarily
harmless; used in the wrong context, they can lead users to associate your app with a
stressful rather than game-like experience.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;">Too many unreads</h2>
<p>When you call customer service and there's a
wait to speak to an operator, 15 minutes might be acceptable. But if the wait is more
than 30 minutes, research in <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queueing theory</a> says that you're far
more likely to just give up.&nbsp; Unread messages are a lot like wait time.&nbsp; A
few unreads are actionable.&nbsp; But when there are too many unreads, you might just
give up on taking any actions.&nbsp; App designers should reflect on the likelihood
that their users will encounter 20+, 50+, or 100+ unreads.&nbsp; If the likelihood is
very high, perhaps the unread indicator is no longer serving one of its key purposes -
creating a sense of actionability.</p>

<p>In recent years there have been some notable efforts to help email users ensmallen
their unread counts.<br><br>

&bull; <a href=
  "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/email-overload-try-priority-inbox.html">Gmail's
  Priority Inbox</a> keeps a separate count for more important email messages.<br>

&bull; <a href="http://www.activeinboxhq.com/">GTD Inbox</a> allows actionable messages
  to be flagged and tracked separately.<br>

&bull; <a href="http://emailgame.baydin.com/learn">The Email Game</a> helps users divide
  and conquer overflowing inboxes by limiting each game to 30 unread messages.<br>
</p>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;">Visual priority</h2>
<p><a href=
"http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT1666/iPhone%20Mail%20badge%20cropped.png">
Apple's white-on-red graphical badge</a> is an iconic form for the unread
indicator.&nbsp; Red is the most eye catching color, so this badge design has the
highest visual priority.&nbsp; On the Mac, a few icons like Mail, iChat, and Skype are
decorated with an unread badge, but the percentage of total screen space they occupy is
slight.&nbsp; However, on the iPhone, there are likely many more unread badges than
seen on Mac, all <a href="http://larifari.org/_/img/iphone4-homescreen.png">squeezed
into a smaller footprint in the home screen</a>.&nbsp; The high visual priority of the
badge seems to be counter-productive in this context, becoming a distraction or even a
nuisance.&nbsp; Aggravating the situation, some of the badges feel like permanent
fixtures and cannot be disabled.&nbsp; There may always be unread Mail, but that badge
can't be disabled. And is it absolutely necessary to treat App Store available updates
as unreads?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many web apps have followed Apple's design lead with their own white-on-red
badges.&nbsp; Facebook's use is particularly encouraging because it demonstrates
awareness of visual priority.&nbsp; Facebook actually uses three tiers of visual
priority for their unread indicators.&nbsp; Requests and messages are shown with
white-on-red badges (highest priority) when they are brand new.&nbsp; Once viewed, the
unread badges are demoted to blue-on-light-blue.&nbsp; The most recent news items count
is shown with an even lower priority white-on-blue design.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;">"Mark all as read"</h2>
<p>Given that unread indicators can be
stressful and even overwhelming, it's important to give users a way to quickly regain
control of the situation.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, the less important the unread, the
easier it should be to clear.&nbsp; Facebook's highest priority badge clears
automatically when the appropriate dashboard icon is clicked. Quora puts a "Clear All
Notifications button" just below the list of notifications.&nbsp; In Gmail, Mark All is
now a handy button.&nbsp; Or, if one seeks total liberation, one Gmail Labs feature
<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/12/square-is-new-round.html">eliminates
the unread count entirely</a>.&nbsp; If email is a game, then that is the ultimate
cheat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video games offer a possibility rarely had in real life - the satisfaction of being truly madly deeply 100% complete.<br /><br />Beating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> will take two weeks.&nbsp; But then again, the main story line is only&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090107203020AAOCali">68% of the game</a>.&nbsp; To reach 100% complete, you'll have to finish umpteen side quests, like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.g-unleashed.com/index.php?jump=839">chasing down 200 pigeons</a>, and <a href="http://www.gta4.tv/100percent.php">meeting random pedestrians</a>.&nbsp; It can take hundreds of hours. And the prize for getting 100% complete?&nbsp; Well, there isn't one really.<br /><br />In fact, 100% completions rarely lead to&nbsp;big juicy rewards. At most it helps unlock an easter egg.&nbsp;<!-- more --> For example, when you beat&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a>, you get to save "Clear Data" to the memory card.&nbsp; In the sequel, this lets you <a href="http://forums.gamewinners.com/forums/showthread.php?p=7890022">equip a geriatric swimsuit</a>. A nice gesture, but not a reward that would seem to justify hundreds of hours of toil.&nbsp; So why then do so many gamers fall under the spell of compulsive completion?<br /><br /><b>Because completion is intrinsically rewarding</b>.&nbsp; Neuroscience backs this up.&nbsp; It turns out that when you finish a complex task,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goals-Everything-Want-Faster-Thought-Possible/dp/1576752356">your brain releases massive quantities of endorphins</a>.&nbsp; Through the magic of classical conditioning, you come to associate present acts of completion and progress with the pleasure and satisfaction of your past completion-induced endorphin rushes.<br /><br />The "need to complete" is a powerful motivator. Properly harnessed, this observation can help you create engaging user experiences for your app or website.&nbsp; And since completion is intrinsically satisfying, it isn't <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/badgeville/">as gimmicky&nbsp;as some extrinsic rewards</a>.</p>
<p><br />Let's look at one game-like design pattern that leverages this "need to complete" - the profile completion bar.<br /><br /><b>PROFILE COMPLETION BAR</b>.&nbsp; Last time we looked at how OkCupid onramps new users with an&nbsp;<a href="http://larifari.org/blog/game-like-mechanics-tutorial/">innovative tutorial system</a>.&nbsp; The tutorial asks&nbsp;new users to take a series of small steps toward a complete profile.&nbsp; Progress toward this goal is communicated by a blue profile completion bar (0% to 100%).&nbsp; The idea of progress is central to games.&nbsp; Game theorists Salen &amp; Zimmerman put it thusly in <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=9802">Rules of Play</a>: "Without a measure of progress to give a player feedback on the meaning of his or her decisions, meaningful play is not possible."<br /><br /><b>Progress itself is the reward</b>.&nbsp; Notice how the language of the tutorial promotes this idea: "Take action X to get to 60% complete." Why would a user comply?&nbsp; First, a great way to get users to do something is simply to tell them to do it.&nbsp; Next, as this post claims, many users will feel rewarded when they advance progress toward 100%.&nbsp; Then of course, there are users who rather loathe incompletion, but this is a glass half-full / half-empty thing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Progress bars must only advance, and never move back</b>. Progress is sacrosanct in games, and there are no takebacks.&nbsp; Unless you're Chutes and Ladders.&nbsp; This reminds me of a design commandment I fondly attribute to my friend and Hunch colleague&nbsp;<a href="http://caterina.net/">Caterina Fake</a>: "Thou shalt not taketh away."&nbsp; This property of in-game progress bars set them apart from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511486.aspx#patterns">the more dubious sort</a> that you find in Windows installers and file transfer modals.&nbsp; Those charlatan "progress bars" jump back, rush to 90% and stall, or make otherwise indeterminate movements.</p>
<p><b>More scavenger hunt, less like filling your taxes.</b>&nbsp; That's the ideal feel for tasks that you ask&nbsp;users to complete.&nbsp; OkCupid's quests are fun, but the site is also inherently playful. LinkedIn, on the other hand, deals with a drier subject matter. There may be some tasks that users simply won't want to do -- such as asking another LinkedIn user for a recommendation.&nbsp; Perhaps recognizing this, <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/10/09/a-cleaner-look/">LinkedIn implemented a profile completion bar</a> that has side-quest mechanics.&nbsp; For example, "adding your summary"" gets you +5%.&nbsp; "Asking for another recommendation" also gets you +5%.&nbsp; In this design, users are able avoid certain steps and make progress in the manner of their choosing.</p>
<p><br /><b>An extrinsic reward, just in case</b>.&nbsp; Alas, not all your users will be seduced by the need to complete.&nbsp; Give them an external motive.&nbsp; LinkedIn woos with this zinger: "Users with complete profiles are 40 times more likely to receive opportunities through LinkedIn." This leads us to next week's pattern - the need to eat.<br /><br />jk.<br /><br><a href="http://larifari.org/blog/night-of-living-unread/">Read part III of the Game-Like Mechanics series here &rarr;</a></p>]]></description>

<p>Product people in consumer internet have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_envy">game envy</a>.&nbsp; Everything should be as fun and engaging as <i>Super Mario Kart</i>.&nbsp; This agenda is emboldened by the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/7895109/Five-reasons-why-Foursquares-mainstream-success-is-inevitable.html">success of Foursquare</a> - the half-app, half- alternate reality game.&nbsp; Game mechanics such as points, leaderboards, badges, and mayorships are what make Foursquare more engaging, addictive, and successful than all the other location apps.<br /><br />Now other apps are eager to jump on the game mechanics bandwagon.&nbsp; Badges, for example, are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/29/huffington-post-does-a-foursquare-offers-readers-badges-for-behavior/">suddenly cropping up everywhere</a>.&nbsp; But in some cases, their use feels contrived, or even worse, users begin to feel manipulated.&nbsp; It's important to realize that explicit game mechanics may not be appropriate for all apps.<br /><br />Instead, consider incorporating <b>game-like mechanics </b>to engage users.&nbsp; These are design patterns that come from videogame theory, but importantly, they aren't overtly videogame-y.&nbsp; <i>Since they don't cry out: "I'm from a video game," game-like mechanics may be suitable for a broader range of apps. </i><!-- more --><br /><br />I stumbled upon game-like mechanics whilst cataloging user engagement techniques for my own <a href="http://hunch.com/info/the-hunch-team/">design practice at Hunch</a>.&nbsp; When I shared my findings with colleagues and friends, there was disagreement over whether certain patterns were actually game mechanics. These patterns engage users using videogame theory, but aren't recognized as iconic like leaderboards and badges.&nbsp; Thenceforth I've been calling this class of patterns game-like mechanics. I used my cohorts' objections as the litmus test. <br /><br />I expect to write a short series about game-like mechanics.&nbsp; One pattern per post.&nbsp; The first pattern I want to share is...<br /><br /><b>THE "IN-GAME" TUTORIAL</b><br /><br />Onboarding is often mistaken for account creation.&nbsp; But user acquisition is actually just the first of four steps. Accommodation, assimilation and acceleration are the other steps.&nbsp; In videogame speak, the onboarding process is accomplished by an in-game tutorial.&nbsp; Adventure and RPG games use warm-up levels to get your basic information, show you the ropes, and accelerate you into the flow of the game.&nbsp; A tutorial can take five minutes. Or it can span <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_00:_Mission_Mode_Tutorial">six mini-missions and take an hour, as in the case of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</a>.&nbsp; (Not that I'm bitter or anything.)<br /><br />If your web or mobile app is complicated like Kingdom Hearts, you should definitely consider a tutorial system.&nbsp; Because dumping users to the home screen to figure out their own use case is <a href="http://yvettesbridalformal.com/">UX purgatory</a>.&nbsp; For an example of a tutorial system in a complicated product, we look at Facebook. After you create an account, you're brought to a Welcome page.&nbsp; The page lists six basic, actionable steps for the user to complete - search for friends, upload photo, fill out profile, activate phone, find people, and set privacy.&nbsp; When possible, the form or button required to complete the step is in-lined so the action can occur right then and there.&nbsp; Facebook's tutorial isn't exactly fun, but it gets the job done.<br /><br />A lighter-weight tutorial system is the hovering callout where the voice of the app speaks to you.&nbsp; For example, after you create an account at <a href="http://vark.com">Aardvark</a> and land on the home screen, a callout tooltip in the upper right corner tells you that the first thing to do is to ask a question. The link is included. Simple and elegant.&nbsp; After you've done that, the tutorial callout tells you to try some other action, and so forth.<br /><br /><i>Note that in-game tutorials are different from tours.&nbsp; Tours might explain how to do something, but tutorials get you to take steps yourself. A powerful idea.&nbsp; </i><br /><br />OkCupid has one of the most impressive in-game tutorials.&nbsp; After creating an account, OkCupid prompts users to take one action that will advance their progress on the site.&nbsp; In total, users are asked to take ten or so steps toward crafting a profile (e.g. add a photo, add some tags) and connecting with the community (e.g. write a forum post).&nbsp; OkCupid's tutorial is better than the rest because it rewards users for completing steps.&nbsp; They accomplish this with help from another design pattern: the PROFILE COMPLETION BAR.<br /><br /><a href="http://larifari.org/blog/need-to-complete/">Read part II here &rarr;</a><br /><a href="http://larifari.org/blog/night-of-living-unread/">Read part III here &rarr;</a></p>]]></description>

	I am a dyed in the wool Apple devotee who daily asks himself questions like "What would Jony Ive think of this UI?"&nbsp; So maybe I've been spoiled by Apple's long streak of design genius.&nbsp; Or maybe I've gotten pickier with my pixels.&nbsp; But I was disappointed to encounter several usability flaws in iPhone's OS 4 update.
</p>
<p>
	It's tempting to just point out the flaws and excoriate Apple for losing its way.&nbsp; But usability design is tough enough. It doesn't call for back-seat driving.&nbsp; So I've cooked up simple design fixes and workarounds.&nbsp; There are, of course, more elegant solutions out there and I hope you'll chime in with your ideas in the comments section.
</p>
<p>
	1. <b>ZOMG Folders are Cluttery!</b>&nbsp; Imagine if all the desk drawers and organizers in your house were completely transparent.&nbsp; You might go crazy staring down your stuff.&nbsp; That is how I feel about the appearance of folders.&nbsp; <!-- more -->The action of dragging one icon onto another to make a folder is elegant enough.&nbsp; So to be fair, perhaps showing the contents of folders is meant to help novice users understand how foldering works. But for the design OCD flock, Apple should add the ability to assign icons to folders to hide that clutter.&nbsp; Default folder icons of varying color and texture themes would be a fine start.&nbsp; After all, people use folders not only to contain files, but also to abstract away their contents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of sight, out of mind.
</p>

	2. <b>Wait? There's no Close (x)?</b> Multitasking was supposed to change everything. Again.&nbsp; But so far, it's just slowed down my phone with background apps I forget to close.&nbsp; The proverbial ball was really dropped on the multitasking UI.&nbsp; Suppose you open Maps, tap the Home button, then open Safari.&nbsp; Well, Maps is still running in the background, draining your battery and cluttering your immaculate psychic environ.&nbsp; Closing Maps is quite a rigmarole: Double-tap the Home button to reveal the task manager, find the Maps icon, tap and hold the Maps icon until it shakes to reveal a minus sign, then tap Maps to close it.&nbsp; That is a lot of work. Especially since most of the time, I have no intention of multitasking.&nbsp; I am done with Maps and I want to close it and not leave it running.&nbsp; Aye but there's the rub.&nbsp; <b>You can't close the app you're currently running!</b>&nbsp; That's right kids, there's no Close (x) control on the foreground app.&nbsp; What happens if you invoke the multitasking UI while Maps is running?&nbsp; Maps <b>does not appear</b> in the apps listing so it is uncloseable.&nbsp; Okay solution time.&nbsp; For one, Apple could add the foreground app to the list of apps in the multitasking UI.&nbsp; Or, Apple can add a "Close (X)" to the foreground app whenever you are in the multitasking UI.&nbsp; But my preferred solution is that Apple close apps by default.&nbsp; If you really want to keep one running, hold down the Home button to return to the home screen.&nbsp; Currently Home button tap-and-hold is reserved for Voice Control. meh.
</p>

	3. <b>Screen Orientation Lock looks like an iPod button.&nbsp;</b> People love that iPhone is by and large intuitive enough so that you don't need a manual to figure out its basic functionality.&nbsp; You can stumble upon them.&nbsp; But how you turn on and off screen locking is awfully confusing.&nbsp; Tap Home twice to activate the multitasking UI.&nbsp; Swipe left or right and the last screen has 5 icons:&nbsp; Refresh, Last Track, Play, Next Track, iPod.&nbsp; Ok, I'm grokking these as music controls, and Refresh is random track or shuffle mode.&nbsp; RIght?&nbsp; <b>Wrong</b>.&nbsp; "Refresh" is screen locking.&nbsp; This becomes abundantly clear when you tap Refresh and it then appears with a lock inside the cycle symbol.&nbsp; Solution: this could have been avoided if Apple had chosen a more specific icon for screen lock and not the universal Refresh icon.&nbsp; A quick fix would be to add an unlocked lock inside the cycle symbol so there would be no semantic collision with universal Refresh.
</p>

	4. <b>A broken clock is right twice a day.</b> I have an iPhone 4 and the retinal screen on it is just amazing.&nbsp; To show off its capabilities, Apple redrew all the basic icons with crystal clarity.&nbsp; Including the icon for the Clock app.&nbsp; On an older iPhone I was already irked that the clock icon failed to tell the correct time. After all, Calendar app's icon manages to show the correct day of the month.&nbsp; But on the retinal display, Clock is just taunting me because I can read the time and numbers on it *so* clearly.&nbsp; It's 10:15.&nbsp; This reminds me of a useful design rule I learned from Scott McCloud, the Understanding Comics guy.&nbsp; <b>Don't bring more detail into an abstraction than is purposeful</b>.&nbsp; Solution?&nbsp; A working clock, or artfully prevent the Clock icon from having a time.
</p>

	5. <b>Giftwrap.&nbsp;</b> This one is not so much a usability flaw as what I regard to be a missed opportunity.&nbsp; I've been yearning for the ability to gift an App to friends for two years.&nbsp; Sending someone an iTunes gift-card for $0.99 so they can buy <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screen-cleaner-pro/id306088983?mt=8">Screen-Clean Pro</a> was an awkward workaround.&nbsp; In iOS 4.0, you can now gift an App to your loved one, which, drum roll please, <b>sends them an email with a redeem code.</b>&nbsp; meh.&nbsp; Come on Apple, whatever happened to showmanship?&nbsp; Now here's how I want it done.&nbsp; Don't send me to "email" -- the dark alley of the iPhone.&nbsp; Don't spoil the gift contents for me in the ugly email.&nbsp; Ping me with iPhone notification: "Mary wants to send you a gift.&nbsp; Accept it?"&nbsp; Then, add a <b>gift-wrapped app to my home screen.</b>&nbsp; Don't ruin the surprise for me either.&nbsp; I click to unwrap it, and get to read the message in the card.&nbsp; You get the idea.&nbsp; This would be <b>true gift-porn</b>.
