			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Post title with apologies to <EM><A HREF="http://youtu.be/5Zp3LPRzuXo">The Police</A></EM>.)</p>
<p>Yes, this week the first essay, a short research essay analyzing a primary source document, is due. I&#8217;m fielding lots of questions, including a surprising number about how they can cite me. Me, me, me, me, me and my lectures! Me from the course manual I wrote for the other course they&#8217;re taking or took last year via continuing education. I&#8217;ll probably even get one or two wanting to cite from the chapters I wrote for one of the Wiley <EM>Pop Culture and History</EM> series!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m supposed to be flattered. I&#8217;m not. Mostly, I feel worried. We had an in-class workshop on how to find research resources using our library catalogue and our databases. I passed out a rubric that underlined the expectation the research would have to draw on a book, chapter or article from our library collections. I spent a fair chunk of two class sessions explaining what we&#8217;re doing and why the research part is important.</p>
<p>When they want to cite me, it feels little better than when they cite some random website. Both strike me as timid or lazy choices made by students who&#8217;re afraid of not finding an acceptable source or just don&#8217;t want to work at the research required. If they don&#8217;t learn to search effectively and in different ways besides using the internet search engines, they&#8217;re not going to uncover the majority of scholarship. They need to learn how to start finding other scholars&#8217; writings, how to read those effectively and how to use this information in their essays. That&#8217;s one of the objectives of this course!</p>
<p>If all they do is parrot back my own words at me, how will they know if I wasn&#8217;t leading them astray? I want them to test my suggestions from our class time, not just blindly accept one of the interpretations that I&#8217;ve offered. I want them to see if they can articulate an idea and find some support for it outside of what I&#8217;ve said or what&#8217;s there in their textbook!</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll find out on Wednesday how many of the students got those messages.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the full-time academics out there, how many days a week do you teach?</p>
<p>I know there are two schools of thought with the popular one hereabouts being to pile up all your teaching on two, three, maybe four days so you have at least one reserved for research. The alternative model is to teach five days a week, spreading it out in smaller chunks.</p>
<p>At my undergraduate university, that could even be six days a week given the existence of Saturday morning classes (usually taught by grad students and sessionals, as I recall.</p>
<p>Because of family issues, I am unavailable for one time slot four days a week. It effectively blocks off many afternoon classes since running a seminar for three hours in the afternoon automatically runs afoul of my restricted time.</p>
<p>As a result, I&#8217;m pretty well resigned to teaching five days a week. It has the advantage of spreading matters out so I&#8217;m not teaching six hours one day followed by three hours the next and so forth. The disadvantage is that it really breaks up my days and, when the inevitable meeting requests come in, those bits and pieces of time are fractured even more.</p>
<p>At least this only lasts through December. Starting in January, I&#8217;m on my lighter term, teaching three classes instead of five (sure, one of these is a graduate level directed readings course but I feel completely justified in counting that as a course in that I have one student now pursuing a topic far afield from my research and I&#8217;ll have a second directed readings student starting in January in a completely different topic also far afield). I might actually get to keep Mondays and Fridays sacrosanct for research, except for when those pesky meetings interfere.</p>
<p>However you experience teaching, do you prefer to spread it out or bunch it up? Do you have any say in your schedule? How does it affect your ability to research and write?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My senior seminar on early medieval chronicles has a total enrolment of sixteen.</p>
<p>In twenty years of full-time teaching, I&#8217;ve never had a senior seminar with so few students. Two years ago I had nineteen and thought that I was fortunate. Sixteen seems even better. This particular group of sixteen is an absolute pleasure to teach.</p>
<p>I suspect that some of the bliss also results from the background many students bring to the topic. Four of the students have completed at least first year Latin, two others say they&#8217;re currently studying it. One student is clearly fluent in both Latin and Greek. I am envious as my Greek is at the elementary level of recognize the letters and about three dozen key words!</p>
<p>While all of our readings are in translation, it&#8217;s wonderful to have students critique the translator&#8217;s word choice or comment on the echoes of other classical models they see in the writing style they&#8217;re analyzing. I&#8217;m more accustomed to students taking my seminars lacking even the most basic of prerequisites such as our western civ freshman course or a sophomore-level subject survey. When half the class doesn&#8217;t have a clue about the history they&#8217;re tackling, no amount of background readings will fix the problem.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t just the linguistic and topical course background that distinguishes the class. Almost every student has identified a useful background they bring to the course. For instance, another number of students have a strong grounding in religious and Biblical studies. A few others have a good sense of theory that&#8217;s quite applicable. Put all of these together and you have a nigh-on-perfect mix for lively discussions on the class board as well as in the classroom.</p>
<p>I like to think this makes up for my other two undergraduate classes sitting right at the course caps of 80. These are also pretty good classes where students are following my lead to comment and contribute but it is far more difficult to achieve this in a group of 80 than in the much smaller class where I&#8217;m mostly scrambling to get out of their way and facilitate the shift from talking to the professor to talking with each other.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haven&#8217;t we heard this before? Margaret Wente&#8217;s recent column explains the dearth of women managers as an issue of individual choice. <A HREF="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/opinion/what-glass-ceiling-its-the-mommy-track/article2175013/">&#8220;What glass ceiling? It&#8217;s the mommy track&#8221;</A> trots out that tired explanation to let us know that not only are women not being excluded from the boardrooms, it&#8217;s that they want it this way!</p>
<p>According to Wente, what&#8217;s important is that women want to have things that are incompatible with a business career. Like children, for instance. Apparently all those male managers are childless. Because having kids is systemically incompatible with business success. Clearly! Since anything otherwise would be unfair and the system isn&#8217;t unfair, is it, Ms. Wente? Funny, but it seems I&#8217;ve read <A HREF="http://books.google.ca/books?id=XfDZrkzmjKAC">lots of research</A> that shows that fatherhood in a management-track employee can be seen as a sign of stability and suitability whereas motherhood is a sign that woman&#8217;s just not committed. Because those maternity leaves are a real hassle, I guess!</p>
<p>Wente also suggests that maybe it&#8217;s because full-time managerial work is <EM>haaaaard</EM> and women don&#8217;t want to do that. Instead, they&#8217;re making rational choices to not go for that promotion. Tracy Robinson, a successful executive at CPF who&#8217;s also the mother of four kids? Apparently she&#8217;s just <EM>craaa-azy</EM> and no smart woman would want to do what she&#8217;s doing. That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s one of a tiny number of women executives, says Wente, while pointing to the recent study that shows three-quarters of Dutch women working part-time. </p>
<p>I have a radical suggestion. Maybe all of these outcomes are a tiny bit influenced by that old <A HREF="http://www.historiann.com/2010/05/18/patriarchal-equilibrium-ur-doin-in-rite/">patriarchal equilibrium that criticizes women for not being like men</A> or for being unwomanly when they act like men?</p>
<p>Nah. Couldn&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s just women&#8217;s nature. When confronted with all the choices in a perfectly equitable socio-economic system, women just say &#8220;that&#8217;s man&#8217;s work!&#8221; and go put on their pearls, get ready to do some vacuuming and pop a few bon-bons as they enjoy their work-life balance.</p>
<p>Wente also thinks this will all only change, get this, when women change. See? The problem&#8217;s all on <EM>our</EM> side. If we just manned up, we&#8217;d all be in the executive suites, sure as shooting! But since we just make these silly choices, we have no one but ourselves to blame when we aren&#8217;t all sitting in that spiffy corner office at the top of some office tower.</p>
<p>Now for a refreshing contrast? Ms. Robinson, that manager-mom at CPR? She&#8217;s on record with quite a different viewpoint from Wente:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tracy Robinson, a vice president at Canadian Pacific, says companies need to institute a plan to ensure qualified women are recognized with promotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 50 per cent of the workforce — the emerging workforce, the emerging talent — is female,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t put some thought into how to make your environment friendly to women and other visible minorities then you&#8217;re at a competitive disadvantage.&#8221; (<A HREF="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2011/08/31/calgary-few-women-executives.html">CBC.ca</A>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess whose analysis I find more compelling?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could be dead, or stabbed. Or it could be midweek! But it&#8217;s Friday and I&#8217;m whole and hearty. Bonus!</p>
<p>Made it to the weekend and neither the meeting with the dean nor my burgeoning workload managed to bring me down. I am already feeling spread out thinly, like butter scraped across hot toast. Saw my schedule get just a little bit more crowded and hectic. We&#8217;re already tackling the question of what courses each of us will offer next year: the earliest we&#8217;ve ever thought about this in my department. But if we don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t know where to make the cuts mandated as part of the university&#8217;s overall austerity program. Balancing personnel realities versus budget numbers is a frustrating exercise.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m not chairperson and I&#8217;m so glad to say that. Once I&#8217;ve dealt with various service responsibilities as well as my class meetings, I&#8217;m doing my best to get out of Dodge. Even though home is alive with distractions, I find it surprisingly easy to ignore the siren call of the television for the luxury of real mind-work.</p>
<p>This term, I&#8217;m committed to <A HREF="http://girlscholar.blogspot.com/2011/09/writing-group-week-2-pacing.html">Another Damned Notorious Writing Group</A>, an online support group running twelve weeks. Week one is done and gone: I did some of what I&#8217;d hoped to do. The sad reality of seeing my writing hopes and ambitions running up against the unyielding requirements of my job&#8217;s other requirements? That&#8217;s the hardest part of term to deal with on an emotional level. I have such hopes of universal, regular progress, and I feel them dashed time and again by my wacky schedule.</p>
<p>As <A HREF="http://reassignedtime.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/pacing-or-finding-your-own-productivity-sweet-spot/">Dr. Crazy notes</A>, writing every day isn&#8217;t an approach that works for everyone. I do my best when I write regularly but Tuesdays, for instance, when I&#8217;m booked all but one hour from 8-8? Writing doesn&#8217;t happen and I don&#8217;t try to make it happen. I might be able to squeeze in a little research or writing time during office hours or my lunch hour but I&#8217;d rather use these contingent timeslots for tasks that don&#8217;t suffer when I suddenly drop the ball. (Reviewing slidesets for classes so I can tweak the questions and images, for instance, or adding more material to the online course management system.)</p>
<p>I pray there aren&#8217;t any meetings on Friday afternoons because then I enjoy a wonderful &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; of four uninterrupted hours to drill down deep in my current project. Despite leaving breadcrumb trails in the form of ALL CAPS NOTES to myself, I need about half an hour to reorient myself as to what I&#8217;m writing as well as how I&#8217;m using the sources.</p>
<p>Sadly, this Friday wasn&#8217;t a joyous excursion into writing. My afternoon meeting was important and we accomplished our goals, but it chopped up my afternoon into precisely the wrong chunks. Even so, I&#8217;ve completed the key writing task I&#8217;d wanted to have finished in the last week. I&#8217;m fortunate that my family&#8217;s tolerant enough of my wacky work schedule to take it calmly when I say that this weekend is all about writing and editing because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not ideal. It&#8217;s not even how I&#8217;m supposed to be working as I teach a 3/2 load on paper. You can be that I can&#8217;t wait for next term when my teaching commitments drop from five courses to three! But I think this stop-and-go schedule with a clear road map is something that&#8217;s working for me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s working for you with writing, editing, research or study this term?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the curse &#8220;May you live in interesting times&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m living them right now and while many elements in my life are going swimmingly (my classes have started fantastically well, the family&#8217;s busy and healthy, I&#8217;m making progress in writing as well as editing), the ominous shadow of those &#8220;interesting times&#8221; looms overhead. It dogs my footsteps when I&#8217;m out walking the dogs. It sits on my shoulder and distracts me from pleasant family time. It follows me into my dreams. I can&#8217;t get past the concern to blog about anything else and I certainly can&#8217;t blog about this!</p>
<p>Soon I&#8217;ll have some information that might help put these worries into perspective. More likely, it&#8217;ll simply lay out the parameters for a scary next few months. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to blog about the rest of my life once I&#8217;ve digested the news.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The virtual commons has been my second home for quite some time now. As the lone Anglophone premodernist on my faculty, it&#8217;s great to be able to turn to the online world and get the feedback, advice and support I&#8217;ve missed since grad school. In the 90s, we did this on listservs and Usenet. In the last decade? The blogosphere&#8217;s been the place to be, but over the last few years, Twitter&#8217;s become the digital equivalent of the old water cooler. (We used to discuss &#8220;Murphy Brown&#8221; at mine. Oh, I know I&#8217;m dating myself with that!)</p>
<p>Got a question about where to find an obscure source or who might be the expert on a tangential topic important to your research? Ask the #twitterstorians! Need to plan for some upcoming meetings or want some feedback on work in progress? You can&#8217;t do better than starting with the #twitterstorians. Want to share some triumphs as well as the occasional frustrations of your historical work: teaching, researching or in outreach? Turn to #twitterstorians.</p>
<p>Thanks to Katrina and all the others who&#8217;ve made the tag come alive this past year and may we have many more years of camaraderie ahead of us! <A HREF="http://katrinagulliver.posterous.com/happy-anniversary-twitterstorians">Happy Anniversary, #twitterstorians!</A></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that my four outlines for the fall courses are finished, it&#8217;s time to get through all the assignment files and CMS set-up every course requires. Ya-ay? This includes the lists of discussion questions I circulate in advance for my undergraduate classes. As I explained in <A HREF="http://jliedl.ca/2011/08/05/teaching-with-monographs/">Teaching with Monographs</A>, I find that providing discussion questions in advance helps students both focus their readings and have some confidence about how they can contribute to the class when we get started.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve honed my craft of questioning. Of course, we all know that leading questions are better than queries which are answered in short order with facts or yes/no responses. I&#8217;ve also come to value questions that are linked to the assigned readings for the day. Even if I don&#8217;t agree with the authors, perhaps especially when I&#8217;m at odds with them, it&#8217;s good to frame the question to encourage students to react to those same arguments and ideas.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve set myself an extra challenge by committing to reuse the discussion questions for both classes as essay questions on the exam. That&#8217;s going to be interesting: I normally formulate essay questions in western civilization that are more broadly comparative, asking students to compare social or religious elements over time or across places. Now I&#8217;m putting that model aside in hopes of enriching the discussion time in class as students perceive the value in answering these fully (because it&#8217;ll be &#8220;on the test&#8221;) as well as understanding that there are no &#8220;right answers&#8221; (so whatever answer they put forward needs to be well-supported).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how that application works out. In the meantime, I&#8217;m tweaking my discussion questions and, as I&#8217;d promised a few weeks back, thought I&#8217;d share some of the current versions here. They&#8217;re relating very closely to the two books students will read for the course, Bucholz &amp; Key&#8217;s <EM>Early Modern England</EM> and Barbara Donagan&#8217;s <EM>War in England, 1642-1649</EM> but I hope they&#8217;ll still be genuinely interesting for the students. Any suggestions are still welcome as these examples are still in draft form only:</p>
<p><UL><LI>What is “affinity” and how was it important in the rise and fall of the Yorkist dynasty?</LI><br />
<LI>What were the three principles of medieval kingship that Henry VII revived and which do you think was the most important in cementing the new Tudor dynasty?</LI><br />
<LI>War, Catholic resistance, parliamentary grievance and noble unrest: which most transformed Elizabethan England?</LI><br />
<LI>Barbara Donagan considers the Civil War an &#8216;integrated war&#8217;. How did culture, technology and/or intelligence link British combatants?</LI><br />
<LI>Bucholz &amp; Key describe the Commonwealth as “too conservative”, “too radical” and “too tolerant of the lower orders” – what do YOU think was its fatal flaw?</LI><br />
<LI>Characterize Britain in 1714: an <EM>ancien r&eacute;gime</EM> culture or a modern, middle-class society?</LI></UL></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s my turn to ask you a question: what&#8217;s <EM>your</EM> advice for enlivening classroom discussion?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://jliedl.ca/2011/08/28/why-cant-a-woman/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Doz5w2W-jAY/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Here&#8217;s a familiar sociological catch-22: Women are enjoined to be &#8220;more like a man&#8221; but will be condemned for being too &#8220;mannish&#8221; if they do so.</p>
<p>Pick any historically prominent woman and chances are you&#8217;ll encounter some version of this charge. Take for instance, one of the women I&#8217;ve researched: Margaret Pole. Daughter to George, the Duke of Clarence, Margaret survived the upheavals attendant upon her father&#8217;s suspicious death in the Tower as well as Henry VII&#8217;s rise to power. (Her brother Edward, wasn&#8217;t so lucky: held in custody by both Richard III and Henry Tudor, he accused of plotting an escape, attainted and executed in his turn for treason in 1499.</p>
<p><img src="http://jliedl.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/margaretpole.jpg?w=210&#038;h=300" alt="Margaret Pole" title="MargaretPole" width="210" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-231" /> Margaret was married off to a loyal follower of the Tudors. When her husband died, she and her children fell on hard times until Henry VIII&#8217;s coronation. Her young relative showered Margaret with honours: a title, lands and wealth became hers as the new countess of Salisbury. When Margaret and her family sided with Catherine of Aragon and the traditional church in Henry&#8217;s break with Rome, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>In 1538, Henry&#8217;s ministers focused on Pole&#8217;s family and circle as traitors supporting a foreign-supported invasion of England. Some of Margaret&#8217;s sons cracked under torture: confessing their complicity in a plot that brought in other noble families as well as their brother, Cardinal Reginald Pole. Margaret resisted all accusations of treason in a grueling series of interrogations, as her weary examiners explained in a letter to Thomas Cromwell. &#8220;We have dealid with such a one as men have not dealid with to fore us, Wee may call hyr rather a strong and custaunt man than a woman.&#8221;<A HREF="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> It didn&#8217;t help. Thomas Cromwell trumped up charges against Margaret that led to her attainder and eventual execution.</p>
<p>Sounds all too familiar, doesn&#8217;t it? What other historical women do you know have been accused of being too much like a man?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fresh off of another writing jag, I set another monograph down on the end table. It&#8217;s a good read and I&#8217;m reluctant to put it down, but there was dinner to be made and family to enjoy.</p>
<p>I have a lot of books on the go. There are five inter-library loan books, four other academic books borrowed from the university library, two academic ebooks I&#8217;ve been reading on the library website, four paperbacks I picked up at the used bookstore the other weekend and still about a half dozen waiting to be read on my Kindle. I have a university office that&#8217;s got three walls filled with shelves and those shelves filled with books. And, yes, I&#8217;ve read pretty much all of them except for a few newcomers and a few gifted books I&#8217;ve yet to read. In my bedroom closet, three further stacks of histories of medieval aristocracy and Byzantium patiently wait for me to finish with one pop culture and history chapter so I can start on the other chapter and read them.</p>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, how much my students read, even before it comes to textbooks and term time. Do they love reading? You&#8217;d think that history majors ought to be voracious readers because even if they don&#8217;t rely on printed sources, that&#8217;s still how we roll when it comes to the professional literature. But I wonder. Some of them are clearly readers: they respond eagerly when I mention a classic text they&#8217;ve read or allude to a piece of popular fiction that relates to our class topic. They pull their nose out of a book when it&#8217;s time for class to begin and dive back in when they&#8217;re out in the hallway. Others never drop a clue about their reading habits: they don&#8217;t carry books with them but, even more disturbing, they don&#8217;t want to discuss the readings, even on the most elementary of levels.</p>
<p>I eye the schedule for my classes with a chary eye. Surely seniors in a seminar won&#8217;t be gobsmacked when the weekly readings occasionally run up to eighty pages (small, <A HREF="http://www.penguinclassics.com/">Penguin Classics</A> paperback pages at that)? A chapter a week in the freshman Western Civ survey isn&#8217;t too onerous, especially given how lucidly the textbook&#8217;s written and with the wealth of illustrations to liven the tedium any might find in the text. I prepare discussion questions to start off every class period that include &#8220;hooks&#8221; from the assigned readings, so students will see the connection between our time in class and their reading tasks outside of the eighty minute time block. It may not inspire a love of reading (I wish I could work that kind of miracle), but at least I hope it will make the reading relevant.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have a novel to finish reading!</p>
