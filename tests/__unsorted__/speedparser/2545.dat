			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Historically, we&#8217;ve kept updates, comments and private messages to 140 characters. This was because an SMS is 160 characters long, your username takes upto 15 characters etc. But things have moved on fast since then; almost all handsets support &#8220;SMS concatenation&#8221; which means they can send and receive long SMS by stitching single messages together. It works pretty well.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can now send updates as much as 420 characters long! This gives you ample space for those thoughts when 140 just won&#8217;t do.</p>
<p>The other main reason we wanted to increase this limit was the answer to the question &#8220;what do you do if you have something longer to say?&#8221; In the online world, you write a blog post and you share the shortened link. But what about all those users who don&#8217;t have access to the Internet or a smartphone? Pring was designed from the ground-up to support SMS and it is important for us that every feature we launch works well over SMS. Short messages work well for sharing links, commenting and chatting; long messages are useful for conveying larger thoughts.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our update and that you keep sending us your feedback.</p>
<p>Until next time, Happy Pringing!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Killing Spam<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Oh how we hate spam! Everyone hates spam. In the begining of Pring, we were small and spam wasn&#8217;t a problem. Eventually as more and more people joined Pring the spammers came. A boy did they came in droves. The result was a lot of spam accounts being created everyday with the sole purpose to create more followers. The problem is that these accounts perform very low-value updates and annoy users terribly. No one likes spam SMS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working to identify common patterns of spamming on Pring such as private message spam, comment spam, update spam and tracking spam. We then build systems to automatically identify and flag these messages. First time offenses are ignored, repeat offenders are warned and eventually suspended.</p>
<p>The result is a much cleaner ecosystem with more useful content and much less spam. From the feedback we&#8217;ve been recieveing, you all seem to love it too. Thanks to our spam prevention system, we&#8217;re now eliminating more than 2 million spam SMS everyday and have suspended 1300+ accounts since launch.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Tracking is a command that advanced users use over SMS to get updates around keywords they track. So, if you were tracking <strong>cricket</strong> you would receive any updates that contained the word cricket. Unfortunately, this gave rise to a new type of spam: keyword stuffing. A spammer could flood popular keywords with irrelevant spammy messages which would break the usefulness of the tracking command. We&#8217;ve changed the tracking functionality after giving it considerable review and thought. You can now only track #hashtags not regular words. So, if you are interested in cricket you can track #cricket. Any updates with the #cricket hastag will then be delivered to you. This allows us to manage keyword stuffing and reduce any spamming that would occur. Your existing track words automatically are now #hashtags.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope they make #ShahidAfridi the captain #cricket #worldcup</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, to reduce spam, we are limiting #hastags to three per update. You can track up to a hundred #hastags at a time.</p>
<p>We hope you like these changes. Happy Pringing!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very common question we hear is &#8220;Who are my followers?&#8221; or &#8220;Who&#8217;s following me?&#8221;. Generally, the broader question is &#8220;How do I find new people?&#8221;. Ofcourse, you can see who is following you from your web profile but more than 90% of our users are mobile only (SMS) so this question is popped up more often.</p>
<p>One of our core philosophy is that whatever we create for the web, we mirror on the mobile as well. This means that every feature we design for the web, it needs to work well for Mobile. Which can prove to be quite challenging considering the limitations posed by SMS.</p>
<p>After a lot of designing, we finally released features to address these questions. The first is the <strong>List </strong>command.</p>
<h2>Lists, Lists, Lists!</h2>
<p>Texting LIST to your shortcode helps you retrieving a summary of your social network and tells you the actions you&#8217;ve done or you want to do on your fellow Pringers. By simply replying to the LIST menu, it may tell you your followers, or the people you follow or the people who you have blocked. Sending LIST to your short-code return you the following menu.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ap kia dekhna chahtay hain. Matlooba number bhaijain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apke followers</li>
<li>Wo jinhain aap follow kar rahay hain</li>
<li>Wo jinhain ap nai block kar rakha hai</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have this menu in front of you replying with 1,2, or 3 would simply get what you are looking for. If a Pringer A<em>li</em> is looking for the people who he&#8217;s following he replies with 1. Likewise for people he is following he can reply with 2 and 3 for those he wants to block. This is the <strong>search results page</strong>. In response to choice no 1 or 2 for example he&#8217;d get:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matlooba number bhaijain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amir</li>
<li>Ghafoor</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again Pring expects you to reply with a number. So if <em>Ali</em> wants to know more about <em>Shaheen</em> he can reply with 3 where he&#8217;s be returned with a menu that asks him what exactly does he want to know about Shaheen. This is the <strong>actions menu<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Matlooba number bhaijain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whois Shaheen</li>
<li>Stats Shaheen</li>
<li>Block Shaheen</li>
<li>Unfollow Shaheen</li>
<li>Pichle Results</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The WHOIS command tells you a short description about Shaheen. Likewise replying with 2, 3 or 4 would use the STATS, BLOCK &amp; UNFOLLOW commands respectively on the user Shaheen. And in the end it asks you whether you want to return to the &#8220;actions menu&#8221; (Replying with 1) or the &#8220;search-page results&#8221; (Replying with 2).</p>
<p>So if you want to scan your friends on Pring and then take specific actions, LIST is the command that would help you in doing that. It helps in making things for you much more visible at Pring. Ofcourse, all of these menus are in English if your interface is set to English.</p>
<h2>Search for Pringers</h2>
<p>Finding your friends on Pring is easy now. All you have to do is use the SEARCH command. Send <strong>SEARCH <em>name</em></strong> to your shortcode and you are returned with all the Pringer IDs containing your required search. For example if a Pring user Ali wants to search for a friend of his going by the alias Goofy, he&#8217;d type in <strong>SEARCH Goofy</strong>. In return he&#8217;s given the list of all the people that have the word &#8220;Goofy&#8221; in their aliases.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reply with no#:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goofy</li>
<li>Ali_Goofy</li>
<li>goofy_007</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>On replying with the number the user is taken to the <strong>actions menu. </strong>For example the reply 1 would return:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matlooba number bhaijain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whois Goofy</li>
<li>Stats Goofy</li>
<li>Block Goofy</li>
<li>Follow Goofy</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy enough to find someone on pring now? Get started then!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Helping You Better</h2>
<p>Here at e-Business, we&#8217;re always working on making your SMS experience over Pring nothing short of amazing. We do a lot of feedback calls to our users to understand in what way can we improve their experience. One of the issue we constantly hear from our SMS-only users is that it is hard for new users to understand what can Pring do.</p>
<p>If you use text you can always send HELP to your shortcode and you&#8217;ll receive help on pretty much anything you can do with/on Pring. Since launching Pring, the amount of things you can do on Pring has grown and so have the number of commands. There are now more than 40 various commands and hundreds of content menus inside Pring. Knowing what you want can become a daunting task over SMS.</p>
<h2>Boy! We&#8217;ve Got a Tip for You!</h2>
<p>For this reason, we&#8217;ve come up with Tips. If you use Pring, you&#8217;ve probably seen our help tips. They appear at the bottom of messages where we tell you how to use a certain command or functionality. Previously, everyone received the same tips over and over again. After collecting feedback, we&#8217;ve overhauled the system to make it much more useful for you.</p>
<p>Tips are now personalized. This means that the tips you see were specifically selected for you. For example, if you have not performed a certain command like FOLLOW; we will recommend that you do with a simple tip such as &#8220;You can get updates from any Pringer by sending FOLLOW Pringer_name&#8221;. Once you act on this tip and send the FOLLOW command, we will no longer send this tip to you. This gives us tremendous flexibility and accuracy in explaining Pring to you bit-by-bit. We&#8217;re working on a whole host of tips that will make it easy for you to understand Pring at the right moment and knowledge level.</p>
<p>Another small but significant step we&#8217;ve taken is the ability to have multi-lingual tips. So, if your language is set to urdu, you will receive tips in Urdu. If your language is set to English, you will recieve tips in English. We translate tips into each supported language.</p>
<h2>Great People To Follow, Seriously!</h2>
<p>But perhaps the most important feature we&#8217;ve launched is personalized recommendations. Searching for new users is hard over SMS. It would be cumbersome to see a list of followers of a particular friend over SMS. A simple solution we&#8217;ve come up with is that we examine all the people you follow and then we examine who do they follow. We then look at the people who who we think are good/fun accounts which you do not follow but are followed by your friends. These accounts are then recommended to you. You will see a tip at the bottom of your SMS such as &#8220;Nash, Umar and 3 more of your friends follow Nomy, you can follow them as well by sending FOLLOW NOMY&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that we&#8217;re working on to make our minimalist interface more meaningful, relevant and fun. We hope you enjoy these changes and give us feedback for improvements!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a few months of testing Pring on Ufone, we are very excited to announce that we are going to go live on the 1st of September 2010. What does this mean?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Change of shortcode from 414 to 2323: </strong>Currently, if you are a Ufone user, you can send and receive updates from the 414 shortcode. After the 1st, all SMS will be sent from 2323 and we will route all traffic from 414 to 2323. Shifting all codes to 2323 simplifies the process of signing up and telling your friends which number to SMS to.</li>
<li><strong>Rs 0.5+tax will be charged on every SMS sent to 2323. </strong>This charge is a small amount and allows us to increase our ability to provide better service quality. Previously, the 414 shortcode was free.</li>
<li><strong>Comment-by-reply functionality: </strong>Currently, to reply to an update you have to write the update @ID followed by the comment. This is slow, hard and unintuitive. Starting from the 1st of September, to comment on any update, all you have to do is to reply to any update and it will become a comment. We already have this <a href="http://blog.pringit.com/2010/01/28/let-a-100-shortcodes-bloom/">functionality on Zong</a>. This allows for better conversations and reduces noisiness. Going forward, shortcode extensions (as these are called) will allow us to greatly simplify your experience for most commands.</li>
<li><strong>Higher limits on sending updates: </strong>On Ufone, depending upon various factors; we limit the updates you can do per hour and per day. We will be relaxing this limit after we place the Rs 0.5+tax charge. Please note that this limit is placed only on updates and not to private messages, comments or any other command.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the whole, we think that these changes are going to make your Ufone experience much better and will allow us to expand with additional functionality. We hope you enjoy these changes!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we started Pring, we designed the whole system in plain English keeping the popularity of English websites like Orkut, Google, Youtube etc. When you send one of our shortcodes an SMS the response from Pring is in English. Same is true for any other command.</p>
<p>After running Pring in the wild for sometime, we&#8217;ve noticed that 90% of our users use some form or the other of Urdu written in English (or Roman Urdu). So, starting from today, we&#8217;re introducing Urdu for Pring over SMS.</p>
<p>You can SMS URDU or ENGLISH and we will change the system language for you accordingly. To find out what your current interface language is, SMS ZABAAN. In the coming days, we will make Urdu as the default system language for SMS in Pakistan. Ofcourse, this does not effect the actual messages from fellow Pringers, they will remain the same.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also working on supporting Nasta&#8217;liq Urdu support for our interface language in a way that does not limit Pring. We hope you enjoy using these new features as much as we had fun writing them!</p>
<p>Happy Pringing!</p>

<h1>Improved Invites</h1>
<p>Previously, whenever you invited someone via SMS they received a message such as &#8220;Jeera100 wants to follow your updates on Pring&#8230;&#8221;. This was fine but sometimes, your friends might not know who Jeera100 is. To improve this, we&#8217;ve added your cell number to the invite message. Now it will read  &#8220;Jeera100 (0321-123-4567) wants to follow your updates on Pring&#8230;&#8221;. This should make it more transparent to the invitee who is inviting them.</p>
<p>Also, you can SMS a valid mobile number  to Pring and we will convert it into an invite.</p>
<h1>Smoother Registration</h1>
<p>Whenever your friend accepts your invitation and signs up on Pring; they just want to start receiving your updates. But instead, they had to register with a username. Setting a username is a hard thing to do. It has to be the right length and with the right characters.</p>
<p>To make it easier for new users to join and receive updates right away, we&#8217;ve removed the need to have a username. When you join Pring, you will be given a new random username likePringerr129. You can always change your username with the Name command.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made a lot of minor updates to improve the overall service. For example, we&#8217;ve noticed that 90% of all communication on Pring is in Roman Urdu, so we&#8217;re making Urdu our default language wherever we can. We&#8217;re working on multi-lingual features so you can select which interface language you want soon.</p>
<p>Till then, Happy Pringing!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered what&#8217;s going on in Pakistan right now? We sure do! Whenever a <a title="Default Privacy Settings" href="http://www.pringit.com/pages/commands_list#default">non-private</a> Pringer update&#8217;s their status, it gets sent to the public page. If you visit our <a title="Pring Public Page" href="http://pringit.com/public">public page</a>, you&#8217;ll see a whole lot of updates coming in every minute. This page gives you a good idea on what everyone is talking about. Private messages, updates from private accounts, commands etc do not appear on this page, but comments on public updates do. We turned this page off sometimes back because of too much traffic, however, after shifting to a much better database for our needs (<a title="Cassandra Project" href="cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>), the public page is lightening fast! Give it a visit <a title="Pring Public Page" href="http://pringit.com/public">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve talked about the complexity of having a conversation over SMS <a title="Having a Conversation on SMS" href="http://blog.pringit.com/2010/01/11/having-a-conversation-on-sms/">before</a>. The updates you receive from anyone you follow on <a title="Pring!" href="http://pringit.com">Pring</a> has a number at the end. If you wanted to comment on that update, you had to reply using that number followed by your comment. Sounds complicated? Well, it can be.</p>
<p>But worry no more! We&#8217;re very happy to announce that starting today, if you&#8217;re a <a title="Zong: Say it all" href="http://zong.com.pk/">Zong</a> customer, you can comment on any update by simply replying to it. This really simplifies the experience of  having a conversation around a particular update.</p>
<p>So, how do we achieve this? When you reply to an SMS, we have no way of knowing what you are replying to. In order to keep track of what you are replying to, we send you updates each time through a different shortcode. For example, instead of getting an update from 2323 (for Zong customers), you will get an update from 232310 or 232311 etc. When you reply to this shortcode, we keep track of the message we sent to you and add your reply as a comment to it. But for updating your status, you still have to send it to 2323. Everything else works the same.</p>
<p>Working with <a title="Owners of Zong" href="http://www.zong.com.pk/about_cmpak.html">CMPak</a> (the people behind Zong) has been great and they&#8217;ve been the first in taking innovation like this forward quickly by allocating us a hundred codes from 232300 to 232399. We&#8217;re working with other Mobile Operators to bring this functionality there as well. We hope this update makes it easier for you to make comments.</p>
<p>Happy commenting!</p>
