      To be clear: content pay walls are not what we are suggesting. Remember, whether you fly Economy or Business: the result is the same (you travel from a to b), and only the experience differs. And likewise Business Class and Economy class seats on news sites should deliver the same content. The idea of creating a business class for online news where is not about buying information, but buying better experience, it’s about service and customer experience. That’s right: Customer (paying), not user (free).

  <description><![CDATA[
  
      Charities appeal to a range of emotions for fundraising. Politicians rely on a few, primarily mail &#034;hot buttons&#034;. Political fundraising is similar to charitable fundraising in that it must evoke an emotion to trigger a donation. The main difference is that a political fundraising letter generally limits the emotional range to the most basic and unattractive of human responses. Anger. Fear. Revenge.

      People read summaries. Summaries don&#039;t affect whether or not they continue reading. . Introductory paragraphs enjoy high readership. Just to be clear, an intro paragraph is a content summary that appears after the headline and before the main text. It’s common in some news writing. I’ve also used it in print ads which are designed in the form of an article, often called an “advertorial.” The downside is that while intros get read, this study says they don’t affect readership of the main text. Maybe they help improve comprehension. The study doesn’t say.

      Yes, online paragraph flow is different. In online writing as in most ad writing, you have to forget normal paragraph development. Breaks should be logical, but they’re organized into a flow of ideas rather than distinct paragraphs.

      Left side list of headlines, first words are important. People scan the left side of a list of headlines. This is related to the previous point. When presented with a list of headlines or links, people will scan down the left side, looking at the first couple words, to find something they’re interested in. They don’t necessarily read each line beginning to end. The implication is the same as before. Get your most mind catching words up front.

      First words in a headline come first. Then the rest of the headline. Then pictures. .Headlines draw eyes before pictures. This might be surprising for some people since the trend has been to add photos and graphics specifically to draw the eye. Even I have been adding more photos to my blog to spice it up a bit. But the participants in this study looked at headlines, especially in the upper left of the page, before they looked at photos when they landed on a page. So you can’t rely on eye candy to make up for poor headlines.

      Differentiation. On a tradeshow floor, which search engine works for which problem? Booths tell little. When I&#039;m attempting to build a shortlist of potential vendors, the experience of looking at home pages reminds me of the frustration I usually feel walking a tradeshow floor. I recently attended an intranet conference that had booths from at least 20 different search engine providers. I simply could not tell the difference between these companies. Who did what? Which technologies would make sense for which type of problem? Which products would fit the budget for which projects? The booths were essentially random designs. While they clearly cost huge amounts of money, they failed to communicate anything distinct to a tired tradeshow visitor pacing up and down the aisles.

      The protests were a lament for a nation in which, despite the 2008 meltdown, the financial system remains largely unregulated, where 46 million Americans live below the official poverty line, and where inequality is greater now than at any time since 1929. That&#039;s hardly the stuff of revolutions: you can read Paul Krugman make a similar point every week in the New York Times. And in the land of the first amendment you&#039;d think it was OK to shout it out in the street, even if that street is Wall Street. Not according to the two white-shirted senior NYPD officers captured on video. The film shows a small group of women protesters, who are doing nothing menacing at all, having been kettled by police. As they stand there fenced in and defenceless, the two white shirts walk up to them, hold out a pepper-spray canister and zap them straight in the face. But it was the incidental details outside the prison that caught my eye. An impassioned but entirely peaceful crowd of protesters had gathered to make the pretty rea...

      For the past year, Facebook has been working on the beautiful re-imagining of the Profile, which they call “Timeline“. I just got it enabled on my account. Going back in time and seeing the past several years of my life displayed in this way is nothing short of profound. Facebook has used software to make something meaningful. Something emotionally powerful. Because of this impact, some people will undoubtedly hate it. But more will love it. It’s incredible: Facebook has become a tool that’s a reflection of who we are. Just in case it wasn’t painfully obvious already, they’re far more than just another web startup that will flame out in a few years. They are the real deal. And they just made their competition look rather foolish.

      Ruby could be written largely without parentheses. The line ``puts sayGoodnight(&#034;John-Boy&#034;)&#039;&#039; contains two method calls, one to sayGoodnight and the other to puts. Why does one call
have its arguments in parentheses while the other doesn&#039;t? In this
case it&#039;s purely a matter of taste. The following lines are all
equivalent.
puts sayGoodnight &#034;John-Boy&#034;
puts sayGoodnight(&#034;John-Boy&#034;)
puts(sayGoodnight &#034;John-Boy&#034;)

      But last week when Wolf Blitzer and CNN had that debate, the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, and Wolf sat there and called them his partners--I just thought, this was amazing, because would you ever see the CNN nurses union debate or the CNN teachers union debate? Because I think there are a few more teachers and nurses in this country than there are members of the Tea Party. But we&#039;ll never see that in the mainstream media. And liberal organizations which have many more members just don&#039;t get the attention. A thousand people arrested in front of the White House a couple of weeks ago on the tar sands environmental issue -- hardly any coverage of this. Can you imagine if 1,000 Tea Party members had been arrested in front of the White House? It would be at the top of every news story. People are down on Wall Street right now, holding a sit-in and a camp- in down there--virtually no news about this protest. This goes on with liberals and the left all of the time, and it gets ignored. And, fortunately, there are sh...

      What is even more bad news is that the most important customers for Microsoft, enterprises, actually upgrade every other version. The Windows “radius” is nominally averaging about 35 months but large account adoption is closer to 60 months. The contrast is then striking: Consumerized devices with over-the-air updates on a 12 month cycle are five times more agile than a traditional corporate Windows desktop. Another way to look at this is that for every change in a corporate desktop environment, the average user will change their device experience five times. Although Microsoft might find comfort in Enterprises’ leisurely pace of change[2], those are the wrong customers to keep happy going forward.

      Greenwald&#039;s prism is David versus Goliath. Ms. Palin’s third point was more striking still: in contrast to the sweeping paeans to capitalism and the free market delivered by the Republican presidential candidates whose ranks she has yet to join, she sought to make a distinction between good capitalists and bad ones. The good ones, in her telling, are those small businesses that take risks and sink and swim in the churning market; the bad ones are well-connected megacorporations that live off bailouts, dodge taxes and profit terrifically while creating no jobs.

      What Carville&#039;s confused, contradictory screed highlights is the difficulty of trying to understand American political conflicts through an exclusively partisan prism of Democrats v. Republicans. Some issues are properly assessed via that dichotomy, but many -- a growing number -- are not. Nonetheless, confining oneself to Democrat v. Republican bickering is the admission price to establishment media access -- that is the only prism they understand or permit -- and most pundits thus happily cling to it; indeed, partisan pundits take the lead role in enforcing this orthodoxy and trying to marginalize anyone who deviates from it or resides outside of it. Political issues insusceptible to this two-team mindset are deemed fringe and rendered invisible. The result (by design) of this narrow, stultifying framework is that many -- perhaps most -- of the most consequential political developments are ignored.

      Allowing &#034;Gambling&#034; / Investment Banks to wed Commercial banks is a disaster! Nonetheless, thanks to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed in 1998 with the help of Bob Rubin, Larry Summers, Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan, Phil Gramm and a host of other short-sighted politicians, we now have a situation where trillions in federally-insured commercial bank deposits have been wedded at the end of a shotgun to exactly such career investment bankers from places like Salomon Brothers (now part of Citi), Merrill Lynch (Bank of America), Bear Stearns (Chase), and so on. These marriages have been a disaster. The influx of i-banking types into the once-boring worlds of commercial bank accounts, home mortgages, and consumer credit has helped turn every part of the financial universe into a casino. That’s why I can’t stand the term &#034;rogue trader,&#034; which is always tossed out there when some investment-banker asshole loses a billion dollars betting with someone else’s money.

      List of the attacks that &#034;catalyzed&#034; American interventions around the world. To put it bluntly, every single chapter in the history of the extension of U.S. power has opened with the same sentence: “Innocent Americans were treacherously attacked…” Remember the Maine in Havana harbor in 1898 (274 dead)? The Lusitania torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1915 (1,198 drowned, including 128 Americans)? Pancho Villa’s raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916 (18 U.S citizens killed)? Pearl Harbor (2,402 dead)? Same sneak attack, same righteous national outrage. Same pretext for clandestine agendas. In addition, historians will also recall the besieged legation in Peking (1899), Emilio Aguinaldo’s alleged perfidy outside Manila (1899), various crimes against American banks and businessmen in Central America and the Caribbean (1900-1930), the Japanese bombing of the USS Panay in 1938, the Chinese army’s crossing of the Yalu River into Korea (1950), the Gulf of Tonkin incident in Vietnam (1964), the North Korean capture of t...

      This is why that first impression, including your email, intro path and pitch deck is so important. It&#039;s your chance to make that click happen, or blow it. It&#039;s hard to recover from the wrong framing.

      Investors want a detailed history of the team. how&#039;d you end up doing this or what led you here over the past few years? Responses to these questions generally get to what I want: your detailed history. Did you do other companies before this one? What happened? Did you to college? What was your major? Did you work after school? What was that like? Did you evolve into pursuing this idea over time or was it more of a discrete jump? How did the team members meet? Etc. etc. A lot of this stuff is actually covered in incubator applications, and I try to get copies of those wherever possible as a result.

      Thin clients allow programmers more freedom to hang with and only interact with programmer-friendly systems. They can have their own islands of control. In server-based applications you can
get away with using the most advanced technologies,
and I think this is the main
cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the &#034;programming language
renaissance.&#034; This is why we even hear about new
languages like Perl and Python. We&#039;re not hearing about these
languages because people are using them to write Windows
apps, but because people are using them on servers. And as
software shifts off the desktop and onto servers (a future even
Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less
and less pressure to use middle-of-the-road technologies.

      Problem is, it’s really really hard to figure out what makes you happy. It’s way easier to guilt yourself into a sense of obligation which you then use to rationalize the decision to do something you don’t actually enjoy. (Other popular happiness-avoidance tactics include doing nothing, trying to make a lot of money, bad relationships, and over-education.)

      This was, Bush would say only three days after the attacks, &#034;the first war of the twenty-first century.&#034; Only problem: it wasn’t. Despite the screaming headlines, Ground Zero wasn’t Pearl Harbor. Al-Qaeda wasn’t Japan, nor was it Nazi Germany. It wasn’t the Soviet Union. It had no army, nor finances to speak of, and possessed no state (though it had the minimalist protection of a hapless government in Afghanistan, one of the most backward, poverty-stricken lands on the planet).

      We would have been better off consigning our memories of 9/11 to oblivion, forgetting it all if only we could. We can’t, of course. But we could stop the anniversary remembrances. We could stop invoking 9/11 in every imaginable way so many years later. We could stop using it to make ourselves feel like a far better country than we are. We could, in short, leave the dead in peace and take a good, hard look at ourselves, the living, in the nearest mirror.
