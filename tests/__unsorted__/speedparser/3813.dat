<p>“Wayns had some games where he knocked down deep shots, played a strong floor game and dished out numerous assists. After these contests, the buzz would begin about how Wayns is beginning to look ready to make the leap into the NBA draft. Those great performances were counter-balanced by games with poor defensive effort, over-aggressive passing and erratic shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Quickness with the ball in transition. Dribble penetrating. Ball-handling and physicality. Foul shooting. Scorer&#8217;s mentality.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Inconsistent jump shooter. At times, he struggles to stop dribble-penetration and to effectively provide help in Coach Wright&#8217;s defense. Over-dribbling. Digressed as an on-the-ball defender.</p>
<p><strong>Summer School</strong>: Improving the consistency of his jump-shot. Developing the ability to bring the same focus and desire to the arena game in and game out. He improved his court vision and ability to distribute the ball over the eighteen months &#8211; that area can continue to improve along with his decision-making. Improve as a team defender.</p>
<p><strong>What next</strong>: This is Maalik&#8217;s team now. Will he step up and lead it? The opportunity is there to play 35 mpg, run the offense, and be the leading scorer and assist man on offense while setting the tone on defense. The team needs to jump-start the offense with turnovers and transition baskets &#8211; Wayns needs to be the spark-plug on the defensive end of the court. Take care of business on the court and the appropriate level of NBA attention will follow.”<strong></strong></p>

There were initially reports on message boards that West Virginia&#8217;s president left the meeting early — this was apparently not the case.

The meeting lasted until a little after 3:30 p.m. <a href="http://vuhoops.com/2011/10/01/full-membership-for-temple/">We reported earlier what we expected to be discussed </a>according to sources.</p>
<p>There were initially reports on message boards that West Virginia&#8217;s president left the meeting early — this was apparently not the case.</p>
<p>After the meeting broke up, John Marinatto made the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;The presidents voted unanimously to authorize the commissioner to aggressively pursue discussions with a select number of institutions that have indicated a strong interest in joining the Big East Conference.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The presidents are also actively considering changes to the conference&#8217;s governing bylaws to further solidify the membership.&#8221;</li>
<li>Commissioner Marinatto said that UConn president Herbst was &#8220;terrific in the meeting, promised to do anything she can to help strengthen the Big East.&#8221;</li>
<li>They didn&#8217;t name any target schools, but noted that they will be football-playing members.</li>
<li>The sevices academies fit academic and athletic profile of the conference. That profile was described as &#8220;high academic standards and strong athletic performance.&#8221;</li>
<li>TCU Chancellor Victor J. Boschini Jr. &#8220;had never wavered&#8221; on Big East membership and was &#8220;very positive&#8221; during the meeting.</li>
<li>Marinatto said he felt better about the conference&#8217;s future than before the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instant Analysis: </strong>No change in leadership, no financial commitment to the league and no solid actions taken on expansion. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there is much to really report at this point in time, so we might as well <a href="http://pean.me/bigeast.php" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/pean.me');">randomly generate the next rumor</a> (<a href="http://friarblog.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/friarblog.com');">h/t FriarBlog</a>).</p>
<p>Though Marinatto expressed confidence, I wouldn&#8217;t consider the league in a much better position than it was a week or two ago. &#8220;Considering&#8221; a change in the bylaws is not the same as actually changing them, it shows a non-committal attitude from the members, and perhaps an expectation on the part of others that invitations to other conferences will be coming (and a desire to keep those options open until they do).</p>
<p>Who are the schools that have indicated a strong interest in joining the Big East Conference? Surely ECU is strongly interested after their very-public application to the conference. Navy and Air Force  are possibly two others. Is Villanova included in that group? We may not find out for a while.</p>
<p>Our source said earlier that this meeting sounded like a &#8220;waste of time,&#8221; and since nothing solid has really seemed  to come of it, maybe it was.</p>
<p><strong>(Update 7:30p)</strong> <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7051020/presidents-chancellors-give-commissioner-ok-expand-big-east-conference" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/espn.go.com');">Andy Katz reports that</a> &#8220;a number of schools were discussed, including Navy, Army, Air Force, Temple, Central Florida and a new name in SMU.&#8221; All of which would reportedly join the conference as full members if invited, except the service academies.</p>
<p><strong>(Update 9:35p) </strong>The <a href="http://twitter.com/jensenoffcampus/status/120662979191644160" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/twitter.com');">Philadelphia Inquirer&#8217;s Mike Jensen tweeted</a>, &#8220;Adding Temple, allowing Villanova to move up in football, remain viable Big East options after presidents&#8217; meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>(Update 10/3 &#8211; 11:39a)</strong> This morning<a href="http://www.zagsblog.com/2011/10/03/big-east-to-expand-but-pitino-says-memphis-not-ready/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.zagsblog.com');"> ZagsBlog.com posted a comment from Rick Pitino on expansion</a>. Pitino has really wanted Memphis to join the Big East for basketball, because it has been a strong program and a former rivalry for his Cardinals. He does not believe they will be an option, however:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Memphis, it’s a shame because their football program is so down right  now,” Pitino told SNY.tv last week in an exclusive interview at Hudson  Catholic High School. “I don’t know why it’s down, but it is down and  that’s what probably’s taking away from it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Memphis wants desperately to be in a BCS conference, but their dreadful football performance puts them in no-better position than Villanova (and very possibly a worse position). Their athletic director, R.C. Johnson, previously was the AD at Temple during their failed tenure as a football-only member of the Big East.</p>

According to Mike DeCourcy of the Sporting News, Sunday&#8217;s Big East meeting in Washington, D.C. will include a vote on whether or not to offer Temple University a full membership in the league. Temple has always been on the Big East radar as a strong hoops program within the northeast corridor, but Villanova&#8217;s presence in the Philadelphia market had previously kept the Owls out of the league. That could change in the next week or two, however, as a previously abysmal Temple football program has seemingly turned a new leaf and is putting together a stellar season that will likely give the school it&#8217;s third winning season in a row. DeCourcy wrote: Meanwhile, a source close to the Big East said that league is expected to vote on offering Temple full membership in the league at its secretive presidents’ meeting Sunday in Washington, along with demanding a more firm commitment from restless members Connecticut and Rutgers. Villanova would hardly want their crosstown rival in the same basketball conference, but there is little that the Wildcats can do to stop the move, other than make a strong case for their own football program.

That could change in the next week or two, however, as a previously abysmal Temple football program has seemingly turned a new leaf and is putting together a stellar season that will likely give the school it&#8217;s third winning season in a row. <a href="http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-09-30/big-12-puts-merger-on-hold-awaits-missouris-commitment#ixzz1ZUj1eqFb" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/aol.sportingnews.com');">DeCourcy wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Meanwhile, a source close to the Big East said that league is expected to vote on offering Temple full membership in the league at its secretive presidents’ meeting Sunday in Washington, along with demanding a more firm commitment from restless members Connecticut and Rutgers. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Villanova would hardly want their crosstown rival in the same basketball conference, but there is little that the Wildcats can do to stop the move, other than make a strong case for their own football program.</p>
<p>This news flys in the face of a claim made my University of South Florida president Judy Genshaft this week, where <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/usf-president-judy-genshaft-reports-of-blocking-ucf-are-wrong/1193933" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.tampabay.com');">she claimed that the Big East would not consider schools in the same state as current members</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is happening is the league, or the conference, now is looking at schools, and they have looked very much at schools that are not in any of the states that are represented by the Big East schools right now,&#8221; Genshaft explained. &#8220;The ones that they&#8217;re looking at right now, they do not sit in any state that the Big East schools currently are in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expansion however, is driven by football and there is no Big East football school in Pennsylvania (once Pittsburgh departs).</p>
<p>Now, that Pennsylvania football school could have been Villanova, and prior to the departure of Pittsburgh and Syracuse, it was perhaps more-likely. Now, the conference might be feeling rushed to expand, and unwilling to wait for a Villanova program to make the transition from FCS.</p>
<p>Will Villanova football also be voted on? Nobody is currently reporting that it will, and since Father Peter Donohue will be Villanova&#8217;s only representative at the meeting, it is more difficult to tell how hard he will campaign for that move. It is certainly more likely that he would push for a Villanova football invitation if the league appears to be reaching stability and new exit fees or other precautions were taken to ensure that stability prior to expansion talk.</p>
<p>Stability might be very far from the Big East&#8217;s status, however. <a href="http://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2011/09/big_12_trying_to_take_tcu_befo.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.nj.com');">TCU is back on the Big XII radar</a>, and other reports have <a href="http://www2.kusports.com/weblogs/tale-tait/2011/sep/27/realignment-today-941-pm-big-12-ads-meet/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www2.kusports.com');">Louisville, Cincinnati and West Virginia</a> on that list as well — and West Virginia, at least, is anxious to leave the conference if a suitable option were available.</p>
<p>Before the Big XII can expand, however, it needs to lock down it&#8217;s own stability. While a plan involving exit fees and media rights was laid out not long ago, the schools have not contractually bound themselves to those terms just yet. Missouri will hold a Board of Curators meeting on Tuesday to discuss their intentions, and may empower their president to move the school to the SEC, or decide to stay put.</p>
<p>A scenario where Temple joins the Big East as a full member is not the worst-possible scenario for Villanova, but it is far from the best one. The &#8216;Cats would be competing for media attention, fan dollars, and recruits with a school in the same major metropolitan area. Is there enough to go around?</p>
<p><strong>(Update 6:45p)</strong> Villanova sources indicate that they do not expect Temple to be on the agenda for tomorrow&#8217;s meeting. Sunday&#8217;s meeting is designed to find out who will commit to the conference for the future. Our source called the meeting a &#8220;waste of time,&#8221; since nobody is likely to admit their intention to leave for another conference (except UConn).</p>
<p>The football schools will discuss Navy and Army as members but it is currently doubtful that either will commit without knowing that the conference will survive with most of it&#8217;s current members.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh and Syracuse were not invited to the meeting and was TCU invited as an observer, but will not vote.</p>
<p><strong>(Update 10/2) </strong>Today&#8217;s meeting will last until around 3:00pm. The agenda includes a discussion of increased exit penalties and it is expected that some Presidents will ask for a long-term TV-rights commitment like what the Big XII discussed and that they hope to implement soon.</p>

The 16-20 loss put Villanova&#8217;s record down to 1-4 with an 0-2 record in CAA play.</p>
<p>The Cats started strong, driving downfield early in the first quarter to score a field goal. That was matched just before the end of the quarter by a 1-yard <strong>Jonathan Grimes </strong>rushing touchdown to give the Tribe the lead again.</p>
<p><strong>Christian</strong> <strong>Culicerto</strong> answered that touchdown with one of his own early in the second quarter, tossing a 15-yard touchdown pass to junior wideout, <strong>Dorian Wells. </strong>That lead wasn&#8217;t built to last, however, as Grimes would sprint 22 yards with the ball about 5 minutes later for the second William &amp; Mary touchdown. Villanova would score on another field goal before the half to go into the locker rooms down by one point, 13-14.</p>
<p>Grimes finished the game with 137 yards on 31 carries and scored two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Villanova only ran 14 plays in the second half, while William &amp; Mary  kept the chains moving and the Villanova defense on the field. It was remarkable then, that Villanova was able to hold the Tribe to just two field goals in the last two quarters.</p>
<p>Despite being so ineffective, the Wildcats had a chance to win the game late in the 4th quarter. Down by 4 points, Culicerto helped the &#8216;Cats offense get deep into Tribe territory, all the way to their 24 yard line. An ineffective running game forced Culicerto to make plays and he did well on that drive until deciding to make a tough pass into coverage on 4th and two.</p>
<p>Culicerto finished the game with 132 yards passing, one touchdown and one interception. He completed 62.5% of his 24 pass attempts. True-freshman <strong>Jamal Abdur-Rahman</strong> was the top runner in an otherwise ineffective rushing game, with 43 yards on 4 carries (10.8 yards per carry). In the passing game, <strong>Dorian Wells</strong> again lead the way with 59 yards on 6 receptions.</p>
<p>On defense,<a href="http://vuhoops.com/2011/09/28/dillon-lucas-on-rice-award-list/"> Jerry Rice Award candidate</a>,<strong> Dillon Lucas</strong>, was again among the top performers. A fellow freshman linebacker, <strong>Joey Harmon</strong>, however, had the defensive play of the game when he grabbed a tipped pass for an interception.</p>
<p>That turnover cost Villanova the ball and, ultimately the game. With three minutes left, the W&amp;M offense was able to run enough time off the clock to end the game and secure their 4-point win. Their first in conference play, and their first victory at Villanova Stadium since 2000.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Updated 7:30p) This morning, while you were drinking your coffee, Dallas Ouano had surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus ligament in his right knee. The senior walk-on had surgery performed on his knee and will begin rehab after a brief period of rest. The procedure, performed by Villanova team orthopedic surgeon Dr. Rob Good, appears to have been relatively short, it took approximately two hours before the Villanova guard was back on Twitter thanking everyone for their well-wishes.</p>
<p>“Dallas is doing well after the surgery,” stated VU head coach Jay Wright. “I know he’s disappointed that this setback occurred but he continues to exhibit outstanding leadership for our young guys. His work ethic in this rehab will be a great example for our young team.”</p>
<p>Villanova does not yet have a timetable for Ouano&#8217;s return to basketball activities. Some knee injuries that are more serious can end a player&#8217;s season. A lesser injury could take a little as 6-8 weeks before he can return to physical activities.</p>
<p>This probably means that Ouano won&#8217;t be available for the Blue &amp; White scrimmage on homecoming weekend, or during the preseason practices that will start in mid-October. Depending on the severity of the injury, he could be sitting out a portion of the regular season as well.</p>
<p>The impact of this is mostly in the areas of bench-depth and practice intensity. Ouano was unlikely to see many minutes outside of some junk-time in blow out games and in serious emergency situations.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[William &#38; Mary has one thing in common with Villanova, both schools opened conference play with a loss. William &#38; Mary, however, picked up two wins out of conference and though they have dropped in the rankings, remains ranked 11th in the polls heading into Saturday&#8217;s bout on the Main Line. The Tribe has wins over VMI and Division-II University of New Haven and losses to UVa and James Madison. The last time William &#38; Mary beat Villanova on the Main Line was in 2000 in a 48-41 overtime game. The Tribe is 4-10 playing in Villanova Stadium.

Sophomore quarterback Mike Graham was able to lead the team on two long scoring drives and make good use of previously-injured junior wide receiver, Ryan Moody, who caught three passes for 82 yards.

The Tribe has wins over VMI and Division-II University of New Haven and losses to UVa and James Madison.</p>
<p>The last time William &amp; Mary beat Villanova on the Main Line was in 2000 in a 48-41 overtime game. The Tribe is 4-10 playing in Villanova Stadium.</p>
<p>W&amp;M&#8217;s passing game was stagnant in the first three weeks, but finally picked up last week in their loss to James Madison. Sophomore quarterback <strong>Mike Graham </strong>was able to lead the team on two long scoring drives and make good use of previously-injured junior wide receiver, <strong>Ryan Moody</strong>, who caught three passes for 82 yards. Moody&#8217;s return will force the Villanova secondary to adjust its coverage — he was a second-team all-CAA selection last year.</p>
<p>Senior receiver <strong>D.J. Mangas</strong> also had a big game against JMU, totaling six catches, 102 yards and a touchdown. Moody&#8217;s threat certainly opened things up for Mangas on the other side of the field, as does a running game lead by Walter Payton candidate, <strong>Jonathan</strong> <strong>Grimes</strong>.</p>
<p>Defense has always been a strong suit for Jimmy Laycock&#8217;s team, but has struggled a little so far this year. The Tribe lost star linebacker <strong>Dante Cook </strong>early in last week&#8217;s game to an injury. Junior <strong>Brian Thompson </strong>will move from safety to outside linebacker this week, and sophomore <strong>Jerome Couplin </strong>will take over in the secondary.</p>
<p>Villanova will again start <strong>Christian Culicerto</strong>, a walk-on senior, at quarterback. Culicerto played in a Wing-T offense in high school, and has had to adjust to Villanova&#8217;s offense since arriving on campus.</p>
<p>“The biggest adjustment for me was the spread offense,” Culicerto <a href="http://pottsmerc.com/articles/2011/09/29/sports/doc4e85036bcdd5d576137619.txt" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/pottsmerc.com');">told the Pottstown Mercury</a>. “I only threw the ball four or five times a game. We were a running team.”</p>
<p>When he runs, he often looks a bit like Chris Whitney — he doesn&#8217;t slide as much as Andy Talley and offensive coordinator Sam Venuto would like.</p>
<p>‘I’d probably slide more if I hadn’t watched Chris Whitney run over people for three years,” <a href="http://pottsmerc.com/articles/2011/09/29/sports/doc4e85036bcdd5d576137619.txt?viewmode=fullstory" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/pottsmerc.com');">Culicerto said</a>. “I’m not as big as he is, but that’s just the competitor in me. I want to do whatever I have to do to help my team win.”</p>
<p>Villanova has a more balanced attack, at least in theory. Until last week, most games split between passing calls and rushing playcalls were split close to 50/50. Against Penn last weekend, there were only 20 passing plays called and 38 carries; not quite the Wing-T, but Villanova is leaning a bit more on a rushing game that has been lead by <strong>Austin Medley </strong>and <strong>Kevin Monangai</strong>, both freshmen.</p>
<p>Medley sat out last week with a back injury, but it was not expected to be a multi-week injury.</p>
<p>Without Norman White or Joe Price, the passing game has relied on <strong>Dorian Wells</strong>, a junior who had 70 yards and a touchdown against Penn, and <strong>Mikey Reynolds</strong>, a diminutive slot receiver. Both players have been effective at picking up yards and helping Culicerto to succeed.</p>
<p>The offense also managed to cut its turnovers down last week in the victory, with just one. Culicerto threw a single pick in the game.</p>
<p>Nova&#8217;s defensive line is starting to live up to the hype as of last week. <strong>Rakim Cox </strong>was credited with six tackles (three solo), 2.5 tackles for loss (-14 yards), one forced fumble and one fumble recovery against the Quakers.</p>
<p>Two fresh faces have stepped up on the defense, however, to really shine. <strong>Dillon Lucas</strong>, a linebacker out of Shawnee High School, has performed so well that people have begun to take notice and he was included on the<a href="http://vuhoops.com/2011/09/28/dillon-lucas-on-rice-award-list/"> initial watch list for the Jerry Rice Award</a>. Lucas leads the team in tackles. Free safety <strong>Joe Sarnese </strong>got plenty of special teams opportunities in the first two weeks, but logged his first start in week 3 against Monmouth. In his two starts, he has recorded 17 tackles and partially blocked a punt against Penn.</p>
<p>Both cornerback <strong>James Pitts </strong>and safety <strong>Ronnie Akins </strong>had an interception last week, it was the second for Akins. Both picks were run back for touchdowns, and it was the second straight year that Pitts did so against Penn. The senior now has 10 career interceptions.</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>William &amp; Mary is probably a team that is better than their record. They have struggled a bit to live up to some very lofty expectations early in the season, but they are a very talented team that is in the process of searching for it&#8217;s identity. Villanova, meanwhile is looking to build some momentum and get into the heart of CAA play on a high note.</p>
<p>The key to winning last week was the adjustment to rely on the running game and the ability of Christian Culicerto to manage the game and help limit turnovers. If that continues, the Villanova offense will be able to give the defense a chance to breathe and will score at least a few points.</p>
<p>With each passing week, the experience levels for the freshmen players is growing and they will hopefully become increasingly more comfortable in the roles they have been handed.</p>
<p>The Tribe have started to get their passing game on track again and have one of the top running backs in the CAA (and possibly all of FCS). They will be a real test for the Wildcats defense to try and manage.</p>
<p>On the other end, William &amp; Mary have been hit hard by injuries on their defense and particularly at linebacker and safety. It could be a good opportunity to test their defense up the middle, especially with the running game.</p>
<p>The games only get more difficult from this point on, but Villanova won a tough game against Penn last week and may be about to turn the corner on this season as well. Culicerto is ready to play, and while he might not be a spread-offense superstar, he is a solid option for as long as the &#8216;Cats need him.</p>
<p>If William &amp; Mary continues to struggle, Villanova can certainly take advantage and win this game. If they awake from their slumber and play to their preseason rankings, they will be a big handful for a &#8216;Cats team that has to win six of the next seven games (most likely) in order to have hope of a return to the postseason.</p>
<h3>Time, TV and Radio</h3>
<p>Saturday game will kick off at <strong>Noon </strong>from Villanova Stadium and will be televised live by the <strong>Comcast  Network</strong> and will also air on <strong>Comcast SportsNet New England</strong> and on <strong>Cox 11</strong> in the Tidewater area.  Marc Zumoff and Kevin Reilly have the call.</p>
<p>The live radio broadcast of every Wildcats game can also be heard  on the air and online at Villanova.com. Joe Eichhorn and Ryan Fannon  will have all of the action as the game is broadcast on <strong>950-AM ESPN  Radio</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2011/9/26/2450747/big-east-blogger-roundtable-biggest-loss" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.rumbleinthegarden.com');">I. Which player is your team&#8217;s biggest loss?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Without a doubt it is Corey    Stokes. He really emerged as a go-to  option on the perimeter last season and    he was a great pure shooter  that will be tough to replace.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2011/9/27/2452299/blogger-roundtable-step-your-game-up" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.rumbleinthegarden.com');">II. Which player needs to step up their game?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Dominic Cheek will have to become a lot more consistent from deep or  one of the freshmen will have to step up to help keep defenses honest.  He will get the starts and the shots that Stokes left behind and will  need to make the most of those opportunities. He had a couple big games  in Europe though, so hopefully he is on the right track.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2011/9/28/2455728/blogger-roundtable-this-years-surprise-players" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.rumbleinthegarden.com');">III. Who will be this season&#8217;s surprise player?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Probably Cheek, but I think Pinkston or Bell may also emerge this  season. Cheek did work in Europe, and I fully suspect that he will break  out some offensively this season. The departure of Isaiah Armwood, however, also opens up some  frontcourt minutes. It sounds like James Bell (who played the 2 for the U19  national team) might get the starts in Armwood&#8217;s place at the 4, but  Pinkston&#8217;s bulkier frame may be better suited to succeed in that role.  Both are very talented players who have the potential to go on a tear  this season.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2011/9/29/2458416/blogger-roundtable-the-newcomers-were-excited-to-see" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.rumbleinthegarden.com');">IV. Who are you most excited to see play?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe Kennedy is without a doubt one of the best &#8220;character guys&#8221;  on this team. He is also a big body that can spell Mouph a lot more  believably than Mo Sutton. He has some room to get better as a player,  but he has great size and instincts as well as great court-vision. He  seems to make good decisions on the floor.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.rumbleinthegarden.com/2011/9/30/2458780/blogger-roundtable-future-of-Big-East-programs" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.rumbleinthegarden.com');">V.  Who is the future of your program?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>I absolutely hate this question. I really don&#8217;t want to predict the  future when the present isn&#8217;t so bad. There are no seniors on this team,  and this 2011-12 roster has two seasons to figure out how to play  together and win games. The last time that happened, Villanova went to  the 2009 Final Four. If you press me, however, the answer is Ty Johnson  and Ryan Arcidiacono — one of whom will run point after Maalik Wayns leaves school.</em></p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[When it was announced that Corey Stokes was on his way to join a German bundesliga team, BCC Bayreuth, many wondered what happened with the criminal charges he was faced with after a June 30th bar fight in Hoboken. Stokes had been out in the Hudson County city with some friends in the early morning hours, when they became involved in the altercation near One Hudson Place that sent two victims to the hospital with various injuries. Stokes is represented by Frank P. Arleo, Esq., a double-Villanova alumnus, of the firm Arleo, Donohue &#38; Biancamano, LLC. According to Arleo, all indications are that Stokes did not get involved in the fight until it escalated into a &#8220;melee,&#8221; that required him to defend himself from becoming a victim himself. The police report makes clear that both victims of the fight were drunk at the time and had incited the fight by making comments to the other parties (that Stokes&#8217; camp claims were racial). It seems unlikely that this legal issue will prevent Stokes from taking the court in Germany, and it will hopefully be resolved soon, according to his attorney.

		<description><![CDATA[Normally Villanova can expect one or two football recruits to change their minds, and this year will clearly be no different. Bryan Osei, a defensive end from Abington High School in Pennsylvania, has now decided to change his commitment to Temple. The 6-2 and 230-lb Osei is rated three-stars (a 76) by ESPN,  and unranked by Rivals and Scout. He had offers from Kent State, Old Dominion and Stony Brook in addition to Villanova and Temple and had initially cited Villanova&#8217;s proposed move to the Big East conference and academics as the reasons for his commitment. Now, he tells the Philadelphia Inquirer, &#8220;I like that Temple&#8217;s football program is on the rise and on the verge of doing big things. Also, it turns out that the school has a higher educational ranking for psychology [his intended major].&#8221; Temple&#8217;s psychology graduate program is ranked 50th in the nation by US News and World Report, but undergraduate programs are not ranked by subject in the liberal arts and sciences.

<p>Osei had been the 10th recruit in Villanova&#8217;s 2012 class (which would have likely capped off at 11 members). He informed the Villanova coaching staff of his change of heart over the weekend. <a href="http://vuhoops.com/2011/09/06/bedell-no-more/">Stacey Bedell, a speedy running back from Long Island also de-committed recently</a> after citing academics and Big East potential as reasons he liked Villanova.</p>
<p>That common thread might be the real reason why the Villanova class is shedding recruits faster than a Concorde jet crosses the Atlantic. The Wildcats initially received many of these commitments when there was a much higher level of confidence that the football program would be moving to the Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Big East conference. Without that, the Wildcats are just an FCS school that had some recent success but is struggling to get through the 2011 season.</p>
<p>Villanova now has 8 known verbal commitments for the 2012 class, with no word yet on whether or not linebacker <strong>Corey Majors</strong> will be joining the program after his prep school year is over. The recruits still committed to Villanova football are:</p>
