<p>A decade ago, I was sitting in class at Capital University when I started to wonder where all my classmates were.&nbsp; Another student popped his head in to say, &ldquo;class is cancelled, go turn on the news.&rdquo; &nbsp;I ran to my friend&rsquo;s dorm room to see what was happening, and soon learned about the events of September 11<sup>th</sup> at the World Trade Center in NYC.&nbsp; Only a few minutes after watching some coverage, I found out that my father was actually in an executive meeting in the South Tower on the 105<sup>th</sup> floor of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>In my father&rsquo;s speech that he gives across the country, he mentions that, by doing his speeches, he &ldquo;keeps the voices of the 3,000 lost alive, and makes sure that we always remember and never forget what happened on September 11, 2001&rdquo;.&nbsp; In just a few days, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in NYC.&nbsp; Because of my close relationship with the events of 9/11, I want to suggest that we take the proper time to recognize and remember the events of that day, and properly honor those that were lost a decade ago so the voices of those lost are heard again we did not forget, and will always remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take a few moments to go to the <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/projects/project_display.php?proj_identifier=2011/08/31/economic-legacy-of-9-11" target="_blank">APM Marketplace website</a> to hear survivor stories from 9/11/01, including my father&rsquo;s, Joseph Dittmar.&nbsp; Scroll to the middle of the page, and you will find photos to match survivor stories.</p>
<p>A mosaic of these interviews will also be aired on NPR Marketplace on Friday. Feel free to also view a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INg1GE1z25M">my 2009 speech</a> at the Scottsdale Healing Fields (my apologies that it is sideways).</p>

From iPads to Podcasts, making lessons that are both engaging and informative are becoming a necessity more and more. And as the line between the traditional classrooms and 21st-centry learning environments continues to become more and more blurred, students and teachers are starting to see significant changes in the world of education.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the acceptance of online education and other distance learning strategics. In support of this trend, <strong>www.onlineeducation.net</strong> has created this <strong>great infographic explaining the shift towards online education.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

While it may be your initial reaction to simply scoff at the idea of <strong>using <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> in the classroom</strong>, completely ignoring the use of social media in schools isn&rsquo;t the answer. No one is debating the fact that there are definite risks involved when in using social media. From inappropriate student-teacher relationships to the ever-increasing prevalence of cyber-bullying, there are plenty of reasons to stay away from social media sites.</p>
<p>But before deciding to prohibit and limit the use of these websites, schools and districts should realize that social media can be an invaluable communication tool. It&rsquo;s no secret that our students are using social networks. Whether it&rsquo;s via their cell phone or computer, students are always connected to the online global community and are looking for a rich and engaging multimedia experience, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>So in an effort to improve student engagement, some teachers are coming up with some innovative and interactive ways to integrate social media in their classrooms. From Skype conversations with students across the globe, to group discussions via Facebook pages, social media is allowing teachers to deliver that interactive multimedia experience students are searching for.</p>
<p>If students are connected to the digital world 24/7, why are we surprised when students lose interest when we make them disconnect and &ldquo;power down&rdquo; every time they enter the classroom? In order to effectively teach today&rsquo;s students; we need to give them the tools they need to succeed in today&rsquo;s digital media landscape.</p>
<p>For those educators who are willing to embrace social media and incorporate it into the classroom, you don&rsquo;t need to do it alone. There are a number of online resources available for teachers who are looking for a little guidance when navigating the world of social media. One of the better resources for teachers is the website <strong><a href="http://www.facebookforeducators.org/">Facebook for Educators</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you decide to give Facebook a try, we highly recommend you read their guide for educators. The guide is full of valuable tips and information on how to effectively use Facebook in an educational setting. For those who don&rsquo;t know where to start, this website is a great resource.</p>
<p>You can read the complete guide on the <a href="facebookforeducators.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Facebook-Edu-Guide.pdf"><strong>Facebook for Educators website</strong></a>.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>InnovatED Teacher Spotlight - Wendy McFarland</title><category term="Company News"/><category term="Interview"/><category term="Teacher Spotlight"/><category term="Video"/><category term="Videos"/><category term="Wendy McFarland"/><id>http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/journal/2011/4/11/innovated-teacher-spotlight-wendy-mcfarland.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/journal/2011/4/11/innovated-teacher-spotlight-wendy-mcfarland.html"/><author><name>InnovatED Marketing</name></author><published>2011-04-11T15:58:37Z</published><updated>2011-04-11T15:58:37Z</updated><content type="html" xml:lang="en-US"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a video interview of <a href="http://www.innovat-ed.com">InnovatED</a> online instructor Wendy McFarland.

As I write this, I can hear the moans of high school students across the country at the mere mention of the words, &ldquo;summer school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When June rolls around on the calendar, all a student wants to think about is how much fun they&rsquo;re going to have, not how much homework they have to do. But for some students, taking summer school is a necessary evil. While summer school may still be a necessity for some students, it no longer has to be an unbearable experience.</p>
<p>With the advancement in <strong>online education</strong> and <a href="http://www.innovat-ed.com">distance learning courses</a>, summer school has become more accommodating and engaging for today&rsquo;s students.

<p>In recent years, we have seen an increase in the use of technologies in the classroom such as <strong>iPods, video chats, and laptops</strong>, and this trend is only going to increase. While some may still balk at the opportunity to utilize these devices, the idea of <strong>adding technology to the classroom</strong> is an increasing sentiment in today&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>But why should you embrace using educational technologies in the classroom? Well, simply put, today&rsquo;s students are driven by technology now more than ever.</p>
<p>From <strong>e-mail </strong>to <strong>text messaging</strong>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/InnovatEDSolutions">Facebook</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/InnovatED">Twitter</a>, today&rsquo;s teens are connected to the global community 24/7. Students are now conditioned to the idea that instant gratification is the norm. Cell phones and other mobile devices are giving everyone, including our students, the ability to send and receive news and information instantaneously.</p>
<p>It is no secret that we are living in a technology-driven, <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">web-2.0</a></strong> society, so why are we surprised that many of our students aren&rsquo;t engaging in curriculum designed in the 20<sup>th</sup> century?</p>
<p>By no means am I crying out for the death of the printed page. I&rsquo;m simply saying that we should embrace change, not ignore it. The printed book will continue to be an integral part of the education process, but if we can incorporate these new technologies into our lesson plans, we can begin to engage our students in ways we never thought possible.</p>
<p>Because of our hesitation to add technology into the classroom, students are forced to &ldquo;power down&rdquo; every day they go to school. Outside of the classroom, our students are using devices like iPods, cell phones, computers and gaming systems in their everyday lives. So it should come as no surprise that many students become disinterested or unengaged when we make them &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; from technology when they enter the classroom.</p>
<p>In order to engage the students of today&rsquo;s multi-media world, we must find a way to successfully incorporate new technology trends in our traditional educational setting. Of course, like anything else, there are dangers and risks that come with these new technologies. But ignoring these new technologies is not the answer. Since these tools and devices are such a big part of our every day communications, ignoring them all together would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Besides, can you imagine what our education system would be like if we never incorporated the internet in our schools?</p>
<p>If we are worried about how students will use these tools, we as educators have a responsibility to teach our students how to use them effectively and responsibly. As we look for new ways to engage our students, these new technologies are continuing to evolve and gain popularity among teachers and students. We must realize that we don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of this new technology, and instead see that, if used responsibly and effectively, these new technologies and devices can <strong>revolutionize the way we engage our students.</strong></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Fighting to Prevent High School Dropouts</title><category term="Credit Recovery"/><category term="Educational"/><category term="High School"/><category term="online education"/><id>http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/journal/2011/1/19/fighting-to-prevent-high-school-dropouts.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/journal/2011/1/19/fighting-to-prevent-high-school-dropouts.html"/><author><name>InnovatED Marketing</name></author><published>2011-01-19T19:00:17Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T19:00:17Z</updated><summary type="html" xml:lang="en-US"><![CDATA[<p><span class="thumbnail-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:showFullImage('/display/ShowImage?imageUrl=%2Fstorage%2Fdropout.jpg%3F__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION%3D1295463994423',271,408);"><img src="http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/storage/thumbnails/4297077-10308329-thumbnail.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1295463997016" alt="" /></a></span></span>By: Gabe Trujillo</p>
<p>With the New Year upon us, high school seniors are now in the final stretch of their high school careers. For the past four years, they have spent countless hours doing homework, going to class and participating in extracurricular activities. The finish line is within reach and seniors can finally see that all of their hard work is about to pay off.</p>
<p>But what if some of those seniors never even complete or start the race?</p>
<p>This is an all too familiar problem that high schools across the United States must deal with each and every day. Whether it&rsquo;s for personal or academic reasons, large numbers of <strong>high school students</strong> are <strong>dropping out at an alarming rate</strong> and never earn their high school diploma.</p>
<p>According to the website <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-dropping-out" target="_blank">dosomething.org</a>, <strong>1.2 million students drop out of high school every year in the U.S. alone. That&rsquo;s a student every 26 seconds &ndash; or 6,000 a day.</strong> And the <a href="http://www.silentepidemic.org/Our-Work/Dropout-Prevention.aspx" target="_blank">Alliance for Excellent Education</a> estimates that high school dropouts from the Class of 2006-07 will cost the U.S. more than $329 billion in lost wages, taxes, and productivity over their lifetimes. Some experts even state that those who drop out are more likely to be incarcerated, rely on public programs and social services, and go without health insurance than those who graduate from high school.</p>
<p>Keeping our students in the classroom is a never-ending battle that will continue to be fought by our teachers and administrators across the country. Schools are continuing ways to improve their&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://innovat-ed.squarespace.com/journal/2010/11/11/innovated-partners-with-ndpcn-to-create-new-plc.html">dropout prevention</a>&nbsp;strategies</strong>, not just for high school seniors, but for every student who walks through the door.</p>
