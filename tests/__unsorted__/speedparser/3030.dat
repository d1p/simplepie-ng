<p>The latest issue of Time Magazine, the number one political magazine in the United States, has a picture <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-elite-are-not-even-trying-to-hide-how-much-they-hate-the-u-s-constitution-anymore">of a half-shredded U.S. Constitution</a> on the cover with the words "Does It Still Matter?" emblazoned across it.</p>

<p>As Mexico's powerful drug cartels diversify operations beyond the illegal drug trade, the organized crime syndicates have found another lucrative line of work: The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/now-mexican-drug-cartels-are-illegally-logging-ancient-forests-2011-7">large scale theft</a> of Mexico's natural resources.</p>

<p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Thursday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/23/afghanistan.karzai/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">welcomed Barack  Obama's plans</a> for a U.S. troops drawdown and said it's a sign that  Afghanistan is ready to take control of security in the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Syrian troops <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/23/us-syria-idUSTRE75J0AV20110623?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FworldNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+International%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">massed near the Turkish border</a>, witnesses said on Thursday, raising tensions with Ankara as President Bashar al-Assad uses increasing military force against a popular revolt.</p>
<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4085924,00.html">is preparing for a possible war with Israel</a> to relieve perceived Western pressure to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad, its guardian ally, sources close to the movement say.</p>

<p>As of June 20th, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/national-debt">the U.S. national debt</a> was $14,344,524,186,068.19.</p>
<p>The national debt will exceed the size of the entire U.S. economy by  2021 — and balloon <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/congressional-budget-office-warns-of-debt-explosion/2011/06/22/AGNwb2fH_story.html?wprss=rss_business">to nearly 200 percent of GDP</a> within 25 years —  without dramatic cuts to federal health and retirement programs or steep  tax increases, congressional budget analysts said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Livestock prices have increased <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/livestock-prices-soar.html">138%</a> since March 2009.</p>
<p>World food prices that rose <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-22/sarkozy-tells-g-20-ministers-food-price-surge-is-plague-needing-action.html">37 percent</a> in a year, driving 44 million  more people into poverty, are a “plague” that need action from world  leaders now, French President Nicolas Sarkozy says.</p>

<p>India imported a staggering <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/276085-gold-and-silver-imports-in-india-surge-222-amid-worry-over-currency-devaluation">$8.96 billion</a> of gold and silver in May.</p>
<p>Greece won the consent of a team of EU-IMF inspectors <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43513976">for its new  five-year austerity plan</a> after committing to an additional round of tax  rises and spending cuts.</p>
<p>Greece's new finance minister said the government has been encouraging  Greek banks <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2011-06-23-Greece-financial-crisis_n.htm">to participate in a solution</a> to the country's crippling debt  crisis, just days ahead of a crucial Parliamentary vote that could  stave off a devastating default.</p>

<p>All over the United States, thieves <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/corruption-in-america">are stealing copper wire, train tracks and even drain covers</a>.</p>
<p>With a bill that would ban invasive TSA pat downs  in Texas set to be  heard by the state legislature on Friday, the federal agency  has  indicated <a href="http://www.infowars.com/tsa-set-to-take-legal-action-against-texas-groping-ban/">that it will take legal action</a> to prevent the law being   implemented, indicating that the government could once again resort to   threatening Texas with a blockade that would impose a de facto “no fly  zone”  over the state.</p>
<p>It is being reported <a href="http://www.myweathertech.com/2011/06/22/fukushima-nuclear-fuel-leaking-into-groundwater-tepco-says-barrier-too-expensive-will-hurt-stock-price/">that Fukushima nuclear fuel has burned through the containment vessel</a> and is sitting on the concrete foundation of the plant leaking into the groundwater.</p>

<p>A shocking new study published in a prestigious  medical journal has  found <a href="http://www.infowars.com/new-study-finds-direct-link-between-vaccines-and-infant-mortality/">a direct statistical link</a> between higher vaccine doses  and infant  mortality rates in the developed world, suggesting that the  increasing  number of inoculations being forced upon children by medical   authorities, particularly in the United States which administers the  highest  number of vaccines and also has the highest number of infant  deaths, is in fact  having a detrimental impact on health.</p>

<p>Is NATO preparing to hit Moammar Gadhafi <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/28/gaddafi-nato-apache-attack-libya">harder than ever?</a></p>
<p>Most people do not realize it, but Yemen <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/yemen-al-qaeda-zinjibar-2011-5">is coming apart at the seams right now</a>.</p>
<p>An Israeli Cabinet minister says the civilized world must take joint  action to avert the Iranian nuclear threat, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/05/30/israel-minister-strike-iran-necessary/">including a pre-emptive  strike if necessary</a>.</p>
<p>The Muslim Brotherhood claims that it wants a diverse parliament after elections in  September <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/05/29/151022.html">and is not seeking to impose Islamic law on Egypt</a>, the head of  the group's newly formed political party said in an interview.</p>
<p>On Saturday, before Songda degraded into a tropical storm, TEPCO said some reactor buildings were uncovered and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/downgraded-typhoon-poised-to-spread-fukushima-radiation/">radiation would spread due to the storm</a>.  “We have made utmost efforts, but we have not completed covering the  damaged reactor buildings,” said an official at that time.</p>
<p>Within a 20 km radius around the stricken plant at Fukushima, <a href="http://www.midasletter.com/index.php/uranium-stocks-under-seige-as-fukushima-continues-spewing-radiation-11053001/">a  Chernobyl-style dead zone is developing</a>, with levels of 1.48 million  becquerels a square meter measured within that area.</p>
<p>Gasoline costs <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-05-30-gas-costs-blame_n.htm?csp=hf">a dollar more per gallon</a> than it did last Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The average Memorial Day cookout is going to cost <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/inflation-2011-honey-they-shrunk-our-paychecks">29 percent more</a> this year than it did last year.</p>
<p>The Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March appears to have damaged the U.S. economy <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-05-30-cnbc-us-economy-japan-quake_n.htm">much more than expected</a>.</p>
<p>High input prices, supply chain disruptions from the tsunami disaster in  Japan and slowing demand from China <a href="http://www.cnbc.com//id/43212761">have combined to brake  manufacturing momentum</a> in Europe, the United States and Asia in recent  months.</p>
<p>Even the United Nations is now warning that the U.S. dollar <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/when-faith-in-u-s-dollars-and-u-s-debt-is-dead-the-game-is-over-and-that-day-is-closer-than-you-may-think">could collapse</a>.</p>
<p>Reports that Greece has not met any of the fiscal targets set by the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) as part of  its 110 billion euros ($157 billion) bailout <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43214540">knocked down the euro  Monday</a>, as other countries in the euro zone are threatened with being  dragged into the Greek morass.</p>
<p>The European Union is racing to draft <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-eurozone-idUSTRE74Q1YV20110530">a second bailout package</a> for Greece to release vital loans next month and avert the risk of the euro zone country defaulting, EU officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>It is being reported that if a new Greek bailout package is approved, outside authorities <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/greek-bailout-will-require-loss-of-sovereignty-2011-5">will take over various functions</a> related to tax  collection (a big time problem in Athens) and privatizations.</p>
<p>The ECB owns <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-jen-on-the-problems-with-the-eurozone-2011-5">50 billion EUR worth of Greek bonds</a>, and has loaned 90  billion EUR to Greek banks. A Greek default would compromise the balance  sheet of the ECB.</p>
<p>Greek citizens <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/greeks-yank-billions-out-of-countrys-banks-as-crisis-worsens-2011-5">are pulling billions</a> out of their banks as the country descends into chaos.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Greeks <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/greeks-vent-anger-entire-political-class-211328854.html">vented their anger</a> at the nation’s political  classes in Athens on Sunday, staging the biggest in a week of protests  as the government seeks backing for yet more austerity.</p>
<p>If Greece defaults, it is going to be <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-whats-going-to-happen-when-greece-defaults-2011-5">a complete and total financial disaster</a>.</p>
<p>Ireland <a href="http://www.cnbc.com//id/43209621">may have to ask for another loan</a> from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund because it will struggle to return to debt  markets to raise funds next year, a government minister said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Bank of England's chief economist has admitted that the UK faces <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8543382/Britain-faces-bleak-two-years-after-feeble-economic-growth.html">two  "bleak" years</a> as it grapples with inflation and economic adjustments.</p>
<p>China <a href="http://www.cnbc.com//id/43213037">is stepping up buying in Japanese government bonds</a>, particularly  notes with less than one year to maturity, market players say, in what  looks like a fresh drive to diversify its ballooning foreign reserves.</p>
<p>In a move that is certain to be detrimental to the American economy,  President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/president-obama-pushing-russia%E2%80%99s-membership-failed-wto-world-trade-organization">is personally pushing</a> for Russia’s entry into the  World Trade Organization, even working behind the scenes to resolve  some of the outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal said Sunday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/05/29/us.saudi.prince.oil/index.html?hpt=T2">that he wants oil prices to  drop</a> so that the United States and Europe don't accelerate efforts to  wean themselves off his country's supply.</p>
<p>A weak dollar, mounting inflationary fears and skyrocketing  gold and  silver prices are prompting some states to convert precious metals <a href="http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/Gold-Silver-Legal-Currency/2011/05/27/id/398039#ixzz1NqrXmhqE">into  legal currencies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Osama-Bin-Laden-Dead.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1664" title="Osama Bin Laden Dead" src="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Osama-Bin-Laden-Dead-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Barack Obama has announced to the world that the U.S. military has killed Osama Bin Laden.  At this point nobody can examine the evidence because supposedly <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-02-osama-bin-laden-dna_n.htm">the body has been dumped into the North Arabian Sea</a> from aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier.  U.S. officials say that this was necessary because "Islamic law" requires a rapid burial.</p>
<p>It turns out that Islamic law actually <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/05/so-much-for-verifying-that-it-was-osama.html">requires burial in the ground</a> if at all possible.</p>
<p>The compound where Osama bin Laden was supposedly killed by U.S. forces is located <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/obama-to-make-statment-tonight-subject-unknown/?hpt=T1&amp;iref=BN1">a  bit more than 1,000 yards</a> from a Pakistan Military Academy.</p>
<p>Pakistan declared the killing of Osama bin Laden a “major setback” to  global terrorism, but it will inevitably come under pressure to explain  how the al-Qaeda leader was holed up <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/bin-laden-killed-dramatic-night-time-raid-near-055004495.html">in a mansion near a military  facility</a>.</p>
<p>Thousands of people <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42854317">poured into the streets</a> outside the White House and  in New York City early Monday, waving U.S. flags, cheering and honking  horns to celebrate al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden's death.</p>
<p>Not everyone is celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/in-pakistan-a-religious-group-pays-homage-to-bin-laden-2011-05">Between 800 - 1,200 protestors</a> marched in Quetta, Pakistan on Monday, to pay homage to Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p>The Taliban has already threatened <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bin-laden-blowback-2011-5">fresh attacks</a> on Pakistani leaders and US targets.</p>
<p>The London Guardian has suggested that <a href="http://www.infowars.com/mainstream-media-blames-fake-obl-photo-used-by-mainstream-media-on-conspiracy-theorists/">the fake  image</a> of a dead Osama Bin Laden used by  several  British mainstream media websites this morning on their  front  pages  was the work of “conspiracy theorists” who claimed it was   genuine.</p>
<p>An article in the New York Times reported that Osama Bin Laden was dead <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/11TAHE.html?ex=1089432000&amp;en=373a282aeff2716a&amp;ei=5070&amp;todaysheadlines">back in 2002</a>, and an article on Fox News reported that Osama Bin Laden was dead <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41576,00.html">back in 2001</a>.  In fact, there have been <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/osama-bin-laden-pronounced-dead%E2%80%A6-for-the-ninth-time.html">quite a few reports</a> of the death of Bin Laden <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/osama-bin-laden-has-been-dead-for-years.html">over the years</a>.</p>
<p>As news of Osama bin Laden's death made its way across the globe Sunday night, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/02/technology/osama_bin_laden_internet_traffic/index.htm">Internet traffic exploded</a>.</p>
<p>The Chinese official news agency Xinhua is reporting that Osama Bin Laden <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-media-pakistan-killed-bin-laden-2011-5">was killed by Pakistani forces</a>, and that U.S. forces merely swooped in the pick up the body.</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler's death was made public <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2292724/">66 years to the day</a> before Bin Laden's.</p>
<p>The State Department <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/02/news/travel_alert_osama_bin_laden/index.htm">issued a travel alert Monday</a>, warning Americans  traveling or living abroad to be cautious about anti-American violence  in the wake of Osama bin Laden's death.</p>
<p>On Monday, the NYPD <a href="http://www.infowars.com/police-state-kicks-into-overdrive-on-dubious-news-of-osama-takedown/">flooded the city’s subway system</a> with  additional cops. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, “out of  an abundance of caution,” said it has added more police at airports, the  George Washington Bridge and ground zero.</p>
<p>China has again urged an end to fighting in Libya, saying it has  "<a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE74100C20110502">always opposed</a>" any action not authorized by the U.N. Security Council,  after Libya said Muammar Gaddafi's youngest son and three grandchildren  were killed in a NATO airstrike.</p>
<p>The British embassy in Tripoli <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/01/libya-british-embassy-nato-attacks">was set on fire</a> and other western missions were ransacked by angry Libyan crowds recently in retaliation for a Nato air strike that killed members of Muammar Gaddafi's family.</p>
<p>Persistent, heavy rains have helped swell the Mississippi and Ohio  rivers <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/01/missouri.levee.breach/index.html?hpt=T2">to the highest levels ever recorded</a>, said an Army Corps of  Engineers official Sunday.</p>
<p>The F5 tornado that ripped through the Tuscaloosa, Alabama area recently was reportedly so monstrous that it is still kind of difficult to believe that it was actually real.  The thing was a mile wide and scientists are estimating that it had winds that exceeded <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-tornadoes-of-2011-the-worst-natural-disaster-in-the-united-states-since-hurricane-katrina">260 miles an hour</a>. According to National Geographic, this monster tornado may have traveled a whopping 300 miles across Alabama and Georgia.</p>

<p>The number of "low income jobs" in the U.S. has risen steadily over the past 30 years and they now account for <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/36-statistics-which-prove-that-the-american-dream-is-turning-into-an-absolute-nightmare-for-the-middle-class">41 percent</a> of all jobs in the United States.</p>

<p>Mainland China <a href="http://www.infowars.com/u-s-treasury-china-has-decreased-its-holdings-of-u-s-debt-2/">has decreased</a> its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities  since last October, according to a report updated today by the U.S.  Treasury Department.</p>
<p>Atlantic City has been very busy <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13503628">putting homeless people on a bus</a> and sending them back where they came from.</p>
<p>According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, we face a  shortfall <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/doc_holiday_Nyb5JCHkWyejLq7dTjTs2J">of more than 150,000 doctors</a> over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars in unclaimed life insurance benefits are at the  center of a legal wrestling match as cash-strapped state governments  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/insurance/2011-05-02-life-insurance_n.htm">step up their efforts</a> to go after unclaimed insurance benefits.</p>

<p>Facebook <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/29/facebook-accused-removing-activists-pages">has removed</a> dozens of political activist profiles from its site, causing an outcry  from campaigners trying to organize anti-austerity protests this  weekend.</p>
<p>Sleeping too little or for too long disrupts how we think and can age the brain by up to seven years, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1382665/The-wrong-sleep-age-brain-SEVEN-YEARS.html">a new study has shown</a>.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Saturday that the country's economic outlook was <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/04/30/uk-japan-economy-shirakawa-idUKTRE73T0IK20110430?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FUKBusinessNews+%28News+%2F+UK+%2F+Business+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">very severe</a> and that the central bank would take appropriate action to support the economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/02/c_13855348.htm">Radioactive leakage</a> from fuel rods at a nuclear power plant in the  city of Tsuruga in Fukui prefecture on Honshu island of Japan are  believed to be the cause of a surge in the density of toxic substances  detected in coolant water, the prefectural government said Monday.</p>
<p>Furious parents in Fukushima have delivered <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/02/parents-revolt-radiation-levels">a bag of radioactive  playground earth</a> to education officials in protest at moves to weaken  nuclear safety standards in schools.</p>
<p>The northwest coast of the U.S. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1379187/U-S-fears-overdue-megathrust-earthquake-trigger-tsunami-decimate-unprepared-north-west.html?ITO=1490">could  be devastated</a> by a huge movement of undersea plates known as a  ‘megathrust’ earthquake, scientists say.</p>

<p>Barack Obama’s father <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53968.html">was forced to leave Harvard University</a> before  completing his Ph.D. in economics because the school was concerned about  his personal life and finances, according to newly public immigration  records.</p>

<p>The vast majority of fatalities from the tornadoes occurred in Alabama, where <a href="http://us.cnn.com/2011/US/04/28/severe.weather/index.html?hpt=C1">well over 100 people  perished</a>, said Yasamie August, Alabama Emergency Management Agency  spokeswoman.</p>

<p>World Bank President Robert Zoellick Thursday says that he hopes the  institution <a href="http://www.infowars.com/libya-it%E2%80%99s-not-about-oil-it%E2%80%99s-about-currency-and-loans/">will have a role</a> in rebuilding Libya as it emerges from current  unrest.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of 2011, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) only  increased <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/economic-growth-slows-crawl">by 1.8 percent</a>, significantly down from the 3.1 percent of growth in  the last quarter of 2010.</p>

<p>France and Italy announced Wednesday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/20/libya.war/index.html?hpt=T1">that they will send military  officers</a> to advise rebels fighting for the ouster of Libyan leader  Moammar Gadhafi's regime.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debka.com/article/20858/">According to Debka</a>, Saudi Arabia has gone out on a limb against  the Obama administration to place itself at the forefront of an  independent Gulf campaign for cutting down the Islamic Republic's drive  for a nuclear bomb and its expansionist meddling in Arab countries.</p>
<p>The Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency has reported to a Cabinet  Office safety panel that nuclear fuel pellets in the Nos. 1 and 3  reactors at the quake-hit Fukushima power station are believed <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110419004267.htm">to have  partially melted</a>.</p>

<p>The operator of Japan's crippled nuclear plant has laid out a blueprint  for stopping radiation leaks and stabilizing damaged reactors  <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/asia-pacific/japans-nuclear-crisis-could-last-another-six-months-under-new-recovery-plan/article1988550/">within the next six to nine months</a> as a first step toward allowing some  of the tens of thousands of evacuees to return to the area.</p>
<p>Oil prices jumped <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/20/markets/oil/index.htm">more than $3 Wednesday</a>, to above $111 a barrel, as the  dollar weakened and a government report said U.S. crude supplies fell  last week.</p>
<p>Gas prices reached <a href="http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/view/f772b5b1f31e2af83d29d52d228dd553/Gas-prices-continue-to-rise-in-Washington/#ixzz1K51rtdwA">five dollars per gallon</a> at a gas station in Washington, DC on April 19, 2011.</p>

<p>Gold prices <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2011-04-19-gold-tops-1500.htm">topped $1,500 an ounce</a> Tuesday as investors looked for more  stable assets because of worries about U.S. government debt, European  financial problems and inflation.</p>

<p>Investors <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2011-04-20-existing-home-sales-march.htm">drove up home sales last month</a>, paying cash to grab cheap  homes at risk of foreclosure. But purchases by first-time homebuyers,  crucial to a housing recovery, fell.</p>

<p>U.S. multinational corporations cut their work forces in the U.S. <a href="http://www.financialarmageddon.com/2011/04/crucial-for-our-economy.html">by 2.9 million</a> during the 2000s while  increasing employment overseas by 2.4 million, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/big-2011-4">new data from the U.S.  Commerce Department reveals</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the U.S. manufacturing industry has shed <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/mirage-manufacturing-recovery">5.5 million jobs</a> while around 50,000 factories have shuttered.</p>

<p>China <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42674209">is heavily investing</a> in troubled Spanish banks.</p>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/04/20/putin-u-s-monetary-policy-is-hooliganism/">is not impressed</a> with the U.S. economy <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-russia-us-monetary-policy-2011-4">at all</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://news.goldseek.com/GoldenJackass/1303243200.php">a lot of reasons</a> why the price of gold keeps hitting new record highs.</p>
<p>Roughly one in four dollars the federal government borrows <a href="http://gonzalolira.blogspot.com/2011/04/whats-really-worrisome-about-treasury.html">goes to pay the interest on the debt</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that our federal government spent $413 billion on interest  payments just last year? Which means in 2010 alone we spent more in  interest payments than we  spent on the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Veterans Affairs,  the Department of Justice and Homeland Security, the  Department of  Agriculture, the Treasury Department, the Department of Labor and the  small business administration — <a href="http://jayforde.com/gov-spends-more-on-debt-interest-than-all-combined-welfare-programs/">combined</a>.</p>
<p>The United States <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42676544">lacks a credible plan</a> to cut its deficit over the  medium term, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier  Blanchard told French daily Le Monde in an interview published on  Wednesday.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor’s has decided to slap U.S. government debt with <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/04/full-text-of-standard-poors-statement.html#more">a negative ratings outlook</a>.</p>
<p>It is being reported that Barack Obama <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-plead-with-sp-not-to-raise-rates-2011-4">begged Standard &amp; Poor's</a> not to lower the outlook on U.S. government debt.</p>
<p>A credit rating downgrade for the United States would spell <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/political-economy/post/us-credit-rating-downgrade-the-armageddon-scenario/2011/04/19/AFnE0n5D_blog.html">even more financial trouble</a> for the U.S. government, hampering its ability to borrow money as investors demand higher yields to make up for the increased risk. That would cause its national debt to balloon further and increase the need to hike taxes or make even more painful cuts in spending.</p>
<p>Donald Trump says <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/04/trump-my-tax-returns-for-obamas-birth.html">that he will show his tax returns</a> if Barack Obama shows his birth certificate.</p>

<p>Protesters led by hardline Islamists in southern Egypt held their ground  Monday, saying they won't end their campaign of civil disobedience  until the government removes <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20110418/D9MMB4S00.html">a newly appointed Coptic Christian  governor</a>.</p>
<p>Women who do not wear headscarves <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1377780/London-Taliban-targeting-women-gays-bid-impose-sharia-law.html">are being threatened with violence and even death</a> by Islamic extremists intent on imposing sharia law on parts of Britain.</p>

<p>Incredible footage has emerged of what a group of Russians claim is the remains <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/dead-alien-found-in-siberian-snow-after-glowing-pink-and-blue-lights-crash-from-sky/story-e6frf7lf-1226042028867">of a mangled alien</a>.</p>
<p>An increasingly larger number of gays and lesbians at Christian colleges are starting to "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/us/19gays.html?_r=3&amp;hp">come out of the closet</a>".</p>
<p>Lastly, does a new book entitled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936488299/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=1936488299">Where's The Birth Certificate?</a>" finally reveal all the details surrounding the birth of Barack Obama?</p>

<p>The budget deal is not going to cut an additional $38.5 billion. That headline number  includes <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/11/news/economy/budget_spending_cuts_2011/index.htm">$12 billion in cuts</a> that were included in three prior  short-term funding resolutions.

<p>The crisis at Fukushima is likely to continue <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/37705">for years</a>.</p>

<p>NATO said on Monday it took note of reports of an African Union proposal  for a cease-fire in Libya, but an official said the alliance <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/uk-libya-nato-strikes-idUKTRE73A1VP20110411">would  target Muammar Gaddafi’s forces</a> as long as they threatened civilians.</p>
<p>Around 2,000 protesters <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/more-1-000-defy-egypt-army-order-quit-20110410-175337-619.html">defied an army demand to leave Cairo’s Tahrir  Square on Monday</a>, vowing to stay until Egypt’s ruling military council  heeds their demand for civilian rule and a deeper purge of corrupt  officials.</p>
<p>Syrian security forces <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=216073">sealed off</a> the coastal city of Banias overnight following sectarian killings by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, witnesses said on Monday.</p>

<p>The outgoing chairman of the nation’s third-biggest health insurer  exercised stock options <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2011-04-11-ceo-pay-aetna-williams.htm">worth more than $50.3 million</a> and pulled in  $18.4 million in pay, stock and other compensation, according to the  company’s 2011 proxy filing.</p>

<p>In Israel, the success of the Iron Dome missile defense  system so far - nine interceptions including the system's first one on  Thursday night - <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/iron-dome-makes-world-history-intercepting-nine-gaza-rockets-1.355033?localLinksEnabled=false">has surprised even the air defense troops</a> who have been  training to operate the device for several months.</p>
<p>In California, what started out as a program to hold unclaimed property, such as the  contents of safety deposit boxes owned by people who have moved away  without a forwarding address, has gone wildly out of control.  The  program is now using <a href="http://blog.mises.org/16433/california-seizing-property-from-safety-deposit-boxes/">the flimsiest of excuses</a> to drill safe deposit  boxes and sell the contents, often for below-market value, the proceeds  going to the state’s general revenue.</p>

<p>Environmental pollution, plastic chemicals, pharmaceutical drugs,  pesticides, unhealthy diets, radiation-emitting technologies — these and  many other factors are contributing <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032031_sperm_counts_radiation.html">to an epidemic decline</a> in sperm  counts among modern men.</p>
<p>In a 70-28 vote, the Tennessee House of Representatives <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/bill-allowing-teachers-to-challenge.html">passed HB 368</a>, a bill that encourages science teachers to explore controversial topics without fear of reprisal.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/japan.quake/index.html?hpt=T2">magnitude 7.1 earthquake</a> struck Japan on Thursday, triggering a tsunami warning for one prefecture and advisories in others.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/04/07/135210070/6-5-earthquake-hits-mexico-no-damage-reported">6.5 magnitude earthquake</a> was felt across Mexico about an hour before the 7.1 earthquake hit Japan.</p>
<p>The new earthquake in Japan was accompanied <a href="http://www.infowars.com/new-earthquake-off-japanese-coast-accompanied-by-strange-blue-light-show/">by a very strange blue light show</a>.</p>
<p>TEPCO has begun discharging 11,500 tons of highly radioactive water into the surrounding ocean.  A marine consulting and research firm has developed a model <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E30Y6W3smqY&amp;feature=player_embedded">to predict the spread of the contaminated material</a>.</p>
<p>Concerns about radiation fallout from Japan's nuclear disaster prompted some schools in South Korea <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/07/us-japan-quake-korea-idUSTRE7360KL20110407">to shut on Thursday</a> as rain fell over most of the country.</p>
<p>After the radioactive cloud emanating from Japan’s stricken Fukushima  nuclear power plant reached Europe last week, French authorities have  detected radioactive iodine-131 <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/en/cap/france-detects-radioactive-iodine-rainwater-milk-news-503756">in rainwater and milk</a>.</p>
<p>The EPA says that eating fish caught in Japan, with radiation levels  2400% above Federal limits, <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2011/04/06/fda-eating-fish-with-radiation-2400-above-federal-limits-%E2%80%9Cposes-no-health-risks%E2%80%9D/">does not pose any health risks</a>.</p>
<p>Japan's economy is "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12994993">under strong downward pressure</a>" due to the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami, the Bank of Japan says.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is meeting again today with Republican and Democratic  congressional leaders who blame each other for the budget impasse that  threatens to shut down the federal government <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/obama-inexcusable-not-to-strike-budget-deal/1">at midnight on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid indicated Thursday that there is  likely to be a government shutdown at the end of the week -- an outcome  the Nevada Democrat <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/04/07/congress.budget/index.html?hpt=T1">blames wholly on his Republican colleagues</a>.</p>
<p>Even if the government does shut down, not that much <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/government-shutdown-2011-16-things-you-need-to-know">is actually going to change</a>.</p>
<p>House Budget Chairman  Congressman Paul Ryan says that  Barack Obama’s budget  strategy is to “do nothing, punt, duck, kick the  can down the road”  while the debt remains on track <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/rep-ryan-obama-s-budget-path-do-nothing">to eventually hit  800 percent of GDP</a>.  Ryan also says that the CBO is saying it “can’t  conceive of any way” that  the economy can continue past 2037 given its  current trajectory.</p>
<p>Oil prices jumped <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/07/markets/oil/index.htm">above $110 a barrel</a>, a fresh 2-1/2 year high, after news broke that Japan was hit with another major earthquake.</p>
<p>Oil prices will soar above $130 a barrel by late 2011, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42464956">a new Reuters  poll has found</a>, and one in five traders said they expected oil to hit $150  this year, levels some economists say could trigger recession.</p>
<p>Inflation fears in Europe have prompted the European Central Bank to  raise interest rates for the first time since 2008. The bank hiked their  key rate by 25 basis points <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/04/ecb-raises-rates-for-first-time-since.html">to 1.25%</a>.</p>
<p>Portugal's prime minister said Wednesday his country <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42458440">has asked for  financing assistance</a> from the European Union due to its high debts and  difficulty raising money on international markets.</p>
<p>Is the U.S. government debt crisis <a href="http://suddendebt.blogspot.com/2011/04/its-greek-to-me.html">even worse</a> than the Greek debt crisis?</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago 66% of foreign central bank assets were in U.S.  dollar investments.  Before that it was 70% and today <a href="http://theinternationalforecaster.com/International_Forecaster_Weekly/The_Financial_System_Designed_To_Self_Destruct">it is just 61.3%</a>.</p>
<p>According to the CoreLogic HPI, national home prices, including  distressed sales, <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/04/corelogic-house-prices-declined-27-in.html">declined by 6.7 percent</a> in February 2011 compared to  February 2010 after declining by 5.5 percent in January 2011 compared to  January 2010.</p>
<p>Over the past several months regulators have finally noticed what consumer attorneys have been saying for years: the big banks <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/07/foreclosure-fraud-the-homeowner-nightmares-continue/">have routinely committed fraud</a> in their foreclosure filings and their records of how much people owe are too often wrong.</p>
<p>Internationalist billionaire George Soros is holding an international  conference April 8 to April 11 at Bretton Woods, N.H., the noted  birthplace of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, where  he plans to “<a href="http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/bretton_woods_ii_265.html">rearrange the entire financial order</a>”.</p>
<p>China is growing increasingly assertive in its foreign policy,  especially in the way it handles the U.S., because officials there  believe that China is on the rise while America is in the midst <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/china-increasingly-asserting-itself-world-affairs">of a  steady decline</a>.</p>
<p>A highly contagious "<a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china/highly-contagious-aids-like-disease-spreading-in-china-53864.html">AIDS-like disease</a>" is spreading in China.</p>

<p>NBC’s Tom Brokaw says that the Saudi Arabian monarchy is “<a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/nbc-s-brokaw-saudis-so-unhappy-obama-adm">so unhappy with the  Obama administration for the way it pushed out President Mubarak of  Egypt</a>” that it has sent senior officials to the Peoples’ Republic of  China and Russia to seek expanded business opportunities with those  countries.</p>
<p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney appears to be the early front-runner in the largely unformed race for the Republican nomination for president, but real estate magnate Donald Trump may be a surprise contender, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/04/06/wsjnbc-poll-a-donald-trump-surprise/">according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll</a>.</p>
<p>Donald Trump continued to question Barack Obama's American citizenship <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/trump-keeps-beating-birther-drum-against-obama/1?csp=hf">during an appearance on NBC's Today show</a>, saying "there is a big possibility" the president may have violated the Constitution.</p>
<p>The former Hawaii elections official who maintains there's no long-form birth certificate for Barack Obama in the Aloha State is now saying the president and his aides have been "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=283865">caught fibbing</a>" about Obama's background, and the "embarrassing" situation is making it difficult to fess up to the truth.</p>
<p>The rationing that so many warned was coming under Obamacare <a href="http://biggovernment.com/tfitton/2011/04/06/judicial-watch-obtains-documents-detailing-obamacare-rationing/">has already begun</a>.</p>
<p>The Pentagon says NATO will have <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110406/ap_on_re_us/us_us_libya_military;_ylt=Arfu3eSMtBBgGZn62WiLq651EcF_;_ylu=X3oDMTM1dWg2YzdvBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTEwNDA2L3VzX3VzX2xpYnlhX21pbGl0YXJ5BGNjb2RlA29mZmdtcGUEY3BvcwM1BHBvcwM1BHNlYwN5bl90b3Bfc3RvcmllcwRzbGsDcGVudGFnb25">to adjust the way it operates in Libya</a> to keep up with changing tactics by forces of Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of protesters <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/06/yemen-protesters-defy-authorities">defied a government crackdown</a> and took to the streets of Yemen's second largest city on Wednesday  in the latest demonstrations against the long-serving president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.debka.com/article/20820/">According to Debka</a>, the Syrian uprising took a new turn Tuesday,  April 5, when armed protesters ambushed and shot dead two policemen in  the Damascus suburb of Kfar Batna. Syrian troops then opened fire and  killed 15 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The UN air strikes <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/cotedivoire/8428251/Ivory-Coast-UN-air-strikes-show-Wests-new-appetite-for-military-action.html">in the Ivory Coast</a> suggest Libya was no fluke: the West's appetite for military action has recovered robustly from the diplomatic trauma of the Iraq war.</p>
<p>A U.S. senator says President Barak Obama’s administration “<a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/US-Senator-Obama-Administration-Wrong-on-Ivory-Coast--119369709.html">got it  wrong</a>” in its handling of the ongoing crisis in Ivory Coast following  violent clashes between rival forces, which has left hundreds dead and  tens of thousands fleeing the West African conflict.</p>
<p>The drought may be over in California, but large portions of the Southwest, southern Plains, Florida and the Southeast <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/drought/2011-04-07-drought07_ST_N.htm?csp=34news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomNation-TopStories+%28News+-+Nation+-+Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">are all still enduring severe to extreme drought conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Depletion of the ozone layer over the Arctic <a href="http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Ozone_depletion_over_Arctic_at_record_level_WMO_999.html">has  reached record levels</a>, and Nordic countries will have to watch for  higher than normal ultraviolet radiation in coming weeks, the UN weather  agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck and the Fox News Channel <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/04/06/2011-04-06_glenn_beck_to_leave_fox_news.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">are giving up on his nightly show</a>.

<p>The radiation level in the ocean near the Fukushima nuclear plant keeps rising. It is now <a href="http://www.infowars.com/fukushima-radiation-double-chernobyl-outside-evacuation-zone/">4,385 times</a> above what is considered normal. This is a significant increase from the yesterday’s report that the I-131 isotope found in the water was 3,355 times the regulatory limit.</p>
<p>The consistently high levels of radiation found in the sea outside Japan's tsunami-damaged nuclear plant complex may mean <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFS7E7ER00820110331">that radiation is leaking out continuously</a>, Japan's nuclear watchdog said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Workers who have been fighting to bring the reactors under control at Japan’s strick nuclear plant <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8419808/Japan-nuclear-crisis-Fukushima-50-expect-to-die.html">expect to die from radiation sickness</a>, according to the mother of one of the men.</p>
<p>The loss of two nuclear power plants means the Tokyo region will face  the summer peak demand <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/31/japan.blackouts/index.html?hpt=T2">with a loss of about 20% of capacity</a>, the plant's  owner said Thursday.</p>
<p>There is no health risk from consuming milk with extremely low levels of  radiation, like those found in Washington state and California, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/31/radiation.us/index.html?hpt=T2">experts  said Thursday</a>, echoing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Is the nuclear crisis in Japan going to continue <a href="http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2011/03/when-the-fukushima-meltdown-hits-groundwater/">for months or even years?</a></p>
<p>Barack Obama signed a secret order <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8417399/Libya-Barack-Obama-signed-order-for-CIA-to-help-rebels.html">a few weeks ago</a> authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces seeking to oust Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, according to government officials.</p>
<p>It is being reported that before any no fly zones, NATO  involvement or UN resolutions,  US and  British intelligence and special forces  <a href="http://www.infowars.com/secret-illegal-war-of-aggression-has-been-raging-in-libya-for-weeks/">were on the ground  inside  Libya</a>, coordinating the uprising against Gaddafi and  waging a  covert  war.</p>
<p>NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said today the alliance <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/nato-rules-out-arming-libyan-rebels.html">was opposed</a> to  arming the Libyan rebels fighting against Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<p>Mussa Kussa, the Libyan foreign minister <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/defecting-libyan-foreign-minister-and-ex">who flew to Britain Wednesday</a> and said he was defecting from the Tripoli regime, is described as a  “master of international terrorism” and the man responsible for  exporting Muammar Gaddafi’s revolution.</p>
<p>Today, in Libya, a ragtag group of rebels fight a seesaw battle  against Muammar Qaddafi's better-equipped forces, and a debate rages  over whether to provide them arms and training. However, whispers are growing <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20048982-503543.html">that al Qaeda may already be among them</a>, complicating the current debate over arming the rebels.</p>
<p>Is the U.S. headed for a "<a href="http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/31/a_libyan_worst_case_scenario_13_steps_from_now_to_a_middle_east_disaster">worst case scenario</a>" is Libya?</p>
<p>Following a closed briefing for members of the House on the U.S.  military  operation in Libya, Democrat Rep.

<p>Toyota may delay the production <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/toyota-may-lose-500-000-units-of-output-post-quake-endo-says.html">of at least 500,000 vehicles</a> in Japan because of a shortage of parts and electricity after the nation’s record earthquake, said an analyst at Advanced Research Japan.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers face "serious" inflation in the months ahead for  clothing, food and other products, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2011-03-30-wal-mart-ceo-expects-inflation_N.htm?csp=hf">the head of Wal-Mart's U.S.  operations warned Wednesday</a>.</p>

<p>Tea Party supporters who rallied on Capitol Hill today <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/03/tea-party-rally-budget-deal-government-shutdown-/1">didn't sound too  impressed</a> with a tentative deal to cut about $33 billion from the  federal budget and avoid a government shutdown.</p>
<p>Israel’s efforts to rally countries against Palestinian Authority plans to ask the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state along the pre-1967 lines are hindered by the fact that Israel has not presented any plan of its own, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=214341">diplomatic officials said Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>State and local governments are slashing their budgets <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-the-economy-were-heading-back-toward-a-double-dip-2011-3">by roughly $110 billion</a> this year.</p>

<p>Rebel forces on Monday fought their way <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-28-libya_N.htm">to the doorstep of Moammar Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte</a>, a key government stronghold guarding the road to the capital Tripoli, their rapid advance built on powerful international airstrikes that have battered Gadhafi's air force, armor and troops.</p>
<p>Libya rebel official says rebels in "<a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/libyan-oil-kaching.html">active discussions</a>" to have  sanctions lifted on purchases of crude from rebel-held east Libya.</p>
<p>The Libyan rebels in Benghazi said they have created a new national oil company to replace the corporation controlled by leader Muammar Qaddafi whose assets were frozen by the United Nations Security Council <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/libyan-rebels-form-central-bank.html">and have formed a central bank</a>.</p>
<p>Libyan rebels say they have signed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12875810">an oil contract with Qatar</a> to export oil from rebel-held territory.</p>
<p>Russia said on Monday attacks on forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar  Gaddafi amounted to intervention in a civil war and <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72R0EL20110328?sp=true">were not backed by  the U.N. resolution authorizing no-fly zones</a>.</p>
<p>In the first 24 hours of the Libyan  attack, US B-2s dropped forty-five 2,000-pound bombs. These massive  bombs, along with the Cruise missiles launched from British and French  planes and ships, <a href="http://stopwar.org.uk/content/view/2321/27/">all contained depleted uranium (DU) warheads</a>.</p>
<p>Syrian security forces <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/03/28/syria.unrest/index.html?hpt=T2">flooded the restive cities of Daraa and Latakia  on Monday</a>, patrolling the streets, protecting government buildings and  in at least one case clashing with protesters, according to witnesses.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Lieberman said <a href="http://www.infowars.com/joe-lieberman-lets-bomb-syria/">that he would support military intervention in  Syria</a> if its president, Bashar al-Assad, resorts to the kind of violent  tactics used in Libya.</p>
<p>The containment structure surrounding one of the reactors at a  quake-battered nuclear power plant is damaged <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/28/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html?hpt=T2">and may be leaking  radioactive material</a>, the Japanese government's point man on the crisis  said Monday.</p>
<p>Japan on Sunday faced an increasing challenge of removing highly  radioactive water found inside buildings near some troubled nuclear  reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, with the radiation level of the  surface of the pool in the basement of the No. 2 reactor's turbine  building found to be <a href="http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/81375.html">more than 1,000 millisieverts per hour</a>.</p>
<p>Workers discovered <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-28-japan-radiation_N.htm">new pools of radioactive water</a> leaking from Japan's crippled nuclear complex, officials said Monday, as emergency crews struggled to pump out hundreds of tons of contaminated water and bring the plant back under control.</p>
<p>Plutonium <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/plutonium-found-outside-nuke-plant-2011-3">has been discovered</a> in the soil outside the Fukushima nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>The discovery of plutonium at five places within Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/28/japan-work-idUSL3E7ES2RH20110328">will not cause work there to be suspended</a>, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A recent sample of rainwater in Boston <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/radiation-massachusetts-rainwater-japan-nuclear/1">showed very low concentrations of  radiation</a>, most likely from the damaged Japanese nuclear power power.</p>
<p>In Japan, radioactive cesium-137 is being released <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/radioactive-cesium-with-a-half-life-of-approximately-30-years-is-being-released-at-about-60-percent-of-chernobyl-levels">at 60% of the level</a> that it was  being released at during the Chernobyl disaster.  Cesium-137 has a  half-life of approximately <em>30 years</em>.  That means that all of this cesium is going to be with us for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Is the nuclear disaster in Japan <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=7CIgA9TSAK8">now worse than the Chernobyl disaster?</a></p>
<p>Some nuclear experts are now warning that a "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXQpvFoqSCo&amp;feature=player_embedded">worst case scenario</a>" is going to eventually play out in Japan.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is ordering all of their employees <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42304574">to stay in Tokyo</a>.</p>
<p>American companies are finding <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7360932n">new overseas tax havens</a> to legally protect some of their profits from the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent, among the highest in the world.</p>
<p>It is being alleged that General Electric is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?_r=4&amp;hp">not paying any U.S. taxes.</a></p>
<p>Right now the New York Times and GE are engaged <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ge-taxes-2010">in a war of words</a> over taxes.</p>
<p>There were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2011-03-26-nevada-real-estate.htm">167,564 empty houses</a> in Nevada last year, according to  newly released U.S. Census data, more than double the number in 2000.</p>

<p>With nearly 14 million unemployed workers in America, many have gotten so desperate <a href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/25/unpaid-jobs-the-new-normal/">that they're willing to work for free</a>.</p>
<p>Employee loyalty <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2011-03-28-1Amorale28_ST_N.htm?csp=hf">is at a three-year low</a>, but many employers are  precariously unaware of the morale meltdown, according to a study out  today.</p>
<p>In 2009, the richest 5 percent claimed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html?_r=1">63.5 percent</a> of the nation’s  wealth. The overwhelming majority, the bottom 80 percent, collectively  held just 12.8 percent.</p>
<p>Consumer spending rose in February at the fastest pace in four months,  but a big part of the increase <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-03-28-consumer-spending.htm">went to higher gasoline prices</a>.</p>
<p>The FDIC <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/temporary.html">has announced the following</a>: "From December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012, all  noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are fully insured, regardless  of the balance of the account and the ownership capacity of the funds.  This coverage is available to all depositors, including consumers,  businesses, and government entities. The unlimited coverage is separate  from, and in addition to, the insurance coverage provided for a  depositor’s other accounts held at an FDIC-insured bank."</p>
<p><a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/28/cnn-poll-neither-democrats-or-gop-have-edge-in-budget-battle/">According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday</a>,  46 percent of Americans say they prefer President Barack Obama's  approach on budget negotiations, with 45 percent saying they prefer  congressional Republicans' approach to the tough choices involved in  both cutting programs to reduce the deficit and at the same time  maintain needed federal programs.</p>
<p>As if fuel taxes and rising gas prices weren't causing enough pain at the pump, Democrats seeking to raise new revenues to support federal spending on highway maintenance are considering <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/03/25/uncle-sam-considers-taxing-motorists-miles-driven/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fpolitics+%28Internal+-+Politics+-+Text%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">taxing motorists for the number of miles they drive</a>.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank's Chief Economist Charles Mayer says that given  the recent election results in Germany, where German Chancellor Angela  Merkel's party was trounced, <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/deutsche-bank-economist-portugal-may.html">it will be difficult for Germany to approve  another debt bailout</a>. Mayer says it may come down to an IMF "bridge  loan" for Portugal to make its bond payments.</p>
<p>By restricting exports, Chinese officials have allowed the price of rare  earth metals <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/china%E2%80%99s-restriction-rare-earth-exports-causes-price-skyrocket">to rise exponentially</a>, putting pressure on companies  across the globe that rely on their input for their manufactured  products.</p>
<p>Chinese police <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110328/wr_nm/us_china_blogger">have arrested prominent blogger Ran Yunfei</a> for challenging  the ruling Communist Party, people close to the blogger said on Monday,  the latest in a string of arrests in a deepening crackdown on dissent.</p>
<p>CNBC says that according to the basic laws of supply and demand, especially given that  the two metals are quite similar, the price gap between gold and silver  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42310097">should be much smaller</a>.</p>
<p>The central bank in Afghanistan <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/world/asia/29kabulbank.html?_r=1&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;seid=auto">has been up to a lot of mischief lately</a>.</p>
<p>Mega-millionaire Donald Trump today <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=280533">said during an interview with FoxNewsInsider</a> that Barack Obama is having trouble with, and spending millions to fight, the ongoing questions about his birth, his birth certificate and his eligibility to hold office.</p>
<p>According to one new study, 34% of senior males are in the work force while <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/grandparents-are-working-while-teenagers-relax-2011-3">just 15%</a> of teenage boys have an employer.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="http://www.japanquakemap.com/">over 800 earthquakes</a> in and around Japan since March 11th.</p>
<p>Severe drought conditions across eastern Colorado and the western half of Kansas and Oklahoma <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/26/us-usa-drought-wildfires-idUSTRE72P20U20110326?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews">are worsening the outlook</a> for more wild fires in the region climatologists say.</p>
<p>More than 17,000 students have enrolled at Oaksterdam University, "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2061398,00.html?hpt=T2">America's first cannabis college</a>", since it first opened in late 2007.</p>
<p>New evidence has emerged that the Iranian government sees the current  unrest in the Middle East as a signal that the Mahdi--or Islamic  messiah--<a href="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2011/March/Iranian-Regime-Video-Says-Mahdi-is-Near-/">is about to appear</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, a clay tablet that has baffled scientists for more than a century has been identified as a witness's account of an asteroid <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-551010/Decoded-The-clay-tablet-tells-asteroid-destroyed-Sodom-5-000-years-ago.html#ixzz1HfER5D3j">that destroyed the Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah</a> 5,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Representatives of Moammar Gadhafi's government and the Libyan opposition will be among those attending an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-24-Libya-UN_N.htm">U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>NATO has reached an agreement to take over the no-fly zone in Libya from  the United States "<a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/24/libya-live-blog-coalition-airstrikes-continue-in-tripoli/?hpt=T1&amp;iref=BN1">in a couple of days</a>" NATO's secretary general said  Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/60-percent-back-libya-military-action/">Sixty percent of Americans</a> support the U.S. and allied military action  in Libya to impose a no-fly zone to protect civilians from forces loyal  to Muammar Gaddafi, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday found.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll conducted Monday finds <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/146738/Americans-Approve-Military-Action-Against-Libya.aspx">more Americans approving than  disapproving</a> of the military action against Libya by the United States  and other countries.</p>
<p>Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the country's top general are  hashing out a political settlement <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703784004576220712562139244.html?mod=djemalertNEWS">in which both men would resign from  their positions within days</a> in favor of a civilian-led transitional  government, according to three people familiar with the situation.</p>

<p>Radioactive yellow rain that fell in Tokyo and surrounding areas last   night  <a href="http://www.infowars.com/chernobyl-style-yellow-rain-causes-panic-in-japan/">caused panic</a> amongst Japanese citizens and prompted a flood of   phone calls to  Japan’s Meteorological Agency this morning, with people   concerned that they were  being fed the same lies as victims of   Chernobyl, who were told that yellow rain  which fell over Russia and   surrounding countries after the 1986 disaster was  merely pollen, the   same explanation now being offered by Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Tokyo government officials have announced that radiation levels in Tokyo  tap water are now so high <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/should-residents-of-tokyo-be-preparing-for-massive-radiation-exposure-12-disturbing-facts-to-consider">that it is unsafe for infants to drink</a>.</p>
<p>The scope of radiation-contaminated tap water expanded Thursday, with  radioactive iodine detected in tap water <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110324x1.html">in Chiba and Saitama  prefectures</a>, while the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which said the day  before its drinking water was contaminated, scurried to distribute  240,000 bottles of water to households with babies.</p>

<p>The radiation released by the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant already rivals  and in one sense <em>exceeds</em> the Chernobyl catastrophe <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/fukushima-radiation-release-rivals-chernobyl.html">according to  Austria’s Central Institute for  Meteorology and Geodynamics</a>, even as media spin  downplays the severity  of the crisis despite the fact that the problems at the  plant show no  signs of abating.</p>

<p>A dangerous drug-resistant bacterium has spread to patients in  Southern  California, according to a study by Los Angeles County public  health  officials, and it is killing <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/map-of-the-day-carbapenem-resistant-enterobacteriaceae-cre-producing-metallo-beta-lactamases-2011-3">40 percent</a> of the people that become infected.</p>

<p><a href="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/NATO-Declares-War-On-Libya.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1628" title="NATO Declares War On Libya" src="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/NATO-Declares-War-On-Libya-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>The latest headlines from The Most Important News....</p>
<p>Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's momentum has been stopped and rebels  have been able to hold onto areas that Gadhafi's forces had been poised  to take over, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/21/libya.civil.war/index.html?hpt=T1">a U.S. official said Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Qaddafi has surrounded himself with civilian supporters in Tripoli, and his forces are bringing civilians to Misrata <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/libya-monday-march-21-2011-3">to use as human shields</a>.</p>
<p>Media outlets affiliated with the Libyan opposition reported Monday that  the son of Muammar Gaddafi, Khamis Gaddafi, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4045624,00.html">was killed</a> in a suicide  attack on the Bab al-Azizia barracks in Tripoli.</p>
<p>SAS teams <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368247/Libya-SAS-smash-squads-ground-mark-targets-coalition-jets.html">are on the ground</a> in Libya with orders to pinpoint and destroy Colonel Gaddafi’s weapons.</p>
<p>One NATO missile totally destroyed an administrative building <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8394562/Libya-missile-destroys-Gaddafi-building.html">at Col. Gaddafi's Tripoli residence</a> according to reports.</p>
<p>As the contrived moral high ground behind the absurdly hypocritical    “humanitarian” pretext of the attack on Libya collapses in the wake of   Russia,  the Arab League and the African Union condemning the US-led   NATO bombings, so  does any pretense of legality that the “no fly zone”   resolution holds, because  the obvious attempt to assassinate Gaddafi   violates not only U.S. law, but also <a href="http://www.infowars.com/un-powers-violate-their-own-resolution-by-targeting-gaddafi/">the  UN’s own charter</a>.</p>
<p>Oil prices surged <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/21/markets/oil_prices_Libya/index.htm">more than $2 a barrel</a> in electronic trading Monday,  after coalition forces launched an attack on Libyan military targets  over the weekend.</p>
<p>Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/medvedev-and-putin-clash-over-libya-2011-3">has lashed out</a> at Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin over his comments on the UN's Libya resolution.</p>
<p>The U.K. government <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/21/libya-uk-battles-hold-coalition">is battling</a> to hold together the international coalition opposing Muammar Gaddafi's actions amid signs of Arab unease at the scale and impact of western-led military operations in Libya, divisions within Nato over the no-fly zone, and a rising tide of global criticism.</p>
<p>Plant operators <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-21-japan-earthquake_N.htm">evacuated workers</a> from Japan's tsunami-stricken nuclear complex Monday after gray smoke rose from one of its reactor units, the latest of persistent troubles in stabilizing the complex after it was damaged in a quake and tsunami.</p>
<p>Radioactivity fears in Japan are growing, with evidence of contamination <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/japan-nuclear-crisis-2011-3">in milk, vegetables and fish</a>.</p>
<p>As Japan edged forward in its battle to contain the damage at its ravaged  nuclear power plants on Saturday, the government said it had found  higher than normal levels of radioactivity <a href="http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/79837.html">in spinach</a> and milk at farms  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/world/asia/20japan.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1300737681-+janZ4/QhX2UUr+SklM2DA">up to 90 miles away</a> from the plants.</p>
<p>World health officials are warning <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fgw-japan-quake-food-20110322%2C0%2C100029.story">of the dangerous cumulative effects</a> from eating food contaminated by radiation leaking from Japan's crippled nuclear plant. One Japanese restaurant in Taiwan is serving up radiation gauges alongside its meals.</p>
<p>Radiation levels observed in food and milk grown  and produced  significant distances from the stricken nuclear power plant in   Fukushima do not correlate with readings supposedly found in the  immediate  vicinity, suggesting <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/fukusima-radiation-levels-being-covered-up.html">that the real levels are being withheld  from the  public</a>.</p>
<p><span>China and South Korea announced on Monday  <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4045401,00.html">they will toughen checks</a> of Japanese food for radioactivity, hours after  the World Health Organization said the detection of radiation in some  food in Japan was a more serious problem than it had expected.</span></p>
<p>Apparently the Dai-ichi complex in Fukushima, Japan has nearly <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/03/amount-of-radioactive-fuel-at-fukushima.html">10  times</a> more nuclear fuel than Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Japanese engineers <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/nuclear-engineers-plan-for-doomsday-scenario-1.1091436?localLinksEnabled=false">have conceded</a> that burying a crippled nuclear plant in sand and concrete may be the only way to prevent a catastrophic radiation release.</p>
<p>The release of radiation from the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear  power plant will be a problem for Japan <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/japan-radiation-release-long-term-problem-france-s-asn-says-1-.html">for years to come</a>, according to  the French nuclear watchdog.</p>
<p>The death toll from last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110321a3.html">will  top 15,000 in Miyagi Prefecture alone</a>, the local police chief said  Sunday.</p>
<p>Food is really <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8392549/Japan-crisis-Theres-no-food-tell-people-there-is-no-food.html">starting to run short</a> in Japan.</p>
<p>Are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/8393984/Safe-nuclear-does-exist-and-China-is-leading-the-way-with-thorium.html">thorium reactors</a> going to transform the way that the world gets energy?</p>
<p>Now that the total debt of the U.S. government is  $14,223,730,274,180.80, it is getting really hard to deny that the federal government is <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/drowning-in-debt">drowning in debt</a>.</p>
<p>In just a month’s time a second American paper mill has announced <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/another-paper-mill-closes">that it will be closing its doors</a> for good.</p>
<p>Unemployment rose <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-03-18-metro-unemployment.htm">in nearly all</a> of the 372 largest U.S. cities in January compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Since the recession began, the number of Americans that have given up looking for work <a href="http://www.financialarmageddon.com/2011/03/things-are-less-than-they-seem.html">has grown by 30 percent</a>, to more than 6.4 million.</p>
<p>Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell unexpectedly sharply in  February and prices touched <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42192395">their lowest level in nearly nine years</a>.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors said Monday that sales of  previously occupied homes fell last month to a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of 4.88 million. That’s <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2011-03-21-existing-home-sales-fall.htm">down 9.6%</a> from 5.4 million in  January.</p>
<p>Are there good reasons why many Americans <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/03/why-i-am-never-going-to-own-a-home-again/">should never buy a house again?</a></p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury said Monday that it will sell a big portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/21/treasury-tiptoes-toward-housing-exit/">over the next year or so</a>, in a move to wind down a crisis-era program providing financing for residential housing.</p>
<p>Average weekly earnings in the United States have gone in a negative direction <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42195578">for four months in a row</a>.</p>
<p>About three-quarters of Americans surveyed by America's Research Group  said they were shopping less due to rising gas prices, with <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42197246">more than 62  percent</a> of the participants planning to spend generously only next year  or beyond.</p>
<p>Households, followed by mutual funds, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-municipal-debt-2011-3">are the biggest holders</a> of municipal debt.</p>
<p>Corn <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-03-17-food-costs-world-hunger.htm">has soared 52%</a> in the past 12 months. Sugar’s up 60%. Soybeans have  jumped 41%. And wheat costs 24% more than it did a year ago.</p>
<p>According to a recent <em>Newsweek</em> quiz, 29 percent of Americans  <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/american-ignorance-increasingly-unacceptable">could not pass the citizenship test</a>, leading to several doubts about the  civic awareness of the population.</p>
<p>Ron Paul <a href="http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/rep-ron-paul-wins-latest-presidential-straw-poll/#ixzz1HFv6gv00">won the California Republican Party convention poll</a> over the  weekend. The Texas congressman defeated former Massachusetts governor  Mitt Romney and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.</p>
<p>Graphic photos showing U.S. troops and dead Afghans that the Army was  keeping under wraps for a war crimes probe <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/afghanistan/2011-03-21-afghanistan-photos_N.htm">were carried by a German news  organization Monday</a>, with one showing a soldier smiling as he posed  with a bloodied and partially clothed corpse.</p>
<p>An autistic man says Transportation Security Administration agents  <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/autistic-man-forced-to-strip-in-public-by-tsa.html">violated his rights</a> early Sunday during a security screening at Boston  Logan International Airport.</p>
<p>The federal government says more overweight Americans <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-21-busweight21_ST_N.htm">are squeezing onto  buses</a>, and it may have to rewrite bus safety rules because of it.</p>
<p>Porsche is now taking orders for the German carmaker's first publicly available hybrid sports car, the 918 Spyder.  It is only <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/21/autos/porsche_918_hybrid_price/index.htm">$845,000</a>.</p>
<p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons says facelifts for men <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42197630">jumped 14 percent</a> last year.</p>
<p>Demonstrators in the southern Syrian city of Deraa <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12800243">have set fire to  several buildings</a> during a third consecutive day of protests, witnesses  say.  One report said the buildings targeted included the headquarters of the  ruling Baath Party.</p>
<p>Lastly, facing a possible new conflict against Hamas, concern is growing within the IDF regarding increased efforts by Palestinian terrorist groups <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=213071">to dig tunnels under the border</a> that could be used to infiltrate into Israel and perpetrate attacks.</p>

<p>The situation at Japan's tsunami-stricken nuclear plant is "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-17-japan-nuclear-crisis_N.htm">very serious</a>" but at the moment it does not appear to be deteriorating, a senior official of the U.N. atomic agency said Thursday.</p>
<p>Efforts to cool down one of the reactors at a quake-damaged Japanese  nuclear power plant have been "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/17/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html?hpt=T2">somewhat effective</a>" since authorities  turned helicopters, fire trucks and police water cannon on the facility,  its owner said early Friday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/science/17plume.html?_r=2">A United Nations forecast</a> of the possible movement of the radioactive plume coming from crippled Japanese reactors shows it churning across the Pacific, and touching the Aleutian Islands on Thursday before hitting Southern California late Friday.</p>
<p>Why are <a href="http://thisistheendoftheworldasweknowit.com/archives/would-a-nuclear-meltdown-in-japan-mean-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it">the spent fuel rods</a> at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nucler plant such a threat?</p>
<p>Fallout from the current meltdown occurring at Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, which was hit by the 9.0+ mega earthquake and tsunami last Friday, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031729_food_supply_radiation.html?asid=ccb4799a#ixzz1GsMPOcYq">could contaminate the world's food supply with toxic radiation</a> according to experts.</p>
<p>Is the mainstream media <a href="http://www.infowars.com/new-york-times-posts-downplayed-radioactive-plume-map/">downplaying the amount of radiation</a> that will make it to the U.S.?</p>
<p>Radiation detectors at Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago O’Hare airports  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-17/tokyo-passengers-trigger-u-s-airport-detectors-n-y-post-says.html">were recently triggered</a> when passengers from flights that started in Tokyo passed  through customs, the New York Post reported.</p>
<p>Suggesting that levels of radiation leaks from the  stricken Fukushima  plant are being grossly underreported by Japanese  authorities, a  Swedish government agency told Reuters today that not only will  the  radiation reach North America, but it will subsequently cover <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/swedish-government-radiation-to-cover-entire-northern-hemisphere.html">the entire   northern hemisphere</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department says that the United States <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/03/17/americans-evacuate-japan/">has chartered aircraft</a> to  help Americans leave Japan and has authorized the voluntary departure of  family members of diplomatic staff in Tokyo, Nagoya and Yokohama --  about 600 people.</p>
<p>Mizuho, the second-largest financial services company in Japan, has just  locked out its customers <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/all-mizuho-atms-japan-have-stopped-working">from accessing their cash</a>.</p>
<p>Many Chinese, fearing radiation poisoning from the earthquake-ravaged  nuclear plant in neighboring Japan that just lies across the sea, <a href="http://www.sify.com/news/chinese-fear-radiation-from-japan-buying-iodine-pills-news-international-ldrnOejhjda.html">are  buying iodine pills</a> to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Japanese citizens are starting to leave Tokyo <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8385978/Japan-earthquake-the-exodus-of-Tokyo.html">in very large numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Is the nuclear crisis in Japan going to cause <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/globalbusiness/8386829/World-energy-crunch-as-nuclear-and-oil-both-go-wrong.html">an energy crunch?</a></p>
<p>Millions of Japanese people are bracing themselves <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8388279/Japan-earthquake-country-on-brink-of-massive-blackouts.html">for massive blackouts</a> as the country’s power system struggles to cope amid the nuclear crisis.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan has pumped <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12768673">6 trillion yen</a> into the country's financial markets in a bid to stabilize them.</p>
<p>Problems in Japan have become exhibit A in what economists say is the  greatest threat to the recovery in the United States -- <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/17/news/economy/japan_disaster_uncertainty_economic_impact/index.htm">uncertainty  overseas</a>.</p>
<p>Will quantitative easing <a href="http://gonzalolira.blogspot.com/2011/03/i-think-today-is-day-dollar-breaks-down.html">have to be extended</a> because of the crisis in Japan?</p>
<p>The U.S. national debt <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/debt-jumped-72-billion-same-day-house-vo">jumped by $72 billion</a> on Tuesday even as the  Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a continuing  resolution to fund the government for just three weeks that will cut $6  billion from government spending.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/16/us-usa-treasury-geithner-debt-idUSTRE72F7WQ20110316">said on Wednesday</a> that there was no  alternative except for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the  government can keep borrowing.  "Congress has to do it. There's no alternative," he said in response to  questions at a House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee.</p>
<p>General Motors <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/03/gm-closing-small-truck-plant-for-lack-of-japan-parts/1">plans to halt production temporarily</a> of the Chevrolet Colorado  and GM Canyon compact pickups made at Shreveport, La., because some  parts come from Japan and aren't available now.</p>
<p>Japan <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42136213">will get what it wants</a> from the Group of Seven teleconference of  finance ministers and central bankers Thursday night, but G-7 sources  say the group is still waiting for Japan to ask.</p>
<p>U.S. housing starts posted their biggest decline <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42106368?__source=RSS*tag*&amp;par=RSS">in 27 years</a> in February  while building permits dropped to their lowest level on record,  suggesting the beleaguered real estate sector has yet to rebound from  its deepest slump in modern history.</p>
<p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is the official government  measure to track inflation, <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/consumer-price-increase-raises-fears-stagflation">is up 2.1 percent</a> from last year.</p>
<p>Food prices at the wholesale level rose last month by the most <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42116697/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/">in 36  years</a>. Cold weather accounted for most of it, forcing stores and  restaurants to pay more for green peppers, lettuce and other vegetables,  but meat and dairy prices surged, too.</p>
<p>Americans spend only about 10% of their annual incomes on food,  compared with as much as 70% in other countries, but <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cheap-food-20110317,0,1746312.story?track=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fbusiness+%28L.A.+Times+-+Business%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">with prices  climbing</a>, some economists wonder whether the nation's abundance of  affordable food is history.</p>
<p>A special index created by the Labor Department to measure the actual  cost of living for Americans <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42130406">hit a record high in February</a>, according to  data released Thursday, surpassing the old high in July 2008.</p>
<p>Public/quasi-public employment rose steadily over the past ten years,  and is now up 16%. By comparison, the rest of the private sector  <a href="http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/a-decade-of-labor-market-pain/">is  down 8%</a> in jobs over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>North Dakota, the state with the nation's lowest unemployment rate, capped <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2011-03-16-north-dakota-census_N.htm?csp=hf">a decade of economic prosperity</a> with dramatic population growth in its biggest cities.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/03/congress-budget-senate-spending-cuts-tea-party/1">has easily passed</a> the sixth in a series of short-term spending bills to avoid a government shutdown.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives has easily passed a bill <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/03/congress-npr-funding--1/1">that would eliminate taxpayer funds for  NPR</a>, a week after a fundraising executive was caught on video saying the  organization would be better off without government support.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, has confirmed <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8386818/Hillary-Clinton-will-step-down-after-2012.html">that she will not serve</a> in the next Barack Obama administration if the president wins a second term in 2012.</p>
<p>Faced with a Congress hostile to even slight restrictions of Second   Amendment rights, the Obama administration is exploring potential   changes to gun laws that can be secured <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/15/obama-gun-laws-congress_n_836138.html">strictly through executive  action</a>, administration officials say.</p>
<p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation that would result in a tax hike <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/17/news/economy/millionaire_tax/index.htm">of up to  40%</a> for the wealthiest Americans.</p>
<p>One protester in Bahrain was recently shot <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9W_-0uGN1E&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;skipcontrinter=1">at point blank range</a>.</p>
<p>The United States, in a reversal of its previous position, now says the  UN Security Council should consider <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/un_security_council_libya_no-fly_zone_united_states_rice/2341042.html">more than a no-fly zone</a> to protect  civilians in Libya.</p>
<p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday that any military intervention in Libya <a href="http://www.newkerala.com/news/world/fullnews-169886.html">may trigger a war</a>.</p>
<p>Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele  Flournoy and Gen. David  Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan,  told the Senate Armed  Services Committee Tuesday that the Obama  administration is planning to  maintain “joint” U.S.-Afghan military  bases in Afghanistan <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/dod-and-petraeus-us-planning-military-pr">after  2014</a> and it plans to conduct what Flournoy  described as “joint  counter-terrorism operations” with the Afghan  military after that date.</p>
<p>Enviropig is the trademark for <a href="http://www.bloggernews.net/126111">a genetically modified line of Yorkshire  pigs</a>, first created in 1999, with the capability to digest plant  phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary unmodified pigs.  They are  considered “greener”, emitting a smaller quantity of pollutants in their  manure.  Thus, the name “enviropig”.  Their creators hope one day that  enviropig’s will be sold in markets, fast food chains and in packaged  food.</p>
<p>CNBC is mocking "<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Armageddon-Entrepreneurs-Whos-cnbc-900342491.html;_ylt=Aq6OsSHgVlVyiAfEjyAd_fS7YWsA;_ylu=X3oDMTE1NmkwMDVjBHBvcwM1BHNlYwN0b3BTdG9yaWVzBHNsawNhcm1hZ2VkZG9uZW4-?x=0&amp;sec=topStories&amp;pos=2&amp;asset=&amp;ccode=">Armageddon entrepreneurs</a>".</p>
<p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court on Wednesday <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/nh-court-upholds-order-to-send-homeschooled-girl-to-public-school-49468/">affirmed a lower court’s decision</a> to order an 11-year-old out of homeschooling and into a public school.</p>
<p>Lastly, crews are on scene assessing a 40-foot section of Highway 1 <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/r/27221999/detail.html">that fell  into the Pacific Ocean</a> near the Big Sur area Wednesday night, according  to the California Department of Transportation.</p>

<p><a href="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Japan-Tsunami-2011.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1620" title="110312-N-0000X-003" src="http://themostimportantnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Japan-Tsunami-2011-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a>The latest headlines from The Most Important News....</p>
<p>Japanese officials said Monday that the nuclear fuel rods <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-14-japan-reactor-explosion_N.htm">appear to be  melting</a> inside all three of the most troubled nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Japan’s struggle to contain the crisis at a stricken nuclear power plant <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15nuclear.html">worsened sharply</a> as emergency operations to pump seawater into one crippled reactor failed at least temporarily, increasing the risk of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material, officials said.</p>
<p>There are fears that a radioactive cloud <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3465322/Tokyo-nuke-cloud-crisis-after-Japan-earthquake.html">could envelop Tokyo’s 13 million residents</a>.</p>
<p>As the scale of Japan’s nuclear crisis begins to come to light, experts in Japan and the United States say the country is now facing a cascade of accumulating problems that suggest that radioactive releases of steam from the crippled plants <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/asia/japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactor.html">could go on for weeks or even months</a>.</p>
<p>The Pentagon was expected to announce that the aircraft carrier Ronald  Reagan, which is sailing in the Pacific, passed through a radioactive  cloud from stricken nuclear reactors in Japan, causing crew members on  deck to receive a month’s worth of radiation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/asia/14plume.html?_r=1">in about an hour</a>,  government officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>An American nuclear expert says radiation from Japan <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/usa/Expert-Nuclear-Radiation-Could-Spread-Far-Beyond-Japan-117899079.html">could spread across  the Pacific and reach the United States</a> if a complete meltdown occurs  at a Japanese nuclear facility damaged as a result of last week’s  earthquake and subsequent tsunami.</p>
<p>Several scientists in the U.S. are warning of a '<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366055/Japan-earthquake-tsunami-America-nuclear-alert-Fukushima-explosion.html">worst-case scenario</a>' in which the highly radioactive material could be blasted into the atmosphere and blown towards the West Coast of America.</p>
<p>California <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/03/12/california-closely-monitoring-japan-nuclear-leak/">is closely monitoring</a> efforts to contain leaks at the quake-damaged Japanese nuclear plants, a spokesman said Saturday.</p>
<p>Could radiation from Japan <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=F70jpw_LT-Q">reach the west coast</a> of the United States in 10 days?</p>
<p>Radioactive particles from the stricken Fukushima nuclear facility   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gr8hr4W64E&amp;feature=player_embedded">would take  around a week</a> to reach Alaska and eleven days to reach Los   Angeles, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/radiation-from-fukushima-would-take-7-days-to-reach-u-s/">according to  an Accuweather.com analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Is <a href="http://www.infowars.com/japanese-government-cover-up-foreshadows-mega-disaster/">the full extent</a> of the nuclear meltdown in Japan <a href="http://www.infowars.com/cover-up-of-fukushima-chain-reaction-underway/">being covered up?</a></p>
<p>So exactly what does radiation do <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=n3pKagV26c8">to the human body?</a></p>
<p>Of all the places in all the world where no one in their right mind  would build scores of nuclear power plants, Japan <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040523x2.html">would be pretty near  the top of the list</a>.</p>
<p>Is the nuclear fuel being used in many Japanese nuclear reactors <a href="http://sherriequestioningall.blogspot.com/2011/03/japan-exploded-nuclear-plant-uses-mox.html">especially dangerous?</a></p>
<p>The official death toll for the Japan tsunami <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704893604576199952635789540.html">continues to climb</a>, reaching above 1,800 by  Monday afternoon, though hundreds if not thousands more were expected to  join the total as reports from the most stricken areas trickled in.  National broadcaster NHK reported that more than 450,000 people had  moved to temporary shelters in the affected areas.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/14/3163465.htm">2,000 bodies</a> have been found on two shores in Miyagi Prefecture following Friday's devastating earthquake and massive tsunami, as Japan struggles to grasp the whole picture of the disaster.</p>
<p>What the sea so violently ripped away, it has now begun to return.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15japan.html">Hundreds of bodies</a> are washing up along some shores in northeastern Japan,  making clearer the extraordinary toll of the earthquake and tsunami  that struck last week and adding to the burdens of relief workers as  they ferry aid and search for survivors.</p>
<p>Friday's devastating 8.9 earthquake in Japan moved Japan's coastline <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/03/13/2011-03-13_earthquake_causes_japans_coastline_to_move_as_much_as_13_feet_tilts_earths_axis_.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">as much as 13 feet</a>, averaging eight feet along a stretch measuring 300 miles, according to the Geographical Survey Institute.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan poured a record <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-13/japan-readies-massive-liquidity-as-boj-gauges-risk-to-post-quake-economy.html">15 trillion yen</a> ($183 billion) into the world’s third-biggest economy today as the strongest earthquake in the nation’s history triggered a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk.</p>
<p>Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami could cause gas prices <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/03/devastated-japans-gasoline-needs-may-raise-us-prices-/1">to  rise even higher</a> in the U.S. as refineries here try to make up for some  of the losses to Japan's refining capacity. At the same time, it is  reducing crude oil prices.</p>
<p>Oil prices <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-03-14-oil-monday.htm">dropped below $99 a barrel Monday</a> in Asia as traders expect the earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan to temporarily crush demand for crude in the world’s third-largest economy.</p>
<p>Industry in the world's third-largest economy <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/12/japan-tsunami-earthquake-insurance">all but ground to a halt</a> following the earthquake, as manufacturers ranging from Toyota to Nissan, Sony, Fuji and brewers Kirin and Sapporo shut down their operations in Japan to assess damage and allow staff to check on their families.</p>
<p>The massive earthquake that shook Japan on Friday is expected <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2011-03-11-quake-economy_N.htm">to at least temporarily set back</a> an economy <a href="http://gonzalolira.blogspot.com/2011/03/likely-economic-effects-of-japanese.html">that has faltered lately</a> and is struggling to recover from years of stagnation.</p>
<p>While most of the industrial base of Japan was spared the worst of the  disaster, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/14/news/international/japan_earthquake_tsunami_economic_impact/index.htm">few plants are back up and running yet</a> as the country tries to  come to grips with the crisis.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Co said on Monday that it plans to suspend all production in Japan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/14/toyota-japan-idUSL3E7EE0ED20110314">at least until March 16</a> following Friday's massive earthquake in northeastern Japan.</p>
<p>Jittery traders <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42072853">sold pretty much everything Monday</a> as the tragedy in  Japan roiled global markets, but longer-term investors were looking at  the move as a natural pullback likely to create opportunities.</p>
<p>The devastation in Japan <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAE7GLE_cOc&amp;feature=player_embedded">was beyond anything</a> that anyone had possibly imagined was possible.</p>
<p>Will it take Japan <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/daily-mix/how-japan-will-battle-the-economic-shock/article1938818/">many, many years</a> to fully recover from this event?</p>
<p>Will Japan's economy <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/257902-the-economic-aftershocks-of-the-japanese-earthquake">ever be the same again?</a></p>
<p>Is Japan about <a href="http://usawatchdog.com/the-economic-aftershock-of-japan/">to massively sell off</a> their U.S. Treasuries?</p>
<p>Experts are now warning a second huge quake - almost as powerful as the first - <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366093/Japan-earthquake-Experts-predict-eruption-tsunami-hit-stricken-country-days.html#ixzz1GaRKInhm">could hit Japan</a>, triggering another tsunami.</p>
<p>The Arab League <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12723554">has backed the idea of a no-fly zone over Libya</a>, reports  say, as rebels continue to be pushed back by Colonel Gaddafi’s forces.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/03/13/110287/gadhafis-forces-roll-east-building.html">advanced further  eastward Sunday</a>, moving into the coastal city of Brega and putting new  pressure on the United States and its allies to either intervene  militarily or risk seeing the anti-Gadhafi movement collapse.</p>
<p>Troops from Saudi Arabia and police officers from the United Arab Emirates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/middleeast/15bahrain.html?_r=1">crossed into Bahrain on Monday</a> under the aegis of the Gulf Cooperation Council to help quell unrest there, a move Bahraini opposition groups denounced in a statement as an “occupation.”</p>
<p>The Chinese government, in its latest five-year plan, has stated its  intentions to allow all exporters and importers <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/china-makes-startling-announcement-regarding-currency">to settle their  cross-border trades in the yuan</a> by the end of this year, the central bank said as  part of plans to grow the currency's international role, which has  severe ramifications for the economies of the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>China has become <a href="http://www.financialarmageddon.com/2011/03/negativityor-reality.html">the world’s top manufacturing country</a> by output.</p>
<p>Investors <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2011-03-14-eurpean-answer-debt-crisis.htm">cheered on Monday</a> a surprisingly broad European package of  measures to deal with the government debt crisis that has over the past  year threatened the existence of the euro currency.</p>
<p>Michigan lawmakers are on the verge of approving a bill that would  enable the governor to appoint "<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20042299-503544.html">emergency managers</a>" -- officials with  unilateral power to make sweeping changes to cities facing financial  troubles.</p>
<p>In Queens, New York, on Friday, New York Fed President William Dudley <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/11/us-usa-fed-dudley-ipad-idUSTRE72A4AC20110311?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Technology%29">got bombarded with questions about food inflation</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. Representatives Steve King (R.-Iowa) and Michele Bachmann  (R.-Minn.), two of the leading congressional proponents of the Tea Party  movement, <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/king-bachmann-pledge-vote-no-any-cr-perm">have taken a pledge</a> and are asking all other House members to  join them in it.</p>
<p>Progressive, one of the nation's largest auto insurers, today launches a  nationwide ad campaign <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2011-03-14-Progressive-electronic-check-system.htm">for its "Snapshot" program</a>, in which drivers can  elect to install a small data recorder in their cars that tracks how  hard they brake, how far they drive and whether it's day or night  driving. Based on the results, drivers can save up to 30% on their  insurance. Average savings: $150 a year.</p>
<p>For the elderly, state budget cuts could mean no more daily hot meals  and exercise classes to help prevent falls. At worst, some <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/14/news/economy/senior_citizens_elderly_state_budget_cuts/index.htm">could even  lose their beds</a> at the nursing home.</p>
<p>The Obama administration <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/03/AR2011030306115.html?wprss=rss_print">is preparing for the prospect</a> that Islamist governments will take hold in North Africa and the Middle East, acknowledging that the popular revolutions there will bring a more religious cast to the region's politics.</p>
<p>Belief in extraterrestrial life <a href="http://creation.com/aliens-are-coming">has effectively become a new religion for many</a>,     replacing traditional belief.</p>
<p>Astronomers tracking the potentially dangerous asteroid Apophis <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/10/scitech/main20041969.shtml">made a major breakthrough in January</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, around 800 people had to be rescued from their cars recently after a blizzard in North Dakota <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1365752/Terrifying-ordeal-800-motorists-rescued-cars-blizzard-sweeps-U-S-state.html">made roads impassable</a>.</p>

<p>Barack Obama isn't taking any options off the table with respect to Libya --  including military options -- but spokesman Jay Carney did say today  that sending ground troops "<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/03/obama-spokesman-ground-troops-in-libya-not-at-the-the-top-of-the-list/1">is not the at the top of the list at this  point.</a>"</p>
<p>NATO has launched <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/07/libya.military.response/index.html?hpt=T1">around-the-clock surveillance flights</a> of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence in the war-torn country, America's ambassador to the organization told reporters Monday.</p>
<p>A joint SAS-MI6 team <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1363540/SAS-rounded-booted-Libyan-mission-turns-farce.html">was kicked out of Libya last night</a> after their mission to link up with rebels fighting Colonel Gaddafi turned to farce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/americas-secret-plan-to-arm-libyas-rebels-2234227.html">It is being reported</a> that the Obama administration has asked Saudi Arabia if it can supply weapons to the rebels in Benghazi.</p>
<p>There are reports that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is using paid mercenaries <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=211101&amp;R=R1">from Serbia, Syria, the Ukraine and Romania</a> to attack rebels.</p>
<p>Interpol has issued <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/Security/?id=3.1.1752608527">a global alert</a> known as an Orange Notice against  Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and 15 other Libyan nationals, including members  of his family and close associates, the Lyon-based international police  organization said on Friday.</p>
<p>Options traders <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-07/saudi-arabia-s-day-of-rage-lures-record-bets-on-200-oil-chart-of-day.html">are betting more than ever</a> that crude oil is heading to $200 a barrel as some websites call for a “<a href="http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/07/will-saudi-be-the-next-to-rise-up/">Day of Rage</a>” in Saudi Arabia and anti- government protests spread in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s Interior Ministry said that demonstrations, marches and sit-ins <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-05/saudi-government-says-demonstrations-marches-prohibited-by-kingdom-s-laws.html">are “strictly” prohibited</a> under the kingdom’s laws, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=210883&amp;R=R1">the Saudi Press Agency said</a>, citing an unidentified official at the Interior Ministry.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is sending <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudis-mobilise-thousands-of-troops-to-quell-growing-revolt-2232928.html">up to 10,000 security personnel</a> into its north-eastern Shia Muslim provinces, clogging the highways into Dammam and other cities with busloads of troops in fear of next week's "day of rage" by what is now called the "Hunayn Revolution".</p>
<p>After Nomura released a report two weeks back predicting oil could rise <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/socgens-three-scenarios-oil-see-crude-price-between-110-and-200">to $220</a> if the MENA situation escalates, this morning SocGen's Michael Wittner has released his own scenario analysis on the possible outcomes of the 2011 revolutions. His three cases see oil within the following escalating thresholds: $110-$125; $125-$150; and $150-$200.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery was trading more than  $1 a barrel higher Monday <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-03-07-oil-monday_N.htm">around $105.50</a>, after hitting $106.95 a barrel  on the Nymex exchange, highest since Sept. 26, 2008.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices in the United States posted <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41938193/ns/business-oil_and_energy/">their second-biggest  increase ever in a two-week period</a>, due to the rise in crude oil prices  stemming from the turmoil in Libya, an industry analyst said Sunday.</p>
<p>Joe Sixpack, driving his 15 mpg Dodge RAM pickup, will now be forking over <a href="http://www.theburningplatform.com/?p=12268">an extra $1,200 per year</a> in gas expenditures.</p>
<p>The speculative fervor for oil is so remarkable that the big trading firms now  have nearly <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/07/speculators-double-down-on-oil/">twice as many</a> long contracts open as they did in 2008, when  oil spiked to $147 in the summer</p>
<p>While rising tension in the Middle East and North Africa have sent crude  prices skyrocketing, as well as hurt developed market equities, the  U.S. dollar has failed to benefit from this rise in risk aversion. This  has many <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2011/03/01/is-the-u-s-dollar-still-a-safe-haven/">questioning the greenback’s status</a> as a safe haven.</p>
<p>As the chaos in North Africa has grown over the past month, investors  have largely shunned the dollar and sought shelter elsewhere. They have  turned to other traditional islands of stability, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704615504576172700977248380.html">buying Japanese yen  and the Swiss franc</a>.</p>
<p>If oil prices continue to climb, it could force the Federal Reserve to  make <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/07/news/economy/Lockhart_Fed_QE3/index.htm">a new round of asset purchases</a>, according to Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart.</p>

<p>Several European governments <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/03/greece-debt-rating-downgrade.html">are finding it much more expensive</a> to finance their debts these days.</p>

<p>The U.S. federal government posted <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/7/government-posts-biggest-monthly-deficit-ever/">its largest monthly deficit in history</a> in  February at $223 billion, according to preliminary numbers the  Congressional Budget Office released Monday morning.</p>
<p>In a sign of just how clueless some politicians are about America’s  manufacturing crisis, former Republican presidential candidate and  current Sen. John McCain claimed over the weekend <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/mccain-claims-iphone-american-made">that iPods and iPhones  are made right here in America</a>.</p>
<p>Over 19 million workers were employed in manufacturing during the  1970s.  Today we have <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/financial-dismantling-of-the-american-middle-class-in-8-charts-peak-debt-credit-card-cash-banking-finance-wealth/">slightly above 11 million workers</a> with many more  living in the country.</p>
<p>After four straight years of declines, sales of million-dollar homes and  condos rose last year in all 20 major metro areas, according to  DataQuick Information Systems. On average, these cities saw <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/07/real_estate/million_dollar_homes/index.htm">an 18.6%  jump</a> in high-end home sales.</p>
<p>An obscure business, the MERS Corporation, claims to hold title <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41946553">to  roughly half of all the home mortgages in the nation</a> — an astonishing 60  million loans.</p>
<p>Is America experiencing <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/economy-hit-with-the-ultimate-smokescreen-biflation.html">"biflation"</a>?  During biflation, there’s a rise in  prices of commodity-based assets  like food and energy (inflation) and a  simultaneous fall (deflation) in  the price of debt-based assets like homes,  cars, and appliances.</p>
<p>California <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41950398">only has a short amount of time</a> to fix its troubled economy, with an $84 billion budget and $24 billion deficit, or else it will deteriorate to the point of no return, Sean Egan, founding partner and president of Egan-Jones Rating Company, told CNBC on Monday.</p>
<p>New York, apparently, wants to encourage companies to take as much risk of bankruptcy as possible, by raising or retaining as little cash as possible, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-capital-tax-2011-3">so it taxes them on cash they have in the bank</a>.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, some tea partiers came over to the union side to have a dialogue with  the  pro-union protesters. The tea partier was stopped cold by this  question: <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/union-protester-to-tea-partier-why-do-you-have-a-right-to-your-money.html">“Why do  you have a right to your money”?</a></p>
<p>There is one family that is actually producing 6000 pounds of produce <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/yes-you-can-survive-the-coming-economic-nightmare-one-family-in-california-grows-6000-pounds-of-produce-on-just-110th-of-an-acre">on  just 1/10th of an acre</a> right in the middle of Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>Is the demand for "brains" <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/falling-demand-for-brains/">falling?</a></p>
<p>More and more people <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41626661">are questioning the practicality</a> of a traditional  bachelor of arts degree as the United States struggles to create jobs in  a global economy while U.S. colleges fail to contain tuition costs.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory says a new fissure eruption opened up  on the floor at the Pu’u O’o when a crater collapsed Saturday.

<p>Speaking briefly at the White House Thursday, Barack Obama said Muammar Gaddafi <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41883246">must leave Libya</a> and he said that the U.S.  was "outraged by the violence" in the North African country as rebels  and forces loyal to Gaddafi continue to battle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/28/us-military-gaddafi-libya">One major British newspaper</a> is reporting that the U.S. and NATO are edging closer to a possible military confrontation with Muammar Gaddafi's regime, as the U.S. deploys naval and air force units around Libya, and as David Cameron orders contingency plans for Britain to help enforce a no-fly zone.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has announced that he has approved <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/03/libya.refugees/index.html?hpt=T1">the use of U.S.  military aircraft</a> to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who  have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya Obama said he  also authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to  charter additional planes "to help people from other countries find  their way home."</p>
<p>If the U.S. military is hesitant to enact a no-fly zone over Libya, the  Army is capable of giving the opposition the capacity to use  anti-aircraft defenses themselves, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/03/03/libya.no.fly.zone/index.html?hpt=T2">Sen. Joe Lieberman suggested  Thursday</a>.</p>

<p>Gaddafi has offered amnesty to Libyan rebels but has also threatened <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8358013/Libya-Gaddafi-threatens-bloodbath-if-West-intervenes.html">a bloodbath</a> if the West tries to intervene.</p>

<p>World food prices <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/un-food-prices-climb-at-264-annualized.html">rose 2.2%</a> in February from the previous month (a 26.4%  annualized rate) to a record peak, according to the The Food and  Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-02-28-libya_N.htm">repositioned some naval forces</a> near Libya and threatened Monday that all options remain on the table to protect Libyans threatened by an increasingly isolated and defiant Moammar Gadhafi, including the possible use of warplanes to patrol Libyan skies.</p>
<p>The United States has frozen <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/28/libya.world.response/index.html?hpt=T1">at least $30 billion</a> in Libyan government  assets, a U.S. Treasury official announced Monday -- one of a series of  steps being taken by international leaders designed to break strongman  Moammar Gadhafi's grip on power.</p>
<p>Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Monday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/28/libya.protests/index.html?hpt=T1">denied the existence of the protests</a> that have threatened his hold on power.</p>
<p>Following Secretary of State Clinton’s recent call for intervention, a rebel  leader in Libya has stated his country <a href="http://www.infowars.com/libyans-no-thanks-to-globalist-intervention/">does not want</a> or need any help  from the United States and its globalist partners.</p>
<p>According to White House spokesman Jay Carney, "<a title="no options" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-barack-obama-about-to-order-the-u-s-military-to-invade-libya" target="_blank">no options</a>" have been taken off the table when it comes to the situation in Libya.</p>
<p>The unrest in Libya has cut oil output <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41829638">by half</a> in the world's 12th  largest exporter, the West's energy watchdog, the International Energy  Agency said on Monday, more than it initially estimated.</p>
<p>The European Union voted Monday <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/27/AR2011022704133.html?wprss=rss_world">to adopt sanctions</a> against Libya that  included an arms embargo, an asset freeze and a visa ban, wire services  reported.</p>
<p>Yemen's main opposition bloc on Monday rejected President Ali Abdullah  Saleh's call to form a unity government to rule until elections to  replace him, saying its goal is simply "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/28/yemen.protests/index.html?hpt=T2">the fall of the regime.</a>"</p>
<p>Anti-government protesters in Oman <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/28/oman.protests/index.html?hpt=T2">refused to end protests</a> Monday,  despite orders from the sultan to hire 50,000 people and pay a stipend  to people who are out of work.</p>
<p>About 60 people were arrested during an anti-government rally attended <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2011/02/27/nb-03">by about 15,000 people</a> in Zagreb, Croatia on Saturday.</p>
