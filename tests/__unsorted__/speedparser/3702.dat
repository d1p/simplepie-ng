			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been saying &#8220;Connectivity is the NEW Currency&#8221; for years now.</p>
<p>The power of the network effect is undeniable in this case.</p>
<p>Due the the <a class="zem_slink" title="Network effect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" rel="wikipedia">Network Effect</a>, <strong>these four magazines are launching with a higher circulation than the previous business category leaders, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Businessweek</em> and <em>Fortune </em>combined</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just posting the release as is for now. Will come back later and give some commentary later in a few days&#8230;</p>
<p>Stay Connected &#8211; Michelle P.</p>
<p><strong><em>Partnerships Create World’s Leading Circulation Business Magazines with 13.8 Million</em></strong><em><strong> Distribution</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NEW YORK (September 7, 2011) – </strong>With social media’s influence growing at a rapid pace, entrepreneurs are embracing it to stay ahead of the curve – and their competition. And now social media’s first magazines – set to debut in October 2011 – are partnering with professional communities <a class="zem_slink" title="EFactor" href="http://www.efactor.com" rel="homepage">EFactor</a>.com and The Pro2Pro Network to expand their business circulation to 13.8 million at launch. This circulation surpasses previous business circulation leader, Wall Street Journal, with 2.1 million subscribers.</p>
<p><em>EFactor </em>is the world&#8217;s largest entrepreneurial community, with members spanning 180 countries. They are a social network and one-stop shop for entrepreneurs, providing them with free resources such as access to funding and savings through exclusively negotiated member discounts.</p>
<p>The Pro2Pro Network is the largest professional-to-professional referral network in North America. Pro2Pro is where  doctors and professionals go for referrals. Their network of entrepreneurs, doctors, attorneys and other professionals is like Match.com for professionals, bringing together like minded geo-targeted professionals  who want to establish mutually beneficial referral relationships.</p>
<p>Associate Publisher and best-selling author <strong>Eric Yaverbaum</strong> says these partnerships reflect the mission of the social media magazines. “These networks really walk the walk of serving their members. By providing our four social media magazines to their constituents for free, they are allowing their members to play the social media game as an informed player. Without this kind of instruction they would find it more difficult to attract customers, translating into lower visibility and lost sales.”</p>
<p>“The influence and power of social media is critical for entrepreneurs,” says founder of EFactor <strong>Adrie Reinders</strong>. “Our partnership with the four Social Media Magazines is an excellent example of how we provide the most up-to-date information on how entrepreneurs can engage with their customers and increase their profits.”</p>
<p>The four social media magazines,<em> <strong>FB &amp; Business</strong> </em>(Facebook), <strong><em>Tweeting &amp; Business</em></strong><em> </em>(Twitter), <strong><em>LI &amp; Business</em></strong><em> </em>(Linkedin), and <strong><em>The Big G &amp; Business</em></strong><em> </em>(Google) include a team of the nation’s most influential social media and business minds. The magazines are designed to help businesses and executives leverage the power of the four leading social media platforms, services that are immensely important for entrepreneurs to master.</p>
<p>“Prior to partnering with EFactor &amp; The Pro2Pro Network we already had millions of readers through our exclusive distribution partnership with Office Depot,” says <strong>Larry Genkin</strong>, GSG WorldMedia’s founder, publisher and CEO. “Now each of our four publications will launch with a higher circulation than the previous business category leaders, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Businessweek</em> and <em>Fortune </em>combined.”</p>
<p>“The combination of EFactor.com and Pro2Pro Network’s vision, with our experts’ knowledge allows us to give 13.8 million entrepreneurs and business people access to the best minds in social media today and for free. As an added bonus, the print publications will also be available in digital format at no cost,” adds Genkin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further solidifying the magazines as the “go-to” resource on social media for entrepreneurs and business executives, the publications have signed top experts to contribute editorially. Such masters include entrepreneur and NFL great Fran Tarkenton; <em>Guerrilla Marketing </em>author Jay Conrad Levinson; Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, who Forbes named one of the world’s top 15 most influential business thinkers; Robert Scoble, who gained fame as Microsoft’s “Geek” blogger; Yanik Silver, known as the “godfather of Internet marketing;” and behavioral economist and the best-selling author of the business classic Predictably Irrational, Dan Ariely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About EFactor:</strong> EFactor.com was founded by a team of successful serial entrepreneurs.  At EFactor.com, entrepreneurs exchange ideas with experts, receive exclusive discounts on business tools, interact with potential partners or clients, and discover funding for their startups. EFactor offers a unique mix of online and offline events in the US and internationally. Members join EFactor to make relevant connections, taking their businesses to the next level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Pro2Pro Network: </strong>Provides strategic business-building marketing solutions for doctors and professionals by scheduling pre-screened, pre-qualified mutually beneficial meetings for professionals with other local professionals who want to establish referral relationships.<br />
<strong>About Social Media Magazines:</strong> The four social medial publications include FB &amp; Business (Facebook), Tweeting &amp; Business (Twitter), LI &amp; Business (Linkedin), and The Big G &amp; Business (Google), and will be available at launch in 8 formats, including iPhone, iPad, Android, tablet, BlackBerry, Kindle, multimedia and print. All digital subscriptions are free, courtesy of Office Depot, EFactor and The Pro2Pro Network, with a subscription to the monthly print edition, priced at $179 per year per magazine. Free digital subscriptions are available online at <a href="http://www.socialmediamags.com/" target="_blank">www.socialmediamags.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first read this story in a short book given to me by John Assaraf, titled &#8220;You2 &#8220;(squared) by Price Pritchett. It&#8217;s profoundly simple and powerful story to help you understand the Quantum Leap mindset. ..</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sitting in a quiet room at the Milcroft Inn, a peaceful little place hidden back among the pine trees about an hour out of Toronto. It&#8217;s just past noon, late July, and I&#8217;m listening to the desperate sounds of a life-or-death struggle going on a few feet away.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a small fly burning out the last of its short life&#8217;s energies in a futile attempt to fly through the glass of the windowpane. The whining wings tell the poignant story of the fly&#8217;s strategy: Try harder. But it&#8217;s not working.</p>
<p>The frenzied effort offers no hope for survival. Ironically, the struggle is part of the trap. It is impossible for the fly to try hard enough to succeed at breaking through the glass. Nevertheless, this little insect has staked its life on reaching its goal through raw effort and determination. This fly is doomed. It will die there on the windowsill.</p>
<p>Across the room, ten steps away, the door is open. Ten seconds of flying time and this small creature could reach the outside world it seeks. With only a fraction of the effort now being wasted, it could be free of this self-imposed trap. The breakthrough possibility is there. It would be so easy.Why doesn&#8217;t the fly try another approach, something dramatically different? How did it get so locked in on the idea that this particular route and determined effort offer the most promise for success? What logic is there in continuing until death to seek a breakthrough with more of the same? No doubt this approach makes sense to the fly. Regrettably, it&#8217;s an idea that will kill.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Trying harder isn&#8217;t necessarily the solution to achieving more. It may not offer any real promise for getting what you want out of life. Sometimes, in fact, it&#8217;s a big part of the problem. If you stake your hopes for a breakthrough on trying harder than ever, you may kill your chances for success.</p>
<p>Price Pritchett&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What I took away from this story is that trying harder is rarely the answer, especially for women entrepreneurs. We have to stop trying and start BEing.</p>
<p>As R2D2 (?) in Star Wars said &#8220;Try? There is no &#8216;try&#8217;. There is only Do and Do Not&#8221;&#8230;;-).</p>
<p>I certainly used that one on my daughters as they were growing up. I use it on myself just about daily when I catch myself saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll try&#8221;.</p>
<p>To get yourself into a Quantum Leap mindset, stop beating your head against the proverbial window and visualize the perfect end result&#8230; think creatively about how you might accomplish it instead of just doing things the same way you&#8217;ve always done them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One week prior to her final divorce court date, Lauren Miller was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer and told she had a 50 PERCENT CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. How’s THAT for stress?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She&#8217;s launching her book &#8220;<a href="http://www.BeforeStressingOut.com">99 Things You Wish You Knew BEFORE Stressing Out</a>!&#8221; today and I am hosting her for a Guest Blog Tour this week. I&#8217;ll be posting a tip from the book every day&#8230;ENJOY!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This first tip is from Chapter 1: TO STRESS? OR NOT TO STRESS?</strong><br />
Ahhh… that is the question. Did you know you have the ability to choose your response to any and every situation that unfolds before you in life? When you remember this truth, it is very empowering and will be of great worth as you journey through life. Your choice of response will also make all the difference in the outcome. When you choose any strong emotional response, know that you cannot see things for what they really are because you are blinded by the intensity of the emotion. You might say, “Well, I can’t help myself, that’s just how I respond,” which comes from your subconscious patterns of behavior. However, when you become conscious of behaviors and responses that no longer serve you, you are in a position to shift back to peace. To choose to stress or not to stress, the choice is yours. Simply taking a few deeps breaths between the situation and your response to it can give you a little gap of empowerment to choose peace over panic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip #1: Know Stress; Know Dis-ease…No Stress; No Dis-ease.</strong><br />
A recent study out of UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center revealed that chronic stress acts as a sort of fertilizer to cancer cells. If you know anything about the physiological effects of stress on the body from high blood pressure to increased cortisol levels and a compromised immune system you might say, “You think?” At least that’s what I said when I read the findings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was one week prior to my final divorce court date when I was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer. Because I don’t believe in divorce (in my tribe you stay married for life) I was under some serious stress and my body was talking to me about it all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever broken down the word disease? Dis-ease: Feelings of uneasiness in the body due to perceived situations that are seen by the viewer as a potential threat to their safety (emotionally, physically or spiritually).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two of your core needs in life are connection and safety. When you feel unsafe you feel dis-connected and you begin to stress out: “Oh no, I’m not safe; I might fail; I might be fired; I might be unseen, unheard, or overlooked.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to disconnect from feelings of insecurity is to connect to that which is secure within you—along with what you value most in life. What do you value most in your life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would venture to guess that it exists beyond the five senses. Make a list of everything that you value most in this life and take time every day to nurture one or two things on that list. You will find that when you align yourself to that which you value most, you fertilize your sense of safety in all situations. This, in turn, releases a sense of ease in your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surely, a portion of the time you spend Skyping, texting, emailing and cell phoning can be used to create ease in your daily life, especially knowing it has the potential to save your life. When your priorities are clear your decisions are easy, which in turn lowers the stress and dis-ease level inside of your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, it’s your choice. One of my daily mantras is “people before things.” Each time I practice this throughout the day I am given the opportunity to choose between the essential and the nonessential. When you connect with the essential, the result is a life of value and inner peace. As Dr. David Hawkins points out, “Peace is the natural state when truth prevails.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Align yourself with truth, what is good, pure, excellent and praiseworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My good friend Michelle Anton pointed me to this book video (below) on Tribal Leadership today. She knows I am a fascinated, curious human being when it comes to anything related to social networks.</p>
<p><object width="480" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AJPAn3cYtLQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/AJPAn3cYtLQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><strong>I like it</strong> because it&#8217;s a serious book sales tool that actually doesn&#8217;t badger you to &#8220;buy the book&#8221;. Plus, it&#8217;s one of the BEST models for a book blogsite I&#8217;ve seen in a very long time. (There was a super great book blogsite that I found a year or so ago. Alas, for the life of me, I CANNOT find it again. Bummer.) Oh well, this one inspired me to actually share it.</p>
<p>The video focuses on educating the viewer about the <a href="http://www.triballeadership.net/book?paperclip">5 Stages of Tribes</a> in companies. The authors say it takes at least 20 people to be labeled a &#8220;tribe&#8221;. Less than 20 and it&#8217;s a &#8220;team&#8221;.  Through the video, the author demonstrates by sharing his knowledge  that he is an expert on this topic.</p>
<p>Perfect way to get me to buy a single book. The authors have also developed various packages that make it easy to buy  &#8221;multiple&#8221; copies.  So if a manager or executive wants to <a href="http://www.triballeadership.net/buy-the-book">buy a book for members of her team or tribe</a>, she can do that, and get more stuff as a bonus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How cool. Got this email from Linked in a while back. Started a post, and got sidetracked.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like the social media pioneer I am&#8230;I just don&#8217;t talk about it as much as some of the others who &#8216;sigh&#8217;&#8230;<strong>never</strong> seem to stop talking about their social media pedigrees.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, <a class="zem_slink" title="LinkedIn" rel="homepage" href="http://www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> is at 100 million members, and did a very successful IPO.</p>
<p>Waaaaaay back in &#8217;04, I was a member of one of the &#8220;in-crowd&#8221; email discussion groups. <a href="http://www.led-digest.com/content/view/38/79/1/4/">i-Sales</a> I think it was (anybody else remember those lists? You replied via email&#8230;the moderator accepted or rejected your reply. How draconian they seem now).</p>
<p>The new moderator and I hit it off, and he invited me to join Linkedin, which was by invitation only back then. I joined, and didn&#8217;t really see anything to do with it. So it sat on the back burner until 2007, right about the time MySpace was hot (never could get into it myself. The screen was too busy).</p>
<p>When I started noticing Facebook heating up around that same time I decided to seriously figure out what Linkedin was really about&#8230;it was still boring. (sorry! only my opinion)</p>
<p>7 years later, I think they finally have the formula right.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Michelle,</p>
<p>I want to personally thank you because you were one of LinkedIn&#8217;s first 100,000 members (member number 53517 in fact!*). In any technology adoption lifecycle, there are the innovators, those who help lead the way. That was you.</p>
<p>We hit a big milestone at LinkedIn this week when our 100 millionth member joined the site.</p>
<p>When we founded LinkedIn, our vision was to help the world&#8217;s professionals be more successful and productive. Today, with your help, LinkedIn is changing the lives of millions of members by helping them connect with others, find jobs, get insights, start a business, and much more.</p>
<p>We are grateful for your support and look forward to helping you accomplish much more in the years to come. I hope that you are having a great year.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Reid Hoffman" rel="crunchbase" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman">Reid Hoffman</a><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this video in a leadership lesson, on an online learning site. I almost passed it up because I wasn&#8217;t looking for this topic &#8211; it just popped up in the search for the other keyword.</p>
<p>But I reminded myself that insights (thinklets) on thought leadership come in the most obscure ways sometimes, ESPECIALLY when you aren&#8217;t looking for them.</p>
<p>So what does a 3 minute video on dancing have to do with thought leadership, launching a movement and getting YOUR first follower?</p>
<p>Watch this video &#8211; it&#8217;s a study in human sociology at the least. You&#8217;ll see the &#8220;light of insight&#8221; flip on when you do. <img src='http://athirdmind.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Enjoy &#8211; it&#8217;s Edutainment at it&#8217;s finest&#8230;FUNNY!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Fierce Feminine entrepreneur friend and colleague Lynn Scheurell sent this out today. I decided it would be a great way to kick off 1/1/11 . So I swiped the wisdom from Charlie Chaplin verbatim and am posting it <img src='http://athirdmind.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>No interpretation needed. He wrote this on his 70th birthday in 1959, over 50 years ago. Wow.</p>
<p>Talk about timeless&#8230;.</p>

<p>Words of Wisdom &#8211; As I Began<br />
By <a class="zem_slink" title="Charlie Chaplin" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a></p>
<p>As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.<br />
Today, I know, this is &#8220;AUTHENTICITY&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person,even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me.<br />
Today I call it &#8220;RESPECT&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow.<br />
Today I call it &#8220;MATURITY&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time,<br />
and everything happens at the exactly right moment.<br />
So I could be calm.<br />
Today I call it &#8220;SELF-CONFIDENCE&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I quit stealing my own time,<br />
and I stopped designing huge projects for the future.<br />
Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness,<br />
things I love to do and that make my heart cheer,<br />
and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm.<br />
Today I call it &#8220;SIMPLICITY&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything<br />
that is no good for my health &#8211; food, people, things, situations,<br />
and everything the drew me down and away from myself.<br />
At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.<br />
Today I know it is &#8220;LOVE OF ONESELF&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right,<br />
and ever since I was wrong less of the time.<br />
Today I discovered that is &#8220;MODESTY&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past<br />
and worry about the future.<br />
Now, I only live for the moment, where EVERYTHING is happening.<br />
Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it &#8220;FULFILLMENT&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me<br />
and it can make me sick.<br />
But As I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally.<br />
Today I call this connection &#8220;WISDOM OF THE HEART&#8221;.</p>
<p>We no longer need to fear arguments,<br />
confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.<br />
Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born.<br />
Today I know THAT IS &#8220;LIFE&#8221;!</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>Create a GREAT 2011&#8230;.</p>
<p>Michelle P.</p>

(it&#8217;s free, and you don&#8217;t even have to leave home or office, even better <img src='http://athirdmind.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>We all know business needs to shift. �These are the people leading that shift with their ACTIONS, �not their talk.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the release for your reading pleasure:</p>
<p><strong>Joie de Vivre Founder Chip Conley to Host First Ever Free Online �Enlightened Business Summit�</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Largest-ever </strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Conscious business" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscious_business"><strong>Conscious Business</strong></a><strong> Telesummit Oct. 25-29 to Emphasize Conscious Capitalism with Thought Leaders Tony Hsieh, John Mackey, </strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Timothy Ferriss" rel="blog" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog"><strong>Tim Ferriss</strong></a><strong>, Google�s School of Personal Growth   Creator Monika Brekker, Stephen M. Covey, and 35 Other Leading Business Thinkers</strong></em></p>
<p><em>San Francisco, Calif. (Oct.18 , 2010) </em>� Joie de Vivre Hospitality Founder and Executive Chairman Chip Conley has teamed up with The Shift Network, an online education company, to launch the groundbreaking <a href="http://enlightenedbusinesssummit.com/" target="_blank">Enlightened Business Summit</a>. This free online event, to be held October 25-29, is the first to bring together top CEOs, bestselling authors, business change leaders and conscious entrepreneurs to share best practices on how business can fuse enlightened values with increased profits. Business leaders large and small will learn practical steps to create successful companies with great cultures that generate both passion, purpose and profits. Participants can register at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1oF72Lj2WSRU2lJjkmbMWkUfKFklo4jhA0n3zL3eo4jw&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://enlightenedbusinesssummit.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Conley, who will emcee the five-day telesummit, is author of <em>PEAK: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow</em> and founder of Joie de Vivre, the second largest independent hotel company in the U.S. He was one of only two business thought leaders invited to speak at�<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/chip_conley_measuring_what_makes_life_worthwhile.html" target="_blank">TED</a> this year, where he recommended organizations re-examine the metrics they&#8217;re using to measure success.</p>
<p>Spurred by his belief that companies must adopt a new paradigm of business leadership to survive, he collaborated with Stephen Dinan, CEO of The Shift Network, to bring together 40 leaders, CEOs, authors, visionaries, and provocateurs he most admires and who are on the cutting-edge of business thinking.</p>
<p>Headline speakers include Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, author of the #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling book <em>Delivering Happiness,</em> as well as other New York Times bestselling authors such as Tim Ferriss (<em>The 4-Hour Work Week</em>) and Stephen M. Covey. The Summit roster also includes notable conscious capitalist CEOs such as John Mackey of Whole Foods, George Zimmer of The Men�s Wearhouse and Casey Sheahan from Patagonia as well as Kleiner Perkins partner Randy Komisar and the creator of Google�s School of Personal Growth, Monika Broecker. �The unique summit will give live, direct access to speakers for free, with most leaders offering 30 minutes of their most important insights in a manner akin to the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/chip_conley_measuring_what_makes_life_worthwhile.html" target="_blank">TED conference</a>.</p>
<p>�In an age of cynicism about capitalism, this Summit will be a powerful antidote,� Conley says. �Anyone who�s involved with business will benefit from our extraordinary line-up of speakers who are creating businesses that truly serve people, planet, and profits. Each speaker will share their specific strategies so that tens of thousands of business professionals can harness their insights and create their own revolution in how business is done.�</p>
<p>Conference topics include:<span id="more-288"></span>enlightened leadership, conscious capitalism and conscious entrepreneurship, triple bottom line values, socially conscious business, workplace psychology, creating self-actualizing customer experiences, and transitioning to a green economy. The Summit is also the first large business telesummit to take place on MaestroConference, a new teleseminar technology that allows greater participant interactivity, such as the creation of networking and discussion groups. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions during the calls, and the technology also allows for conversations among the thousands of participants during many of the sessions.</p>
<p>Stephen Dinan, CEO of The Shift Network said, �There is no more pressing need in our world today than creating enlightened, conscious businesses that serve the greater good of employees, shareholders, customers, and the larger world equally well. We�re delighted to offer the best-in-class thinking about how to accelerate this shift to truly conscious capitalism, and to do so without the expense, time and impact of travel.�</p>
