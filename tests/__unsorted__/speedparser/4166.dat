	  <h2>Paperless Nirvana!</h2>

<p>On a single night recently, I read an <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6652">article</a> that explains how
to set up the <a href="http://swish-e.org" title="May not load, the server may be down">swish-e</a> XML document indexer, <a href="http://kevincupp.com">Kevin Cupp</a>'s
<a href="http://blog.kevincupp.com/2008/06/three_weeks_with_my_drobo.php">review</a> of the ready-made raid box drobo, and a linux.com
<a href="http://www.linux.com/articles/61826?theme=print">article</a> about turning a networked computer into a pdf making
machine.  You can see where my mind was headed.</p>

<p>I've decided it would be an awesome thing to have a "paperless"
office.  Now I'm not going to throw out my printer, or anything silly
like that.  Having a digital filing cabinet instead of a paper filing
cabinet just appears to be advantageous.  So what all do I plan to do?
Well first there is the issue of what I actually need out of this
project.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>I plan to store everything on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">Raid</a> 1, 5, or maybe even 6.  I plan
to use these drives ONLY for document storage.  No music, no movies.
I hope to have a seperate set up for Raid 1 with MythTV for my music
and movies.  More on the DVR project later...</p>

<h3>Physical Input</h3>

<p>I need a way to get physical bills, letters, etc into digital storage.
The solution is obviously a scanner of some kind.  I might need two
scanners though, one flatbed for things that cannot be spooled, and
another one for the letter/A4 sized papers.  Any suggestions on either
scanner I should be looking for would be great.</p>

<h3>Physical Output</h3>

<p>Getting things out of digital storage into the physical world is just
as important.  I have a printer, problem solved.  I imagine I would
have this printer shared on the network so any computer can print from
the same printer.</p>

<h3>Digital Input</h3>

<p>Setting up <a href="http://www.cups-pdf.de/">CUPS-PDF</a> seems like the obvious choice.  I could
hit print on any page I want and just choose the CUPS-PDF printer.
Then I could have a process that runs every 5 minutes to look at
recently created documents and indexes them, and does any cleaning I
deem necessary.</p>

<h3>Digital Output</h3>

<p>And finally what I would consider the most important part of this
little project, getting digital output of the documents I have
stored.  I would need remote and local access to my documents, and
have some way to easily search them.</p>

<p>My ideal interface for this would be a nice web interface that I could
log into, and access/search/download any of my files stored on the
machine.  Then I could use the same interface for these documents no
matter the machine or the location.  I'd probably also have ssh/nfs
access set up as well, but that is a simple and no-fun set up.</p>

<p>I still don't have a good idea of the best document indexing service
to set up.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>The more I think about this, the more I can see myself setting up a
quick <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>/<a href="http://merbivore.com/">merb</a>/<a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">thin</a> interface for the server, and
having it be accessible from anywhere.  Most likely it'd end up being
django so I could just use the admin interface for a quick solution.
Ideally I'd also be able to upload files from any computer to the
document server as well.</p>

<p>This is going to be a fun project, and I'll keep you updated!  Email
me if you have any suggestions for indexing services, names for the
project, or possibly projects that all ready do most things describe.</p>

	  <h2>Hriki : The Happily Ruby Ikiwiki Clone</h2>

<p>I felt bad when I started this project.  <a href="http://ikiwiki.info">IkiWiki</a> is a great
piece of software and my goal is not to compete with ikiwiki
directly.</p>

<h2>But let's get real</h2>

<p>I suck at perl.  In fact I suck really really hard at it.  So one of
my first attempts at hacking ikiwiki failed within 2 minutes.  I
didn't try the hardest.. but I didn't want to.</p>

<p>So now we're left with the option of rewriting the same type of
program in a language I would like to hack.  <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> it is.</p>

<h2>So let's see it!</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/codemac/hriki">Go get 'em</a>.  It's not done yet, in fact I can't guarantee it
does anything useful.</p>

	  <p>I am of a very small percent of the world, probably less than one
percent, that live a wealthy and privileged lifestyle.  I consider
myself extremely lucky, and I try as hard as I can to not take it for
granted.  Obviously I do take my wealth for granted some, because I
have a blog, extra clothes, extra food, extra toys, extra rooms, and
basically extra wealth.</p>

<p>This lifestyle can be sickening when I truly evaluate it.  Though
truly evaluating something you live in is difficult.  Either way, my
recognition of my exceeding wealth is an important step for me.  I
have to use my conscience as a mechanism to keep me grounded.  Living
the good life is enjoyable, but achieving the sublime is a goal worth
suffering for.</p>

<p>So to define my personal wealth, I must throw out my check book.  I
have to erase the societal definition of what I have.</p>

<p>I don't think I know I how to do that.</p>

<p>Yet even so, look out world. I'm coming for you.  My personal wealth
and my personal success as top priorities.</p>

	  <p>I sent the following email to Anywise after my account at xmpp.us kept
disconnecting.</p>

  To: info@anywise.eu <br />
  Subject: xmpp.us: Short Write()  </p>
  
  <p>Several times a day for the past couple days, my xmpp.us jabber
  account has been disconnected and wont be able to reconnect for a good
  while with the error "jabber - Logged out: Short write() to server".
  I know you guys just recently merged the xmpp.us server over, but I
  was curious what was going on.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for the great service,</p>

<p>And this is the response I get.</p>

  <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
  
  <p>After the migration we see more crashes than ever. This is very
  annoying of course. We now know what the cause of the crashes is. One
  of the developers of ejabberd helped us to find. Now, we are working
  to fix this. You may see some disconnects for a couple of days but I
  hope this is fixed over the weekend.</p>
  
  <p>Jeroen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you know your timezones, you'll notice that this message was sent
16 minutes and 10 seconds after my mail was sent.  I honestly don't
even care about the crashes anymore.  I want to stick with a jabber
server service that replies so quickly with a couple key things:</p>

<ul>
<li>They admit there is a problem, I'm not crazy.</li>
<li>They know what the problem is.</li>
<li>They mentioned the jabber server software they are using.</li>
<li>They gave me an estimated time frame for when it will be fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I know that I'll wait until next week sometime before I complain
about this again.  Thank you <a href="http://www.anywise.eu/">Anywise</a>!</p>

	  <p>While working on this ikiwiki, I just added a fun little function to
my init.el.  It finds the next file that I am going to write for the
blog and adds some meta stuff at the top.</p>

<pre><code>;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; bloggin
;; This should create a new file with the next numerical value
;; and add some boilerplate

(defun blog-insert-meta ()
  (interactive)
  (insert "[[!meta  title=\"\"]]\n")
  (insert "[[!tag  ]]\n")
  (insert "\n")
)
</code></pre>

<p>The blog-insert-meta function just inserts the title and tag stub so I
remember to tag and add a title to my blog post.</p>

<pre><code>(defun blog-find-next ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((wiki-dir "~/www/wiki/blog/"))
    (find-file 
     (concat wiki-dir 
         (number-to-string (1+ (apply 'max (mapcar 'string-to-number 
         (mapcar '(lambda (a) (substring a 0 -5)) 
                     (directory-files wiki-dir nil "[0-9]*\\.mdwn" t))))))
         ".mdwn")))
)
</code></pre>

<p>The blog-find-next function finds all the numbered blog posts, and
opens a new emacs buffer with the next numbered file.</p>

<pre><code>(defun blog-next ()
  (interactive)
  (blog-find-next)
  (end-of-buffer)
  (blog-insert-meta)
)

;;
</code></pre>

<p>The blog-next function just puts these all together and gives it a
nice short name for me to run.</p>

<p>You can find more of my emacs shenanigans in my <a href="http://dev.codemac.net/config.git?p=config.git;a=tree;f=emacs.d;hb=HEAD">config repo</a>.</p>

	<title>The Switch to Ikiwiki</title>

	  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	  <p>This is the first post I have written with the new <a href="http://ikiwiki.info">ikiwiki</a>
backend, and I like it a lot.  Some of you may have known that I was
writing a git backended blog/wiki.  Well I gave up.  Not because it
wasn't going well, or anything of the sort, it was merely a design
choice.  I decided that it would be better to create a blog/wiki
generator.  Dynamically serving up each page used more computation
than just compiling and spitting out the pages once a week.  So, I
went the noble route and looked online at what other people have done
with the wiki generator idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://ikiwiki.info">Ikiwiki</a> was a complete and working solution that all ready
could use git as a backend for the wiki.  Why fight it?  So I migrated
my posts (which I was all ready storing in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>) to ikiwiki (which
uses <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>).  I haven't solved the problem of comments...  I
haven't ported them out of the old database yet, and I'm not sure if I
care.  There were plenty of decent comments, but none that really
changed anything in the article.  Though, I might place them on the
old posts?  I've also thought about incorporating <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a> into the
blog, but I haven't figured out how to do it in a way that I like
yet.  I enjoy the idea of outsourcing my comments, but I dislike the
idea of having to manually place the javascript into each blog page so
it only appears on them, and THEN figuring out a way to get the old
comments into disqus.</p>

<p>We'll see.  But I figure I should get this all online.  If you have
any comments or fixes, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:j@codemac.net">&#x6A;&#64;&#99;&#111;&#x64;e&#109;&#x61;c&#x2E;&#110;&#x65;&#116;</a>.</p>
