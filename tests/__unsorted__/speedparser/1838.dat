The typeface in question is based on a type design I&#8217;ve been working on for a while now and that has — in various forms — popped up in a few projects like <a href="http://www.hellomuller.com/blog/2011/01/20/the-coenfographic/" title="The Coenfographic" target="_blank">The Coenfographic</a> and <a href="http://hellomuller.com/work/2011/iron-man.html" title="The Invincible Iron Man." target="_blank">The Invincible Iron Man</a>. Time permitting, this might turn into another font.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.hellomuller.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dotnet.jpg" alt="netmag logo" title=".net Magazine logo" width="180" height="76" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2014" /></p>
<p>.Net Magazine is currently running an article on their site asking <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/perfect-web-design-app-and-why-it-doesn-t-exist" title="The perfect web design app article on .Net Magazine" target="_blank">if there is such a thing as a perfect web design app — and if there isn&#8217;t, why not</a>. Writer <a href="http://www.craiggrannell.com/" target="_blank">Craig Grannell</a> asked a few web design practitioners for their input, here&#8217;s what I had to say in regards to web design and typography:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Other designers pick up Pitman’s point about existing design tools from Adobe being rooted in a bygone age. Tom Muller, director of helloMuller Ltd is hugely into typography, which many web designers are finally waking up to. Web fonts now enable websites to include more than a tiny handful of ‘safe’ typefaces, but existing design apps turn type into a minefield. “There’s always that development hurdle — it looks good in Photoshop, but will it translate to code,” complains Muller. “With @font-face, Typekit, Fontdeck, Google Fonts and so on, we have far more flexibility when it comes to type, but there’s a barrier at the graphic design stage: while I can download a Google Font and use it in Photoshop, it’s still different from an in-browser render.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/perfect-web-design-app-and-why-it-doesn-t-exist" title=".net article" target="_blank">full article</a> raises a few interesting points, which — as always — primarily focus on the transfer between turning a flat design into a working model, and if we&#8217;re reaching a stage where some steps should be cut<br />
from the process as technology on one side (the development) is starting to outrun the other, design-focussed side.<br />
I&#8217;ve worked through phases in my career where at least 50% of text in my web designs were rendered as images, to avoiding non-system fonts at all costs and using tricks like Flash and sIFR to again try to approach<br />
a more interesting graphic language online, not mentioning using chunks of flash movies to embed headings and site navigations wholesale. Personally I&#8217;m excited to see the rise of web foundries, and juggernauts like Google advocating font embeds properly — even though I haven&#8217;t had the chance yet to implement this in my own work (more on than another time).</p>
<p>Of course, as I said in the .net article there is still a gap that needs to be filled between designing pixel-perfect screens in Adobe Photoshop and slicing images and writing the CSS for the text styles compensating for the differences. By and large we&#8217;re moving in the right direction, but it would be nice to see companies like Adobe take the hint and develop ways to integrate these new advances in the web design workflow. </p>
<p>And then, Adobe releases Muse and kicks us back 10 years. More on that later.</p>

<p>A little summer press update for you: The current issue of <a href="http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/blog/web-designer-185-preview/" title="Web Designer magazine" target="_blank">Web Designer (nº185)</a> focusses its Design Diary spotlight on the new website for <a href="http://www.wearesource.co.uk/" title="Source Recruitement" target="_blank">Source</a> which I designed whilst at <a href="http://www.studio-output.com/" title="Studio Output" target="_blank">Studio Output</a>. The article features comments and insight on the project from myself and SO&#8217;s Head of Digital Dave McDougall alongside the team from <a href="http://www.tobias.tv/" title="Tobias &#038; Tobias" target="_blank">Tobias &#038; Tobias</a> who were responsible for the UX and IA evaluation and testing.</p>
<p>Moving from the printed press to online — design magazine <a href="http://www.core77.com/" title="Core77" target="_blank">Core77</a> has published an <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/graphic_design/mulling_it_over_with_tom_muller_19755.asp" title="Core77 interview" target="_blank">interview with yours truly</a> where I mainly talk about how I ended up designing comics, a love for custom fonts and other nerdy stuff.</p>

<p>Recently I helped Extreme Music-Sony/ATV Music Publishing in the design concept stage for their Hype Music initiative with MTV and collaborated with <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/">Its Nice That</a> on the design of an identity suite for one of their clients  (which will hopefully see the light of day this summer). Aside from those jobs I&#8217;m still knee-deep in 3-4 other design projects locked behind cast-iron NDA agreements that are and have been shaping up to be really cool if I say so myself.<br />
More news on that probably around September.</p>
<p>The biggest news was dropped earlier this week <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/tom-muller-joins-conran-singh/3027135.article">on Design Week</a> as I have recently joined <a href="http://www.conransingh.com/">Conran Singh</a> where I&#8217;ll be contracting for the next 6 months or so on one of their accounts.<br />
Looks like its going to be a very busy summer!</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="http://www.hellomuller.com/blog/2011/05/11/european-sci-fi-comics/">my previous image-led entry showcasing some of my favourite classic (i.e. 70s &#038; 80s) Euro Sci-Fi comics</a>, I thought it was only logical to list, in no particular order, some of my favourite (Sci-Fi) film titles. I have consciously avoided the expected choices everyone usually recalls (Star Wars, Alien, Tron, Altered States… to name a few) and narrowed down the (obviously incomplete) selection to only the films — and titles — that have stayed with me (and gone on to, in some skewed way, inform my design tastes) since I first saw them.<br />
See if you can spot some of your favourites!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_1875" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 190px"><img src="http://www.hellomuller.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Carson-mag-cover-lg.jpg" alt="" title="Carson-mag" width="180" height="211" class="size-full wp-image-1875" /><p class="wp-caption-text">CARSON #1 cover</p></div> When it was announced last year that David Carson would launch a new magazine bearing his own name the design world took notice. This is after all the guy who — as<a href="http://magculture.com/blog/?p=10758"> Jeremy Leslie point out in his rather poignant review</a> — redefined what graphic design could be and do for a generation of designers of which I consider myself a part of.</p>
<p>While studying design in the mid-to-late 90s, there were two things that made a considerable impact on me and my work: Emigre Magazine and the work of Carson — insofar that I once copied the cover design concept of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cyclops-Albert-Watson/dp/0821221418">Cyclops</a> wholesale for one of my projects with horrible results (aside from being caught out). I grew out of my &#8216;Carson phase&#8217; by the time I graduated (but not before having both the End of Print and 2nd Sight signed by the man himself) but I have always kept a soft spot for his work, so the announcement of CARSON magazine didn&#8217;t pass me by. Thanks to a temporary offer giving people outside of the US the domestic shipping rates I subscribed to the announced 6 issue run.<br />
<span id="more-1873"></span><br />
Interestingly no one really knew what they were subscribing to… all we knew was that Carson was once again art directing a magazine regularly, and that — to me, having missed a lot of his early magazine work originally — too good to pass on. Just for the record, the editorial concept of the magazine played second fiddle to me — if it was covering flower arrangement I still would have bitten (and that would have been a interesting combination, but I digress). My fascination with it was (is?) purely a design interest and I was looking forward to something akin to Raygun 2.0 (his recent covers for both Little White Lies and Huck seemed promising).</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Twitter flickered alight with initial reviews from people who received the inaugural issue offering mixed reviews, often veering more towards the negative than the positive. Finally, last week my copy arrived and I could finally see what all the magazine was all about and if it lived up to its own hype.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t. Not to me at least. I&#8217;m not saying its a bad magazine, which it isn&#8217;t. It just feels underwhelming and middle of the road for something that shouts CARSON!. I largely enjoyed the articles — theme of the 1st issue is Survival— which, strangely enough were largely legible (they must&#8217;ve been interesting), but the design doesn&#8217;t make sense. I can see glimpses of the Carson I expected to encounter, yet those glimpses are rare, as the majority of the design feels like its done by someone who is going through the motions of &#8216;doing Carson&#8217;. I don&#8217;t feel that topical connection between the design and the editorial content. I miss the raw energy on the pages, that organic distortion that makes you look twice at an article. It also doesn&#8217;t help that the magazine is rife with advertisements (a necessary evil, I know) which blend in with the content (on purpose? or a sign that the design isn&#8217;t working?) and personally I believe the magazine would have benefitted from uncoated or matte paper. I don&#8217;t think it needs to be glossy to work effectively.</p>
<p>Then of course there is the recent spat on Facebook between Carson (the man) and Alex Storch (editor of the magazine) raising questions about Carson&#8217;s actual involvement with the magazine which only helps to fuel speculation around (and possibly explain) the quality of the magazine — or its all a clever bit of hype marketing.</p>
<p>As it stands, I&#8217;m a subscriber, so I&#8217;m in it for the duration. I doubt I would have bought the 2nd issue if I wasn&#8217;t.<br />
I probably would have flipped through it in the shop to be fair, but I&#8217;m hopeful it will get more interesting with subsequent issues.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its just dawned on me after having bought the fantastic <a href="http://www.humanoids.com/album/241">Weapons of the Metabaron</a> graphic novel from Humanoids Publishing that Science Fiction comics are still a rather fringe affair in the American comics landscape — that is if you&#8217;d factor out superheroes, which do fall into the grander SF schema. No, I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;classic&#8221; SF fare: time travel, space operas, robots, science adventurers and their ilk. The best example would be Humanoids themselves who seem like a bit player in the US market (publishing amazing books nonetheless), when they are the American counterpart of Les Humanoïdes Associés, the legendary French publisher responsible for unleashing Métal Hurlant into the world, giving us Moebius, Jodorowsky, Druillet, Bilal amongst other, influencing a generation of writers, artists and film makers in the process and birthing their equally influential Americanised Heavy Metal magazine. </p>
<p>Growing up in Belgium I was equally feeding off US superhero comics and reading Belgian, French, and other European SF comics which seemed (and still do) cater for all ages and are a large part of the European comics landscape.</p>
<p>All of which to lead you into a slightly arbitrary, and personal, cover selection of books I grew up reading in the 70s and 80s:<br />
