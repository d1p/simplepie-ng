			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I love Lego and so when I was contacted about hosting a giveaway I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>So this afternoon, because I am currently off work due to hurting my tailbone, I spent making the entire Lego Space City!</p>
<p>After three hours it was all finished, I think I had a few breaks in there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1100" title="Lego" src="http://early-childhood-resources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Lego-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="476" /></p>
<p>I must take my hat off to Lego because they have really great and simple instructions and even the bags are numbered in the bigger boxes. While I made the two smaller boxes in an hour the other two took an hour each.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like, because well I think you all should know, is that there is no door in the space shuttle. Okay, so maybe there isn&#8217;t meant to be one, but I was just a little concerned for Mr Lego Man. Oh and you simply must look at all the Lego men/woman&#8217;s faces. Some made me have serious giggles.</p>
<p>I know, enough about me blabbing on about how much fun I had this afternoon, you want to know about the giveaway!</p>
<p><strong>I have two Space City Lego packs to giveaway valued at $279.96 each. What do you get in your pack?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Satellite Launch Pad; Space Shuttle; Space Moon Buggy; and a Space Centre!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, four things all to yourself [or your children!]</p>
<p>Everything has an age range 5-12 years and there is super tiny things that babies can swallow so I would definitely stick with 5 years and up.</p>
<h2>How To Enter:</h2>
<h2>Leave a comment below [you must fill in your name and email address] and tell me, if you were going to the moon what would you take?</h2>
<p><strong>The Boring Bits:</strong></p>
<p>1. One entry per person.<br />
2. Entry is open to Australian residents only.<br />
3. The giveaway opens upon the publishing of this post and closes Friday 20th May at 9pm.<br />
4. Winners will be drawn using the Random Number Generator.<br />
5. Winners will need to reply to the email stating that they have won by Monday 23rd May at 9am or another winner will be drawn.<br />
5. Have fun and be creative!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Winners are #21 Sass and #3 Donna Webb! Congratulations! I am about to email you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Today during afternoon tea, one of the children was not drinking. Confused, because most days he will simply push the sipper cup away, without even taking a sip, the other carer and I wondered if he wasn&#8217;t used to drinking from <em><strong>that</strong></em> type of sipper sup.</p>
<p>Which then lead to me, grabbing my own sipper cup and modeling the behaviour.</p>
<p>For under threes, I find modeling a great teaching technique for showing children the type of behaviours that you would like to see.</p>
<p>Modeling can be used throughout everyday and often we do it without realising.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most recent behaviour that you modelled to a child?</strong></p>
<p>[If you are wanting to learn more about teaching techniques, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/bookshop/show/9781442502710" target="_blank">MacNaughton &amp; Williams</a> as a great professional development tool.]</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Within any setting, creating an observation system and record is always a great idea. If you are working within a prior to school setting, the regulations dictate how many observations need to be compiled each month, according to how many days they attend.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing specifically within prior to school settings these are the steps that I took to develop my observation record:</strong></p>
<p>Create a table format in Word or similar, using six columns and then as many rows as needed [depends on how many children you have to observe].</p>
<p>Once you have that then you can put the children&#8217;s names in the first column, and observations 1-4 across the next four columns. In the final column this can be a space for extra comments or observations. As not every child will need four observations, shade the extra columns for those that attend three days or less in a light grey [this will enable you to write over if you do happen to see and write an observation, but allows you to see how you are going with your tracking].</p>
<p>Then as you complete each observation, write the date in the box and then you have a record for each month.</p>
<p>If you have computer-based portfolio&#8217;s be sure to update them as soon as you write an observation, it is a lot easier then having to go back and check to see if you put that observation in yet.</p>
<p><strong>But who should you observe on what day?</strong></p>
<p>Well this is where you set up a monthly, fortnightly or weekly observation system. I set mine up as a monthly chart and have around two children per day to observe, which means that they are my focus children for that day however, it does not mean that if I don&#8217;t notice something else I wouldn&#8217;t note it down.</p>
<p>So for this I just created a five column table with either five rows [monthly], three rows [fortnightly] or two rows [weekly].</p>
<p>Along the top you write the headings as the days of the week. Then in the rows place the children&#8217;s names in. Be sure to make sure that the child attends on that day too!</p>
<p>It is a good idea to spread your observations for each child across the month, so if a child comes only one day per week, observe them two out of four weeks that they attend [e.g. week 2 and 4] which will space out the observation dates and give a holistic view of that child.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I am a fan of Australian author and illustrators, and Bruce Whatley is a big favourite of mine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://bau-images.tangentone.com.au/images/bau/97808109/9780810993648/180/0/plain/clinton-gregorys-secret.jpg" alt="Clinton Gregory's Secret'" width="180" /></p>
<p>Clinton Gregory&#8217;s Secret is a book about a little boy who has a secret. Actually, he has several secrets. The picture book then goes and shares his secrets. At the end of the book, we see Clinton Gregory asleep and it links to the new secrets, of next week.</p>
<p>The picture book has amazing visual aesthetics with each page drawing the reader and audience further into Clinton Gregory&#8217;s world. The language is sophisticated, yet, simple. Once the humour is added, then the children are left in awe of the text.</p>
<p>When reading a picture book, there are always ways in which the text can be then used again to further develop a skill or area of learning. It is never just about English, rather it can often extend into Mathematics, Science, Physical Development and Education, Creative Arts, Language, and Technology.</p>
<p>Using Clinton Gregory&#8217;s Secret, the following areas can be explored:</p>
<p><strong>English</strong><br />
Furthering the text, asking the children to continue the story, what happened next?<br />
Having the students share a secret or a made up secret, and detailing the secret.<br />
Looking at the text for sight words.<br />
Exploring words that haven&#8217;t been introduced into the vocabulary.<br />
Exploring other texts written by Bruce Whatley.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong><br />
Sequencing the days of the week.<br />
Specifically looking at what happened on each day of the week.<br />
Estimating what could happen in the next week.<br />
Counting how many people/animals Clinton Gregory meets.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Development/Health/Physical Education + HSIE</strong><br />
Discussing secrets.<br />
Discussing friendships, and what makes a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Arts</strong><br />
Developing music to be played with each secret.<br />
Recreating their own secrets using a variety of materials.<br />
Acting out the picture book.</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong><br />
Looking up certain words in a different language.</p>
<p><strong>Science and Technology</strong><br />
Exploring dinosaurs.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways that Clinton Gregory&#8217;s Secret can be used and explored.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Games are a fun way to play with the children on a level where you too can be an active participant. These games don&#8217;t require any props so can be played on short notice.</p>
<p><strong>Hide and seek</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the age group will depend on what you are counting too. Generally it is between ten and twenty. During this time, the other children hide. When the child has finished counting they call out, &#8220;Ready or not! Here I come!&#8221; and goes off in search of the other children. The first person found is the next person to count in the next round.</p>
<p>This is a fun game that can be played with three year olds and up, generally when playing with three year olds, I have hidden with them {in a nannying context rather than long day care setting}. To make it more interesting for the older children, by playing in the dark and using torches is a great modification! I have played this with children from around five, however again this was in a nannying context and was with the youngest child throughout.</p>
<p><strong>On the River, On the Bank</strong></p>
<p>Using chalk/rope/string/tape/etc to mark a line down the carpet and have the children stand on one side of the line. If they are standing closest to you {in front of the line} that is the bank, if they are standing over the line {further away from you} that is the river. You then call out, ‘On the river’ or ‘On the bank’ and the children jump back and forth. This can be played with children four years and up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Port and Starboard</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>One player is the captain, the other children follow the captain’s orders {the children can get “out” if they miss an order but this is optional}.<br />
The Orders are -</p>
<p>:  <em>To the ship:</em> run to the captain&#8217;s right<br />
:  <em>To the island:</em> run to the captain&#8217;s left<br />
:  <em>Hit the deck:</em> lay down on your stomach (or if players don&#8217;t want to get dirty, they can crouch down)<br />
:  <em>Attention on deck:</em> salute and yell, &#8220;Aye, aye captain!&#8221; – must stay in that position until captain yells, &#8220;At ease!&#8221; (ie even if the captain gives a different order such as &#8220;to the ship&#8221; the crew must continue to remain at attention until told &#8220;at ease&#8221;)<br />
:  <em>Scrub the deck:</em> everyone on their knees scrubbing<br />
:  <em>Captain&#8217;s Quarters:</em> everyone ran towards the captain.<br />
:  <em>Sick turtle:</em> Everyone falls onto their backs and waves hands and feet in the air.<br />
:  <em>Bow:</em> Run to the front of the boat<br />
:  <em>Stern:</em> Run to the back<br />
:  <em>Port:</em> Run to the left side of the boat<br />
:  <em>Starboard:</em> Run to the right side of the boat.</p>
<p>When playing this game, depending on the ages of your children will significantly depend on the number of orders you have. Also, keep in mind if this game is played over a period of time, the orders will become easier to remember. {There are a lot more orders but are mainly for large groups}. The game can be played inside the house or out in the backyard.</p>
<p>If playing with children of four years, keep instructions simple using four key orders and slowly building up depending on age group and setting.</p>
<p><strong>Statues/Freeze</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The children dance to the music whilst it is playing and when the music stops, they freeze. Children from four years or even younger can enjoy this game, but the concept of stopping and &#8220;freezing&#8221; may still need a little more practice.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>We’re Going on a Bear Hunt</strong></p>
<p>Re-enacting this favourite will be a great way to spend the afternoon. Use the story and walk around with your children through the grass and the mud {pretend} and make it a fun experience. You could also make props using large cardboard and keep so that it can be used repeatedly. Once finished the children could then draw what they saw on their walk.</p>
<p>Something fun for children of all ages, but around three would be a good age to introduce and could easily be down with a mixed age group.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When with a group of new students, one quick and easy way to learn children&#8217;s names is to sing this song:</p>
<blockquote><p>{Teacher} &#8220;Bee, bee bumble bee. Can you sing your name for me?&#8221;<br />
{Child} &#8220;My name is ______.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have a prop of a bee the children pass this around the group once they have sung their name.</p>
<p>I was taught this song during a music based unit, something which I don&#8217;t find myself too talented in, and we learnt and discussed the need to give the children the pitch and tone that they should too be singing in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bee, Bee Bumble Bee&#8221; is quite a high pitched song with a slow tempo.</p>
<h2>Do you have any songs that you use to learn children&#8217;s names?</h2>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Water play is one of the best activities that can be set up in the summer time. Whether you are filling a tub with water or playing with the hose, it is not only a lot of fun but it creates some comfort to our hot summers.</p>
<p><a href="http://early-childhood-resources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1078" title="-1" src="http://early-childhood-resources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/1.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to add extra items to water play, to change the dynamic of the play, such as:</p>
<p>: Adding a range of different sized containers that can be filled and refilled<br />
: Adding objects that will sink or float<br />
: Adding food colouring to make the water a different colour<br />
: Using water coloured pencils for drawing and then splashing water onto that drawing and watching what happens<br />
: Making boats from different materials to see which will float the best</p>
<h2>What is something that you have used to extend water play?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to remember about water play is to stay safe and always supervise the children. Any amount of water can be deadly to a child. Also, please remember to Slip, Slop, Slap {even if it looks overcast}!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">February 3rd is the start of the new Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>In China this is a huge celebration and lasts for fifteen days until the moon gets its brightest.</p>
<p>Red is the colour to be wearing, painting doors or windows in and carrying around. Red symbolises gladness and is used to ward of wicked spirits and omens from homes, and is usually accompanied by the colour gold which symbolises prosperity and good faith.</p>
<p>During the colorful celebrations, people wear masks made up of varied materials including cloth,  paper, grass, leather, metal, shell, and carved of stone or wood painted  with Chinese symbolic designs and vivid colours. Some have realistic  human or animal appearance.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I have only done Valentine&#8217;s Day art once. Back in 2008 when I was the room leader of the birth-15 month room, this was the art that we created.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rationale</span><br />
For the children to explore their senses and creative abilities whilst creating Valentine&#8217;s Day art.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Materials Needed</span><br />
:: Red/pink paper/cardboard<br />
:: White paint<br />
:: Permanent marker</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Experience</span><br />
Having the paint in little trays where the children can put their hands into the paint and then onto the paper. You can make a shape of a love heart {by doing two hand prints, with the palms touching/crossing over} or just let the children create what they would like*. You then can either trace around the heart or just write a simple &#8216;Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8217; on the back or over the handprints.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Prior Knowledge</span><br />
None.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Age Group</span><br />
All ages &#8211; this specifically was done with younger children birth-3years of age. Though could be done with older children.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Links to Early Years Learning Framework</span><br />
Outcomes One and Four.</p>
<p>* I done one of each when working, so that the children were able to express themselves but to meet standards that the director wanted I also had a &#8216;pretty&#8217; one. I must stress though, never force a child to do anything. Ever.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>As most of you know the floods in Queensland were devastating. Not only was Queensland in a disaster situation, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia were too. Even if one of them was the result of people.</p>
<p><a href="http://mezhead-dayslikethese.blogspot.com/">Merrill</a>, one of the girls that writes for the other blog that I created, <a href="http://weheartlife.com/">We Heart Life</a>, has decided to give something to the children in Queensland that are in need.</p>
<p>Being a primary school teacher also, I cannot agree more. Shopping for school supplies will definitely be the last thing on these parents minds.</p>
<p>If you would like to help out by heading out and shopping for school supplies, think books, pencils and the like, please let Merrill know! Even if it is just a couple of dollars that you can spare you will be helping those in need.</p>
<p>Visit Merrill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Its-Days-Like-These/139785702699113">Facebook page</a> {and then find the information for the Mez&#8217;s Queensland &#8220;Back to School&#8221; Flood Appeal event} for further information.</p>
