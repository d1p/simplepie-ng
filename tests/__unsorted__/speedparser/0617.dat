Interview: Schweitzer’s plan to bring Canadian health care to Montana
]]></title>

</p>
<i>Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer is no stranger to aggressive, and controversial, attempts at health reform. In 1999, he began chartering much-publicized buses to Canada, where seniors could fill prescriptions at lower costs. He’s asked for permission to create a Medicaid drug prescription program for all his citizens (Health and Human Services said no.) and to import medications from Canada.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In advance of health reform, Schweitzer has a new idea: build a statewide, universal health-care system, modeled after that of Saskatchewan, the Canadian province just north of Montana.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We spoke this morning about his new plan to build a public option out of Montana’s Medicaid program, what federal waivers he would need to do so and why, like many of his Republican counterparts, he’s looking for something like block grant funding. What follows is a transcript, lightly edited for content and length.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Sarah Kliff: Give me a bit of a history of what you’re trying to do here – what have you been working on?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Gov. Brian Schweitzer: </b>I’ve spent a great deal of time studying a lot of different countries’ health-care systems. This time around, I’m looking at a system straight north of us. In Saskatchewan, they have had universal health care since 1946, 20 years before the rest of Canada. We’re pretty similar: Montana has 990,000 residents and Saskatchewan has just over 1 million. They’re 10 percent Indian, we’re 7 percent. Their average age is just two months different than ours. But they have a health-care system where they have two years longer and have lower infant mortality rates.</p>
<p>I called up Brad Wall, the conservative premier of Saskatchewan and asked him, “Would you help me work through all your numbers, so I can compare that with our system?” I looked at what they spent and what we do. They have a slightly larger population and for every man, child and woman in their health-care system, the cost is about $4 billion. Remember, they live two years longer and have a lower infant mortality rate. In Montana, it’s about $8 billion.</p>
<p>Imagine if you went to a gas station, and you looked over at a car with a Canadian license plate. They were paying $1 a gallon for gas, and you’re paying $2. Wouldn’t that make you mad? That’s exactly what’s happening. I’m mad for all the people in the country.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: How’d that influence what you want to do in Montana?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BS: </b>We know that, because of the Affordable Care Act, Montana’s Medicaid population will double. So we’re saying, let us set up clinics across Montana like they have is Saskatchewan, for Medicaid, where we will have family practitioners, nurse practioners, taking care of patients. That will have about 20 percent of the state’s population in the pool. We’ll also add in all state employees, that’s another 60,000. Then, we’ll turn to private citizens and ask, do you want to buy into this? We’ll turn to small businesses and large ones, and ask them, too.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: What you’re describing sounds like a public option for Montana, which builds off of your Medicaid program.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BS:</b> This would be a hybrid of systems we have right now, serving Medicaid patients, state employees, university employees, the people who are currently Montana employees, we’ll start with that. If somebody else wants to get in, to deliver health care, too, we’ll be accommodating. Every patient would come in and pay a co-pay and the clinics would be staffed primarily by people who worked for the Montana Medicaid program.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: What kind of waivers do you need from the federal government to do this?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BS:</b> The waiver we’d need is Medicaid-related. It would allow us to deliver health care through community health-care clinics as opposed to contracting for specific services, with all kinds of clinics large and small across the state. We’re simply saying that we here in Montana are adults, we have a budget surplus, weren’t good at negotiating and not buying things we don’t need.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: Have you looked at other states in pursuing this kind of health reform? I know Vermont is working on a single-payer system that could be somewhat similar to what you’re doing.</b>
</p>
<p>BS: Yes, I definitely looked at Vermont, other states. Most of the Republican governors have either asked or plan to ask for a block grant, which is kind of what I’m talking about here. Send me the money and I’ll take responsibility for my Medicaid population. Don’t be my partner anymore.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: What about the health reform law? Will you need any waivers from that?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BS:</b> We’ll see what Health and Human Services says about that. They’re the judge and the jury. What I’m trying to do is claim jump it, not going to wait and see it drive our state into bankruptcy. The thing they say in Washington — other than it’s too hot, or I’m working too hard — is that they believe the states are the laboratories of democracy. We’re giving them an opportunity to do what they say, and let us be that laboratory.</p>
<p>
<b>SK: What kind of reception are you expecting from Health and Human Services? I know they’ve turned down some of your previous waiver requests.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BS:</b> Since we’re proposing to save citizens money, you’d expect some kind of chorus and music, maybe a presentation with some plaques and flowers. That’s what you’d expect. But in my experience, that’s not what you get.</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

‘You’re creating a vision of the sort of society you want to have in miniature.’
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>
<i>David Graeber is an anthropologist at Goldsmiths, University of London, and author of ‘Direct Action: An Ethnography.’ He was also one of the initial organizers of the ‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests. And he thinks the people asking for a list of demands are missing the point of the movement quite dramatically. We spoke this morning by phone.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Ezra Klein: So when did your involvement with these protests begin?</b>
</p>
<p>David Graeber: July 2nd. That was the first actual meeting. What happened was AdBusters put out <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet">this call </a>for these protests. We had heard there was supposed to be a general assembly on July 2nd. So I just showed up. But it was a rally, not an assembly. Some Marxist groups had set up stages and megaphones and was making speeches and were planning a march. So we said we don’t need to do this. We pulled a small group together and decided to have a real assembly.</p>
<p>So we wandered over to another part of the area and began a meeting and people kept migrating over. But we had a problem because we only had six weeks. AdBusters had already advertised the date to 80,000 people. And their date was a Saturday. You can’t really shut down Wall Street on a Saturday. So we were working under some significant constraints. We assembled 80 or 100 people and formed working groups for outreach, process, so forth and so on. And we began meeting every week. </p>
<p>One thing that helped a lot was a smattering of people from Spain and Greece and Tunisia who had been doing this sort of thing more recently. They explained that the model that seemed to work was to take something that seemed to be public space, reclaim it, and build up an organization headquarters around that from which you can begin doing other things. </p>
<p>
<b>EK: This movement is organized rather differently than most protest movements. There isn’t really a list of demands, or goals, or even much of an identifiable leadership. But if I understand you correctly, that’s sort of the point.</b>
</p>
<p>DG: It’s very similar to the globalization movement. You see the same criticisms in the press. It’s a bunch of kids who don’t know economics and only know what they’re against. But there’s a reason for that. it’s pre-figurative, so to speak. You’re creating a vision of the sort of society you want to have in miniature. And it’s a way of juxtaposing yourself against these powerful, undemocratic forces you’re protesting. If you make demands, you’re saying, in a way, that you’re asking the people in power and the existing institutions to do something different. And one reason people have been hesitant to do that is they see these institutions as the problem. </p>
<p>
<b>EK: So if you say, for instance, that you want a tax on Wall Street and then you’ll be happy, you’re implicitly saying that you’re willing to be happy with a slightly modified version of the current system.</b>
</p>
<p>DG: Right. The tax on Wall Street will go to people controlled by Wall Street.</p>
<p>
<b>EK: By which you mean government.</b>
</p>
<p>DG: Yes. So we are keeping it open-ended. In a way, what we want is to create spaces where people can think about questions like that. In New York, according to law, any unpermitted assembly of more than 12 people is illegal in New York. Space itself is not an openly available resource. But the one resource that isn’t scarce is smart people with ideas. So we’re trying to reframe things away from the rhetoric of demands to a questions of visons and solutions. Now how that translates into actual social change is an interesting question. One way this has been done elsewhere is you have local initiatives that come out of the local assemblies. </p>
<p>
<b>EK: It also seems that the tradeoff here, from an organizational standpoint, is that if you say you want, say, a tax on Wall Street, then the people who aren’t interested in a tax on Wall Street stay home. So remaining vague on demands can make the tent bigger. But it also seems that, at some point, people are going to need to be working towards concrete goals and experiencing dicrete successes in order to sustain the energy of a movement like this.</b>
</p>
<p>GB: As the thing grows, new organizational forms will develop. At this point, the New York occupation has 30 different working groups for everything from handling sanitation to discussing labor issues and tax policy. So we’re trying to set up ways that people with different interests can plug into the movement. There’s even a newspaper. The ‘Occupied Wall Street Journal.’ Of course, this is nothing compared to what happened in Tahrir Square, where they even had dry cleaners. </p>
<p>
<b>EK: We’re also beginning to see “Occupy Wall Street” link up with with more traditional activist groups. Some members of the protest were speaking via videofeed at today’s big confab of liberal groups in Washington. MoveOn.org and organized labor are planning a march in support of the occupiers for Wednesday. How does that change what is, for now, a very decentralized movement?</b>
</p>
<p>DG: It is organically happening but there are definite problems that occur. We found this back in the days of the globalization movement. Unions were very supportive and provided resources but they’re very different organizations. The real difficulty is how to work with people who are top-down and have a funding base, as it means there are things they can say in public and things they can’t, and groups where people can say whatever they want and the whole idea is to be decentralized. One problem I’ve already heard of is that people are coming in and changing the tenor of the general assemblies to speeches, and that’s not really what it’s supposed to be about. So you have to balance the aspect where you’re trying to show what direct democracy could be like and the effort to link up with groups that have a form of organization we’ve rejected. </p>
<p>
<b>EK: The name of the group is “Occupy Wall Street,” but from what I can tell by listening to interviews with the protesters and reading messages at ‘<a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">We are the 99</a>,’ it’s not just about Wall Street, it’s about the powerful in general, which include politicians and wealthy folks who don’t make their money in finance, and beyond that, it’s really about the less-powerful. The real running theme I’m hearing is hopelessness: that we did everything right and played by the rules and went to school or got a job and now we’re buried in debt and can’t make ends meet, while these folks at the top of the economy seem to just keep prospering and prospering.</b>
</p>
<p>DG: Right, and Wall Street is just a beautiful illustration of that. Here we have these guys who were just greedy crooks, who crashed the global economy and did terrible things to the lives of people all over the world. None of them have paid at all. There was a debate about whether their bonuses should be lowered. On the other hand, if people point out to vigorously that this has happened, they do get arrested. And that helps to point out the essential double standard of the system. </p>

‘Occupy Wall Street’ gains institutional cheerleaders
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>A live feed from “Occupy Wall Street” was played at the opening of a major annual gathering of liberal groups in Washington, as progressive organizers try to build on the protests’ momentum. “They set an example of all of us, of discipline, of non-violence…in the heart of the belly of the beast,” said Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America’s Future, which organized the conference. “We are going to keep building here, over the next three days—we’re going to build plans for the next 18 months.”</p>
<p>
<p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/10/01/National-Enterprise/Images/127824102.jpg?uuid=CW48bux9EeCovo1iItaECw"/>
</p>With attendees from Washington’s major progressive institutions — from MoveOn.org and labor unions to the Center for American Progress and members of the House Progressive Caucus — the CAF conference had already been planned a Wednesday march on Capitol Hill to advocate for “jobs not cuts.” Now the conference’s progressive leaders are urging them to support a D.C. offshoot of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/occupy-wall-street-a-primer/2011/08/25/gIQAbX7oHL_blog.html">Occupy Wall Street</a>,” which converged Sunday at McPherson Square. On <a href="http://www.occupytogether.org/events/northeast/district-of-columbia/untitled-event-1/">Thursday</a>, they’ll protest the role of corporate money in politics. “Occupy K Street is starting. It’s from Wall Street to K Street,” says Liz Butler, campaign director for climate advocacy group 1Sky. “To send the same message to corporate lobbyists that’s being sent to Congress and Wall Street. It’s a beautiful moment of convergence — versus Wall Street, versus cuts, for our future.”</p>
<p>But exactly how these long-standing progressive groups will relate to “Occupy Wall Street is still unclear. Local union affiliates have <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20111002/ECONOMY/310029971">joined</a> the New York protesters and contributed food to the encamped participants, but the movement has yet to converge upon the kind of agenda that established groups have been pushing for. In fact, the CAF conference will be organizing a lunch Tuesday to discuss the best way to support the expanding protests — and, perhaps, to link their own organizing efforts with the burgeoning movement. You can watch a live feed of the three-day conference <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/">here</a>.</p>

How Yelp is killing chain restaurants
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p/>
<p>Michael Luca of Harvard Business School has a <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-016.pdf">new paper</a> studying the effects of Yelp.com on the restaurant industry. Three big findings: First, “a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue.” No surprise, good reviews help restaurants. Second, this mainly affects smaller, independent establishments. A Yelp review has no effect on an individual chain restaurant like Applebee’s, presumably because people already have firm impressions of those places. </p>
<p>
<p>

</p>However, looking more broadly, chain restaurants <i>as a whole</i> seem to have declined in market share as Yelp has grown in prominence. “This suggests,” Luca writes, “that online consumer reviews substitute for more traditional forms of reputation.” In 2007, about 50 percent of all restaurant spending, some $125 billion per year, went to chain restaurants. Chains have always benefited from uniformity: No matter where you go, you always know what you’ll get at an Applebee’s or a McDonald’s. Independent restaurants, by contrast, are more of a gamble. But as online review sites like Yelp expand, that’s no longer the case.</p>

‘Occupy Wall Street,’ a primer

</p>Wonkbook today was about ‘Occupy Wall Street,’ the growing, decentralized protest movement that’s clashing with police in New York City, spreading across the country, and grabbing headlines across the world. It is also, somewhat unusually, a protest movement without clear demands, an identifiable leadership, or an evident organizational structure. </p>
<p>Decisions are made by the NYC General Assembly, which Nathan Schneider describes as “a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought,” and thus far, the General Assembly has decided against yoking the movement to a particular set of goals, or even a particular ideology. </p>
<p>Which is all to say that it’s important to try and understand the movement on its own terms, rather than the terms most of us are used to.  Here are five places to start:</p>
<p>- The official -- or perhaps just mostly official -- ‘<a href="http://occupywallst.org/">Occupy Wall Street blog</a>’, and in particular, the blog’s <a href="http://occupywallst.org/forum/">forums</a>. Here, for instance, is the movement’s ‘<a href="http://occupywallst.org/forum/first-official-release-from-occupy-wall-street/">Declaration of the Occupation of New York City</a>.’ </p>
<p>- The moving ‘<a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">We are the 99</a>’ tumblr.</p>
<p>- Nathan Schneider’s ‘<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/163719/occupy-wall-street-faq">Occupy Wall Street FAQ</a>’. I’d perhaps recommend this as the single best place to start.</p>
<p>- ‘<a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/understanding-the-theory-behind-the-different-approach-of-the-occupy-wall-street-protests/">Understanding the theory behind Occupy Wall Street’s approach</a>,’ by Mike Konczal. A deep dive into the theoretical underpinnings of the protest movement’s tactics and organization. Also see his post, ‘<a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/fifteen-definitions-of-freedom-from-occupywallstreet/">15 definitions of freedom from Occupy Wall Street,</a>’ which records the answers 15 protestors gave when Konczal asked them to define “freedom.”</p>
<p>- ‘<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/matt-stoller-occupywallstreet-is-a-church-of-dissent-not-a-protest.html">Occupy Wall Street is a church of dissent, not a protest</a>,’ by Matt Stoller.</p>
<p>- A nicely produced video interviewing a number of protesters:</p>

<p>- Greg Mitchell’s <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/163752/blogging-occupy-usa-monday-protests-spread">OccupyUSA</a> blog is essentially liveblogging the protest movement.</p>
<p>If you know of more worthwhile links for people looking to better understand these protests, leave them in comments. I’ll update the post with the best of them as time allows. If you’re a member of the movement, I’d be interested in hearing from you in the comments. </p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Lessons from 1931: How to dodge a European bank collapse #Euromess
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>A bit of comforting context for Europe’s financial meltdown: We’ve kind of survived this before.</p>
<p>In 1931, things looked just as grim across the Atlantic as they do now. Financial crises plagued Europe. Things got so bad that Germany was forced to shut down its banking system for two days that summer, July 14 and 15, after a July 13 run on the banks. Foreign deposits in the New York banks already exceeded $700 million, so there was cause for concern in the United States, too.</p>
<p>But despite all that, key American financial institutions actually survived the German storm pretty much unscathed. A <a href="http://nber.org/papers/w17437">new paper</a> from economists Gary Richardson and Patrick Van Horn argues that New York banks, the key connection between American and European financial systems back them, managed to survive the 1931 collapse of the German banking system with little contagion, or ripple effect, across the Atlantic. It had everything to do with confidence. “New York reacted little, if at all, to the financial crisis in Europe,” they write. “New York’s leading bankers deliberately and collectively decided on a business-as-usual policy in order to minimize the impact of the financial crisis.”</p>
<p>Among many other documents, Richardson and Van Horn dug up records of a July 15, 1931, meeting of 11 New York bank presidents, right when the German banking system was in meltdown. “The bankers agreed to honor all checks and cable orders to the extent of available credit limits,” they write. “They also agreed to maintain acceptance lines and accept new bills within existing lines. Finally, they agreed to maintain all advances to, and loans for, German banks.” It apparently worked: Despite heavy media coverage of the German financial crisis, there was no run on the banks.</p>
<p>To be sure, 1931 was a time of great financial turmoil, with banking crises in both the spring and fall of that year. Other international events, like Great Britain’s <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html">abandoning</a> the gold standard or the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_18/b4226012481756.htm">failure</a> of a major Austrian bank, Credit-Anstalt, probably did affect the United States. But the point of the Richardson and Van Horn’s paper is that Germany’s financial crisis, in the summer of 1931, wasn’t one of them. One key chart they include, which maps banks’ percent change in cash in the months surrounding Germany’s meltdown, shows no relationship:</p>

</p>
</p>
<p>How well, or whether, that could work today is unclear: Our financial markets are much more correlated and intertwined with Europe’s than they were nearly a century ago. But the crucial role that confidence can play still echoes today. “Fear is a very powerful fundamental,” Stephen Wietling, an economist who oversees European markets for Citigroup, told me in a recent interview. “A lot of this has to with how confident we are.” Or as PIMCO’s Scott Mather told my colleague Suzy Khimm, “The direct financial linkages are pretty small time, we haven’t extended that much credit to European banks. It’s mainly through financial confidence and through multinationals — the extent they lose confidence.” Both now and then, confidence can play a key role in how financial instability finds its way across the Atlantic.</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Wonkbook: What does 'Occupy Wall Street' want?
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>Two weeks ago, I was walking through New York when I stumbled on a crowd chanting angrily at a mass of police. "They're arresting them," someone said to me. "Who?" I asked. "The Occupy Wall Streeters," he said. Someone else held up a cell phone camera. "The whole world is watching," he shouted.</p>
<p>
<p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/blogpost/201109/Images/um3.JPG?uuid=Gi3POOhAEeCKBcEOwQfcZg"/>
</p>It didn't seem that the whole world was watching, at least not then. The next day, I tried to contact the protest's organizers for an interview, but it didn't come together. An effort to look up their demands online didn't yield much. I figured the protests would fizzle. Instead, they're gaining strength. Almost 1,000 protesters were arrested this weekend on the Brooklyn Bridge, and sympathy protests are spreading to cities all across the country. Occupy Wall Street is leading papers and news shows. The whole world, or at least the whole country, actually is watching.</p>
<p>The protesters are also gaining institutional support. MoveOn.org is sending e-mails about "an amazing wave of protest against Wall Street and the big banks has erupted across the country." They're planning to join with organized labor to march to the Occupy Wall Street site on Wednesday. A live videofeed from the protests will kick off the liberal Campaign for America's Future annual conference, and Van Jones's 'Rebuild the Dream' coalition is staging a "virtual march." </p>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street protests are explicitly inspired by, and modeled on, the Tahrir Square protests in Egypt. And though that's a tough act to follow, it's clear the Occupy Wall Street protests are catching a fire all their own. The question now is what they do with it. The jockeying has already begun to suggest an agenda to the protesters -- see these proposals by <a href="http://www.good.is/post/three-concrete-demands-to-hold-wall-street-accountable/">Mike Konczal</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-the-bankers-and-the-revolutionaries.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">Nick Kristof</a> -- and, in the embrace of the activist left, to join the protesters to an agenda that already exists, much as happened with the Tea Party and the conservative movement.</p>
<p>We'll see, over the next few weeks, which, if any of these paths, tempt the protesters. Up until now, the organizers have seemed to view the decentralized, inchoate nature of the protests as a strength for the nascent movement, not a weakness. The unifying idea has been drawing attention to "<a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">the 99</a>," not offering a concrete policy agenda. The New York Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/police-arresting-protesters-on-brooklyn-bridge/?ref=occupywallstreet">quoted</a> a a pep talk a woman gave to a new protester. “It doesn’t matter what you’re protesting,” she said. “Just protest.”</p>

<strong>1) The "Occupy Wall Street" protests are escalating, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d8fe1c18-ed15-11e0-be97-00144feab49a.html">reports</a> Robin Harding:</strong> "A controversy erupted on Sunday over the policing of <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/72583196-ece4-11e0-be97-00144feab49a.html">anti-Wall Street protests</a> in which the New York police arrested over 700 people. Police said that they made the arrests on Saturday afternoon after demonstrators ignored warnings and entered the roadway of Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. But protesters claimed that police had entrapped them by leading them on to the vehicle section of the bridge. The arrests have drawn worldwide attention to Occupy Wall Street, an inchoate protest movement modelled on the Tahrir Square demonstrations in Egypt this spring, which has been building up in downtown New York since September 17...The movement is fuelled by continuing anger at the profitability of Wall Street following government bail-outs in 2008 and 2009...But the goals of the demonstrations are vague."</p>
<p>
<strong>2) Republicans are telling allies not to expect a big supercommittee deal, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/64953.html">report</a> Manu Raju and John Bresnahan:</strong> "A month into the supercommittee’s term, Senate Republicans are telling K Street that they don’t believe the powerful deficit-cutting panel can reach a 'grand bargain' agreement, sources familiar with the negotiations say. In a closed-door meeting with Republican lobbyists late last week, senior policy advisers representing both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his chief deputy, Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who sits on the special deficit panel, said the issue of tax increases may be an insurmountable obstacle in the secretive talks. The two top Senate Republicans don’t think such a grand bargain style plan...could succeed because all of the existing proposals contain tax increases they consider 'significant' and are, therefore, politically untenable, officials say."</p>
<p>
<strong>3) The US recovery depends on what happens in Europe, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-economic-recovery-tied-to-european-debt-crisis/2011/09/29/gIQAAIAEBL_story.html?wprss=rss_business">reports</a> Neil Irwin:</strong> "The political intrigues in Brussels and Berlin over Europe’s debt crisis are as foreign to most Americans as the languages spoken there. U.S. exports to Europe don’t even amount to a fiftieth of what Americans produce. And American banks have at best a modest toehold in the European countries facing possible default. But the waves of anxiety caused by the European debt crisis are taking a significant toll on the United States -- not just palpitations in financial markets but darkening prospects for the broader U.S. economy. That’s because developments in Europe, like never before, are influencing the judgments of key decision-makers in the U.S. economy: executives deciding whether to add workers or build a new plant, investors deciding where to place their money, even consumers deciding whether to take the plunge on a new house or car."</p>
<p>
<strong>4) This year's Supreme Court docket is full of big cases, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-term-will-include-cases-highlighting-extent-of-federal-power/2011/09/29/gIQA3lbXDL_story.html?hpid=z2">reports</a> Robert Barnes:</strong> "The Supreme Court convenes Monday for what could be the most significant term of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/29/AR2005092900859.html">Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s six-year tenure</a>, with an agenda that both reflects the nation’s political landscape and offers the potential to reshape it. The dominant theme is the one that has divided the country and fueled the debate between tea party Republicans and President Obama since the 2010 election: the extent of the federal government’s power. The justices are being asked to decide the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-dept-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law/2011/09/28/gIQAjCPK5K_story.html">constitutionality of the landmark health-care act</a>, the ability of states to enforce strict immigration laws and whether the government can continue to monitor the airwaves for indecency. The court could also reopen the question of affirmative action in college admissions, rule on the rights of gay adoptive parents and decide whether the blindingly fast pace of modern technology has reshaped Americans’ notion of privacy."</p>
<p>
<strong>5) Obama is  submitting a number of trade deals for final passage this week, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203791904576607112452634524.html">reports</a> Elizabeth Williamson:</strong> "President Barack Obama could send trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress for approval early this week, setting the stage for final passage of the agreements in mid-October after five years of political combat. Together, the pacts could boost U.S. exports by $13 billion annually--the Korea pact alone is worth $11 billion--though there would also be more imports and a wider array of foreign services available in the U.S. All three deals are expected to benefit U.S. agriculture by lifting or reducing tariffs on exports of U.S. commodities, machinery and chemicals, even as they present new challenges to the U.S. textile, electronics and floral industries. The U.S.-Korea agreement will double U.S. farm exports to Korea, to $3.8 billion annually...the U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated."</p>

</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1) The Senate's anti-China trade bill will do some good, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/opinion/holding-china-to-account.html">writes</a> Paul Krugman:</strong> "To be fair, there are some arguments against action on China that would carry some weight if the times were different. One is the undoubted fact that inflation in China, which is raising labor costs in particular, is gradually eliminating that nation’s currency undervaluation. The operative word, however, is 'gradually': something that brings the United States trade deficit down over four or five years isn’t good enough when unemployment is at disastrous levels right now. And the reality of the unemployment disaster is also my answer to those who warn that getting tough with China might unleash a trade war or damage world commercial diplomacy. Those are real risks, although I think they’re exaggerated. But they need to be set against the fact -- not the mere possibility -- that high unemployment is inflicting tremendous cumulative damage as we speak."</p>
<p>
<strong>2) "Occupy Wall Street" needs more specific demands; here are some suggestions, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-the-bankers-and-the-revolutionaries.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">writes</a> Nick Kristof:</strong> "Impose a financial transactions tax. This would be a modest tax on financial trades, modeled on the suggestions of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/13/business/james-tobin-nobel-laureate-in-economics-and-an-adviser-to-kennedy-is-dead-at-84.html">James Tobin</a>, an American economist who won a Nobel Prize. The aim is in part to dampen speculative trading that creates dangerous volatility. <a href="http://www.financialtransactiontax.eu/">Europe is moving toward a financial transactions tax</a>, but the Obama administration is resisting -- a reflection of its deference to Wall Street. Close the '<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/opinion/07kristof.html">carried interest</a>' and 'founders’ stock' loopholes, which may be the most unconscionable tax breaks in America. They allow our wealthiest citizens to pay very low tax rates by pretending that their labor compensation is a capital gain. Protect big banks from themselves. This means moving ahead with <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0928_basel_banking_elliott.aspx">Basel III </a>capital requirements and adopting the Volcker Rule to limit banks’ ability to engage in risky and speculative investments."</p>
<p>
<strong>3) Foreclosures are literally deadly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/opinion/foreclosures-are-killing-us.html">write</a> Craig Pollock and Julia Lynch:</strong> "Foreclosure is not just a metaphorical epidemic, but a bona fide public health crisis. When breadwinners become ill, they miss work, lose their jobs, face daunting medical bills -- and have trouble making mortgage payments as a result. But that is only part of the story. A growing body of research shows that foreclosure itself harms the health of families and communities. In our 2008 survey of 250 people undergoing foreclosure in the Philadelphia area, 32 percent reported missing doctor’s appointments and 48 percent said they let prescriptions go unfilled, significantly higher rates than others in their community. A paper released last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that people living in high-foreclosure areas in New Jersey, Arizona, California and Florida were significantly more likely than those in less hard-hit neighborhoods to be hospitalized for conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and heart failure."</p>

<strong>4) Antitax orthodoxy could lead to higher taxes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/business/economy/antitax-ideas-could-have-unintended-results.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">writes</a> Tyler Cowen:</strong> "IN a <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_08/tentoone_isnt_good_enough_for031484.php">debate in August, Republican presidential candidates</a> were asked whether they would support a budget deal that bundled $10 of spending cuts for every $1 of tax increases. All said no. They rejected any deal that involved raising taxes. Curiously, though, if this approach actually were to become government policy, it would have a surprising effect: it would surely lead to higher rather than lower taxes. Consider the example more closely. Cutting $10 in spending for every $1 in tax increases would result in $9 in net tax reduction. That’s because lower spending today means lower taxes tomorrow, and limiting the future path of government spending does limit future taxes, as Milton Friedman, the late Nobel laureate and conservative icon, so clearly explained. Promising never to raise taxes, without reaching a deal on spending, really means a high and rising commitment to future taxes."</p>

<strong>5) Keynes' theories are facing their biggest test yet, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_cassidy">writes</a> John Cassidy:</strong> "Why didn't the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package usher in a true recovery? Keynes would have pointed out that, with households and firms intent on paying down debts and building up their savings in the aftermath of a credit binge, large-scale deficit spending is needed merely to prevent a recession from turning into a depression. With interest rates already close to zero, Keynes would have argued that the economy was stuck in a 'liquidity trap,' greatly limiting the Federal Reserve's scope for further action. He would also have noted that the stimulus was--especially compared with the devastation it meant to address--rather small: equivalent to less than two per cent of G.D.P. a year for three years. Even this overstates its magnitude, given that much of the increase in federal spending was offset by budget cuts at the state and local levels."</p>

'Despite your diligence and our good-faith effort to reach reasonable terms with the banking industry, there now exists a proposed settlement that is inadequate for California homeowners,' Harris wrote in a letter to the two officials heading up the talks, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Associate U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perrelli. 'I have concluded that this is not the deal California homeowners have been waiting for.'

They say it would prevent the government from hindering growth by picking and choosing who gets a tax break. But they are skeptical it would get much traction in Congress, and they warn that the country could open a Pandora’s box by introducing a national sales tax. Currently, only states can charge sales tax. Liberal economists say that the plan would end up shifting more of the burden to lower- and middle-income families, who are the beneficiaries of so many of the regulations and deductions that complicate the tax code."</p>

The payoff, they say, could be significant: 1.3 million new jobs and an $859 billion shot in the arm for the economy over the next decade.

This might be only a piece of theatre, taking the crisis right to the brink before the need for action becomes so apparent that its political cost is lowered. (Merkel is facing reëlection in 2013.) German politicians seem to have a block about making clear to their electorate just how much the country has benefitted, and continues to benefit, from the euro, mainly through its enormously helpful effect on Germany’s strong export economy. That could turn out to be a historic failure of leadership."</p>

Of course, the specter of Jack Abramoff hovers, but no one has suggested that the Abramoff scandal reached down to the level of career government employees.

The announcement marked a dramatic ending for the $18 billion loan guarantee program, which has been central to the administration’s push to create jobs and promote green technology. Simultaneously, the program has come under fire for its handling of a half-billion-dollar loan to Solyndra, a solar company that collapsed in August. The program’s congressionally approved funding expired at midnight Friday as the federal fiscal year ended. The effort to commit money before the books closed came at a delicate time for the Energy Department, which for weeks has battled allegations that it erred by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-pushed-500-million-loan-to-solar-company-now-under-investigation/2011/09/13/gIQAr3WbQK_story.html">rushing to extend a guarantee to Solyndra</a>."</p>

But Chu, the Nobel laureate praised last year for spending weeks in a Houston control room brainstorming up engineering ideas that ultimately helped cap the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher, is not out of the woods.

The Hyde Amendment at 35: a new abortion divide
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p/>
<p>On March 21, 2010, President Obama made the final move to secure the health reform law’s passage: He issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/03/21/one-more-step-towards-health-insurance-reform">executive order</a> barring federal funding of abortion under the Affordable Care Act. The executive order expressly stated that health reform would “maintain current Hyde Amendment restrictions,” referencing the law that bars federal funding for abortions. The order won over a handful of reticent Congressional Democrats who opposed abortion rights but wanted to see health reform pass.<p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/01/25/Others/Images/2011-01-25/PHO-11Jan25-285412.jpg?uuid=oVMdor3iSY2e6TDKPTs_mQ"/>
</p>
</p>
<p>Abortion rights supporters have long rallied against the Hyde Amendment; they say the law, first passed in 1976 and reauthorized every year since, places an undue burden on women who rely on government programs like Medicaid for health care. Abortion opponents strongly support it: the Hyde Amendment, they contend, sets up an appropriate boundary between private and public dollars for a controversial procedure.</p>
<p>But as the Hyde Amendment hit its 35th anniversary Friday, both sides of the abortion debate could agree on one thing: health reform quietly transformed Hyde’s funding restrictions into a new status quo. Lawmakers across the political spectrum came to support federal abortion-funding bans as neutral, neither enabling or restricting access, which abortion rights supporters describe as a major setback.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this idea that there shouldn’t be public insurance coverage for abortion got cemented in the public’s mind,” says Jessica Arons, director of the women’s health and rights program at the Center for American Progress. “Politicians have gotten used to saying that.”</p>
<p>Congress first passed the Hyde Amendment, named for its sponsor Rep. Henry Hyde, three years after the Supreme Court affirmed the legality of abortion in Roe v. Wade. The biggest impact is on Medicaid, which cannot provide abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life or health of the mother.</p>
<p>The landscape around Hyde shifted during the health reform battle, when a near-consensus developed that no federal funds would go toward abortion. President Obama vocally endorsed that position. “I’m pro-choice, but I think we also have the tradition in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care,” he t<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5178972-503544.html">old</a> CBS News during the health reform debate. A CNN <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-18/politics/abortion.poll_1_public-option-abortion-issue-health-insurance?_s=PM:POLITICS">poll</a> in November 2009 found that 61 percent of Americans favor banning public funding for abortions.</p>
<p>Even some of the staunchest supporters of abortion rights endorsed maintaining the Hyde Amendment as a means to passing the health reform law. “]M]y whole thing is that I want to see the status quo preserved, which is the Hyde idea,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/boxer-says-she-backs-hyde-idea-bar-federal-funds-abortion-voted-against-hyde-language">told reporters</a> during the health reform debate. She went on to describe the idea of barring federal funding of abortions as an “uneasy truce” between supporters and opponents of abortion rights.</p>
<p>That truce has become less easy since the health reform law passed. The 35th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment has supporters of abortion rights worried about the precedent that the health reform debate set for barring federal funding of abortion. “The debate put people in a box where we were saying ‘don’t worry, there won’t be taxpayer funding for abortion in this bill,” Arons said. “What pro-choice advocates have realized since then is we need to focus on health insurance that’s inclusive of all reproductive health needs.”</p>
<p>Marlene G. Fried made a similar point in a recent essay, “<a href="http://www.fundabortionnow.org/news/HydeAt35">Hyde at 35: How One Law Continues To Divide a Movement</a>,” where she argues that the health reform debate normalized the idea of barring federal funding for abortion.</p>
<p>“The persistence of the Hyde Amendment also created a series of disastrous roadblocks to inclusive reproductive health coverage in other legislation,” Fried, a professor at Hampshire College who both studies and supports the abortion rights movement, wrote. “Compounding this specific policy loss was the profound ideological loss of normalizing the exclusion of abortion from health insurance.”</p>
<p>Health reform also made the Hyde Amendment a mainstream election issue. Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion rights, poured millions of dollars  into billboards and television ads accusing Congressional Democrats of supporting tax-payer funded abortion.</p>
<p>“Health reform certainly made the issue electorally powerful,” says Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser. “You do not want a billboard saying you voted for tax payer funding for abortion. It wasn’t like that 10 or even five years ago.”</p>
<p>Abortion rights supporters concede that moving back to the environment prior to health reform is a challenge. Fried hopes that it will catalyze “new champions” to come forward on the issue. She’s already seen a bit of that. “It was sort of a wakeup call for activists,” she told me in a recent interview. “I’m heartened by what I’m seeing so far.”</p>
<p>Others aren’t so optimistic. Arons describes the process as “digging out of a hole” and a big challenge. “We have a lot of work to do,” she says. “I really can’t argue with that.”</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

BofA claims that it is charging the new fees to recoup the lost money. But the retailers who lobbied hard for the new swipe-fee regulations insist that customers could still benefit from the changes — on their end of the equation, at least. </p>
<p>Target, for example, claims the swipe fees are the company’s second-largest expense, following labor. “They are one of Target’s largest single-expense categories. These fees represented hundreds of millions of dollars every year,” Jenna Reck, a Target spokesperson, told me. “We are in a competitive marketplace as a retailer, so any reduction in industry operating costs may likely result in lower prices to consumers.” </p>
<p>The National Retail Federation, a key lobbying group behind the swipe-fee change, <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1199">accuses</a> banks of hiding behind the new regulation as a way to gouge consumers. “Every time Congress takes a step to protect consumers, the banks use it as an excuse to raise fees,” the NRF said in a statement, claiming the fee caps would save merchants and consumers “billions.” During the fight on Capitol Hill, some retailers were even more candid. Stan Sheetz, CEO of the Sheetz chain of convenience stores, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bank-of-america-to-add-5-monthly-debit-card-fee-as-era-of-low-cost-banking-ebbs/2011/09/29/gIQAzyhL8K_print.html">told</a> the Huffington Post that swipe fees cost the company $5 million every month. “I am a die-hard capitalist pig,” he told HuffPost. “That’s why Visa and MasterCard piss me off.” (To really understand the swipe-fee battle, read HuffPost’s entire <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/28/swipe-fees-interchange-banks-merchants_n_853574.html?view=print&amp;comm_ref=false">opus</a> on the issue.)</p>
<p>To be sure, it’s fair to be skeptical that even retailers who benefit most from the swipe-fee changes will lower costs as a direct result. But even if that’s the case, Mike Konczal <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/three-points-about-interchange-reform-pass-through-australia-low-income-groups/">explains</a> that there’s a benefit that consumers still stand to gain due to this new windfall:</p>
<blockquote>[B]usinesses compete on all kinds of things other than price, and if the cost of using money goes down for business even if that isn’t transferred through price mechanisms there are other ways it’ll get transferred. It may go to wages, it may go to hours, it may go to quality of products, etc. But it’ll go somewhere.</blockquote>
<p>Finally, there’s an argument that the swipe-fee rules will actually help the banking system itself, as well as the consumers who use it. Daniel Gross, for instance, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daniel-gross/why-higher-bank-fees-could-good-news-161312200.html">argues</a> that the new debit-card fees that Bank of America are imposing have more to do with bad decisions the banks themselves made before the financial crisis, not Congress.</p>
<blockquote>Companies routinely get hit with higher costs, by the market or by regulation.... Healthy, smart companies can frequently figure out ways to cope without loudly annoying their customers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But banks aren’t particularly healthy or smart, especially Bank of America. Check out this two-year chart of its stock. ... If not for the toxic legacy of Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America acquired in 2008, it might not be imposing a fee at all.... In some ways, the imposition of fees is a positive development. The concept of charging customers for a service is actually a more sustainable and intelligent way for banks to do business.</blockquote>

How robots will replace doctors
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>Farhad Manjoo has <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_3.single.html">a provocative thesis</a> on the future of medicine: Robots will take the jobs. And not just the bottom-rung of jobs. “The doctors who are the juiciest targets for automation might not be the ones you’d expect,” he writes. They’re not the nurses or the primary-care docs. “They’re specialists like my wife — the most highly trained, highly paid people in medicine.”</p>
<p>
<p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/201110/Images/Doctor_Watson_0248c.jpg?uuid=a-e05N2AEeCgwkmpTPQdrw"/>
</p>I’m not convinced. Manjoo’s argument is that robots tend to be good at doing a very specific thing over and over again. That’s pretty much the definition of specialization. Ergo, specialists had best welcome their new robot overlords. Conversely, robots aren’t very good at having a long conversation with a human to figure out, in a subtle and sensitive way, what’s really wrong with them. But — and I recognize this will be an unpopular sentiment — are doctors?</p>
<p>After all, who becomes a doctor? High-achieving type-A folks who are really, really good at science. Some of them also happen to be very humane, very empathetic people. But not all of them. Perhaps not even most of them.</p>
<p>But then, we’re not sitting in that room wrapped in a garment made of the finest recycled sandpaper because we were hoping for a good conversation. We’re there because we’re sick, or worried we might be sick, and we’re hoping this arrogant, hurried, credentialed genius can tell us what’s wrong. We go to doctors not because they’re great empaths, but because we’re hoping medical school has made them into the closest thing the human race has developed to robots.</p>
<p>As Atul Gawande wrote in “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312430000/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=washingtonpost-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0312430000">The Checklist Manifesto</a>,” “the ninth edition of the World Health Organization’s international classification of diseases has grown to distinguish more than thirteen thousand different diseases, syndromes, and types of injury.” And that doesn’t take into account all the possible symptoms and recommended lab tests and side effects of, and interactions between, various medications. That’s complexity beyond any human’s capacity to handle. But it’s not beyond a computer’s ability.</p>
<p>Manjoo suggests robots are built for surgery. But most doctors right now are thinking about robots built for diagnostics. They’re thinking about a version of IBM’s Watson that can cross-check symptoms with medications with a patient’s history and come up with an array of possible diagnoses ranked by likelihood. They’re thinking about that so much that, on Tuesday, the famed Cleveland Clinic is hosting an <a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/innovations/summit/">innovation conference</a> in which clinicians will be competing against Watson. </p>
<p>My prediction is that long before robots undermine specialists, they will undermine primary-care doctors. But here’s where Manjoo is right: They will do that by specializing. They will allow the medical profession to break the conversation, the human element of the practice, from the technical diagnosis. Because doctor’s offices already have people who are really, really good at talking to patients, and they’re also the people who, more often than not, actually know how to use the computers. </p>
<p>They’re called nurses, and patients like them quite a bit. They’ll speak with the patient and then they’ll go to the computer and type up what they have heard and refer the patient to the appropriate specialists or medications. The software will “know” more and catch more than most doctors could on their own, and the nurses, by virtue of being less expensive, will have more time to talk with the patients and inform the computer of what they said.</p>
<p>There’s precedent for this. Librarians, for instance, now work with the public to find information on computers. Loan officers now speak with eager borrowers and plug their financial system into a computer program. Accountants now plug their client’s income information into tax-preparing software. There are plenty of professions that used to mix technical skills and conversational skills and now mix conversational skills and computers. Eventually, medicine will be one, too.</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/11/michael-lewis-201111.print">California and Bust</a>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Michael Lewis • <em>Vanity Fair</em> • November 2011</i>
</p>
<p>The country’s largest economy is a case study of what can happen when we sacrifice our long-term interest for short-term rewards. A story of Meredith Whitney, Arnold Schwarzenegger and California’s dying municipalities:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The relationship between the people and their money in California is such that you can pluck almost any city at random and enter a crisis. San Jose has the highest per capita income of any city in the United States, after New York. It has the highest credit rating of any city in California with a population over 250,000. It is one of the few cities in America with a triple-A rating from Moody’s and Standard Poor’s, but only because its bondholders have the power to compel the city to levy a tax on property owners to pay off the bonds. The city itself is not all that far from being bankrupt.</blockquote>
</p>
<p>

<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/09/26/110926fa_fact_hessler?currentPage=all">Dr. Don</a>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Peter Hessler • <em>The New Yorker</em> • September 2011</i>
</p>
<p>The tale of Don Colcord, a small-town pharmacist in Colorado:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>He is, by the strictest definition, a bad businessman. If a customer can’t pay, Don often rings up the order anyway and tapes the receipt to the inside wall above his counter. “This one said he was covered by insurance, but it wasn’t,” he explains, pointing at a slip of paper on a wall full of them. “This one said he’ll be in on Tuesday. This one is a patient who is going on an extended vacation.” Most of his customers simply don’t have the money. Each year, Don writes off between ten and twenty thousand dollars, and he estimates that he is owed around three hundred thousand dollars in total. His annual salary is sixty-five thousand dollars. Over the course of many days at the Apothecary Shoppe, I never saw a customer walk in whom Don doesn’t know by name.</blockquote>

</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jeanne Marie Laskas • <em>GQ</em> • September 2011</i>
</p>
<p>Who picks our fruit? Oftentimes the laborers are undocumented immigrants—the invisible link in the supply chain:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Out in the fields north of Pea Ridge Road, a tall truckload of fresh empties crept out of the horizon, and the workers sprinted like urgent bargain shoppers toward it. Yellow, green, blue, white plastic boxes identical in size, and so they stacked, Lego-style, ten, fifteen at a time. Lift the stack on your shoulder and run. You wanted as many empties as you could carry so you could be sure to have enough to fill as you raked. Your kids, those who were at least 12, raked alongside you, pouring what they got into your boxes. Your kids, those under 12, hid in the car scratching their mosquito bites, waiting until nobody from the company was around before they started raking. The company has zero tolerance about letting underage kids work, because there are laws in America. But your kids wanted to rake, and your family needed the money, so what was the problem? An 8-year-old could easily do fifteen boxes a day, dramatically boosting his family’s yield. It was just a matter of not getting caught. </blockquote>

</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Radley Balko • <em>The Huffington Post</em> • September 2011</i>
</p>
<p>It’s fair to assume that the well-publicized racial bias of the death penalty and the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham—who was almost certainly innocent—would have soured Americans on the institution. Oddly enough, this hasn’t happened, thanks to a desire for vengeance, the sanitization of executions and the reliability of DNA evidence:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>[T]he scientific certainty DNA testing offers, in contrast to most other forensic specialties, also seems to have reassured the public that we’re now more likely making the right calls. According to Gallup, in 2003, 73 percent of Americans said an innocent person had probably been executed in the previous five years. That number dropped to 59 percent in 2009. In his concurring opinion in Marsh, Justice Scalia also wrote that an exoneration “demonstrates not the failure of the system but its success.”</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Matthieu Aikins • <em>The Atlantic</em> • November 2011</i>
</p>
<p>Abdul Raziq, a 33-year-old warlord, may have perpetrated a massacre of civilians. An increasingly powerful player in Afghanistan, Raziq is also the recipient of substantial U.S. support:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Last fall, Raziq and his militia were given a starring role in the U.S.-led military offensive into Taliban-controlled areas west of Kandahar City, a campaign that boosted his prestige immensely. Mentored by an American Special Forces team, Raziq’s fighters won public praise from U.S. officers for their combat prowess. After the offensive, Raziq was promoted to brigadier general—a rank requiring a direct order from President Karzai—in a January ceremony at the governor’s mansion. As Ben Moeling, who was until July the State Department’s senior official in Kandahar province, explained to me at the time, the promotion was “an explicit recognition of his importance.”</blockquote>

Did health reform drive up insurance premiums? Depends on the plan.
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>When <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/coming-to-an-insurance-plan-near-you-the-32000-premium/2011/09/27/gIQAFt9q1K_blog.html">a survey</a> earlier this week found that health insurance premiums had risen 9 percent this year, the usual suspects made their usual arguments. “As this survey shows, the president’s promise that his partisan health law would lower costs was just empty rhetoric,” Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said in a statement, joining a chorus of congressional Republicans pointing a finger at the Affordable Care Act. The White House pushed back. “We know that the Affordable Care Act will help make insurance more affordable for families and businesses across the country,” Nancy-Ann DeParle recently <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/27/health-insurance-premium-update">wrote</a> on the White House blog. So, who is right?</p>
<p>Everybody — and nobody. When it comes to rising health premium costs and the health reform law, there’s no one-size-fits-all explanation. A great new <a href="http://www.aon.com/attachments/thought-leadership/2011_Health_Insurance_Trend_Driver_Survey.pdf">study</a> from the consulting firm Aon Hewitt makes this point by digging into the 2011 numbers and lays out how, exactly, the health reform law has impacted health insurance premiums so far.</p>
<p>Across the board, Aon attributes 1.5 percent of premium bumps in 2011 to the reform law, pretty close to estimates from both <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/09/08/affordable-care-act-did-not-cause-unjust-premium-increases">the White House</a> and other consulting firms. But that 1.5 percent increase is an average and doesn’t say much about different insurance-market segments. Here’s how that breaks down, for this year, in the Aon study:</p>
<p>
<p>

</p>
</p>
<p>In the large group market, where health insurance tends to be more robust, the increase is lower, less than 1 percent, as those plans tend to already cover the benefits that the Affordable Care Act now requires. In the individual market, benefits packages are often skimpier. The price increase is higher there, nearly 5 percent. To be sure, the beneficiary is receiving a richer benefit package, but also a higher bill.</p>
<p>“The impact depends on where you start,” Karen Igagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, told me Friday morning. “If an individual has purchased primarily catastrophic coverage, it will add to the cost of coverage much more than for a small employer or large employer who already had a broader benefit package.”</p>
<p>In some cases, the addition of new benefits can even drive down the cost of health insurance. Aon Hewitt also had carriers report the impact of health reform’s new benefits on premium costs. In all markets, the extension of dependent coverage up to age 26 actually pushes the cost of coverage down. “Since dependents under age 26 are generally healthy, extending coverage to this group may result in bringing more low-cost members into the plan and thus lowering the per member cost,” the report concludes.</p>
<p>In other cases, the new benefits can be expensive: Individual market plans estimate that the end of pre-existing conditions for children will increase premiums by as much as 6 percent. Here’s what all that looks like in a graph (keep in mind these are now ranges, not averages):</p>
<p>

</p>
</p>
<p>What health reform’s early-to-implement benefits mean for the cost of premiums really depends on what the starting benefit package looks like. And what the rest of the law means is a whole different ballgame: In 2014, the mandated purchase of health insurance, as well as public subsidies to purchase coverage, will come into effect. All those changes will vastly overhaul the individual insurance market.</p>
<p>This research focuses on the cost of the benefits that have already come online. Because so many benefits packages are starting from very different places right now, any blanket statements or average numbers are likely to miss what’s actually happening in different insurance-market segments.</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

The cost of China’s currency ma­nipu­la­tion — to China
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>“It is currently costing the Chinese central bank about $240 billion per year to hold down the value of the Chinese currency relative to other currencies...To put this cost in perspective, $240 billion is considerably larger than China’s trade surplus of $183 billion last year. It is about 4 percent of China’s GDP in 2010. Moreover, this cost does not include the implicit tax on the banking system associated with China’s reserve holdings, which is passed on to Chinese households in the form of depressed rates of interest on savings deposits.” <i>-- Joe Gagnon on <a href="http://www.piie.com/blogs/china/?p=422">China’s currency policy</a>.</i>

Congress is addicted to stop-gap budgets
]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[
<p>With government shutdowns now seeming to loom at every budget deadline, Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever. But let’s keep it in perspective: Congress almost never manages to pass the entire federal budget by the scheduled deadline of Sept. 30. Over the past 30 years, it’s happened only <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32614.pdf">four times</a> — in 1977, 1989, 1995, and 1997. Every other year, Congress has depended on short-term stopgaps and omnibus bills to keep the government running. In 2001 alone, Congress relied on a record 21 Continuing Resolutions before a full budget could be passed, as tensions over the 1997 Balanced Budget Act boiled over.<p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/StandingArt/CRs%20number%20per%20fiscal%20year.jpg?uuid=gOqHhOuSEeCovo1iItaECw"/>
</p>  </p>
<p>What has changed is the tenor and length of such negotiations. In an earlier era, budget dealmakers used CRs simply to buy themselves more time to reach a bipartisan deal, and the stopgaps were routinely passed as a matter of course, generally extending the budget at the previous year’s levels. But the budget process has gotten increasingly politicized as Congressional politics have become polarized, particularly over the size and role of government. </p>
<p>The normal budget process is a long slog to begin with: 12 separate appropriations bills have to pass out of committee and through both houses for a full budget to be passed. As the parties have gotten far apart, it’s taking even longer, as political scientists Sarah Anderson and Jonathan Woon have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450649">shown</a>. As the deficit has ballooned, for instance, appropriations have become a bigger target for fiscal conservatives — even though entitlements that fall outside these budget bills are the bigger long-term driver of government spending. Budget dealmaking has also become more difficult with the ban on earmarks that the current Congress has imposed, which has made it harder to lure individual members with promises of spending in their respective states or districts. </p>
<p>All this is why Congress has had so much trouble passing a year-long budget resolution, turning instead to short-term extensions. As these stopgaps have supplanted traditional, year-long budget resolutions, the short-term CRs themselves have become the new battleground for policy battles and brinksmanship, as we’ve witnessed this year. Congress has now been relying on stopgap measures to fund the government for more than two years, ever since the GOP took the House. The last time it passed a full-fledged budget resolution through the normal legislative process was in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040203473.html">April 2009</a> — without a single Republican vote — and it’s been using short-term CRs and bigger omnibus packages to keep the government running ever since. </p>
<p>Circumventing the traditional budget has also concentrated power in the hands of party leadership: rather than passing individual appropriations bills, vetted and passed out of Congressional committees, party leaders hammer out grand bargains themselves and push to get everyone else on board. Just this week, for instance, House GOP appropriations leaders <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/house-republicans-jockey-to-influence-the-next-budget/2011/09/29/gIQAxPfQ8K_blog.html">introduced</a> a highly controversial new bill for health, education, and labor spending without putting it up for a committee or subcommittee vote — partly because two GOP members were blocking it for going forward. Members like Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Ct.) <a href="http://delauro.house.gov/release.cfm?id=3199"/>
<a href="http://delauro.house.gov/release.cfm?id=3199">denounced</a> the move for going over the heads of the committee members and effectively removing the legislation from “public debate and amendment.”</p>
<p>At the same time, individual members have tried to influence negotiations by holding parts of the budget hostage--whether it’s disaster aid offsets or Planned Parenthood funding. In 2009 alone, the final appropriations bills took longer to pass on average than any other year since 1977, when the modern-day budget rules were first enacted. <p>
<img src="/rf/image_296w//WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/StandingArt/CRs%20length%20of%20passage.jpg?uuid=jV0-YuuSEeCovo1iItaECw"/>
</p>
</p>
<p>“It’s the outgrowth of a very old appropriations process that can’t keep pace with hardcore partisan differences and ideological difference over spending,” says Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University and Brookings fellow. “The stakes have gotten bigger as the debt as grown.” </p>
<p>Congress will have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/five-reasons-the-next-budget-fight-could-be-worse/2011/09/26/gIQABfSjzK_blog.html">another chance</a> to get its act together in the next few weeks, when it’s due to put together a budget for the rest of the 2012 fiscal year. It’s already agreed on one short-term extension that will keep the government going until Nov. 18. But the threat over an seemingly straightforward six-week budget, it’s unclear whether legislators will be able to avoid another blow-up — and avoid yet another short-term fix.</p><br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>
