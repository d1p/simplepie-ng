                        &lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve always known that Macs are susceptible to malware, but without a significant portion of market share, why should anyone bother? Now that numbers are up, Mac users are finding out that their platform of choice is also vulnerable, and it&#039;s not just Windows users who have to be on the lookout. The latest threat eating away at Apple PCs is a trojan horse that tries to dupe users into thinking it&#039;s a harmless Flash Player installer.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve always known that Macs are susceptible to malware, but without a significant portion of market share, why should anyone bother? Now that numbers are up, Mac users are finding out that their platform of choice is also vulnerable, and it&#039;s not just Windows users who have to be on the lookout. The latest threat eating away at Apple PCs is a trojan horse that tries to dupe users into thinking it&#039;s a harmless Flash Player installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s called Flashback (OSX/flashback.A), and though it&#039;s been found in the wild, Mac security software provider &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.intego.com/2011/09/26/intego-security-memo-%E2%80%93-september-26-2011-mac-flashback-trojan-horse-masquerades-as-flash-player-installer-package/&quot;&gt;Intego&lt;/a&gt; considers it a low risk threat. That&#039;s mainly because there&#039;s only been one report of Flashback fooling anyone. Nevertheless, it &quot;has some disturbing actions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain websites contain a link or an icon to download and install the fake Flash Player, and since Max OS X Lion doesn&#039;t include a Flash Player, it&#039;s easy to see how something like this could dupe users. Once installed, the Flashback trojan gets to work disabling various network security software, installs a dynamic loader library and auto-launch code, and connects to a remote server where it sends information about the infected machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest threat to the Mac ecosystem comes right on the heels of another Mac trojan masquerading as a PDF file. Security firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002241.html&quot;&gt;F-Secure&lt;/a&gt; says that one is detected as Trojan-Dropper:OSX/Revier.A and &quot;may be attempting to copy the technique implemented by Windows malware, which opens a PDF file containing a &#039;.pdf.exe&#039; extension and an accompanying PDF icon.&quot; Once infected, it installs a backdoor in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now stop laughing at your Mac loving buddy who claims his platform is impervious to malware and go update your own AV software for your Windows machine. Linux users go ahead and stand pat, hardly anyone knows you&#039;re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an article from MaximumPC.com what are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my computer last Christmas around December 30th so I still have some warranty usage left. However, this computer has not given me these errors until recently (August) where the system would randomly blue screen in the middle of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit and then upon reboot, would not detect the HDD. This went on for about a few weeks with me tweaking different settings and rolling back updates and I even upgraded my PC to Windows 7…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my computer last Christmas around December 30th so I still have some warranty usage left. However, this computer has not given me these errors until recently (August) where the system would randomly blue screen in the middle of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit and then upon reboot, would not detect the HDD. This went on for about a few weeks with me tweaking different settings and rolling back updates and I even upgraded my PC to Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit to see if that would remedy the problem. The last step was install all of Windows Updates and updated all the extra bells and whistles like Flash, Adobe, etc. Worked fine for about 5 days and then blue screened again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted into the Dell Diagnostics CD included with my PC and did a complete system scan. Found a major error on the HDD and it said something to the nature of the HDD rejected the test command and gave an alpha-numeric code to give to Dell Support. I called Dell Support and told them the nature of the problem, gave them the code, and within minutes they said they were going to FedEx Overnight me a new HDD. I got the new drive in, installed it, it did its thing with the image and brought my PC back to factory defaults. Happy camper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My PC has been on since then for about a week and a half or a little less. I sleeps when not in use and hasn&#039;t given me any major problems. I have been playing a game called Forsaken World without issues. Today, I woke up to a black screen on my PC with a blinking cursor in the upper left. I pressed the power button to turn it off, and upon restart, pressed F2 to get into the BIOS to see that SATA0 had no device on it, and SATA1 was my CDROM. HDD not detected. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After letting out a rather loud and staccato &lt;strong&gt;WTF!&lt;/strong&gt;, I turned it off and went to the store for breakfast. Came home, and turned it back and it detected the HDD, booted up, requested Safe mode that I declined and started Windows normally. Now I&#039;m sitting here writing this wondering if there is something I am missing, or if anyone else with a Dell Inspiron One 2305 is having the same issues. Google came up dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
