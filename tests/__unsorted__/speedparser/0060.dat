			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular questions I get asked in any iPad training session I do, is HOW TO TURN THE BLASTED IPAD ROTATION OFF. I mean, most people LOVE this feature, that whole built in sensor that moves with you thing, but for many of the seniors/people I teach, it becomes a nuisance when you&#8217;re laying back on the couch to watch a movie or read a book.</p>
<p>The thing is, you can EASILY turn this function on and off at your whim. Assuming you have an iPad that you&#8217;ve updated the software of (ie, synced with your computer recently), here&#8217;s how you do it. This is the same on iPad 1 or 2.</p>
<p>Basically, the side switch on your iPad (next to the volume control buttons) can be used to EITHER lock the rotation of the screen, OR mute the volume quickly (like on an iPhone).</p>
<p>All you have to do is toggle the settings so that the switch is used only to lock rotation, that way everytime you flip that switch, it will either lock or unlock the rotating screen.</p>
<p>Firstly, just tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your <strong>home screen</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-93 aligncenter" title="settings app on ipad" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo.png" alt="settings app on ipad" width="516" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Then, when the <strong>Settings</strong> open, tap on the left hand side on the word &#8220;<strong>General&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p>On the right hand panel, a slew of options will appear &#8211; look for &#8220;<strong>Use Side Switch To</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Under that, tap on &#8220;<strong>Lock Rotation</strong>&#8220;. You will know it&#8217;s correct because the <strong>tick will be next to &#8220;Lock Rotation&#8221;</strong>, as shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-94 aligncenter" title="using side switch to lock the rotation on the ipad" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo-1.png" alt="using side switch to lock the rotation on the ipad" width="491" height="369" /></a></p>
<p>This is a little tip that takes less than 2 minutes to execute, and may help some of you out there &#8211; so far 90% of my students have asked for this, so I know it&#8217;s popular!</p>
<p>Hope that was helpful!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been facilitating training session in a wide array of topics for many years now, and it struck me the other day that there&#8217;s a lot of content out there about being a great teacher, but not a whole lot about how to be a great student.</p>
<p>In this day and age, self-development as an adult is a HUGE mantra we hear daily &#8211; it&#8217;s perfectly normal for most people to attend after work developmental classes such as singing, dance, sport, and even more common that companies invest in their employees and send people to training and improvement courses.</p>
<p>So why be a great student?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Firstly, if a trainer has great students in their session, they&#8217;re more likely to feel inspired to give the best class they can themselves, and who doesn&#8217;t want the best of content and delivery that a subject matter expert can bring to the table?</p>
<p>Secondly, being a better student means enhancing your own capability to learn, and very likely boosting your speed and efficiency in attaining and retaining the skills you&#8217;ve learnt. This alone should be the impetus for being a better student!</p>
<p>In my view, there are several things a student of any skill can quickly become a better student and learner. However no student has exemplified this for me as much as my most recent technology trainee, and 87 year old man I&#8217;ve been teaching iPad too, and I&#8217;ll call him J.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard me right, he is 87.</p>
<p>And more technologically savvy than many 50 year olds out there, with a PC, Kindle, iPad and iPod touch. And he knows how to use all of them and cannot sate his desire to learn more about how he can enhance his life with these gadgets.</p>
<p>Already inspired?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
<dl id="attachment_81" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 534px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipad-class-wrkd-sm.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-81  " title="ipad for seniors at CAE MELBOURNE by Sharon Pakir" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipad-class-wrkd-sm-1024x566.jpg" alt="ipad for seniors at CAE MELBOURNE by Sharon Pakir" width="524" height="290" /></a></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>These are the ways in which J is a model student:</p>
<p><strong>1. J IS A LIFELONG LEARNER</strong></p>
<p>At 87, J hasn&#8217;t hung up his learning hat, even despite having lived quite an incredible life of passion, fulfilling his dreams, representing his country and living in several countries. His passion is clear &#8211; he wants to constantly improve his life and keep his mental skills nimble, and it&#8217;s working. At his age, he&#8217;s healthy, limber, and quick witted, and perhaps most impressively, completely self sufficient. He&#8217;s even planning a holiday to the UK this year!</p>
<p>This passion for learning has him travelling to various places for lessons, and even goes to shops to research the new gadgets he reads about. He takes notes diligently, and spends his alone time listening to audiobooks and processing the information he&#8217;s learnt. He researches new musicians he may like, and stays up to date with current affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. J PUTS NO LIMITATIONS ON HIS LEARNING</strong></p>
<p>J has never said the words &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221;. He overcomes aching shakey fingers to manipulate his iPod and Kindle controls which are fiddly. He understands that learning requires an investment of energy, time, and money, and is happy to make those investments. He does not say &#8220;you do it for me&#8221; &#8211; if I&#8217;m so much as creating a shortcut on his desktop to make something easily accesible, he wants to learn HOW to make that shortcut himself. He also never thinks anything is too hard for him to learn, and instead tells me that he just needs a bit of time and repetition to process it. It&#8217;s refreshing, and inspiring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. J IS POLITE</strong></p>
<p>Ever polite students are a teacher&#8217;s dream. When you&#8217;re focussed on learning, sometimes you don&#8217;t think about how your manner may come across when asking questions or expressing your (very natural) frustration with a difficult learning curve. J is quintessentially gentlemanly, and always prefaces his questions with helpful context, always is almost apologetic for having an additional question, and if he finds out it&#8217;s his own user error involved, NEVER gets defensive or makes excuses.</p>
<p>Not that you should feel apologetic for asking questions &#8211; but it&#8217;s always nice from a teacher&#8217;s end if before asking an additional question, you make sure the teacher her time to devote to the solution. It&#8217;s nice that J assesses if a question should be posed RIGHT at the end of a lesson, or writes it down to ask at our next session or via email later on. It gives me the luxury to respond to it with an appropriate amount of attention, and doesn&#8217;t make me feel pushed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. J TAKES NOTES</strong></p>
<p>In any lesson, you only ever retain about 20% of what you&#8217;ve learnt. It&#8217;s perfectly normal. But if you want to train yourself to retain up to 80% of what was taught, you should absolutely take notes. I seldom recommend relying on provided notes &#8211; how many times have we actually gone back to refer to a provided textbook after a class? I would wager that it&#8217;s seldom. When you take notes though, you are firstly re-enforcing what is said, but also transcribing it in your own language and format. If you refer to them, chances are you will understand your own version of things much better than the most comprehensive textbooks.</p>
<p>J doesn&#8217;t just take notes, he makes me stop teaching for a moment so he can take the time to accurately write down steps or explanations. It&#8217;s proven a huge help to his learning &#8211; 90% of the time he has been able to execute the same actions learnt in his own time between lessons, with his notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. J PRACTICES IN HIS OWN TIME</strong></p>
<p>Every time I meet him for a lesson, J has used the time in between to practice what he&#8217;s learnt. This means there&#8217;s very little repetition in our classes, and we seldom waste time repeating what he&#8217;s already been shown. This discipline is rather incredible to behold &#8211; few people have natural disposition toward spending their scant leisure time devoted to working or learning, but J does. He enjoys it, and feels more confident as a student as a result.</p>
<p>When he comes into a problem in his practice, he writes down exactly what the issue is, how it made him feel, and what the steps he took were. When I arrive for my lesson, it is usually extremely easy to pinpoint the issue, and show him the right path.</p>
<p>If you used this technique of writing something down EVERY time you feel a mistake is made in anything you&#8217;re learning, I&#8217;d wager that sooner or later, you&#8217;ll see a pattern in your execution that has caused it. Practice, deliberate practice, and conscious practice are vital to learning well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This was just PART 1 of what makes a great student, with J (my 87 year old technology student) as an example. Part 2 is coming very soon, stay tuned!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday night, on a whim, S and I decided to go watch a movie. We were, for various reasons, trying to kill time out in the Eastern suburbs, which we weren&#8217;t so familiar with, and were tossing up between having dinner somewhere or watching a movie, or going to a bar for a drink.</p>
<p>As S drove around in the general direction of civilisation (we hoped), I googled &#8220;Eastland cinema&#8221;, and the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/hoyts-movie-app/id441151000?mt=8">Hoyts iPhone app</a> popped up.</p>
<p>Hmm, I thought. Intriguing.</p>
<p>And promptly, of course, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/hoyts-movie-app/id441151000?mt=8" target="_blank">went to the App Store and downloaded it</a>.</p>
<p>And was duly impressed.</p>
<p>Truly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-27-at-10.36.56-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-74 aligncenter" title="hoyts iphone app" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-27-at-10.36.56-PM.png" alt="hoyts iphone app" width="191" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/hoyts-movie-app/id441151000?mt=8" target="_blank">Hoyts iPhone App</a> delivered quite the user experience &#8211; in 3 minutes flat, I worked out how to use it, picked our movie, and selected our tickets. It&#8217;s user-interface is wonderfully simple and slick looking, and I love that it&#8217;s extremely fast to load each page.</p>
<div id="attachment_76" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 368px"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_48491.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-76  " title="hoyts iphone app" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_48491.jpg" alt="hoyts iphone app" width="358" height="538" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">simple, pretty interface</p></div>
<p>You can search by Movies or Cinema, and once you do, buying a ticket is just about 2 taps away. You can choose your seat easily, and that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>Then, you simply enter your credit card details, and the receipt is stored in your &#8220;Purchases&#8221; section. You don&#8217;t need to have an account, register, or sign in (though if you have a <a href="http://www.hoyts.com.au/" target="_blank">Hoyts</a> account, you can use it on this app too), which means a hassle-free transaction.</p>
<p>I think this was one of the major selling points for me &#8211; if you give your customers an easy, clear path to purchasing, chances are, they will buy more easily and happily and impulsively. Which is kind of what happened to us. I went from <em>&#8220;maybe we should watch a movie&#8221;</em> to <em>&#8220;I bought tickets!&#8221;</em> before S had even left the next set of traffic lights.</p>
<p>Within seconds, the barcode was sent to me and all I had to do when we rocked up at Eastland Hoyts was display my purchase barcode to the nice lady at the counter. She scanned it, and BOOM, we were in.</p>
<p>It actually was harder and took longer to find the right carpark to park in at Eastland.</p>
<p>So there you go. If you&#8217;re a movie aficionado,<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/hoyts-movie-app/id441151000?mt=8" target="_blank"> you need this app</a> &#8211; it has definitely endeared me to <a href="http://www.hoyts.com.au" target="_blank">Hoyts</a>, and it certainly helped that their <a href="http://www.hoyts.com.au/Cinemas/La_Premiere.aspx" target="_blank">La Premiere</a> experience was pretty damn good too. Plus, the app is free. What more do you need in life? <img src='http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an instalment of the &#8220;train the trainer&#8221; series by Sharon Pakir &#8211; designed to identify the key traits that great coaches, trainers, public speakers and teachers share in providing world class knowledge sharing that engages and escalates learning! Each instalment identifies a characteristic that great educators exude, and contains practical strategies to apply them in your sessions. To read the complete writings on this topic, simply click on the &#8220;Train the Trainer&#8221; category on the right hand sidebar. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>Being a trainer is in itself a form of leadership &#8211;  you must be able to attain the respect and engagement of the person, group, team or room before they are willing to let their defences down and truly absorb the information you are providing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/self_confidence.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105 aligncenter" title="self_confidence" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/self_confidence.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>Confidence is one of the most important qualities that a trainer, coach or public speaker must have in order to attain, in turn, the confidence of the people you are engaging with. Plus, to ensure your learner(s) become confident in the subject being taught, you must also exude confidence yourself. This has been a long known fact in sports, with studies mapping a coach&#8217;s behaviour to athlete success.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Smoll and Smith&#8217;s (1989) model of leadership behaviors in sport provides a framework for examining the cognitive and affective processes that may mediate an athlete&#8217;s reaction to their coach&#8217;s behavior. The central process of their model states that a coach behaves in a certain way, the athletes perceive and recall these behaviors, and based on this perception and recall the athletes have an evaluative reaction to the coach&#8217;s behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>- <em>Athlete&#8217;s Perception of Coaching Behaviors, by Laura Kenow , Jean M. Williams</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are 2 aspects of training confidence I would like to talk about here &#8211; one is innate self confidence in your knowledge, product or session content, and the other is about exuding that confidence in training to empower your students! The first is mental, the second is physical, and both work hand in hand to ensure your success as a trainer.</p>
<p><strong>1. Innate self-confidence</strong></p>
<p>If you are a trainer or coach, then presumably you have the knowledge that is required for conducting a session for your student/trainee. Your self-confidence is paramount here &#8211; no one wants to learn from someone that seems unsure about what they are teaching, or the accuracy of their knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, public speaking is scary for most people, and having the knowledge does not equate to feeling prepared to teach it &#8211; the fear of making mistakes and being responsible for imparting the wrong thing can be very strong deterrents to coaching. Plus, even if you are a subject matter expert, how do you decide WHAT to teach in the vast area you are training others in?</p>
<p>Whenever I&#8217;m teaching something new, I like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down/type out/draw a mind map of ALL the information I think I need to cover in the training session or sessions.</li>
<li>Highlight all the bits that the learner NEEDS to know before embarking on the hands-on aspect of training, and move them to the introduction section.</li>
<li>Collate the data into a chronological listing that makes sense &#8211; that is, sort the data from most basic to most complex, and that is your teaching order</li>
<li>Allocate times to each section that are REALISTIC, and include practical and hands-on exercises to assis with the learning process for each module.</li>
<li>Insert break times, and scribble notes for what I want to talk about, analogies that may help remembering the data, and even jokes I could make at each section.</li>
<li>TADA, you&#8217;re looking at my lovely session plan!</li>
</ul>
<p>Having these session plans help me with structuring the class and ensuring I stay on point, and also assists me in knowing that I have indeed covered everything I was supposed to. The session plan stays near me at all times, and this gives me the mental confidence that I have both the required knowledge to train this topic, but also a structural guide to follow, and ensures learner progression.</p>
<p>Of course, having innate self-confidence is not as simple has having a session plan &#8211; practice makes perfect, and I encourage all the trainers I coach to find a willing friend or volunteer to sit through as many &#8220;rehearsals&#8221; as needed before GO LIVE training! Don&#8217;t feel bad or strange about this &#8211; the best athletes and performers in the world rehearse before going on stage, why not you too?</p>
<p>After the above exercises, you should be feeling pretty confident about going into the training session, and here&#8217;s what leads me to my next point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Exuding physical confidence</strong></p>
<p>Making sure that you physically convey confidence is a sure-fire way to inspire and engage your learners. Of course, I don&#8217;t mean for you to be arrogant or have too much swagger, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how many learners rate &#8220;good body language&#8221; as an important skill for trainers to have.</p>
<p>Displays of confidence are universal, and include good eye contact, a strong smile, great posture, using the entire room throughout the session, and having good energy levels. It starts with the way you greet the room and introduce yourself, and often this is the main exercise I conduct when training other trainers.</p>
<p>Give this rehearsal exercise a try &#8211; enter a room with all your training materials in hand, put your things down, and brightly greet your imaginary room, or learner. Introduce yourself, and provide some personal anecdote to make a personal connection. Smile, show your passion for what you&#8217;re about the teach, and most of all, be authentic.</p>
<p>This above exercise is harder than you think! Again, try and get some feedback from the people you trust, and ask them to help you make it a better introduction. Remember that once you If can do your entry well, you&#8217;ll find the rest of your training session to be a piece of cake!</p>
<p>Just focus on being yourself, and being comfortable in your own skin &#8211; most people are very good at &#8220;being themselves&#8221;, and you are no exception. Think of the training session as relating a long story to some friends, instead of public presentation. Think of your materials as props and don&#8217;t forget to have fun. Your confidence and personality will simply be unmistakable, and there you have it, you&#8217;re on your way to trainer success!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello from <a href="http://www.sharonpakir.com/2011/05/04/the-birthday-month-commences/" target="_blank">Egypt</a>! Yes, we landed early this morning after an exhausting 28 hour journey consisting of 4 flights and much tiredness. Since then we&#8217;ve been welcomed into friend&#8217;s home wonderfully, had our first Egyptian meal, had a great walk around the neighbourhood, and had a chill on the couch. Wonderment, and a great relaxing start to what is sure to be an amazing 10 days ahead!</p>
<p>As we were enduring our seemingly never-ending litany of flights this last day and a half,  Stephen and I were discussing a phenomena neither of us understand. I think you&#8217;ll know it too.</p>
<p>When the airline calls passengers to board a plane, WHY does everyone rush to line up? Why do some people try to push in, and others try to find ways to weasel in a bit earlier? I&#8217;m not talking about forming a nice orderly line, or passengers slowly merging into some semblance of order in order to get on the plane. I&#8217;m talking about rushing, rushing to get to the gate, pushing ahead to get your ticket scanned, rushing to get on board the flight, grumbling about there being a line.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/People-exiting-from-plane-photo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103 aligncenter" title="People-exiting-from-plane-photo" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/People-exiting-from-plane-photo.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="208" /></a></p>
<p>It makes no sense to us &#8211; we are all getting on the same plane, and there isn&#8217;t a prize or reason for anyone to be RUSHING onto a plane. It doesn&#8217;t get anyone anywhere any faster. In contrast, Stephen and I waited for the line to thin a little, then walked up to the gate, sauntered onto the plane, and calmly sat down to enjoy the flight. It certainly felt good, and started the flight on a great note!</p>
<p>Stephen and I aren&#8217;t dawdlers, and we certainly like being efficient and for processes such as travel to be smooth and swift. But the rush doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense. Have we become so full of stress in our daily lives that we must rush to whatever it is? Have we forgotten that competition and jostling ahead simply aren&#8217;t important in some applications and scenarios in life?</p>
<p>Worse, do we rush and push and jostle because we have lost an ability to ascertain when urgency simply isn&#8217;t necessary?</p>
<p>We live in an instant world, and in a modern one where every system is planned to happen smoothly and efficiently. No one likes the people who hold everything up for their seeming inability to be on time. But there are instances when we don&#8217;t need the stress and impatience that comes with rushing and this is one of those times.</p>
<p>It made me think about all the other times in my daily life when I rush, but there isn&#8217;t a need to do so. Such as when I am getting ready for bed (the act of brushing my teeth and washing my face sometimes feels like a sprint!). Or when I&#8217;m pouring my morning coffee, or preparing my breakfast. Even the constant rushing 2 minutes before I leave the house, tearing around finding my keys and locking the door with haste.</p>
<p>Unfailingly though, I rush through these simple processes when I often don&#8217;t have to, just by habit, whether I&#8217;m running late or not. I made a mental note to slow things down a little bit and enjoy the simple acts a little bit more. I&#8217;m sure life will be that little bit less harried and stressful for it!</p>
<p>What are some of the things you subconsciously rush through in your daily life? Do you think it would help to savour the moments a little bit more and be attentive to the process? Please share!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am always incredulous at the seemingly ever-elastic nature of the human mind &#8211; every time we come across a new experience, we open ourselves up to new opportunity for growth and learning.</p>
<p>When we experience an intense learning experience such as a conference, retreat, course or camp, endorphins rush through us and a heightened sensation of wonderment abounds, due to this mind-stretching phenomena. Those of us who ensure our daily lives are sources of education benefit from this mind stretching as much as any muscle in your body benefits from daily exercise!</p>
<p>Most recently, I taught an <a href="http://www.cae.edu.au/web/?class=SRV56408" target="_blank">iPad for Seniors</a> course at the <a href="http://www.cae.edu.au/web/" target="_blank">CAE, Melbourne</a>. The class was filled with over 60&#8242;s, and they were all clueless about technology but eager to learn. A couple of them had never even emailed or used a computer before, let alone understood what an iPad was to be used for besides viewing photos and books. What a great start to the day, being surrounded by such eager learners!</p>
<div id="attachment_63" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/28699_626529916871_1010512_35539618_7699423_n1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-63 " title="sharon pakir with ipad" src="http://www.thecapabilityproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/28699_626529916871_1010512_35539618_7699423_n1-225x300.jpg" alt="sharon pakir with ipad" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the day i bought this, i never realised i&#39;d be training others in its use!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the 3 hour session went on, I could see this lovely group grow more and more enamoured with the potential of their <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad?afid=p219|GOAU&amp;cid=AOS-AP-AU-Google-AA0000018661" target="_blank">iPads</a>, and rather than grow weary with exhaustion from the intensity of learning, they almost bloomed with energy. Their questions came faster and harder, their excitement and swooshing swiping fingers leaping away at their iPad screens, and the sparks in the room were flying with joy.</p>
<p>When the session ended, each person was incredulous that such technology existed, and they were all passionate about learning even more. We all lamented that the course had to come to an end, and they firmly expressed their happiness at their new gadget that rendered them so connected and productive!</p>
<p>The thing is, it wasn&#8217;t just them that had their minds stretched, and their technology use empowered. What this class of people had taught me, in turn, is that the joy of learning never ends, at any age. They had shown me what a true commitment to learning could contribute to ones life, at any stage of it. They demonstrated that a willingness and receptiveness to learning could trump almost any impediment such as ignorance, and in doing so, stretched MY mind and inspired me to be a lifelong learner myself.</p>
<p>When&#8217;s the last time your mind got stretched in this wonderful way? When&#8217;s the last time you walked out of a learning experience, tingling with excitement, bouncing up and down about the potential of the future, and committed to elevating your learning journey to new levels? I would love to hear about it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my travels, I get the opportunity to talk to learners of various sports and activities, from dance to sport, from academic pursuers to lifelong learners.</p>
<p>Here’s a little compilation of things that anyone seeking to learn a skill can pay attention to in order to increase their learning capability – what do I mean by this? Well there’s learning, and then there’s smart learning. There’s having a new skill then there’s applying a new skill effectively. There’s knowing your activity, and then there’s understanding the ways to excel in it. By increasing your capability as a learner, not just a doer of the activity, you will be able to learn better, DO more effectively, and deeply think about the emotional value you achieve from your hobby/passion!</p>
<p>Some of the things below may not be easy to think about or define clearly – we commit to most activities because we feel strongly emotionally bonded to them – and challenging they way you think/feel about any passion in order to surpass your current physical abilities, is arduous! It’s extremely hard to implement a lot of it as well, so for each item I’ve included a little action list, to help your thought process along.</p>
<h3>1. Choose your coach</h3>
<p>Many students stick with the first  teacher they ever had, without trying anyone else, for reasons of comfort and familiarity. Some students stick with their coach because they are encouraging and nurturing. Some don’t leave their instructors despite them not being supportive, because they feel too fearful of the unknown.</p>
<p>A good coach will not just nurture you, nor would a good coach encourage you to never learn from anyone else. Find a coach who will give you honest feedback, who would be proud of you if you ever surpassed them, rather than feel threatened. Find an instructor who not only has genuine passion but also a personal commitment to their own continuous improvement. <strong>Experience challenges – do not go to a school where you are constantly lauded for being good  – find a space where you can consistently be pushed to higher levels.</strong></p>
<p>A good coach always pushes you hard, whilst being supportive. A great coach gives you consistent and thoughtful feedback without putting you down. A fabulous coach pushes themselves harder than they push you. An amazing coach teaches you to analyse the issues in your own skills so you can do effective self training. Find a coach that inspires you, and that you can trust 100%. <strong>Always have a coach, no matter how good you are – you are never beyond needing a coach, even when you are beyond needing a teacher. Note that most professionals have a coach themselves.</strong></p>
<p><em>Actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Make a list of the qualities you want in a coach, and those you don’t desire</em></li>
<li><em>Make a list of the feelings you want to experience when walking out of a great training session</em></li>
<li><em>Have a think about whether you are experiencing the above right now</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Establish Peer Reviews</h3>
<p>Find a group of peers whom you can practice with. Meet regularly, whether it’s at a social event, you rent an appropriate space, or have a picnic in a park, and not just DO the activity blindly, but also give each other salient feedback over a drink after.</p>
<p><em>Discuss</em> what you’ve learnt in class that week, provide information on other teachers, schools, events, and more. Discussion and community sharing is one of the best proven ways to improve knowledge dramatically, and contact and feedback is the quickest way to improve.<strong> Talking about the activity and its techniques is certainly a fantastic way to understand the intricacies of it better, and allowing your mind to explore and embrace the ideas behind certain skills.</strong></p>
<p><em>Actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Write a few friends from the community an email, and  organise to have an activity like dinner.</em></li>
<li><em>Outline the kind of feedback you want about your skill, and explain your reasons for wanting peer review.</em></li>
<li><em>Talk about the best classes you’ve experienced lately and ask them for theirs.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Learn to learn</h3>
<p>Learning how to look at yourself and your instructor, and get maximum benefit from understanding what to look for, is a skill in itself. I call this “<em>learning to learn</em>” – where you get taught about how to be an effective learner of any sport/activity, and I frequently spend time in class going over this technique of learning to learn. <strong>Everyone knows one person who seems to pick everything up quicker – it’s not necessarily about innate talent – often, it’s because that person understands how to learn effectively.</strong></p>
<p>Book a session in with your instructor to simply teach you about HOW they personally analyse you, and then watch yourself and your coach in a mirror, on camera, or self analyse on paper, and quickly imitate the analytical actions involved. This session should cover what the instructor is looking at how to improve your form and knowledge, as well as skills. This one session will change the way you think of learning, and ensure that you get huge mileage out of any classes you attend from now onwards!</p>
<p><em>Actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Book in a lesson with your instructor and ask for a lesson in how you can learn more effectively</em></li>
<li><em>Write down the things you would like to change in your own skill level, and spend some time after each class/activity self-analysing as though you are your own coach.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Watch yourself</h3>
<p>So many people hate watching themselves on video or in a mirror, or hate reviewing their own work – I’m one of them too! Watching yourself though, is the single most underrated thing in learning anything. It’s also the single hardest thing to do when reviewing your improvements/issues. In the past, I have asked friends or team mates to video each other.  I also have recommended my students video themselves doing a routine after a class, so they can firstly have a record of what they learnt, but also have immediate comparison to how it looked when the instructors demonstrated it. This will give you incredible ability to identify issues as they are happening, and correct them with ease.</p>
<p><em>Actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Watch the videos/read your work/listening to a recording, and as you evaluate, jot down anything of interest  - what you liked, what you didn’t like. At the end, explore the overall feeling you had about your experience, and decide the main things to work on.</em></li>
<li><em>Every 3-4 months, rinse &amp; repeat. Reflection is so important!</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Find Joy</h3>
<p>I nearly titled this “BE INSPIRED”, however rephrased it to reflect what I think is an often overlooked aspect of learning can be – finding joy. This can take many forms – sometimes you may spend so long working so hard on a skill that you lose enthusiasm. Sometimes you may feel jaded by the community, your progress, the lack of inspiration around you. You might feel bored by what you are working on, or feel that you’ve lost your mojo. These are all extremely common, and you are not alone.</p>
<p>My tactic – is to find joy. Rather than describe it more, here’s your action plan. <strong>Follow it, and remember all the simple things that drove you to this activity in the first place. I’ll bet my bottom dollar that it will re-ignite your passion for learning faster than anything else.</strong></p>
<p><em>Actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Find joy in watching absolute beginners getting it so wrong that they are hysterically giggling, and remember when that was you.</em></li>
<li><em>Find happiness in screaming and cheering on a group of peers doing your activity, no matter what or who it is. Go nuts being a great audience.</em></li>
<li><em>Do a beginners class and remember the joys of learning simple things.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this list has been helpful – becoming a good learner of any skill/activity whilst maintaining your enjoyment of it, and keeping clear goals, is not easy, and is certainly a reason that many people experience burnout or a dip in passion when they become intermediate or advanced at learning something. Having simple mindsets such as the above can hugely assist in clearing your mind and allowing you to focus on the activity itself, whilst staying an extremely effective learner!</p>
