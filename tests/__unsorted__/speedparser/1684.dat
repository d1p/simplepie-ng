In an eastbound context, Yampai marks the end of the Yampai Canyon and from here BNSFâ€™s trackage descend towards Pica and into Aubrey Valley for the run to Seligman. Yampai is rather remote yet offers some compelling opportunities, depending on local road and lighting conditions, so I wanted to try my luck there&#8230;

At this point we didn&#8217;t have any particular destination in mind. Rather, we knew the route we wanted to travel though. We wanted to stay on Route 66, which follows the BNSF&#8217;s Seligman Subdivision, as it meanders through some of the most beautiful scenery in northern Arizona. Interstate 40 takes a more direct and southernly route from Seligman directly to Kingman, Arizona. We were taking the road less traveled&#8230;

We had spent some time there on previous trips but we only used Seligman as a base for operations and we never really spent time photographing the area. I knew there were some nice spots with a lot of potential so we left Crookton and drove the few miles west to Seligman to get a spot for the night&#8230;

After I awoke and as I made a quick walk around the area where we camped, surveying for animal tracks as much as looking for a good shot, I thought of the today&#8217;s plan. We are now fairly far removed from all the trappings of a modern society. &#8220;No billboards, no buildings, no graffiti, no power lines &#8212; nothing to spoil a scene,&#8221; I pondered&#8230;

According to my original plans we were due to spend the day shooting the area around Eagle Nest and Double A. Since we were not even near Double A yet, I felt tense because that meant something must give in our schedule. I preferred it to be those areas we had visited before so we headed west on I-40 towards Williams, Arizona to try to get back on schedule&#8230;

So after leaving the observatory we headed west on I-40 in search of a place to park for the night. We opted to just spend the night at the Pilot Travel Center at Bellemont, Arizona. This seemed as good of a place as any as it afforded us a chance to top off the tanks and do some shopping to augment our stores. No time for a traditional dinner tonight so we just grabbed some McDonalds and called it a night&#8230;

Considering the hotel&#8217;s history, a place for weary travelers of the Santa Fe Railway Company to get some rest and good eats, this is by design. As such, the grounds provide a welcome sign of sorts admist the parch and arid landscape in this part of northern Arizona. Butted up against the platforms of the Winslow Amtrak station, a semi-circular brick plaza morphs into a walkway that leads directly to a portico and the lobby of the hotel. Today, as it was then, this area serves as fantastic train watching vantage point complete with wood rocking chairs for the guests to rock their cares away as they watch the parade of trains, from all points east and west, go by&#8230;

The view from the eastern side of the overpass is less spectacular but similar&#8230;
