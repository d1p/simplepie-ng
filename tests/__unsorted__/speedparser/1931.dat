			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In some parts of the world, lengthy conversations are still being  held on the subject of persuading clients to devote enough budget to  digital. In light of past battles nearly won, it&#8217;s particularly  maddening that some paid search campaign managers seem so bent on  handcuffing their own accounts, that they are limiting their upside  through a process of excessive filtering.</p>
<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s important to use a means of excluding unwanted  traffic - such as keyword exclusions (negative keywords). But it&#8217;s also  important that overall campaign strategy be driven by a game plan rather  than fear or &#8220;best practices&#8221; hearsay. You&#8217;re in advertising, not  corporate security. If you feel like your whole job is to keep &#8220;bad&#8221;  clicks away from the website, chances are you&#8217;re over-filtering.</p>
<p>Some clients - indeed, more than half - will be timid and will go about trying new things in accounts slowly. And that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>A select few clients will be gunslingers, aggressive marketers who actually love to try new things.</p>
<p>But never, ever should the agency or expert over-filter on behalf of  the client without being absolutely certain that the client is as  conservative as one might assume.</p>
<p>In platforms like AdWords, we&#8217;ve been handed wonderful tools to get  very granular in excluding certain keyword phrases and display network  sources (and other segments) that are almost certainly bad bets to  convert for the target market. From this simple principle inevitably  grew overkill. Instead of focusing on the business reasons for  filtering, some marketers focused on to-do lists (to look busy); exotic  strategies (to look &#8220;advanced&#8221;); and scare tactics (to win business or  to sell a new tool). And instead of seeing Google&#8217;s machine-learning  capabilities in keyword match typing and display network placement  (expanded broad match in search and automatic matching in the display  network) as broadly positive developments with some negative elements  that require hand-tweaking, some marketers have chosen to outright  reject them and see only negative aspects.</p>
<p>And so the negative keyword lists and publisher exclusions lists  grew. And grew and grew and grew. And sometimes they were misapplied to  the whole campaign when applying them at the ad group level would have  sufficed.</p>
<p>Sure! Powerful machine learning by the world&#8217;s largest technology  company, using the world&#8217;s largest dataset, is 100 percent worthless!  You should filter as much as you can by hand, and when that fails, get  other computers involved to counteract Google&#8217;s computers, willy-nilly.  You should make your account into one big filter.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are three main drawbacks to this over-filtering bias:</p>
<ol>
<li>You limit volume potential and total profit overall.</li>
<li>Because you artificially create a narrower universe, but forget just  how narrow you made it (and why), when it comes time to look for  creative ways to expand that finite volume (like when the client asks  for more, more, more), the &#8220;out of the box&#8221; means of boosting volume you  come up with turn out to be worse than some good potential traffic that  was right under your nose. (Specifically, &#8220;so-so&#8221; phrases that you&#8217;ve  so hastily negatived out, or &#8220;so-so&#8221; publishers that you&#8217;ve excluded,  might have served some purpose to the business - moreso than grasping at  straws for unproven keywords or new, exotic channels.)</li>
<li>What I like to call the &#8220;short leash problem.&#8221; When you try to  anticipate and react to every possible poor-performing segment (and  sub-sub-sub-segment), your analysis is actually getting too granular,  and your assumptions, too causal. Mathematically, if you slice and dice  everything enough, something will be coming in last place - often for no  good reason. The upside of using a broader approach is that you keep  your options open for random good luck. This approach may lead to more  learning, and in the end, more volume and total profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>There may even be deep-seated reasons we get addicted to the short  leash. Economists explain the behavior as &#8220;myopic loss aversion,&#8221; and it  can <a href="http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/2/647.abstract" target="_blank">affect</a> investment returns.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. One day, you lost a mitten. When you&#8217;re five  years old, that&#8217;s bound to happen. But for some reason, the adult brain  sees this loss as a significant moral failing and a potential threat to  the family&#8217;s future financial viability. You&#8217;d hear about it over and  over again, with constant warnings to &#8220;never&#8221; lose a mitten again  (thinking in terms of absolutes), or worse, be fitted with &#8220;idiot  strings&#8221; to ensure the security of your personal hand-warming equipment  (shaming). You&#8217;d think that after years of training, and in an adult  scenario that involves a mandate for profit maximization, it wouldn&#8217;t be  hard to drop the baggage. But it is! Too easily, &#8220;should&#8221; and &#8220;ought&#8221;  creep into our decision-making in ways that aren&#8217;t synonymous with &#8220;the  predicted return on investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to advise Google that it&#8217;s going about something  in the &#8220;wrong&#8221; way, or asked it to define exactly what a valid or  invalid click is, you know that Google and its computers don&#8217;t think in  terms of good and evil. Catchy slogans (&#8221;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221;) are basically  red herrings; they are not, in any shape or form, Google policy.</p>
<p>One way of looking at the Google world of data-driven success is to  say that &#8220;Google is like a baby&#8217;s brain&#8221; (terms used by one Googler  attempting to explain the company&#8217;s apparent managerial chaos). Systems  are built to absorb and learn at a breathtaking pace, just by &#8220;taking it  all in&#8221; and letting the &#8220;brain&#8221; do what it does best - compute,  iterate, and develop more complexity in responses than could be possible  through a deliberate effort to &#8220;plan.&#8221; In fact, the &#8220;baby&#8217;s brain&#8221;  analogy is a compliment to Google, at least in moral terms. A baby is  much more judgmental and discerning than a machine-learning system. As  inhuman as it may sound, machine learning works at its breathtaking best  when it&#8217;s free of moral baggage.</p>
<p>Take a concrete example. Why prejudge a certain publisher in the  display network because it&#8217;s a &#8220;certain type of site&#8221;? Just let the  machines run and cut off the non-performers at a predetermined point. It  could be that you get 200 clicks on a &#8220;silly&#8221; travel site for the same  price as you pay for 30 clicks on the &#8220;serious&#8221; one, so the two turn out  to be equally good buys.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should avoid excluding keyword phrases that &#8220;might not  be exactly&#8221; what is being searched for. What if they aid in research  stage awareness, or convert occasionally? Exclude away if the data look  pitiful. But please don&#8217;t leap into a <em>priori</em> negativing-out of  phrases including things like &#8220;recipes,&#8221; &#8220;cheap,&#8221; &#8220;directions,&#8221;  &#8220;software,&#8221; etc. just because these are slightly off your desired  micro-intent. Try keeping them hanging around a little longer to see if  they convert occasionally. Or try different ad groups, landing pages,  and creative for different types of intent.</p>
<p>In some cases, you&#8217;ll make some amazing discoveries. We&#8217;ve discovered  that searchers interested in high-volume orders actually use a variety  of different signifiers, and they&#8217;re all seeking slightly different  things (most of them being some form of bulk order). But at first  glance, some of the words (&#8221;wholesale,&#8221; let&#8217;s say) appear to convert  poorly. Until you solve the puzzle, the tight-leash, exclude-whole-hog  mentality appears sound, but it doesn&#8217;t correspond well with the broader  potential inherent in the search behavior.</p>
<p>To be sure, you&#8217;ll still want to use your human judgment to see  patterns and to adjust slightly to taste. Just don&#8217;t overdo it. And try  using rounds of lower bidding (signifying something that is <em>worth less</em> to you) rather than exclusions (signifying that the source is literally <em>worthless</em> to you).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relevance in search means a lot of things to a lot of people. Information retrieval scientists right down to the average user of a search engine might think there is quite a lot to determining what is &#8220;relevant&#8221; to any given user on any given query. There is. Although by no means scientific, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors">SEOmoz&#8217;s annual review</a> of what experts think are factors determining search ranking</p>
<p>So when organic search principles seemed to be seeping into paid search programs, many observers read a lot more into the terminology than really should be read, it seems.</p>
<p>Remembering back to the launch of AdWords Select in 2002, Google explicitly defined the AdRank formula as your Max Bid on a keyword multiplied by CTR. They referred to this as rewarding more relevant ads. Indeed, at times they displayed a green bar denoting &#8220;user interest.&#8221; What was relevance, or &#8220;user interest&#8221;? It was synonymous with &#8220;clicks.&#8221; More clicks, higher ad rank.</p>
<p>Enter Quality Score, circa 2005, and several updates of it since. A whole industry has arisen trying to deciphering it.</p>
<p>Some Google documentation refers to &#8220;relevance,&#8221; &#8220;the quality of the landing page,&#8221; &#8220;other relevance factors,&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>But for years, key architects and managers of the AdWords product have quietly counseled people not to go overboard in interpreting these definitions.</p>
<p>Nick Fox, one of the leading pioneers in the AdWords program, used to remind us that the various other &#8220;relevance factors&#8221; were mostly &#8220;different cuts at&#8221; either predicting or reflecting the same measure of relevance&#8230; that being clicks, or CTR.</p>
<p>At SMX East last week, in our session on AdWords best practices, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fvallaeys">Fred Vallaeys</a> flatly stated that by so-called &#8220;relevance,&#8221; Google basically means clicks.</p>
<p>It might sound really cool to try to divine how Google assesses information and scent, and user satisfaction all the purchase cycle, from ad impression, to click, to landing page, to further activity on site. It might be neat to guess at the semantics and other technology involved in &#8220;other relevance factors.&#8221; But in terms of the overall weighting in the vast majority of cases, as Vallaeys implied, these things might as well not exist. Google counts clicks. They may count them relative to the situation, normalize them for match type, etc. etc., but that&#8217;s what we mean by &#8220;relevance&#8221; here.</p>
<p>Another thing Vallaeys said (agreed on by many of us over the years) is that you shouldn&#8217;t be slavishly pursuing this click goal at all costs. You pick the ad, the segment, the bid, the match type, etc., that ultimately returns the best ROI for you. So in other words, Google rewards x, and you should be generally mindful of it, but ultimately pursue y.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why, then, do we devote so much time in these sessions to Quality Score, when so many other things are so much more important?,&#8221; asked an attendee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because people want us to,&#8221; replied a panelist.</p>
<p>The truth about how to outperform the competition in the AdWords auction is not simple. But it&#8217;s also true that the &#8220;Quality Score industry&#8221; benefits from overcomplicating things and in many cases, misleading people about how Quality Score works. Also, like too many SEO&#8217;s, Quality Score pundits offer too much speculation about components of the formula, instead of sticking to what is known to be true.</p>
<p>Displayed Quality Score, like toolbar PageRank, has a seemingly endless capacity to bamboozle. It&#8217;s time to give it a rest, at least in the general marketing industry dialogue.</p>
<p>Knowing the ins and outs of the formula helps me quite a bit in my job, but I don&#8217;t think these lengthy dissections of it in public forums are as helpful as many speakers hope. I vow to pare back my treatment of QS in the future, and to focus on the most helpful tips and heuristic uses.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While search marketing has often been lauded for its killer ROI  and – especially on the paid search side – its incredible capacity for  fine-tuning and testing, its cousin on the display side hasn&#8217;t always  attained the same standard. Perhaps because of past miserable failures,  some advocates for the display side simply issued it a different  rulebook. Why should it be expected to &#8220;perform,&#8221; when it clearly can&#8217;t?</p>
<p>But what if it can? What if there&#8217;s a good chunk of the display world  that needs to be tested, optimized, iterated, and forced to run the  same gantlet as &#8220;performance media&#8221; like search advertising and  affiliate marketing?</p>
<p>Too often, display advertising has been coddled like a supermodel:  allowed to swan in late to the shoot; paid exorbitant sums for  lackadaisical performance…as long as it looks good, someone will go to  bat for it and it will get a repeat engagement somewhere.</p>
<p>Paid search ads, meanwhile, have been like James Brown, the  &#8220;hardest-working man in show business.&#8221; Singing, dancing, sweating…there  isn&#8217;t anything paid search ads won&#8217;t do to make the paying customers  happy.</p>
<p>Chalk it up to the guilty consciences of publishers and their trade  group partners who secretly don&#8217;t think their display advertising is  capable of performing. As a result, they overcompensate with elaborate  measures of brand lift and other indirect metrics. Spokespersons like  comScore&#8217;s executive chairman, Gian Fulgoni, are congenitally squirmy  about true performance measures. Keynoting recently at an IAB Canada  industry event, Fulgoni thundered that it&#8217;s time we stopped counting the  click as a meaningful measure of ad performance.</p>
<p>The click! Call us crazy for still believing that a click may be the  first step in getting someone to, you know, visit your website.</p>
<p>Ironically, speakers following Fulgoni earnestly reported not only  impressive CTRs (click-through rates), but on-target CPAs (cost per  acquisitions) on recent campaign efforts. Recalling the keynote, they&#8217;d  hasten to add &#8220;with all due respect to Gian Fulgoni&#8217;s point…in a lot of  ways we agree that performance measurement needs to get beyond the  click.&#8221; Sure. But there has to be some reason you brought your CTRs to  the table.</p>
<p>For avid search marketers, the most comfortable place to start in a  renewed quest to expand out to display advertising is often the Google  AdWords Display Network (formerly called the content network). The  principles (and the cookies served to those who visit your site after  the click) have much in common with your search campaigns in AdWords.</p>
<p>Two types of advertisers today are paying particular attention to display ads as an additional means of customer acquisition.</p>
<p>1) Traditional e-commerce players, steeped in the measurement of ROAS  (return on ad spend) on all segments of their search keyword marketing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing that a significant amount of content has evolved on the  web that appears well-aligned with the vast universe of e-commerce  sellers. It&#8217;s not as easy to find high-intent prospects reading content  as it is when they search directly for your products. The ecosystem has  been self-optimizing to a degree because relevant publishers are  increasingly incentivized through improving AdSense revenues, and  irrelevant ones&#8217; earnings are dropping.</p>
<p>These websites have to build their audiences somehow. It doesn&#8217;t come  out of thin air. Well, because they offer large amounts of relevant –  and often practical and action-oriented – content, many of them do  pretty well in organic search results. The fact that they can &#8220;monetize&#8221;  the traffic keeps them in business, and allows advertisers to continue  facilitating that monetization.</p>
<p>In other words, these aren&#8217;t just random matching algorithms going  bump in the night; this is an increasingly organized and predictable  ecosystem involving symbiotic relationships. Advertisers hope that the  &#8220;go-to&#8221; conversion-driving publishers in the Display Network continue to  succeed in building their audiences.</p>
<p>A fascinating development – completely overlooked by the SEO  community and the journalistic outsiders commenting on Google&#8217;s harsh  treatment of some content sites in its recent Panda update – is that  websites like Suite101.com, About.com, Squidoo, eHow.com, Answers.com,  and many others continue to drive strong conversion volumes in AdWords  Display Network stats. These sites were supposedly &#8220;hammered&#8221; by the  Panda update, and that supposedly happened because they offer too much  useless, regurgitated, rapidly-written content. Well, they certainly  haven&#8217;t dropped off the map as far as our e-commerce clients are  concerned. They may not be the highest-quality publishers in the world,  but in a world short on quality content across many subject areas, they  are often &#8220;good enough.&#8221; Indeed, their visitors appear to be more  transactionally-oriented than they would be on high-minded &#8220;quality&#8221;  websites.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes – although the user behavior dynamic is  significantly different – the way that e-commerce publishers use Display  Network is often similar to the way they use search. You can tweak bids  on segments like publishers, exclude publishers and pages you don&#8217;t  like, try additional targeting refinements such as demographic-based  bidding, and more. And the key metrics (CTR, CPA, and average order  size; by ad, source, ad group, etc.) look or can be made to look more or  less identical to the metrics you&#8217;re tracking on the search side. Sure,  if you&#8217;ve got fancy attribution models, you might give the display ads  additional credit beyond directly attributable performance. But the  point is, you can compare apples to apples. For many advertisers, that&#8217;s  very reassuring.</p>
<p>Such advertisers simply aren&#8217;t listening to all of the exhortations  about how you&#8217;re supposed to treat display radically different from  search, and maintain different expectations for it. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t  get the memo. Or perhaps they&#8217;re onto something.</p>
<p>2) Aggressive CPA-focused advertisers who have been mainly rewarding  performance in their interactions with publishers and marketing  tacticians. Rather than being willing to pay for clicks, they generally  &#8220;pay out&#8221; on a CPA basis to affiliates, websites, and networks. Yet some  of the tactics (like aggressive pop-ups, spyware, etc.) employed by  publisher sites in the past are drying up because users are rebelling.  So now, they are looking into compromise solutions that tap into more  mainstream forms of display advertising. Because a number of channels  now subject display ads to Quality Score algorithms analogous to those  employed on paid search platforms, advertisers may be able to increase  delivery and lower costs by optimizing for relevancy to get ahead of  less diligent competitors.</p>
<p>For CPA-obsessed performance marketers, the inventory and methodology  used by traditional e-commerce players may not apply as well. Instead  of hoping that Google&#8217;s probabilistic matching technology will find them  high-intent matches across many good-quality content sites of all  stripes, they may be dialed into a vertical such as gaming, targeted  mainly at males in the 15-29 demographic. Here, the campaign deployment  may be quite different. A traditional &#8220;Automated Placements&#8221; campaign,  corresponding with keyword terms that are literally being searched for,  may not be the way to go. The secret is that the demographic is so large  and that there is so much relevant content to sort through, the  potential is huge but the process of sorting out high-intent (and  deep-pocketed) customers from low-intent audience members is going to be  more daunting and more meticulous – and yes, it will definitely involve  new channels like YouTube. Large effort, but great rewards, to the  companies that can crack that nut.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my wish for your ROI-focused display ads in the latter half of  2011. You&#8217;ll add profitable volume to your campaigns, and – like the  hardest working man in show business – be moved to exclaim &#8220;so good, so  good, I got you…HEY!!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is approximately one way they can effectively do this. That is: be acquired by Google.</p>
<p>Another approach might have been to think of some other way to grow than to indiscriminately acquire spambox signups in the hundreds of millions without pausing to assess profitability. But when you&#8217;re Groupon, &#8220;pausing,&#8221; even for a breath, is not on the agenda.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s post, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/08/the-web-hates-typography.html">Seth Godin argues</a> that we can be lulled into settling for blah layouts and fonts because (after all) companies like Google, eBay, and Craigslist have treated them as an afterthought, and they&#8217;ve been wildly successful.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question he&#8217;s right. Trying to strip every element of marketing down to the bone is a kind of purists&#8217; mentality. And in a world of profit margins, finite consumer mindshare, (or selling B2B &#8220;connections and comfort&#8221;), there is little room for purists. Apple has proven this in spades.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a purist? There are many kinds. A purist is someone who insists that the world should have stopped in 1982 (remember, the year the disco-had-lost-all-its-charm-for-you). When no recreational cross-country skiers existed who did not have a working knowledge of how to apply the correct wax to a ski. When no race was held using anything other than &#8220;classic&#8221; technique, since &#8220;skating&#8221; hadn&#8217;t been invented yet. Today, most recreational Nordic skiers (especially those renting them) use waxless skis (as crappy as they may be). Most racers (and not a few novices) prefer to speed along on &#8220;skating&#8221; skis as opposed to fussing with classic technique. I&#8217;m perfectly happy with the 1982 world of cross-country skiing. I like wax. I like classic style. But if I were running a chalet or a retail store, as a purist, I&#8217;d be out of business.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advertising&#8221; may be the cost of creating unremarkable products, as some have said. Then again, it&#8217;s a cost many are willing to incur. And do we count basic communications and imagery (storytelling and positioning) as &#8220;wasteful&#8221; and superfluous or as part of the deal?</p>
<p>If you can ignore the &#8220;soft edges&#8221; elements of communication and still succeed, chances are you&#8217;re doing something very, very well. Or had great timing. But it&#8217;s not good advice to ignore them. Think of all the startups who have had meetings where they say &#8220;Craigslist was fine with this design, so let&#8217;s not think about it.&#8221; Where are they now?</p>
<p>Probably the best read on this subject is - yes - by Godin: All Marketers Are Liars (rebranded, ultimately, to the more apt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Marketers-Liars-Preface-Works/dp/1591843030">All Marketers Tell Stories</a>). It helped me understand that Starbucks had subtly and steadily painted its own little universe. Something for your mind to wrap around, not unlike a Disneyland of caffeine, while you decided whether to part with $4 for that mocchacino.</p>
<p>Starbucks<em> isn&#8217;t</em> just a building you go to to get some brown liquid, served up dutifully by adequate help. It&#8217;s a story.</p>
<p>Technology companies create &#8220;operating systems&#8221;. An operating system can be formally defined in a few ways, roughly as an environment that allows us to complete work and tasks using apps. What an operating system doesn&#8217;t have to be is compelling. But if it isn&#8217;t compelling, then it must at least become a standard (lest it become too easy to switch). In other words, if you ignore &#8220;compelling,&#8221; your business must be or become so strong that it becomes a de facto standard! Turns out even the mighty Craigslist never got to that point.</p>
<p>Remember DOS? Remember the Apple TV spots of long ago that made fun of the poor users who had received PC&#8217;s as Christmas presents, and were now trying to set it up? &#8220;C. Colon. Backslash&#8230;,&#8221; said the hapless Dad, in a flat voice. No one&#8217;s enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Sure, your products may work. But insofar as you can take them into the realm of a pleasant, social, or forward-looking environment &#8212; you create a compelling &#8220;place&#8221; for your customers to be. Getting out of &#8220;C-Colon-Backslash&#8221; and into something slightly warmer, something slightly larger. That&#8217;s a marketing challenge worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Is there some truth in the opposite insight, too? Certainly there is. Consumers are exposed to more information today, and many stories won&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny. They&#8217;re more likely to discount brands and try to see through to the raw material behind it. If the quest for some authentic story can&#8217;t be pursued right through, that&#8217;s lip gloss, not marketing something authentic. That might work in some industries, but not all. Don&#8217;t try to sell me ibuprofen with commercials and fancy images &#8212; it&#8217;s just ibuprofen and I want to get it as cheaply as I can. As Godin has said in speeches: &#8220;I solved my pain reliever problem 25 years ago. I use the one in the yellow bottle. The generic!&#8221; He&#8217;s never wrong.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1308662">recent information</a>, the option to use the polygon tool should already have been removed from AdWords for new campaigns.</p>
<p>One of the quietest Google announcements in history, it seems that a widely used targeting tool (often touted as a major advantage over competitors) is simply going to be taken down (arrrgh!).</p>
<p>Existing polygons will be served until the end of 2011.</p>
<p>Seeing this, I assumed Google&#8217;s replacement for this would be ever more adoption of Google Places, location extensions, and other elements of Google&#8217;s current local strategy. But the polygon has its own uses. So that was a complete arrrrgh!</p>
<p>But &#8230; it seems that the radius capability will still be available, which was what we all used originally before the polygons rolled out. So phhheww!</p>
<p>The question is why? Why remove polygons, and why keep the radii?</p>
<p>Our real concern should be that the other shoe will drop in 2012, and it will be bye-bye, radii.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: no brain cells were used in the creation of this post.</em></p>
<p><em>*** INSIDE BASEBALL ALERT &#8212; IF NAME-DROPPING OFFENDS YOU, LEAVE NOW!</em></p>
<p>As our industry matures, I sometimes find myself asking: &#8220;Where has the fun gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another question I ask, when I look back on something that happened to us &#8220;a couple of years ago,&#8221; is &#8220;what!! how did seven years go by that fast!?&#8221;</p>
<p>In this case I&#8217;m referring, of course, to Meredith A. Roth&#8217;s infamous &#8220;<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2004/07/prweb144533.htm">worst dressed list</a>&#8221; for the &#8220;best brains&#8221; in search marketing, which came out at SES San Jose just over <strong><em>seven</em></strong> years ago. As a hook, it wasn&#8217;t bad: a geek-focused Mr. Blackwell on heels. Had skins been thicker and the tone less catty, this thing could have had legs.</p>
<p>Getting on the list could have been seen as a form of flattery, but at the time, few if any of those making the list reported being flattered. That despite a somewhat flattering intro:</p>
<blockquote><p><span><em>Wanna hook up with the smartest people in the Search Engine Marketing biz? Look for the worst dressed. It&#8217;s SEO Tip number one: The brains of Search Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization are sartorially challenged.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>As Ms. Roth so dismissively chose to focus on list members&#8217; external appearance, I figured it might be worthwhile to check in on how those making the list of fared in their attempts to piece a career together&#8230; and, how are they dressing these days?</p>
<p>One inescapable conclusion seems to be that there was something to the notion that eventually, no matter who you are, you gotta clean up. And&#8230; could Ms. Roth have had an actual<em> influence</em> on these folks&#8217; wardrobe strategies?</p>
<p>Here goes, with a recap of the unlucky winners, in reverse order.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://thirddoormedia.com/team#csherman">Chris Sherman</a>. Chris was tagged as a devotee of &#8220;business-too-casual.&#8221; This jab didn&#8217;t make much of a dent in Chris&#8217;s way of life. All he&#8217;s done since is continue to lead the industry as a partner in Third Door Media, Executive Editor of Search Engine Land, and author. What people don&#8217;t realize is Chris isn&#8217;t dressing for the conferences; he&#8217;s a true traveler who has been everywhere and needs to be ready with comfortable shoes and indestructible clothing to explore every corner of a city or the top of a mountain. Chris&#8217;s fast getaways are legendary and I&#8217;m lucky to count him as a great friend who will often take me along on the expedition.</p>
<p>9. <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/author/1754/greg-jarboe">Greg Jarboe</a>, the &#8220;bearded guy you&#8217;d vote least likely to be in public relations.&#8221; OK, but answer me this: have you heard of him? I thought so. Greg has been the backbone of many SES&#8217;s since, and has evolved his firm and himself, including expertise on YouTube strategies and a book to match. This despite the views of Ms. Roth and one senior executive from across the pond who (it can now be revealed) opined that &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to get Jarboe out of those horrible jumpers.&#8221;</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/about/#axzz1VELUrBUV">Bryan Eisenberg</a>. Have a good look at Bryan&#8217;s photo on his website. That&#8217;s the Bryan Eisenberg you see today. It&#8217;s undoubtedly true that the best revenge is living well. Some time after making the infamous list, Bryan embarked on a personal journey that included a weight loss in excess of 95 lbs. Formerly, he packed as much as 290 lbs. on his 6&#8242;2&#8243; frame. There is less of him to love now, but all of us who count him as a friend are happy that he&#8217;ll be around much longer to spellbind us with deep-seated understanding of the online user experience. And yes, as a result of all that, he has new clothes.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.search-usability.com/">Shari Thurow</a>, Karen Breen Vogel, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschinkel/1701958510/in/photostream/">Stacy Williams</a> were singled out for looking like a &#8220;PTA panel.&#8221; Not only did they maintain their high visibility in the industry, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve witnessed several rounds of shopping in the two of these three I know well. I guess we were all just too busy to dress ourselves in the old days. Not that we aren&#8217;t still busy. Shari, for one, has published a couple of books since her original groundbreaking work.</p>
<p>5. I&#8217;m pretty sure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Lloyd-Martin">Heather LLoyd-Martin</a> didn&#8217;t need any outside prompting to be aware of her &#8220;skirts being up to here&#8221; in 2004.</p>
<p>4. Detlev Johnson? Oh, what am I getting  myself into. Well suffice to say this: no one&#8217;s going to accuse <a href="http://www.searchreturn.com/">Disa Johnson</a> of looking like she is on a &#8220;PTA panel&#8221;.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.clickz.com/author/profile/1057/kevin-lee">Kevin Lee</a>&#8217;s success is obvious proof of the &#8220;wear your boothwear&#8221; strategy so derided by Ms. Roth. We assume that Kevin did not, nor did he wish to, show Ms. Roth whether the &#8220;Did-it duds came in undies too.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Industry maverick&#8221; <a href="http://www.clickz.com/author/profile/1092/mike-grehan">Mike Grehan</a> was singled out for his look being &#8220;100% spinal tap,&#8221; but &#8220;catch his session and you&#8217;ll be thoroughly entertained, enthralled, and educated.&#8221; Mike, tied for my very best friend in the industry, has certainly put on a show since. Ms. Roth wouldn&#8217;t have been the only one to kid him for his &#8220;look&#8221; at the time. Since becoming an avidly-shopping New Yorker, Mike has updated that look at least once. Today at the SES San Francisco show, he wins my award for &#8220;best dressed at the conference&#8221;. On top of the perfect suit and tie, I just need to know where to get a pair of those perfectly-matching shades. Since taking over the job as VP of Global Content for Incisive Media three years ago, Mike&#8217;s career dial has gone to &#8220;11.&#8221; According to his bio, Mike is supposedly releasing a new book this summer.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://daggle.com/">Danny Sullivan</a>. It seems such a long time ago that &#8220;vintage Danny&#8221; was &#8220;dressing British,&#8221; perhaps because he resided in a quaint village near Stonehenge and Madonna&#8217;s house and could only get to London occasionally for a quick dash into one of those stores that sold stuffy criss-cross ties meant to be worn with bespoke finery. Today, as we&#8217;re kept well aware by his <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dannysullivan">frequent tweets</a> and twitpics, Danny leads with California casual style from his rollerblading home base in Newport Beach, CA. In other words, the look that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> has unsuccessfully tried to copy. When you have a combined 200,000 in legit twitter followers, though, does it really look like anyone needs to copy anyone else?</p>
<p>This brings me to the subject matter of my next post: &#8220;facial hair of SEM top 10 list&#8221;. But this is for another time (and after I have six months to grow the beard).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Google AdWords rolled out its remarketing feature, many of us felt we&#8217;d stumbled on an exciting &#8212; but modest &#8212; new high-ROI targeting segment. By combining contextual targeting (keywords denoting which sites in the network our ads would show up on) with audiences (people who had done something in relation to your website in the past x days, cookied and followed around), suddenly these ads that generated some user complaints about &#8220;feeling stalked&#8221; were feeling like a pretty neat bonus for marketers, without being unduly intrusive. Early case studies showed ROI off the charts. On some accounts, as a result, we did a lot of this &#8212; implementing it carefully one ad group at a time.</p>
<p>At some point Google sent the word out to its reps, and through them, to agencies, that broader-based remarketing (no context, just audience, using impression caps if you like) was more practical. It offered wider reach. And if it wasn&#8217;t wide enough, we were given case studies that encouraged significant bid increases just to make sure you were &#8220;using it correctly&#8221; (paraphrasing here). These more general campaigns would work differently, but would move the needle more, and would be easier to implement.</p>
<p>It was at that point I felt that the majority of advertisers were being encouraged to bid unrealistically, in multiple dollars per click, on inventory that &#8212; while valuable &#8212; couldn&#8217;t support those levels when market forces (CPC&#8217;s and bid levels based on performance, and easy comparisons with other traffic in your account) kicked in.</p>
<p>Even with ongoing optimization, we weren&#8217;t finding the CPA&#8217;s quite within our target range. I imagine other advertisers are gradually coming to this conclusion. (And yes, the ROI for the original, narrower context-meets-audience version of this remains very high, so that&#8217;s a separate issue.)</p>
<p>This softness in demand for more general remarketing is indeed beginning to manifest itself. After several modest bid reductions for one retail client we work with in this area, we&#8217;ve recently seen no slackening of click volumes, and indeed a gradual improvement in ad position.</p>
<p>This smells every bid to me like the &#8220;reverse bidding wars&#8221; that we relish in this industry, that come along every so often until the bids reach a more realistic equilibrium.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-425" title="rmkt" src="http://blog.traffick.com/wp-content/uploads/rmkt.bmp" alt="rmkt" /></p>
<p>From time to time in this auction, market forces do work in our favor. And not even clever &#8220;best practices&#8221; Powerpoints from Google can keep us all overbidding forever.</p>
<p>Here are some stats in connection with this case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>In recent weeks, the ROAS on the generalized remarketing effort is 2.08 - below where we&#8217;d like to see it. The conversion rate is 5.3%. Healthy, but the low ROAS indicates we&#8217;re still paying a premium for this valuable inventory.</li>
<li>By contrast, display network clicks across the account have had an ROAS of 2.52 over the same period, despite a weaker 2.57% conversion rate &#8212; indicating more economical click prices.</li>
<li>The search inventory produces much better numbers than either of these.</li>
<li>View-through conversions are worth considering &#8212; all versions of display, including remarketing, do indirectly drive recall and sales. Hard to value precisely, though.</li>
<li>The original remarketing effort &#8212; the hybrid of context and audience (ad group by ad group remarketing, with keywords) &#8212; performs far better, with conversion rates 8-15% depending on the ad group, thus meriting high CPC&#8217;s.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simple takeaway is that the inventory is valuable and the technique offers much promise, but as with everything else, there is a market value for the clicks, and you can&#8217;t talk it up (or down) indefinitely. It will gravitate in the direction of its real worth.</p>
<p>As with other forms of interruption-based advertising (however targeted), the novelty effect wears off and the entry of more participants in a cluttered, finite sphere of user attention may also lead to gradual, or even sharp, declines in response rates and thus prices. That depends to a certain extent on how you use it, but it might also be a collective action problem. The Tragedy of the Commons applies to almost any ridiculously appealing, high-response form of advertising. What&#8217;s good for you is good for others, so the user can be bombarded with messages and begin to rebel.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In terms of sheer user adoption, Google+ may be the most successful online service launch. Recent estimates place the user base at 25 million. Now that&#8217;s a fast start. Any other company would have struggled mightily with capacity issues by now.</p>
<p>The service seems well received, even though (similar to Gmail) it only lightly innovates on top of an existing category. Why is it a game-changer? Because of its scale and not because of any revolution in user behavior.</p>
<p><strong>How Google+ Will Advance Display Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Google+ solves a real problem. It helps to advance online display ad targeting, which has had limited the company, and most advertisers, to date. Essentially, Google will now have full, opt-in access to your demographics, tastes, and behavior. Prior to this, Google, as well as other firms and advertisers, were almost there. Now, the more people that embrace Google+, the more fully this loop will be closed.</p>
<p>The analogy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile" target="_blank">last-mile</a> problem comes to mind. The last mile referred to the inadequate Internet connection from a person&#8217;s home to the larger, more sophisticated global network. As demand increased for faster home connections, innovation and investment followed despite a lack of elegant, efficient solutions. This is analogous to Google building an incredibly expensive social network just so it can close the attribution loop and create more fertile audiences for its existing advertising base. It&#8217;s a huge bet, but with a quantifiable payoff.</p>
<p><strong>Why Google+ Is Not Another Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Analysts and practitioners are already trying to guess at how Google will target advertising in this platform. Most are looking at Google+ as a copy of Facebook, but that&#8217;s not a good comparison. It&#8217;s not primarily about the ads that will show up inside Google+, though they will. It isn&#8217;t primarily about being able to take social targeting and target searchers, or searches, to target within social.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s biggest advance is the creation and maintenance of richer, more granular, and more predictable audiences for advertisers, allowing for better targeting of display advertising all over the digital universe. In many cases, of course, Google will split the proceeds with publishers, networks, and exchanges. But increasingly, advertisers will enjoy the benefit of doing more through a single platform - or at least fewer platforms.</p>
<p>How can Google accomplish all of this with a social network? With a single checkbox. The signup process for new users says it all: when signing up for Google+, you give Google permission to use your personal information &#8220;to personalise content and ads on non-Google websites.&#8221; It started out as a consequence of signing up for and using the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/profiles/bin/static.py?hl=en-GB&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=1364508&amp;answer=1152622&amp;rd=1" target="_blank">+1 button</a>. Now, signing up for Google+ accomplishes the same thing.</p>
<p>Is providing richer personal data through Google+ similar to Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;interest categories&#8221;? Potentially, it&#8217;s a lot more than that. You could deny Google this right by simply unchecking the box on sign-up. I&#8217;d love to see what percentage of Google+&#8217;s 25,000,000 users to date did so.</p>
<p>If Google can obtain this rich data about its users, it might continue to grow its top-line revenue and profit margin from display advertising; so display advertising wouldn&#8217;t look anemic compared to the cash cow, search. Compared with search, Google&#8217;s other advertising revenues (mainly, the display network) have limped along slowly, especially given the singular focus Google has put on widening its footprint over the past five years. Google&#8217;s very <a href="http://investor.google.com/earnings/2011/Q2_google_earnings.html">strong quarterly earnings report</a> released in July shows that non-Google sites account for only 31% of Google&#8217;s revenues (years ago, this proportion was a fair bit higher), and that 31% is won at significant cost by sharing a high percentage of revenues with AdSense partners, etc. Given that relatively weak performance, it isn&#8217;t out of line to assume that Google&#8217;s investment in Google+ has more to do further buttressing their lagging push into display advertising, as it does with Google really matching other social networks step for step on &#8220;sociability&#8221; or &#8220;cool factor,&#8221; whatever those mean anyway.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; social, say the critics. But they&#8217;re beginning to &#8220;work&#8221; social, and it&#8217;s not really clear that they care about &#8220;getting it.&#8221; That&#8217;s because they have some pretty focused business reasons for being there, and for Google, that&#8217;s good enough.</p>
<p><strong>Google+: Right Time, Right Place?</strong></p>
<p>Some suggest that pent-up demand for a Facebook alternative is driving Google+&#8217;s growth. Some prominent &#8220;socialites&#8221; have essentially left their Facebook presences dormant since the company&#8217;s high-profile privacy gaffes. Google is far from immune to criticism on the privacy front, but there is a collective feeling out there that veteran Googlers have taken their lumps, whereas Mark Zuckerberg is an untamed animal still on the loose with weaker adult supervision.</p>
<p>Privacy gaffes by Facebook as well as by Google (Buzz) seemed to change public expectations about privacy - or lack thereof. Interestingly, Google created something called a Hangout inside of Google+. No one is under the impression that he is going to &#8220;hang out&#8221; in these platforms in a genuine, unfettered way. Either your guard must be up permanently, or you must accept that people will know more about you as part of this new, more open way of life.</p>
<p>As if to make this point directly, on Google+, we see Googlers subtly training us to be &#8220;transparent.&#8221; A photo of Larry Page waterskiing received hundreds of comments.</p>
<p><strong>A Formidable Facebook Foe?</strong></p>
<p>Google eventually can benefit from operating the most functional, sophisticated advertising platform in the world. As a result, Facebook will face its first serious competition. Its advertiser platform is one-dimensional and behind schedule compared to Google&#8217;s multi-dimensional, highly evolved system.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s likely initial public offering - and all of the distractions that accompany IPOs, including departures by vested employees - poses another challenge to Facebook. (Google went through this already.)</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s other advantages over Facebook?</p>
<ul>
<li>Google&#8217;s slightly better reputation on privacy issues.</li>
<li>Its superior engineering talent that is helping to marry search with social with local with photos and videos with messaging and email.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s expansion is funded through cash flow. Facebook has burned significant sums of cash to get to where it is now.</li>
<li>Its ability to innovate on issues involving speed and cost, and its massive scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google operates search, YouTube, Gmail, and now, Google+ with aplomb. By contrast, Facebook (a behemoth, to be sure) handles far less data; it will have difficulty scaling efficiently into new realms.</p>
<p>Facebook suddenly looks beatable. Facebook&#8217;s biggest asset? Aside from users and their behavior: the Googlers who now work there. But that could change. What hot start-up will bored ex-Facebookers be jumping to in a couple years?</p>
<p>From a cultural standpoint, Google+ still faces an uphill battle. A useful product isn&#8217;t the same as a place you feel proud to hang out in, or go to appear cool. Google will need to maintain a fun image. Strange to pose this as a challenge for a company with Doodles on its home page and exercise balls as furniture. But photos of Larry waterskiing don&#8217;t exactly scream &#8220;Facebook killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>But its first taste of serious competition will no doubt cramp Facebook&#8217;s style. And when the analysts start comparing the two companies directly on things like profit margins and the number of defensible, home-grown technologies, Facebook&#8217;s early swagger will be a thing of the past.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly three years ago, I wrote a two-parter for Search Engine Land addressing the &#8220;Wall Street Meltdown&#8221; and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/wall-street-meltdown-and-the-2009-digital-marketing-outlook-part-2-15433">how it would affect digital marketers</a> in the coming years.</p>
<p>Although many people suspected things were going to be a bit rough, only a minority were concerned enough to believe that a major shift was taking place. You&#8217;re supposed to &#8220;bounce back&#8221; from recessions. It didn&#8217;t happen this time.</p>
<p>Since September 2008 when I wrote the piece, the stock indexes have remained about where they were. The precipitious fall continued into 2009, then a powerful rally got things back to where they had been, and as of this writing, stocks are falling steadily. The market is almost always a pretty good (18-month) leading indicator, so along with everything else, that indicator suggests we&#8217;re headed for more trouble and more slack demand.</p>
<p>What perhaps couldn&#8217;t have been predicted was the fact that the tech investment bubble kept bubbling - seemingly exponentially - in the midst of unprecedented calamities in housing prices, employment, etc., in the rest of the economy. Analogous to the process by which much of the loot at the top of the economic expansion went disproportionately to a few in the finance sector (either in bonuses from successful bets, or government transfers for bailouts), these high-tech windfalls don&#8217;t seem to do much to stimulate the broader sector, at least in the short term. The founders and investors in a small number of companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GroupOn, Pandora, etc., walk away with windfalls from IPO&#8217;s or pre-IPO financings, limiting the &#8220;good times&#8221; to a small number of winners. Companies in a rush to do the same thing suddenly look out of step with normal human decency when they grab a little too hard for it, openly, without taking care of things like basic safety, ethics, etc. &#8212; to wit, the recent <a href="http://www.pehub.com/114113/what-not-to-do-in-a-crisis-%E2%80%93-lessons-from-the-airbnb-fiasco/">Airbnb</a> fiasco.</p>
<p>There have been a raft of successful tech IPO&#8217;s in the past couple of years, after a long drought. It&#8217;s entirely possible, though, that a decent number of those in the planning phases may need to be shelved as investor demand dries up. It will be interesting to watch whether investors continue to look the other way at ugly fundamentals and questionable founder ethics, or if such companies will soon be held to &#8220;normal&#8221; investment standards.</p>
<p>That aside, the continued success of this sector isn&#8217;t inconsistent with the economy, as this is not a normal &#8220;demand slackening,&#8221; general sort of slowdown, but rather an inchoate and yet-to-be-determined reorienting of how economic and social life are organized. Richard Florida calls these episodes &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Reset-Working-Post-Crash-Prosperity/dp/0061937193">Great Resets</a>,&#8221; and posits that this is only the third such reset since the 1870&#8217;s. During the Great Depression, for example, Prof. Florida cites a wide variety of innovations and huge leaps forward in productivity that rolled out in the wake of the Roaring Twenties, as the general population retrenched into caution and often grinding poverty. I&#8217;ll dig into this in a future post.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are a series of cataclysmic changes happening at once: broader fiscal and economic cycle issues; the &#8216;Chaos Scenario&#8217; for old media, the Great Reset that will continue to produce steady declines in employment in many traditional working-class and middle-class professions, while creating massive growth for high-skill Creative Class professions on one hand, and dead-end but tolerable service-sector jobs on the other (and somehow to be afforded, the persistence of stable government jobs and a huge increase in health-care related employment). Are these trends all interrelated? No; it&#8217;s dangerous to try to divine some coherent logic from every trend. But with the pace of change, the insistence by analysts like Florida that some kind of Schumpeterian process of &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; is currently at its height is obvious, on one hand, and depending on where you sit, perhaps too sanguine, on the other.</p>
<p>Anyway, to touch back on a few highlights among the 11 predictions I made for our particular sector nearly three years ago, they were roughly as follows (paraphrasing at times):</p>
<ol>
<li>Paid search will remain relatively robust.</li>
<li>Display ads are vulnerable in a slowdown</li>
<li>Weak companies die. The strong get stronger.</li>
<li>M&amp;A and downsizing means frequent job changes for some</li>
<li>Phony &#8216;performers&#8217; and &#8216;rock stars&#8217; get outed, and real expertise becomes easier to spot</li>
<li>The tools of business and pleasure all get cheaper, for those who can afford them. The face-to-face conference business won&#8217;t dry up (in our sector) as fast as you might think or fear.</li>
<li>More people will re-evaluate their priorities, values, and goals.</li>
<li>Real-world financial problems will be achingly bad for many folks, something that should become hard to ignore even inside the most meticulously-constructed digital bubble.</li>
<li>Traditional ad agencies and traditional media will continue to decline.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you think these predictions played out? Were some of them on the mark? Most? All? Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in a bit, when time allows.
