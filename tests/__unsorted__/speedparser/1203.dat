<p>Founded in 1957, the Association Typographique Internationale (<a href="http://www.atypi.org">ATypI</a>) is a worldwide organization dedicated to type design and typographic-related themes. <a href="http://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik">Reykjavík/Iceland</a> hosted this year’s annual ATypI conference. From 14–18 September, about 250 local and international guests gathered to hear presentations on writing systems, design history, and font production. I attended with the Linotype/Monotype Imaging company contingent, and was fortunate enough to give a <a href="http://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik/programme/activity?a=101">presentation</a> on the final day of conference. While this write-up doesn’t cover every lecture or activity, I hope that it lends readers a good feeling of the event’s flavor.<br />

<p class="captions">This year’s conference was held in the brand new Harpa building on Reykjavík’s harbor. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>Reykjavík is a beautiful city, and the conference location was outstanding. All regular activities took place inside the recently completed <a href="http://en.harpa.is">Harpa</a> Reykjavík Conference Hall and Conference Center.  Harpa has a contemporary, nebulous appearance. Although the building is without a specific profile, it still features a prominent façade, created by the Danish artist <a href="http://www.olafureliasson.net">Olafur Eliasson</a>. While Reykjavík may be a small town, as far as European capitals are concerned, Iceland seems immensely large upon arrival. Many conference attendees took advantage of the easy opportunity to drive out into the landscape and experience more of the island’s natural wonders.</p>
<h3>Font editors &#038; a book steal the show</h3>
<p>The five-day conference began rather informally on Wednesday, 14 September. Attendees could sign-up for optional workshops; the most interesting of these may have been Indra Kupferschmid and Nick Sherman’s <a href="http://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik/programme/activity?a=47">Define: type matters</a> round-table discussion on typeface classification, or Mike Duggan’s ClearType hinting for webfonts <a href="http://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik/programme/activity?a=34">workshop</a>. Indra and Nick are hoping to publish proceedings from their workshop on the ATypI website soon; this will give the wider community the benefit of their work at the conference. As for hinting, Mike works for Microsoft, and I think that it would be great to see more workshops with him at future design conferences.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have experienced several design events where the new, star products were all typeface releases. As far as I recall, no new typefaces were released at this year’s ATypI. Instead, talk of four new font editors filled the air. Days before the conference began, FontLab issued the long-awaited public beta version of <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/news-and-events/fontlab-announcements/lion-compatible-fontlab-studio-5-1-public-preview.html">FontLab Studio 5.1</a>, a re-write of FontLab Studio that enables the application to run under MacOS X Lion. </p>

<p class="captions">This slide from Frederik Berlaen’s presentation shows node manipulation on a glyph in the new RoboFont application. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>Before the conference, much of the online buzz around this year’s ATypI revolved around <a href="http://doc.robofont.com/">RoboFont</a>. So, many attendees must have felt relieved when <a href="http://www.typemytype.com/">Frederik Berlaen</a> took to the stage on Thursday to demonstrate RoboFont publicly for the first time. RoboFont – already used by some of the world’s best typeface designers – is a Mac-only, UFO-based glyph drawing application, originally commissioned from Frederik by the Font Bureau. RoboFont was officially released during the conference. Later on during the conference, I saw several designers in the audience with their laptops open, already designing in RoboFont. For professional type designers, the €400 price is really a steal, especially if they have already purchased other UFO-workflow applications, like Metrics Machine and Superpolator. A 15-day <a href="http://doc.robofont.com/order/">trial version</a> of RoboFont is also available.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://doc.robofont.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screenshot-Drawing_in_RoboFont.png" alt="Screenshot Drawing in RoboFont" title="Screenshot Drawing in RoboFont" width="960" height="288" class="padb" /></a>
<p class="captions">Drawing in RoboFont.</p>
<p>There were other font editors shown during the conference: Georg Seifert presented his <a href="http://glyphsapp.com">Glyphs</a> font editor, which he had demonstrated in beta at last year’s ATypI conference. Google’s <a href="http://levien.com/">Raph Levien</a> previewed a new, <a href="http://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik/programme/activity?a=33">spiral outline font editor</a> he is developing; this cloud-based application is apparently not yet ready for release, however. Will it help make 2012 be ‘year of the font editors’?</p>

<p class="captions">Fred Smeijers discussing a close-up photo of a sixteenth-century matrix from the collection of the Museum Plantin–Moreutus in Antwerp. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>Another release was <a href="http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-42-8" title="Hyphen Press">Hyphen Press</a>’s announcement of the second edition of <a href="http://ourtype.com/#/our-designers/fred-smeijers/">Fred Smeijers</a>’s <a href="http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-42-8">Counterpunch</a>, and a few advance copies of the book sold out quickly in Harpa’s bookstore. Fred had a lecture of his own on Friday morning, in which he showed incredible close-up photos of sixteenth-century matrices from the <a href="http://www.plantin-moretus.be/eCache/MFE/30/04/926.html">Museum Plantin–Moretus</a> collections; some of these matrices were struck with punches cut by Claude Garamond, Robert Granjon, or Hendrik van den Keere. Counterpunch itself was originally published in 1996, and Fred’s lecture focused on his research into punchcutting since that time. According to Fred, Counterpunch’s second edition is primarily a reprint, not a sequel, although he then teased the audience, remarking that his additional findings may some day be published in a follow-up volume, which he jokingly referred to as Counterpunch Two. I know that this is a text that I would eagerly read.</p>
<h3>Iceland’s special letters</h3>
<p>This year’s conference theme was ‘eth’ – or ‘œŧħ’, as the conference designers wittingly spelled it. The ‘eth’ name represents the Ð/ð letter of the Icelandic alphabet. The lowercase ð form seems to have come to Iceland via Anglo Saxon texts, while a ‘barred D’ type of uppercase form is used in the diacritics of other contemporary languages as well. Today’s Icelandic alphabet has 32 letters, including the Þ and the Ð, an Æ, six letters with an acute accent, and an Ö. The letters C, Q, W, and Z are not used. The Þ and the Ð share a similar th sound, at least to non-Icelanders; but the Þ only appears at the beginning of a word, while Ð is an inter-word letter only. In keeping with the special-letter theme, several papers on diacritics from various European languages were presented during this year’s conference, particularly on Friday.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Icelandic-street-sign-with-eth.jpg" alt="Icelandic street sign with eth" title="Icelandic-street-sign-with-eth" width="960" height="490" class="padb" />
<p class="captions">This street sign in Reykjavík illustrates how common the diacritics are in written Icelandic. Unfortunately, Icelandic presenters during the conference mentioned that including flat-stroked bar on the letter ð is not the best way to draw the character. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>One of my fondest memories of the conference will surely be the panel discussion on the design of the lowercase ð, which was the penultimate Friday afternoon presentation; it is a pity that this was not filmed for later release to the general public. Panel participants included Anton Kaldal Ágústsson, Gunnlaugur SE Briem, Veronika Burian, Steinar Farestveit, Gerry Leonidas, Gerard Unger, Gunnar Vilhjálmsson, and Ian Watson. Albert-Jan Pool lent a hand, too. Early on in the discussion, Gerard Unger remarked that, ‘it can be tricky to design an ð for a typeface. If you don’t want to design an ð that matches your typeface, you can design a nice ð and then design a typeface around it!’ This comment set a light-hearted tone; yet, despite all of the laughs during the 30-minute time-slot, I think that there was a lot to be learned during this part of the programme.</p>
<p>After the presentation had ended, Adobe’s Frank Grießhammer told me that the problem type designers had about not knowing how to properly design the ð is now over. By convening in Iceland, the ATypI ensured that more than enough photos of Icelandic signs will make their way onto <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/atypi11">Flickr</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/President-of-Iceland.jpg" alt="President of Iceland at atypi" title="President-of-Iceland" width="960" height="528" class="padb" />
<p class="captions">Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, the president of Iceland, addressed the ATypI during the conference’s official opening on Thursday, 15 September. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>This year’s ATypI conference included a new element: a ceremonial opening on Thursday evening by Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, Iceland’s president. Although there have now been 55 ATypI gatherings, this is the first time a head of state has addressed the organization.</p>
<p>President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson’s talk was a treat. With great humor and insight, he explained the role that he saw for languages with smaller numbers of speakers, both in Iceland and abroad. For instance, Microsoft once had a policy of only supporting languages with over one million speakers. Although Icelandic is the national language of Iceland, only some 318,000 people are estimated to live on the island. However, Windows does now support Icelandic, thanks to a personal letter the president sent to Bill Gates. This was only one of several anecdotes he used to captivate his audience. </p>
<p>The presidential address was followed by a keynote lecture from <a href="http://briem.net">Gunnlaugur SE Briem</a>, author of the English-language instruction <a href="http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.11/index.htm">guide</a> for type designers eager to learn how to properly design the Icelandic characters thorn (Þ/þ) and eth (Ð/ð), and likely the most well-known Icelandic type designer.</p>

<p class="captions">One of five short videos put together by Iceland’s ATypI volunteers. This one, from the conference’s last day, is my favourite. Aside from shots of many aspects of the conference, it also features short interviews with several attendees.</p>
<h3>World scripts</h3>
<p>If Saturday’s daytime activities had their own theme, it would have had something to do with non-Latin design. This year’s conference programme included talks on – at the very least – Arabic, Devanagari, Khmer, Korean, Latin, Meeti Mayek, Mongolian, and Tamil scripts. Aside from the annual TDC and TDC² exhibitions that have long been part of the ATypI conferences, this year saw the first World Scripts Exhibition from the collections of the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography">Typography and Graphic Communication</a> department of the University of Reading. Fiona Ross and Alice Savoie curated this fascinating glimpse into the resources available to students and researchers at Reading; many of the items included traveled outside of the archives for the first time in order to be part of this exhibition.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Malayalam-newspapers.jpg" alt="Malayalam newspapers" title="Malayalam newspapers" width="960" height="543" class="padb" />

<p>Saturday’s final presentation was from <a href="http://www.hanifkureshi.com">Hanif Kureshi</a>, entitled Painter Kureshi, last street painters of India. I first saw Hanif’s <a href="http://www.handpaintedtype.com">HandpaintedType</a> project during the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~typo/2011/index.html">Typography Day 2011</a> conference in Ahmedabad, India. His project has come a long way since then. Some time back, a free font named Painter Umesh was released via the website. Now, the first commercial font family is available for sale: <a href="http://store.wkexp.com/painter-kafeel.html">Painter Kafeel</a>. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22240175?portrait=0" width="500" height="283" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
<p class="captions">This was one of two videos Hanif showed during his presentation. The second was produced especially for the ATypI conference, and is not yet available online.</p>
<p>Although the Painter Kafeel fonts cost $50, they are a tour de force worthy of consideration in a broad scope of headline and other display typography applications. A full half of each purchase will go directly to Kafeel, the sign painter in Delhi who made the artwork on which the fonts are based. The remaining $25 will be invested in the HandpaintedType project itself. Mumbai-based design studio <a href="http://whitecrow.in/">WhiteCrow</a> digitized the Painter Kafeel fonts. This studio’s bespoke typefaces can already be seen all over India, so seeing their support for HandpaintedType is a good sign. Hanif Kureshi mentioned in the Q&#038;A after his talk that, thus far,  very few copies of the Hanif font have sold. However, I have a feeling that this might be about to change.</p>

<h3>Not all work and no fun</h3>
<p>Celebrating and socializing are important parts of any conference. Reykjavík’s intimate size made it easy for groups of conference attendees to meet-up in the evenings for pub-crawls or clubbing. There were also organized after-hours activities, including an exhibition opening at Reykjavík’s <a href="http://www.sparkdesignspace.com">Spark Design Space</a>, and a large Gala Dinner on Saturday night for all of the conference attendees, followed by an after party with drinks and dancing at the <a href="http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE">Iceland Design Centre</a>. </p>

<p class="captions">TypeTogether’s Veronika Burian travels with several other ATypI delegates in a balloon-filled bus to Saturday evening’s Gala Dinner. Photo by Frank Grießhammer.</p>
<p>Everything ATypI related wound down quickly on Sunday, 18 September, as attendees began to leave for home. For those who remained through the end, the first order of business for the final day was the organization’s Annual General Meeting, which only about twenty percent of conference registrants attended. Several additional talks took place after the meeting concluded, including my own. Fortunately, these were much better attended that the General Meeting itself.</p>
<p>The highlight of this year’s Annual General Meeting was a series of presentations on possible locations for future ATypI conferences. The Board of Directors determines exact locations, but it seems very likely that next year’s conference will meet either in Yerevan, Armenia or in Hong Kong. ATypI conferences might be organized in any one of a long list of cities that presently includes Amsterdam, Antwerp, Reading/UK, Toronto, and Weimar/Germany. A proposal for a future ATypI conference in India is also being prepared.</p>
<p>Before we start planning for ATypI 2012, I would like to heartily thank Hörður Lárusson, Gunnar Vilhjálmsson, and all of the other volunteers in Iceland who made this year’s great conference possible. Thanks must also go to ATypI’s Barbara Jarzyna, whose organization throughout the year ensures that conferences like this one run smoothly. Birna Geirfinnsdóttir designed the conference logo, color scheme, and other collateral. The white/blue/orange combination was excellent, and the design in general was exemplary.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="byline">The Week in Type</p>
<p>Hard to believe that 2011 is coming to a close. Autumn is showing its face, and before you know it, we’ll be Christmas shopping. Some inspiring stuff in this week’s The Week in Type. Sit back and enjoy.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a gorgeous <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/senhesse/6075951907/">book cover</a> by Carlo Giovani for the new Brazilian edition of Jules Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/senhesse/6075951907/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/julio-verne1.jpg" alt="" title="julio verne book cover" width="500" height="749" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Lovely use of <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2010/01/21/my-favourite-fonts-of-2009/#phaeton" title="Phaeton font">Phaeton</a> by Randy Jones &#038; Kevin Cornell. </p>
<p>Via @<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ThinkingType">ThinkingType</a>.<br />
<span id="more-10926"></span><br />
We’ve seen typographic ornaments, clothing, furniture. But what about the floor! Enter <a href="http://www.linusdean.com/Col_New_York.html">LinusDean</a> and their type-themed rugs:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.linusdean.com/Col_New_York.html"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Hero-boston_480x401.png" alt="" title="Hero-boston_480x401" width="460" height="384" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.linusdean.com/Col_New_York.html"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Hero-Paris_480x401.jpg" alt="" title="Hero-Paris_480x401" width="460" height="384" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>If a rug is too big, then how about something a little smaller: <a href="http://www.typerings.com/" title="type rings jewelry">Type-Rings</a>:<br />
<a class="noborder" href="http://www.typerings.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-13-at-2.16.31-AM-500x375.png" alt="" title="type rings" width="500" height="375" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.woodtyperevival.com/">Wood Type Revival</a> site of Matt Griffin &#038; Matt Braun has launched. This started out as a Kickstarter project. You can now buy licences for some of the ‘revived’ fonts. Some of the library is available on <a href="http://typekit.com/foundries/bearded" title="wood type revival fonts on typekit">Typekit</a>.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.woodtyperevival.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-13-at-2.08.43-AM-500x375.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-13 at 2.08.43 AM" width="500" height="375" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.linotype.com/">Linotype</a> is one of the last of the big font foundry/distributors to redesign their websites. Looking pretty good. Certainly a huge improvement:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.linotype.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-12-at-10.47.16-PM-500x408.png" alt="" title="linotype" width="500" height="408" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>PBS continues its series of <em>Off Book</em> shorts with one devoted to type:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eKKDL6lekmA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This could well be the world’s largest printing type. The work of <a href="http://nicksherman.com/" title="Nick Sherman">Nick Sherman</a>:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/6119020070/in/faves-redsil/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-16-at-4.31.59-AM-500x369.png" alt="" title="Nick Sherman life-size type" width="500" height="369" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>And, yes, he printed with them.</p>
<p>Created for the <a href="http://www.colum.edu/Academics/Interarts/events/exhibitions/" title="wood type evolved exhibition">Wood Type Evolved</a> exhibition at Columbia College, Chicago. The exhibition runs until December 10, 2011.</p>
<p>Promotional video for Simon Garfield’s <em>Just my Type</em>:</p>

<p>And Paul Shaw’s <a href="http://imprint.printmag.com/typography/not-my-type/">scathing review of the book</a>.</p>
<p>I recently featured the work of the 2011 Hague Type Design graduates. Now for the <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/2011/">Reading class of 2011</a>:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/2011/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-13-at-1.50.58-AM-500x424.png" alt="" title="" width="500" height="424" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Particularly like Saja for its Korean component, and mostly for its ground-breaking true italic:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/saja.png" alt="" title="saja" width="500" height="452" class="padb" /></p>
<p>Vaibhav Singh’s <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2011/VaibhavSingh_Eczar_specimen.pdf">Eczar</a> is also pretty ambitious. Like the stencil:</p>

<p>Web Fonts has just released its Web Font plug-in for Photoshop. Basically access to the entire library of WebINK web fonts for comping.<br />
<a class="noborder" href="http://www.extensis.com/en/webfontplugin/index.jsp"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-13-at-1.48.05-AM-500x397.png" alt="" title="web font plug-in" width="500" height="397" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>See Elliot Jay Stocks’ <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/extensis-web-font-plug-in/">review</a> of the plug-in for more info.</p>
<p>Emigre&#8217;s award-winning type specimen <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EmigreCatalog.php">catalogs</a> are now available for free as PDF files:</p>

<p>Right now the annual <a href="http://www.atypi.org/">ATypI</a> (Association Typographique Internationale) convention is in full swing in Iceland. We’ll have a review posted here in due course. For me one of the highlights is the release of the long-awaited font editor, <a href="http://doc.robofont.com/">RoboFont</a>.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://doc.robofont.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/robofont.png" alt="" title="robofont font editor" width="500" height="288" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>And congratulations to type designer <a href="http://www.atypi.org/news/sorkinnominatedforatypiboard">Eben Sorkin</a> who was nominated for election to the ATypI Board. Great news.</p>
<h3>New fonts</h3>
<p>Love <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/filmotype/filmotype_prima_ot/">Filmotype Prima</a> available from FontShop.

<p>A lovely new Fatface from James Puckett of Dunwich Type. Meet <a href="http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/dunwich-type-founders/sybarite">Sybarite</a> in four weights with complimentary italics:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/dunwich-type-founders/sybarite"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/09/Sybarite1.png" alt="" title="Sybarite fonts" width="500" height="661" class="pads" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.type-together.com/abril" title="Abril fonts from typetogether">Abril</a> from TypeTogether is a really sound text face. Interesting are the dual sources for the complimentary text and titling styles. The titling face is based on the Didone, while the text face is inspired by the Slab Serif and Scotch Roman. Comes complete with a number of typographic ornaments and borders:</p>

You may have heard via Twitter that I am having problems with PayPal and their arbitrarily imposed rolling reserves. Without going into the impossibly dull details I’ll just say that Codex will be published twice yearly instead of quarterly. Though it will mean fewer issues per  year, it will mean that the quality remains exceptionally high. Work on issue two has already begun, and I hope to publish it in December or thereabouts. If you enjoyed issue #1, then you will go crazy for issue #2. As issue #1 is almost sold out (4,000 copies sold!), I will be releasing a PDF version soon. I will announce it on <a href="http://twitter.com/ilovetypography" title="ILT on Twitter">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, finally, I have some great new feature articles coming soon to ILT. So, keep your eyes peeled, and have a really great weekend, wherever you are and whatever you’re doing.</p>

<p class="byline">New limited edition prints by Seb Lester</p>
<p>I am proud to present a new limited edition print released today entitled &#8216;<a href="http://seblester.co.uk">Peace</a>&#8217;. It is available in two colourways. A classic metallic gold on black and a contemporary dark chrome on white. I would like to offer a little insight into the design.</p>
<p>There are words that are common currency for calligraphers and artists. Often profound words that encapsulate an idea or sentiment that has broad and timeless appeal. &#8216;Peace&#8217; is one such word. I felt this year was a good time for me to produce my interpretation of the word &#8216;Peace&#8217;.<br />

<p>As is often the case I have drawn inspiration from our rich heritage of letterforms in the West. These influences have been filtered through modern sensibilities to, hopefully, produce something that appears fundamentally of our time. &#8216;Peace&#8217; is a melding of inspiration from many sources including Anglo Saxon art, 18th and 19th century virtuoso penmanship and Medieval illumination.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://seblester.co.uk"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/08/Peace_White_LR.jpg" alt="" title="Peace_White_LR" width="960" height="288" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>The background filigree is composed largely of spirals and stars. I was drawn to spirals because, apart from their profound beauty, they have mystical qualities. They appear as ancient Pagan symbols in megalithic art, notably Newgrange in Ireland. They appear in Norse culture on the prows of Viking ships. They appear in Maori facial tattoos and in ancient Chinese art, where they are thought to symbolise the sun. They appear in the sacred art of all the world&#8217;s major religions. So spirals are powerful symbols that cross cultural and religious boundaries. For these reasons a filigree design based on spirals seems perfect to me.</p>

<p>I know a piece is finished when I feel that adding or removing even the smallest of details would be detrimental to the overall design.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I am the director of a feature-length documentary <a href="http://kck.st/r5zuyB">film</a> about the Linotype type casting machine. About a year ago, I partnered up with two good friends on a journey to document the Linotype and the people who love these crazy machines. After 45 interviews and 26 separate shoots, we have amassed an amazing collection of footage telling the surprisingly emotional and fascinating story of the Linotype.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/15032988?portrait=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/15032988">&#8220;Linotype: The Film&#8221; Official Trailer</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user4747369">Linotype: The Film</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-10854"></span></p>
<p>Called the &#8220;Eighth Wonder of the World&#8221; by Thomas Edison, the Linotype revolutionized printing and society, but very few people know about the inventor, Ottmar Mergenthaler, or his fascinating machine. The Linotype brought about a revolution in literacy and communication as dramatic as the internet today. To read a much more in-depth history of the Linotype, you can read my article in <a href="http://codexmag.com" title="codex, the journal of typography">Codex</a> #1.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of the people connected to the Linotype and how it impacted the world. We have discovered that the Linotype was more than just a machine - it was a career, a skill, and a passion. Even in the face of modern technology, many still believe it to be the best way to create beautiful typography.</p>
<h3>Gathering Footage</h3>
<p>We have filmed all over the United States and into Europe. Along the way, we met some of the most generous and amazing people that have a passion for the Linotype. Filming in barns, museums, corporate headquarters and government buildings, we found Linotypes in tiny towns and major cities. Below is a small list of a few of the people that we have interviewed over the past six months:</p>
<p>Matthew Carter — type designer &#038; former Linotype employee<br />
Frank Romano — preeminent Linotype historian<br />
Carol Knopes — former editor at USA Today<br />
Carl Schlesinger — former New York Times Linotype operator<br />
Bill Boarman — Head Printer of the United States<br />
Nadine Chahine — type designer &#038; Arabic specialist at Linotype<br />
Klaus Trefzer — German collector of Linotypes</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/08/Still_NadineChahine-500x281.jpg" alt="" title="Nadine Chahine" width="500" height="281" class="padb" /><span class="footnote">Nadine Chahine</span></p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/08/Still_DavinKuntze-500x281.jpg" alt="" title="Davin Kuntze" width="500" height="281" class="padb" /><span class="footnote">Davin Kuntze</span></p>

<p>You can see excerpts from several of our interviews in this video:</p>

<h3>Funding the Film</h3>
<p>From the beginning, all of our funding has come from grassroots support — people that love printing, communication and typography. We had a very successful Kickstarter campaign in November that exceeded our expectations. This allowed us to expand the scope of the film to include more people and locations to make this the definitive film on the subject. </p>
<p>Honestly, our original budget for the film was naïve in estimating our total film expenses. Thankfully, the Kickstarter community knew better than us and gave above and beyond our goal. In a moment of serendipity, the money raised was exactly the amount needed to fund the filming portion of the film.</p>
<p>We are now launching a second <a href="http://kck.st/r5zuyB ">Kickstarter</a> project to help cover our post-production expenses such as color-correction, audio engineering, motion graphics and titling, music, and archival footage. Post-production is where the film really takes shape. If we have done our job correctly, it is where we take 45 interviews and tell a story together.</p>
<p>Supporters of the <a href="http://kck.st/r5zuyB">Kickstarter</a> project can receive limited-edition letterpresses posters, a copy of the final DVD or even an actual line of lead type.</p>
<h3>Screenings &#038; Release</h3>
<p>Many have been asking when they can see the final film. Because of our expanded scope, the film will premiere in early 2012 and screenings of the film will tour around the world shortly thereafter. The DVD will be released in the spring of 2012. We will be submitting the film to various film festivals and we hope to meet many of you out on the road.</p>

<p>There’s also a good article over at the FontFeed about the <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/fontbook-the-team-behind-the-new-app/" title="ipad fontbook app">team behind the iPad app</a>. I like Mai-Linh Truong’s closing comment,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The last FontBook was big enough to crack open your skull, but the new FontBook app will totally blow your mind.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I began writing a review, but there really is no need for one. The <a href="http://www.fontbook.com/">FontBook</a> has always been a great reference book. It’s now available in an easy-to-search, easy-to-digest format — and it costs little more than a cup of coffee. Need I say more. What would be great is the ability to print samples from within the app. Not sure if that’s even possible?</p>

<div id="theDeck-21"></div>
<p>From May 19–21, FontShop hosted its 16th annual <a href="http://www.typoberlin.de/2011/index.php">TYPO-Berlin</a> conference. Over 1,600 guests were in attendance. This year&#8217;s conference theme was &#8220;Shift,&#8221;  and the subtext of many of the presentations dealt with how to bring one&#8217;s design work to the next level, whether that is the next level of your own personal development, or to new brands of media. With so many graphic designers in one place, it is no wonder that several type foundries and publishers chose this event to launch new products. Many of these items have already been discussed on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23typo11">Twitter</a> or on other blogs, such as in last week&#8217;s weekly <a href="http://typedia.com/blog/post/type-news-lenny-bruce-is-not-afraid/">Typedia</a> report. Nevertheless, the following recap should still be of interest to I Love Typography readers.</p>
<h3>Klim Type Foundry</h3>
<p>New Zealand&#8217;s Kris Sowersby (also an I Love Typography <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2010/05/25/founders-grotesk-fonts">contributor</a>) used his Thursday evening lecture to announce the release of his two newest type families: <a href="http://klim.co.nz/calibre.php">Calibre</a> and <a href="http://klim.co.nz/metric.php">Metric</a>.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://vllg.com/Klim/Calibre"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Calibre.gif" alt="" title="Calibre by Kris Sowersby" width="530" height="520" class="pads" /></a></p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://vllg.com/Klim/Metric#panel=usage-poster"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Metric.gif" alt="" title="Metric by Kris Sowersby" width="530" height="447" class="pads" /></a><br />
<span id="more-10698"></span></p>
<p>While Calibre and Metric are separate designs, Sowersby writes that they each share an underlying geometry. They each have roots in the canon of the history of European sans serif design. Calibre takes some influence from Aldo Novarese&#8217;s Recta, and Metric samples forms familiar from street sign letters in West Berlin. While Calibre is a neo-grotesque, Metric is more humanist; Sowersby calls it a &#8220;geometric humanist.&#8221; Like most of Sowersby&#8217;s other commercial fonts, <a href="http://vllg.com/Klim/Calibre">Calibre</a> and <a href="http://vllg.com/Klim/Metric#panel=usage-poster">Metric</a> may be licensed through <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Klim">Village</a>.</p>
<h3>Storm Type Foundry</h3>
<p>In a lively lecture at the end of the conference&#8217;s first day, František Štorm showed samples from several of his recent typeface releases, including  the new <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/family-jannon-sans.html">Janon Sans</a>, a sans serif counterpart to his <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/family-jannon.html">Jannon</a> family. Storm Type Foundry&#8217;s Jannon is based on the oldstyle letterforms of punchcutter Jean Jannon (1580–1641). There are not too many sans serifs counterparts to Garamond-style typefaces; during the early twentieth century, Jannon&#8217;s types were misattributed to Claude Garamond, so Jannon Sans may mix well not only with Jannon, but with Jannon-esque Garamonds, like Monotype Garamond or Garamond #3.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.stormtype.com/family-jannon-sans.html"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Storm_Jannon_and_Jannon-Sans.jpg" alt="" title="Storm_Jannon_and_Jannon-Sans" width="700" height="495" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.stormtype.com/family-bhang.html"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Storm_Bhang.jpg" alt="" title="Storm_Bhang" width="700" height="495" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>During his talk, Štorm also presented images of his whimsical <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/family-bhang.html">Bhang</a> family. Inspired by the intensely creative styles of hand-painted sign lettering in India — a genre that is gradually being replaced by digital printing and vinyl-cutting machines — Bhang hopes to preserve some of what may soon be otherwise lost from the visual landscape. To stimulate the actual use of Bhang on signs, the <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-bhang-strong.html">Strong</a> variant of the family (something like a regular weight) is available as a free download from the Storm Type Foundry website.</p>
<h3>Typotheque</h3>
<p>Although he has released several fonts through the <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/">FontFont</a> library, Typotheque’s founder Peter Biľak only paid his first visit to the TYPO-Berlin conference this year. One of the many new projects that he presented during his two talks was Elementar. Designed by Gustavo Ferreira, <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/elementar#sans-a_09_11_3">Elementar</a> is a system of 420 &#8220;parametric bitmap&#8221; fonts. With the aid of sliders, Typotheque customers can select the height, weight, width, and style of the letters. As is the case with other Typotheque types, webfont versions of Elementar can be licensed and delivered via Typotheque&#8217;s own webfont service.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/elementar#sans-a_09_11_3"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/elementar.jpg" alt="" title="elementar" width="896" height="675" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>At TYPO-Berlin, Biľak demonstrated an iPad app for Elementar, which should soon be released via Apple&#8217;s App store. With just their fingers, users will be able to select the size, width, thickness, and style of the Elementar fonts they would like to license. Purchases can be made directly from the app to users&#8217; Typotheque accounts — an innovation that I would like to see more foundries adopt.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/elementar#sans-a_09_11_3"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Elementar_Parameters-Overview.png" alt="" title="Elementar_Parameters-Overview" width="539" height="587" class="pad" /></a></p>
<h3>FontShop AG</h3>
<p>FontShop AG — sometimes referred to by designers as FontShop Berlin or FontShop Germany — is usually known as a font reseller, not as an actual foundry. Unlike its sister company FSI FontShop International GmbH, FontShop AG has not released many typefaces under its own banner. A notable exception was the 2009 release of Erik Spiekermann&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fontshop.de/fontdetails.htm?fontWrapperPk=3659744907974216080&#038;fontProductPK=288735758995088&#038;openNewTab=true&#038;referredFrom=globalsearch.htm&#038;itemsPerPage=40&#038;currentPage=0">Axel</a> typeface, designed specially for use in Microsoft Excel documents. Just before the start of TYPO-Berlin 2011, FontShop AG released Georg Seifert&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Azuro&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">Azuro</a>. </p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Azuro&#038;x=0&#038;y=0"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Azuro_type_specimen.jpg" alt="" title="Azuro_type_specimen" width="1024" height="821" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Another typeface designed for on-screen reading, I find <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Azuro&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">Azuro</a> interesting for three reasons. First, as is reported on the <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/azuro-a-new-typeface-for-reading-on-screens/">FontFeed</a>, Azuro&#8217;s forms were tested extensively on-screen during the design process. And Azuro was not just tested on one screen, but on many kinds of screens. Seifert even incorporated iOS testing into his design process. Second, Azuro is the product of strong collaboration between several font technology experts. No stranger to programming himself, Seifert designed Azuro in <a href="http://schriftgestaltung.de">Glyphs</a> — a new Mac font editor that Seifert wrote himself — instead of in FontLab Studio. The font files were hinted by Jens Kutílek. In the font production process, additional testing tools written by <a href="http://yanone.de">Yanone</a> were used. Finally, Azuro is of interest for its accessibility: through May 31, 2011, the Azuro family can be licensed for about €20, rather than about €200.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.fontshop.com/freefonts"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Fontfummler.jpg" alt="" title="Fontfummler" width="832" height="283" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>For TYPO-Berlin this year, FontShop AG did not stop at releasing another new typeface. They also published a tool to help designers everywhere draw letters on their own: A handy stencil element template, the <strong>Fontfummler</strong> allows anyone to quickly draw letter elements by hand, on paper. By combining the various letterform elements or shapes, almost any kind of Latin-script letterform can be constructed. The technique reminds me a little of W.A. Dwiggins’s own stenciled Falcon typeface. </p>
<p>According to the FontBlog, the name for this stencil was found by Erik Spiekermann. The stencil&#8217;s design comes from <a href="http://edenspiekermann.com/">EdenSpiekermann</a>&#8217;s Lars Krüger. Alexander Roth has produced a digital font made from letters built with the Fontfummler: the font is named <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/freefonts">Fummler</a>, after the German verb &#8220;fummeln&#8221; (to fumble or twiddle with). TYPO-Berlin attendees received pre-cut Fontfummlers of their own, but via this <a href="http://www.fontblog.de/der-fontfummler-ist-da-und-fummel-der-free-font">link</a>, anyone may download the template, and get directly to work!</p>
<h3>Two Books</h3>
<p>You might already be familiar with the <a href="http://www.decodeunicode.org">decodeunicode.org</a>, a wiki-like initiative to explain Unicode and the meaning of its multitude of encoded glyphs in the Unicode 6.0 standard. The website is a resource from designers, for designers. Now, German readers can add the appropriately thick <a href="http://www.typografie.de/Unsere-Buecher/Neuerscheinungen/Johannes-Bergerhausen_Siri-Poarangan/Decodeunicode::1421.html">Decodeunicode</a> book to their libraries. Here is my translation of the publisher&#8217;s description of the book:</p>
<p>&#8220;Unnoticed glyph treasures slumber deep underneath of the keyboard … but where, exactly? Compared with the Tower of Babel, Unicode is a sort of typography United Nations; every character receives its own encoded place. Decodeunicode is your key to all the characters of the world. The book presents all 109,242; too, it makes them easily discoverable. <a href="http://issuu.com/verlag-hermann-schmidt/docs/decodeuncode/19">Decodeunicode</a> arouses interest in discovering unfamiliar symbols and the creative use of doing so. And it introduces all writing systems, too — living and dead, often — used as well as niche scripts. The book is a 600-page typographic trip through the world and the history of writing.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.typografie.de/Unsere-Buecher/Neuerscheinungen/Johannes-Bergerhausen_Siri-Poarangan/Decodeunicode::1421.html"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/decode-unicode.png" alt="" title="decode-unicode" width="500" height="316" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>German readers may also browse through Jürgen Siebert&#8217;s detailed review on the <a href="http://www.fontblog.de/decodeunicode-das-buch-der-zeichen-ist-da">FontBlog</a>.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.nbvd-shop.de/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=97&amp;language=en"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Typoversity_photo_1.jpg" alt="" title="Typoversity" width="960" height="638" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbvd-shop.de/index.php?main_page=product_info&#038;cPath=1&#038;products_id=97&#038;language=en">Typoversity</a> is another German-language title first presented at TYPO-Berlin. The book combines samples of student typography projects from various schools in Central Europe and a series of interviews with typography instructors in Germany. The book is well-produced, and is typeset in <a href="http://www.burodunst.com/typefaces/novel">Novel</a> and <a href="http://www.burodunst.com/typefaces/novelsans/">Novel Sans</a>, from Christoph Dunst. The cover was produced using polymer plate letterpress techniques.</p>
<h3>abc litera</h3>
<p>Not so much of a release as an announcement: small flyers distributed during the conference whetted the appetite for the work of a new Swiss foundry. A collaboration between <a href="http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/authors/jost_hochuli">Jost Hochuli</a>, <a href="http://www.niedermann.org">Jonas Niedermann</a>, and <a href="http://www.tgg.ch/office/team.html">Roland Stieger</a>, one can expect excellent tools to soon come from <a href="http://www.abclitera.com">abc litera</a>.</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=4"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Alena_sample.png" alt="" title="Alena_sample" width="500" height="310" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=3"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Allegra_sample.png" alt="" title="Allegra_sample" width="500" height="610" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=5"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Nicolas_sample.png" alt="" title="Nicolas" width="500" height="182" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Their simple, two-color, folded A4 flyer showcased Steiger&#8217;s <a href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=4">Alena</a> and Hochuli&#8217;s <a href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=3">Allegra</a>. A serif face — <a href="http://www.abclitera.com/?cat=5">Nicolas</a> is also shown on their website. I have heard no word yet on how these three families will be distributed, but I am willing to bet that each will be an excellent workhorse face for book typography.</p>
<p class=&#8221;footnote>Dan Reynolds was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Before moving to Europe, he received a BFA in graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Reynolds studied at the HfG Offenbach for a few years before receiving an MA in typeface design from the University of Reading (U.K.). Today, he lives in Berlin, Germany, where he works for Linotype GmbH and teaches typeface design at the Hochschule Darmstadt. His most recent typeface, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/521506/malabar-family.html">Malabar</a>, received a Certificate of Excellence in Type Design from the Type Directors Club, a silver medal at the ED-Awards 2009, and a gold medal from the 2010 Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany competition.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last five months have been pretty intense. Creating a 164-page magazine from scratch is an enormous project and, looking back, I’m happy that I was naïve enough to think it could be done.

<p>I’d also like to thank <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> for their generous support. Now that the first issue of <a href="http://shop.codexmag.com/products/issue-1">Codex magazine</a> is on its way to the printer, I can take a breather (a few days until work resumes on issue #2), and list here some of the type-related things that have been catching my eye. Yes, it has been a while, but here is the week — perhaps the month — in type.</p>
<p>I already have too many pictures and posters, but couldn’t resist buying this one (the one on the right):</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.atipo.bigcartel.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/fontface05.jpg" alt="" title="fontface poster" width="500" height="372" class="pad" /></a><br />

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/19558725">fontface</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/atipo">atipo</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Available from <a href="http://www.atipo.bigcartel.com/">atipo</a> in Spain. And I almost forgot to mention that I’ve convinced <strong>atipo</strong> to give one away to an ILT reader. Just tell us why you want or need the poster and we’ll select a lucky winner. I will announce the winner on Monday via <a href="http://twitter.com/ilovetypography">twitter</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fittextjs.com/">FixText</a>, a very clever jQuery plugin for resizing web type on the fly:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://fittextjs.com/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-12-at-2.45.17-PM-500x408.png" alt="" title="FixText" width="500" height="408" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Nice use of Font Bureau’s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Giza/">Giza</a> and <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic/">Griffith Gothic</a> in Pentagram’s work for the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore.

<p>Two great <a href="http://typecamp.org/">Type Camps</a> coming up. One in <a href="http://typecamp.org/california2011.html">California</a> Wine Country (12–17 June 2011); the other held at the Bauhaus campus in Weimar! (30 July –4 August 2011). Places limited, so hurry.</p>
<p>Last chance to sign up for the <a href="http://legacyofletters.com/">Legacy of Letters</a> tour. Eight days in Italy; eights days of type. You have until May 20th:</p>

<p>Great to see type designers embracing dribble. Among them, French type design legend, <a href="http://dribbble.com/typofonderie">Jean François Porchez</a>:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://dribbble.com/typofonderie"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-12-at-3.14.36-PM-500x390.png" alt="" title="dribbble" width="500" height="390" class="padb" /></a><br />
 Wish dribble had twitter-like lists or groups, so that I could share such a list with others. [hint, hint]</p>

<p></p>
<div id="theDeck-19"></div>
<p>There are many OpenType features that can be built into a font, but Contextual Alternates is something special. </p>
<p>Swash characters, ligatures, small caps and figure variants are all very well, but they merely duplicate cleverness that was available prior to digital type. The Contextual Alternates feature however, in which the choice of glyph alternate for a particular character is set automatically with reference to an adjacent character, enables new possibilities for the type designer. Consider it as &#8216;smart fonts&#8217;, because the appearance of typography is determined not by the person laying out a page, but by a font&#8217;s response to the particular words that comprise the text.<br />
<span id="more-10568"></span><br />
At the heart of the feature&#8217;s code is a process of glyph substitution, e.g. </p>
<p style="font-family:monospace;padding-left:2em;"><span style="color:blue;">sub</span> a b&#8217; <span style="color:blue;">by</span> b.alt ;</p>
<p>This means, &#8220;When a is followed by b, don&#8217;t set the default glyph for b, substitute an alternate (b.alt)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here is a brief history of the feature, illustrated with the five typefaces I&#8217;ve designed which address some of its possibilities. Most typefaces mentioned are linked to MyFonts, which has an online type tester that demonstrates OpenType features.</p>
<h3>Simulating scripts</h3>
<p>The Contextual Alternates feature was developed by Adobe ten years ago and registered in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm">OpenType Layout tag registry</a> as providing &#8220;… better joining behavior … in script typefaces which are designed to have some or all of their glyphs join&#8221;.</p>
<p>Caflisch Script was the proving ground; it was a typeface which had originally been created for Adobe by Robert Slimbach in 1993, based on a writing style of calligrapher Max Caflisch. Apart from its Multiple Master format (weight axis), it was published as a two-font system, one with default characters, the other an Expert font containing a handful of ligatures and swash alternates which could be set laboriously by keystrokes such as &#8220;i&#8221; for the &#8220;tt&#8221; glyph.</p>
<p>The OpenType update, <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&#038;event=displayFontPackage&#038;code=1725">Caflisch Script Pro</a>, was released in 2001, the same year as Adobe InDesign 1.5, the first major layout application to support OpenType. I was very keen on this new technology, and wrote about it for Graphic Exchange magazine: <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/BigThing.pdf">Big Thing</a> [PDF].</p>
<p>It should be stressed that OpenType is a system; the fonts and applications which implement it are interdependent. Consequently, Adobe developed its OpenType-savvy layout applications in tandem with Pro OpenType fonts initially containing the traditional &#8220;Advanced Typography&#8221; features of Small Caps, Ligatures, and Old Style figures, that were accessible via a special OpenType sub-menu in the character panel. Taking it to the next level, InDesign 2 (2002) showcased Caflisch Script Pro, which had been expanded with hundreds of alternate glyphs and ligatures, activated by InDesign&#8217;s new Contextual Alternates feature to mimic the &#8220;letter joining rules&#8221; of traditional calligraphy, with which, as a calligrapher in his own right, Slimbach was very familiar. Such joining conventions were already a species of coding exhibiting a logical reduction and marshalling of letter form, so their adaptation to computer code was opportune.</p>
<p>Certainly, fonts had been available with alternate forms before, but the sheer quantity of those in Caflisch Script Pro, and the rigor with which they were automatically deployed, created an emergent quality of organic script typography. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/12422">Zapfino Extra</a> (Herman Zapf, Akira Kobayashi and Adam Twardoch, 2003) and <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/dear-sarah-pro/">Dear Sarah Pro</a> (Christian Robertson, 2004) were also instrumental in popularizing contextuality in OpenType script faces. In conjunction with Adam Twardoch and Thomas Phinney, I gave a workshop on on how to code such fonts, at TypeCon 2005 in New York. The three of us had previously discussed this and other OpenType issues extensively in the Build forum at Typophile.com.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/Handsome.png" alt="" title="Handsome" width="960" height="515" class="noborder" /></p>
<p>Also in 2005, I updated my script face <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/handsome-pro/">Handsome</a> (1999) to Pro status, with Contextual Alternates, for a more natural written look.</p>
<h3>Snug fit</h3>
<p>Although not a cursive script, <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/edbenguiatfonts/viewfonts">Ed Interlock</a> (Ed Benguiat, Ken Barber and Tal Leming, 2004) used contextual substitution to deploy a huge array of ligatures, simulating the effect of custom-designed hand lettering.</p>
<p>Recognizing that there are many possible formal relationships between adjacent glyphs, beyond cursive joining style or interlocking ligatures, my next foray into contextuality addressed something different: proximity. I created a rounded sans serif font, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/softmachine/fonts/">Softmachine</a> (2006), in which the closest distance between letter parts—both within and between letters—was equalized. The primary goal was to enable a clean outline stroke which didn&#8217;t overlap itself in hot spots or produce pinched negative spaces.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/softmachine.png" alt="" title="softmachine" width="960" height="545" class="noborder" /></p>
<p>This was achieved not just by well-placed stems within glyphs, and plenty of kerning adjustment between them, but by alternates that modulated the negative space between adjacent glyphs. So Softmachine contains, for instance, several variants of &#8220;l&#8221;, each with a different length of tail, selection of which is programmed according to the following glyph shape. The overall effect is a novel kind of text color.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-randomness</h3>
<p>LettError&#8217;s <a href="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/beowolf/">Beowolf</a> (1989) and <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-kosmik/">Kozmik</a> (1993) introduced the notion of randomness to digital typography, challenging the convention that every time a character repeats, the glyph should be identical. However, the non-standard programming in those types was not widely supported in layout applications. Then in 2005 several pseudo-random types were released with OpenType contextual programming by Tal Leming: Ken Barber&#8217;s Studio Sable and <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/studiolettering/fontfeatures">Studio Swing</a>, and Christian Schwartz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/local.shtml">Local Gothic</a>. Since then many foundries have followed suit. Patrick Griffin weighed in with <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/chapter+11/fonts/">Chapter 11</a> (2009) and <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/outcast/fonts/">Outcast</a> (2010), distressed styles in which disparate alternates suggest the randomness of wear and tear and uneven, haphazard printing. And Beowolf and Kozmik have been reconfigured to OpenType.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/Duffy.png" alt="" title="Duffy" width="960" height="551" class="noborder" /></p>
<p>In 2008, I designed <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/duffy+script/fonts/">Duffy Script</a>, an interpretation of the lettering of Toronto illustrator <a href="http://www.amandaduffy.com/">Amanda Duffy</a>. Each weight contains four glyphs for every character (including all numbers, punctuation and symbols). These are coded to set in a non-repetitive order, for a subtle, natural effect—and this is generally what is meant by &#8220;random&#8221; in OpenType fonts. The variant glyphs for each character are not radically different, but consistent in the way that letters from Ms Duffy&#8217;s hand exhibit slight modulations from a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>In 2010, for the OpenType makeover of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_fontesque_display_ot/">Fontesque</a> (originally designed in 1994), I again applied a random feature. However, this time it was achieved more economically, with only one set of alternates. Here&#8217;s how. Fontesque&#8217;s Contextual Alternate (&#8216;calt&#8217;) feature has two parts:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/fontesque1.png" alt="" title="fontesque" width="960" height="272" class="noborder" /></p>
<p><em>Toggle.</em> This causes every other character in text to be a &#8216;calt&#8217; glyph, so that when a character is doubled, the two glyphs are different (note the double &#8216;s&#8217;). It also provides two different looks—useful for optimizing the appearance of display settings. And of course, further refinement may be made by manual selection from the glyph palette.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/Fontesque2.png" alt="" title="Fontesque" width="960" height="179" class="noborder" /></p>
<p><em>Proximity.</em> When an alphabetic or numeric character repeats, separated by a single character, the second instance is programmed to be the other glyph for that character. Therefore, the closest that a glyph may repeat is when separated by three characters. So, with just two sets of glyphs and the “Toggle + Proximity” system, repetition will not occur until the fifth character, far enough apart to make it unobtrusive. This system works because there are no languages in which an alphabetic character appears three times in succession. (Well, actually there <em>are</em> a few words in German.)</p>
<p>Most Fontesque alternates are similar in structure but slightly different in proportion, alignment, and detail, so that the overall effect enhances the original premise of the type—the appearance of graceful, slightly off-kilter hand lettering devoid of mechanical repetition.<br />
So far as I know, pseudo-randomness has not yet been implemented in a text face to simulate the vagaries of the letterpress process, but Contextual Alternates has been integrated into several text faces—switching glyphs to improve readability—beyond dealing with the traditional problem of &#8216;f&#8217; colliding with accents, punctuation and ascenders.</p>
<h3>Readability</h3>
<p>Rob Keller&#8217;s <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2009/12/15/font-design-vesper-typeface-devanagari/">Vesper</a> (2009) has pushed the envelope furthest in using a large set of alternates to improve the fit of text type. By retracting or extending serifs, clashes and gaps are smoothed away. This is extremely practical in many character combinations, but as with kerning one wonders at what point the effect becomes counterproductive, and where the threshold is between smooth and bland. The question arises of whether such a process might dilute the personality of a typeface—or disguise its faults—and more profoundly, to what extent does the physiological process of reading type depend on consistency of letterform? Vesper raises these questions, but one theoretical typeface cannot provide the answer. Don&#8217;t ever expect a categoric decision, the best one can hope for is a consensus derived from practical experience with this and other types, yet to be designed, which implement contextuality as a readability strategy.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/Checker.png" alt="" title="Checker" width="960" height="200" class="noborder" /></p>
<h3>Counterpoint</h3>
<p>My new release <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/checker/fonts/">Checker</a> is a monowidth, all-cap ‘three-D’ display font which alternates white letters on black tiles with black letters on white tiles.</p>
<p>When working on the face, I was aware that I was channeling nostalgia for a kind of counterpoint layout that was popular in the early 1950s, involving bold type and large areas of spot color, but I didn&#8217;t reference anything in particular. After I had completed the typeface, I came across the old <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2652/3731796861_03c680afec.jpg">Cinerama</a> logo (1952–1974), which has some similarities with Checker. </p>
<p>Now I recognize the interplay of memory and imagination that occurs in bringing vague and half-grasped imagery into sharp reality, and the differences between the Cinerama logo and Checker reveal something of my graphic interests and modus operandi. Whereas the logo has white lettering and proportional width tiles with a gap between them, Checker alternates positive and negative lettering, monowidth tiles, and forms an accordion strip – qualities which may be traced to themes and content in my recent work:</p>
<p><em>Contextual alternates.</em> Checker integrates contextuality at a fundamental level of design, making it the pronounced sine qua non of the font. The contextual alternation of Checker involves figure/ground and italic/backslant switching, and baseline disruption.</p>
<p><em>Extreme Italicization.</em> The lively zigzag employs extreme italicization of 20° (the norm is close to 10°) of a bold weight; this style is adapted from <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/figgins-sans/">Figgins Sans</a>. (Figgins is a derivative of one of the first sans serif types, from a time when the lower case sans serif did not yet exist; there was thus no model to revive and so the Figgins italic was based on its serifed Modern Suite partner, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/italic/">Scotch Modern Italic</a>, which is at 20°.)</p>
<p><em>Monowidth.</em> <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/panoptica/fonts/">Panoptica</a> (2005) was designed for constraints-based verse, with a monowidth, unicase alphabet.</p>
<p><em>Perceptual dissonance.</em> I gave a talk at Typo Berlin in 2009 investigating the conference theme of &#8220;Space&#8221; through a history of the representation of three dimensions on a flat surface—linear perspective, from Pompeian murals to Google Earth. This touched on the graphic qualities of axonometric projection (parallel line perspective with no vanishing points) and its propensity for optical illusion. Perceptual dissonance has some relevance to type design. Geometric transformations (flipping, rotating, skewing), if not the most basic of vector drawing processes, are nonetheless actions used all the time in drawing type, to manipulate and form the components of glyphs. However, when it comes to finessing different characters, the plot thickens, because merely transforming one glyph shape to another by flipping, rotating or skewing all or part of it is not necessarily enough. Some account must be made for visual perception&#8217;s demand for bias. Put simply, when a viewer is presented with two elements which are plain transformations of the same shape, there is a modicum of confusion. At its most problematic, this manifests as dyslexia, when, for instance, a reader confuses b with q or d. To establish meaning, the eye must have its clearcut categories, to differentiate between objects which are identical and those which aren&#8217;t. Images which are transformations of one another have a hint of ambiguity; identical in shape, yet different in alignment. This is perhaps one reason why serifed types are preferred for long stretches of text, because the serifs applied to b, q, and d render them non-transforms of one another.</p>

<p><em>Letters vs Word.</em> As a design based on the concept of transformational opposites—contrast, angle of skew, and mirroring—Checker is highly invested in the issue of perceptual dissonance. Ambiguity is embraced in the tiles&#8217; axonometric perspective, which simultaneously suggests a view from above and below, yet rejected in curved glyphs whose mechanically skewed distortions of stem thickness have been partly unmade by manual drawing (in the time-honored typographic tradition) to facilitate the gestalt of words—emphasizing tension between letter perception and word perception as the fundamental theme of the font&#8217;s design, embodied by the principal of contextual alternates.</p>

<div id="theDeck-18"></div>
<p>Ever since I started to draw type, one of the challenges that has intrigued me the most is figuring out how letters carry their weight. Arranging thicks and thins and determining the contrast between them is crucial in assembling the systems of shapes that form a type design.
<p class="excerpt-only"><a class="noborder" href="http://ilovetypography.com/2011/03/11/through-thick-and-thin/"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/manicotti_thickThin-thumb.png" alt="" title="manicotti_thickThin-thumb" width="500" height="260" class="padb" /></a></p>
<p>Historically, a letter&#8217;s thicks and thins emerged from the writing or drawing implement used to make it. The angle, direction, and pressure of a pen or brush can produce seemingly endless models of thick and thin in calligraphy and lettering. We sometimes carry these ideas over to typography, thinking of typographic letters in terms of imaginary mark-making tools. In type, the conventional definitions of <em>stress</em> and <em>contrast</em> are focused on the idea of stroke, telling us where a line swells to its thickest point, and how thick it actually gets.<br />
<span id="more-10540"></span><br />
For me, the relationship of thicks and thins is more abstract. While stroke and gesture are interesting subjects, what fascinates me is how <em>any</em> thick/thin relationship can define the vocabulary of shapes in a typeface, and how those shapes can in turn produce unexpected textures and rhythms of black and white. This fascination has served as the jumping off point for three of my typefaces, each one approaching stress and contrast in a different way.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/manicotti_thickThin.png" alt="" title="manicotti thick thin" width="960" height="500" class="padb" /></p>
<p>My first exploration of thick and thin sprung out of the bombastic French Clarendon types of the nineteenth century. These faces are notable for having serifs that are heavier than the vertical stems (it&#8217;s usually the other way around). Following this model of &#8220;reversed&#8221; stress, I drew an alphabet that pushed the style to its extreme, and called it Manicotti since it reminded me of Spaghetti Westerns, only bigger and tastier.</p>
<p>Manicotti&#8217;s letters are so distorted that they lose any connection to an imaginary stroke.   Instead, it&#8217;s a set of ideas that governs the thicks and thins, controlling the unusual placement of weight at the tops and bottoms of letters, and the thicks that grow to be up to three times the weight of the thins. The rules of stress and contrast compact the countershapes into a tiny vertical space, allowing the massive black areas above and below to create an interesting texture of railroad tracks across a line.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/trilby_thickThin1.png" alt="" title="trilby  thick thin" width="960" height="500" class="padb" /></p>
<p>Like Manicotti, Trilby is driven by the backwards arrangement of thicks and thins. But everything that Manicotti is &#x2014; cheesy, over-the-top, and stereotypically Western &#x2014; Trilby isn&#8217;t. In Trilby I took a different approach to the French Clarendon style, chilling out that railroad track effect and introducing an open, contemporary letter structure.</p>
<p>More than anything else, Trilby&#8217;s character is defined by subtle shifts in weight. The other aspects of Trilby&#8217;s design are deliberately basic, leaving me room to play with the unconventional arrangement of thicks and thins. Even though the contrast is subtle, I was amazed to see that breaking just one so-called &#8220;rule&#8221; could have such a forceful impact on virtually every shape in the typeface.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/03/condor_thickThin.png" alt="" title="condor thick thin" width="960" height="500" class="padb" /></p>
<p>In my next face, Condor, it is the contrast and not the stress that deviates from the norm. While most sans-serifs have relatively little difference between thicks and thins, Condor&#8217;s character comes precisely from that contrast. Amplifying the subtle vertical stress of traditional American gothics, Condor&#8217;s squarish, slender counters stand tall against the outer shapes. </p>
<p>High-contrast faces have an inherent unevenness, and letter drawers often use strategies like tapering stems and modeling edges to temper this effect. I went out of my way to avoid these techniques while drawing Condor, instead choosing to let the contrast do its thing. The other aspects of the design &#x2014; the rational structure, the open forms, the tense curves &#x2014; only serve to underscore the dazzling effect of the thicks and thins.</p>
<p>Approaching Manicotti, Trilby, and Condor through the lens of thick and thin has taught me how a typeface can be held together by a simple idea. The arrangement of thicks and thins in these three designs comes from an idea about how shapes should relate &#x2014; the black forms to the white forms, and the interiors of letters to the exteriors. With these relationships in mind, I can separate the parts that make a typeface interesting from the parts that make it useful, in the hope that I can produce work that is both.</p>

<p>A young and upcoming book designer to keep your eye on: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ninastoessinger">Nina Stössinger</a>. Particularly like this, <em>Das Auge des Wals</em>, a novel by Danish writer Arthur Krasilnikoff:</p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.ninastoessinger.com/?l=e&amp;s=typography"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/02/krasilnikoff_cover.jpg" alt="" title="krasilnikoff cover" width="500" height="332" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>And <em>Nordlandliebe</em>, a 160-page anthology published by Verlag Martin Wallimann: </p>
<p><a class="noborder" href="http://www.ninastoessinger.com/?l=e&amp;s=typography"><img src="http://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2011/02/nll_1-500x277.jpg" alt="" title="Nina" width="500" height="277" class="pad" /></a></p>
<p>Great to see Hrant Papazian&#8217;s TMF Patria used to set the texts.</p>
<p>Some great content being posted to <a href="http://welovetypography.com/">WLT</a>. We’ve now reached 10,000 submissions. I can barely keep up:</p>
