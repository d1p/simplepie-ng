<p>If I had an HGTV producer&#8217;s blank cheque to go redecorate my living room, my first stop would be <a href="http://redbrickhome.ca/">Red Brick</a>. The arcane language of interior design escapes me, but suffice it to say that almost everything in the new-ish store on Carnarvon St. is just lovely &#8211; and in many cases, surprisingly affordable. In addition to sofas, bedframes, chairs and tables, Red Brick carries a carefully curated selection of lamps, clocks, mirrors, quirky knick-knacks, gifts and cards.</p>
<p>On October 5 from 5:30-7:30pm, the store will host the fall kickoff event for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nextnw">NEXT New West</a>, a monthly casual social group for young professionals. Catered by nearby Quantum Deli &amp; Bistro, the free event will be an easygoing opportunity to mingle and meet other young adults living or working in New Westminster, wine glass in hand. Plus, any purchases made that evening will be 10% off.</p>
<p>Unlike most networking events, there isn&#8217;t a lot of business card-swapping and smarmy sales pitches are strongly discouraged. NEXT events are social first, business second. There will be a brief pause in the party for the quarterly &#8216;members spotlight,&#8217; in which three NEXT members will have two or three minutes each to introduce themselves and share what they do professionally in the city. That concludes the formal program.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to attend, please RSVP to nextnw@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Event Details: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What: NEXT NW Fall Kick Off Event, hosted by Red Brick</li>
<li>When: Wednesday October 5th, 2011, 5:30-7:30pm</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4415" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4772513343_f23dac0bd6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4415" title="The future site of Westminster Pier Park.

Taken July 2010 by Dennis S. Hurd." width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The future site of Westminster Pier Park in July 2010. Photo: Dennis S. Hurd.</p></div>
<p>The news came out today that the <a href="http://www.newwestcity.ca/2011/09/19/september_19_2011.php">Westminster Pier Park project is a finalist in the Canadian Urban Institute Brownie Awards</a>, which recognize leadership and innovation in sustainable remediation technologies and excellence in neighbourhood project development. It rekindled in me the pride I felt in our city when I first heard about the proposal for this project. I was also reminded, however, that no matter how successful the park might be, it is likely to remain highly controversial in the near future.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing better symbolizes New Westminster&#8217;s often polarizing politics than the <a href="http://www.newwestcity.ca/business/planning_development/projects_on_the_go/articles213">Westminster Pier Park</a> project. The ambitious, even audacious, $25-million project involves reclaiming a long stretch of blighted brownfield bordering the Fraser River for a new public park.</p>
<div id="attachment_4414" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-19-at-9.16.40-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4414" title="A 3D visualization of the complete Westminster Pier Park" src="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-19-at-9.16.40-PM-300x163.png" alt="A 3D visualization of the complete Westminster Pier Park" width="300" height="163" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A 3D visualization of the complete Westminster Pier Park</p></div>
<p>Even with two-thirds of the project bill covered by the federal and provincial governments, critics of the project blanch at the price tag, and fear that the cost could balloon if the site proves to be more contaminated than expected. But even at this cost, even if the cost goes up, what better omen for the future of New Westminster than to transform <a href="http://greennewwest.blogspot.com/2010/11/on-blobs-and-politics.html">a tragically damaged ecosystem</a> into a verdant oasis downtown?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just another local park project. Westminster Pier Park is another <a href="http://greennewwest.blogspot.com/2011/04/on-being-visionary-one-clear-open.html">beacon of hope that transformation can occur</a>, that the mistakes of the past can be reconciled if not undone. As one of the oldest cities in B.C., the New Westminster of today is burdened with many mistakes made in the past, not only contaminated sites but <a href="http://finiansworld.blogspot.com/2009/03/high-school-built-on-chinese-cemetery.html">forgotten cemeteries</a>, <a href="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/2009/06/05/a-critical-eye-on-canadians-for-reconciliation/">historic institutionalized racism</a>, and more. The true test of our city&#8217;s (and citizens&#8217;) character is what we collectively choose to do about it.</p>
<p>As John Wooden famously said, &#8220;<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/07/if-youre-not-making-mistakes-then-youre-not-doing-anything/">If you&#8217;re not making mistakes, you&#8217;re not doing anything</a>.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe in heaping ashes on our heads over mistakes made by those who lived here long ago. All anyone can ever do is make decisions based on the best information available at the time. If our forefathers knew then what we know now, I&#8217;m sure they would have made some different choices.</p>
<p>Saddled with the mistakes of the past, it is up to us to decide whether we take responsibility to correct those things we do have the power to affect today. Ignoring New Westminster&#8217;s brownfields is an unjustifiable abdication of our responsibility to this place we love. I am proud to live in a city that has the chutzpah to take on the challenge of rehabilitating abused sites like these when it would be so easy to simply look away.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since embarking on my own entrepreneurial endeavours I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised to see just how many people augment or even replace their 9-to-5 with freelance work. I always find it inspiring to meet people with the gumption to work on their terms. Some do it in a quest to seek balance, some are pursuing their passions and others are just making a little extra money on the side. Above all, it seems the biggest appeal is the flexibility and autonomy of a freelancer&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>It sounds like a dream, but freelancing has its challenges too. Support from mentors and peers can really make a difference. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.thenetworkhub.ca/freelancecamp/">Vancouver Freelance Camp comes in</a>. The second annual <a href="http://www.unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/">&#8216;unconference&#8217;</a> is coming up Saturday, September 10, from 9am to 5pm, just a few days before <a href="http://www.thenetworkhub.ca/">The Network Hub</a>&#8216;s grand opening at their brand new second location in New Westminster&#8217;s <a href="http://rivermarket.ca/">River Market</a>.</p>
<p>An unconference doesn&#8217;t follow the usual program of speakers and panels at a conference. At most conferences the best part is meeting and learning from other people in your field. At an unconference, there is no divide between speakers and audience. The schedule is created the morning of the conference, and it is whatever the attendees make it. Anyone can make a pitch to be a presenter, and the freelancers vote on who they want to hear speak. Last year&#8217;s event offered a choice of 22 presentations for the 130 people attending, including some coming from as far away as Kelowna, Victoria and Seattle. This year&#8217;s event aims to be even bigger. This will be the first local event to use Google+ Hangouts to empower up to 25 people to view presentations and ask questions from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Registration to Freelance Camp is just $10 with the proceeds going to charity. For more information, or to register for the event, visit the website at <a href="http://www.thenetworkhub.ca/freelancecamp/">http://www.thenetworkhub.ca/freelancecamp/</a> and follow Vancouver Freelance Camp on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/604freelancers">@604freelancers</a>. <strong>If you&#8217;d like to enter to win two free tickets to Vancouver Freelance Camp, please leave a comment on this post <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before 2pm PST on Tuesday, September 6.</span> </strong>Tell us about your freelance business (or the freelance business you&#8217;d like to start) and one piece of advice for other freelancers or one thing you wish you knew about freelancing. Once a winner is picked, Jen will let you know who won in the comments (the winner will also be notified by email, so make sure you include a valid email in the comment form).</p>
<p>The Network Hub is a coworking space, where freelancers and other entrepreneurs can rent desk and meeting space as they need it, one day a week, one day a month or all year round. It&#8217;s the place you go when you wear out your welcome at wifi-ed coffee shops but don&#8217;t necessarily want to rent your own office. The really good stuff isn&#8217;t the desk or the wifi or even the meeting rooms and mail service. It&#8217;s the opportunity to meet other freelancers, to learn from each other, expand your network of contacts and support each other as your businesses grow. As you can tell, I think it&#8217;s a good idea! (I&#8217;m planning to give it a try myself.) The Network Hub&#8217;s New Westminster location will open for business September 15. Pricing starts at $5 per hour or $35 per day for drop-in, $100 a month for a five-day pass, or $250 per month for permanent, dedicated desk space.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our first year in our home, Will planted a vegetable garden in our front yard. It was a glorious explosion of cherry tomatoes, snap peas, carrots, beets, salad greens, rosemary, sage, chives and more. But then we had another baby, and like so many other hobbies, work on the garden took a back seat to shushing, rocking and cooing.</p>
<p>We had hoped to reclaim the garden this year, but we were humbled by the invasion of weeds that took over our garden. Every time he went outside, Will grumbled about the garden and threatened to nix the whole thing. Then one day, he did.</p>
<p>I loved our garden, weeds and all, and never failed to believe in our power to redeem it. He grumbled, I hoped. Finally, one day Will came home and announced the gardeners were coming next Tuesday to grass over our garden. I was opposed at first, but conceded because I could tell it was important to Will. Once the work was done,  however, I was shocked to find how much I like it. The emerald grass sets off the purple lavender bordering the walk and makes our other remaining plants really stand out. Clearing the riotous random growth makes our garden look more intentional and peaceful.</p>
<p>I don’t like to admit defeat, but I am forced to admit that sometimes life becomes jumbled with too many commitments. Sometimes it’s better to just grass it over.</p>
<p>I have often seen the metaphor in gardening and blogging. I have felt very guilty that Tenth to the Fraser has been such a sadly neglected patch of the Internet these past few months, and I&#8217;ve been at a loss of what to do about it. I keep meaning to return to it and help it thrive again, but if I’m honest with myself, right now it isn’t the priority it once was.</p>
<p>Life is full of surprises. These past few months have been personally tumultuous (in a good, &#8216;this is helping me grow&#8217; kind of way). I’m in a very different place than I was when Will and I launched this blog. My attention is elsewhere, and it’s become obvious.</p>
<p>Much good has come of these changes: more time with my two young children, more time out and about enjoying the sun in the community I love, and a newly rekindled interest in long-abandoned hobbies like playing piano, sewing, cooking and reading actual paper books. Unhappily, all this personal growth has come at the expense of other interests, most visibly in the neglect of this blog.</p>
<p>This post is partly an apology for that neglect and partly an appeal for help to decide what to do next. Tenth to the Fraser is more than just my blog. I feel like it “belongs” to the community too. Given that, I’d like to hear from you before I decide what to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure those of you who noticed how long it&#8217;s been since I&#8217;ve blogged here have been wondering what&#8217;s been going on. I&#8217;m sorry for abandoning you all so suddenly. As you know, Tenth to the Fraser is my hobby, not my job. Other commitments have demanded priority, and I’ve had to put blogging on the backburner.</p>
<p>In the personal tempest during which I was rethinking my work situation and mourning the bummer summer that rained out Summerfest, I made the decision to simplify my commitments and bid adieu to full-time work in favour of working from home as an independent consultant. That business has taken off more quickly than I expected (yay!) but the unexpected result is that I have had to put aside blogging these past months in order to focus my much-reduced time at the computer on billable hours. Surprisingly to me, I really like having less time at the computer and more time in the world. Before I knew it, my brief hiatus ‘while I figured things out’ stretched longer and longer. I can’t ignore any more that I have to change how I’m going about things.</p>
<p>I have been wrestling with what to do with Tenth to the Fraser. I remain passionate about life in New Westminster, and I love the parallel online communities on Twitter and Facebook that have emerged along with the blog. And yet, the inner need that drove me to launch this site has been met. I was motivated to start blogging because I felt lost and disconnected in New Westminster, and I longed for a more meaningful life in my community. Thanks to the people I have met and the opportunities I have received through blogging, I have received all that in spades. Paradoxically, now that I do feel connected and involved in my community, I don’t feel as strong an urge to write about it.</p>
<p>Realistically, I don’t see myself having much time to blog for at least the next month or two. I’ve got two vacations to plan (&amp; enjoy!), a number of big project deliverables to complete and a ton of miscellaneous projects that I’ve been putting off doing for far too long. On the other hand, it’s possible that once my son’s back in school and these big projects are handed off that I’ll have more time and mental energy to invest here. I might feel very differently a few months from now than I do right now.</p>
<p>I’m sorry for rambling on so. Thanks to those of you who have indulged me and read to the end. If you have any words of advice or encouragement I’d appreciate hearing it!</p>

At the time the forecast was for a sprinkle, and the organizing committee and I didn't want a little rain to ruin the fun. Unfortunately, the reality is that today the forecast has worsened, and upon further discussion with the committee we realized it was foolish to continue.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrote optimistically about pressing on with Summerfest, rain or shine (the post is removed to avoid confusing people further). At the time the forecast was for a sprinkle, and the organizing committee and I didn&#8217;t want a little rain to ruin the fun. Unfortunately, the reality is that today the forecast has worsened, and upon further discussion with the committee we realized it was foolish to continue.</p>
<p>I hate to say one thing and do another, but the fact is that the weather is so terrible that few people would be likely to come out, and it didn&#8217;t seem fair to the vendors, volunteers and entertainers to ask them to come stand in the rain for four hours when everyone we spoke to said it was too rainy to come. The decision was not an easy one. It seemed that either way we would be disappointing someone.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for your support, and I will let you know what happens next with Summerfest. The committee will meet soon to discuss whether it&#8217;s possible to reschedule. If you&#8217;re reading this and you&#8217;d like to pitch in to help with the work involved in rescheduling, please let me know in the comments or via email (briana at tenthtothefraser.ca) and I&#8217;ll be in touch to let you know what the committee decides.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support, and once again, I am very sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Briana</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The front-page article on today's Newsleader is about New Westminster's new green bin program. According to the article, with the introduction of a dedicated waste bin for food scraps, New Westminster has gone from having a 31 per cent rate of diverting waste from the landfill in 2009 to 59 per cent in the last three months of 2010. How do you like the green bin program? What do you do to reduce trash? How do you think New West could further reduce garbage sent to the landfill?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.bclocalnews.com/greater_vancouver/newwestminsternewsleader/news/122519303.html">front-page article in today&#8217;s Newsleader</a> is about New Westminster&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.newwestcity.ca/residents/residents_services/garbage__recycling_calendar/automated_waste_collection.php">green bin program</a>. According to the article, with the introduction of a dedicated bin for food scraps, New Westminster has gone from having a 31 per cent rate of diverting waste from the landfill in 2009 to 59 per cent in the last three months of 2010.</p>
<p>Personally, I love the green bin, and I had been looking forward to <a href="http://www.abbotsfordtimes.com/story_print.html?id=4738214&amp;sponsor">the new single-stream recycling bins that are coming</a> (you can toss in all recyclables without having to sort them all), but I see there&#8217;s <a href="http://zerowastevancouver.blogspot.com/2011/05/write-to-new-west-councillor-jonathan.html">a counter-argument that this approach lowers the quality of the recyclables</a>, which results in a lower price for them on the commodities market (I didn&#8217;t even know there <em>was</em> a commodities market for recyclables &#8230; shows what I know!). The city is aware of this and has taken the position that more recycling is better (and I think I agree) but it just goes to show that these things are much more complex than they seem.</p>
<p>As I wrote this post I was reminded me of <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/01/13/freakonomics-radio-the-economics-of-trash/">a Freakonomics podcast I listened to once on the subject of trash</a>, which floated some interesting incentives to encourage waste reduction, including charging people for trash pickup based on the volume or weight of the trash their household puts out at the curb. &#8220;Pay-as-you-throw&#8221; needs to be done carefully if the goal is to increase compliance with trash diversion programs. Some folks in the U.S. live in communities with privatized trash pickup, and because they would have to pay an extra fee for recycling pickup they just don&#8217;t bother. At all.</p>
<p>How do you like the green bin program? What do you do to reduce trash? How do you think New West could further reduce garbage sent to the landfill?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[My neighbour reminded me today that I forgot to post this week&#8217;s New West Wednesday question yesterday. Sorry! Hopefully you won&#8217;t mind if we do it today instead.
This week, I&#8217;d like to hear what you think about Residents&#8217; Associations in New Westminster. Have you ever attended a meeting? Why or why not? What do you think about your RA? What do you think the role of RAs is or should be for New West residents?

Homey meals like mac 'n cheese are spiced up with gourmet additions like chorizo, and on that hot plate coffee is Kicking Horse Coffee - quality stuff. Inside, the decor is the kind of thrift-store chic you'd see in an art-school major's first college flat. It's zany, colourful and lovingly retro.

<p>A cash-only diner with serve-yourself coffee ready to pour from a hot plate, the Coming Home Cafe may be low on frills but it doesn&#8217;t skimp on the flourishes. Homey meals like mac &#8216;n cheese are spiced up with gourmet additions like chorizo, and on that hot plate coffee is Kicking Horse Coffee &#8211; quality stuff. Inside, the decor is the kind of thrift-store chic you&#8217;d see in an art-school major&#8217;s first college flat. It&#8217;s zany, colourful and lovingly retro.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people rave about the Coming Home Cafe, but I&#8217;m not often around that part of Sixth. Until recently I&#8217;d only stopped by for a brief coffee on the patio, but after seeing a bunch of people mention the cafe on Twitter and in the comments on various posts, I made a point of coming by again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Coming Home&#8217;s free wifi to write this post now on my second visit this week. Last time I had the divine pulled pork sandwiches (flavourful, topped with coleslaw on a just-crispy-enough bun). Today though, I&#8217;m trying the mac &#8216;n cheese special mentioned above. The nostalgic classic is decadently creamy and cheesy, and that chorizo gives it a nice touch of spice. The prices seemed a mite high at first glance until I tasted the quality ingredients &#8211; and saw the note on the board that all prices include HST. Mains range between about $6-8 for the most part, and the coffee starts at $2.75 (but includes a free refill with meal).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tried the all-day breakfast yet, but the menu looks great, and I would expect the quality would be as good as lunch. There are also a few nice options like gluten-free bread and options like adding tofu or sauerkraut when you build your own breakfast.</p>
<p>As an aside, if I ever write a post on remarkable bathrooms of New West, the Coming Home Cafe would make the list. Their washroom is a cheeky corner featuring decoupaged paper with bathroom trivia and a few hilarious diagrams. It&#8217;s not the fanciest washroom in New West, but it&#8217;s definitely memorable!</p>
<p>I have only three quibbles with the restaurant: like most mom-n-pop stores in New West, it&#8217;s closed on Mondays (annoying to discover when you&#8217;re standing outside the door, as I did on my first attempt to revisit this place), there&#8217;s no debit or credit card processing (if you bring out the plastic you&#8217;re directed to the G&amp;F Financial cash machine across the street) and the music is terrible. The fiercely poppy mix is not at all my cup of tea (though some of it is so bad it edges towards ironic goodness). The first two points can be overcome with a little planning, and the last can be endured (and I suppose could be a plus for fans of autotune and MC Hammer / Black Eyed Peas mashups).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a short walk from the centre of Uptown, but The Coming Home Cafe is worth going a little out of your way. The food is excellent, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is creative and fun.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crime is down in British Columbia. In New Westminster, it&#8217;s way down.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General of B.C., the provincial crime rate has dropped 19% over the past decade. In New Westminster, it&#8217;s down a striking 32%.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years in New West:</p>
<ul>
<li>criminal code offences decreased by 25%</li>
<li>annual crime rates per 1000 persons decreased by 35%</li>
<li>auto thefts decreased by 52%</li>
<li>robbery crimes decreased by 34%</li>
<li>overall property crime rate decreased by 32%</li>
</ul>
<p>In their <a href="http://www.nwpolice.org/mediaReleases2011-05.html#MediaReleases">news release</a> sharing the above statistics, the New Westminster Police said a number of factors have resulted in a lower crime rate, including new policing initiatives and demographic shifts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Province-wide a number of factors are involved in the decreasing numbers. These include policing programs such as the Bait Car program and PRIME reporting systems wherein police have instant access to information on criminals and criminal activity. Generally speaking, crimes tend to be committed by males in their late teens and early twenties. In BC, the population in this age group is decreasing,&#8221; it says in the NWPD release.</p>
<p>The NWPD also points to programs improving public awareness of crime and reporting criminal activities, specifically Crime Free Multi-Housing, the Park Safety Initiative, School Liaison Officers and, the Operational Support Unit.</p>
<p>If you want to be involved in improving public safety in New Westminster, you can call the NWPD&#8217;s Crime Prevention Unit at 604-529-2528 to find out more information on policing programs and volunteer opportunities in our community.</p>

<p>Peter Julian loves his job. But <a href="http://peterjulianmp.ndp.ca/">the incumbent Member of Parliament for Burnaby-New Westminster</a> can’t help but wish Canada wasn’t so dang big. Twenty hours a week in airplanes and airports flying between Ottawa and New Westminster is the one part of the job he’d change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t live in Ottawa. I live here. I wish the country was a little smaller,&#8221; Peter confided when he joined Will and I for a glass of beer at Drink a few days ago for a pre-election chat.</p>
<p>Will and I don’t always vote for the NDP, but this election there was no question who we would support. Peter’s an able representative for New Westminster and has <a href="http://peterjulianmp.ndp.ca/biography">a reputation as one of the hardest-working MPs in Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>On the other side of the electoral boundary, our friend and fellow editorial board member Jen Arbo, who usually votes Green, is also voting Orange this election (she explains <a href="http://www.arbolog.com/?p=1525">why Fin Donnelly wins her vote</a> on her personal blog, the Arbolog).</p>
<p>Given <a href="http://www.straight.com/article-390173/vancouver/corporate-media-line-behind-stephen-harper-and-conservatives">the recent shenanigans in Ottawa</a>, I was disappointed to see <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/editorials/the-globes-election-endorsement-facing-up-to-our-challenges/article2001610/">The Globe &amp; Mail</a>, the <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/editorials/EDITORIAL+Conservative+majority+needed+through+turbulent+times/4701393/story.html">Vancouver Sun</a> and <a href="http://www.theprovince.com/news/decision-canada/Editorial+Tory+majority+would+best+Canada/4693088/story.html">The Province</a> newspapers all endorse Steven Harper&#8217;s Conservatives. In New Westminster, the Tenth to the Fraser editorial board endorses the NDP.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/983376--toronto-star-endorses-the-ndp">we are by no means alone</a>. This once ho-hum election has taken a surprising turn towards the end, with <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/health/surge+puts+Conservative+majority+risk+Liberals+collapse+poll/4700410/story.html">pollsters across the country reporting an NDP surge</a> that has caught everyone, including the NDP, by surprise. On Monday when the polls close, we could see another Harper minority, but it’s also possible it could be a Harper majority (thanks to vote-splitting on the progressive side) or even an NDP-led coalition government.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.straight.com/article-390033/vancouver/straight-slate">The Georgia Straight has also endorsed Peter Julian and Fin Donnelly in New Westminster</a>. Here&#8217;s their rationale:</p>
<p>Peter Julian:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a no-brainer. He’s a very capable politician with a firm grasp on complicated issues, including health care and international trade. Julian is also bilingual, which raises the possibility of him becoming a future leader of the party should Layton decide at some point to step down.</p>
<p>First elected in 2004, he wins with larger pluralities in each successive election. This time should be no different. If the NDP pulls off the upset of the century and wins the most seats, Julian will go straight into cabinet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fin Donnelly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The former Coquitlam councillor won a stunning landslide in a 2009 by-election by appealing to traditional New Democrats in New Westminster as well as the sizeable number of environmentally minded voters in the Tri-Cities. As the NDP fisheries critic, he has been a relentless opponent of open-net fish farms. He also introduced a private member’s bill to ban oil supertankers off the north coast.</p>
<p>For many years, Donnelly has maintained strong ties with B.C.’s aboriginal community. He helped win trust by swimming the length of the Fraser River twice to raise awareness about the importance of protecting fish habitat.</p></blockquote>
<p>For his part, Peter Julian thinks that voters, particularly young voters, have had enough of negative campaigning and <a href="http://pushedleft.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-harpers-message-control-has-hurt.html">Steven Harper’s legendary message control</a>. According to Peter, the NDP in New Westminster are seeing unusually high numbers of volunteers in their 20s and 30s getting involved in the campaign. In addition, the <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20110426/advance-poll-turnout-rises-110426/20110426?s_name=election2011">advance poll turnout is much higher than in previous years</a>, which may indicate a trend towards higher voter turnout overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something phenomenally profound about what has happened over the last few weeks across the country. We&#8217;re getting reports that people are saying that people are stepping up to vote for an NDP government, and they like Jack, they like that the campaign is positive and that it is substantive issues we are talking about,” Peter said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a pretty profound transformation happening now as we speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, polls can be misleading and can lead people to change their vote based on what other people are doing, rather than vote for the candidate they most support. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/reneestephen/status/62925820699738112">Renee Stephen tweeted</a> that it would be more useful for Elections Canada to ban polls instead of <a href="http://techchange.org/2011/04/29/canadians-protest-election-results-ban-using-social-media-ahead-of-monday-polls/">election-day tweets revealing early results</a>. I asked Peter about this too.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Seduction-Surveys-Canadas-Federal-Elections/dp/1425135544/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304206875&amp;sr=1-1">written a book on this</a>, on polls. I think polls have their place but I think it bothers me to the extent the the mainstream media covers polls instead of the real issues,” Peter told me. “We get a lot of information on polls but we don&#8217;t get a lot of information on homelessness and poverty and record levels of student debt. These are the kind of issues that actually have a profound impact on people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>“The polls are a superficial and cheap way of saying you&#8217;re covering politics without really covering the impacts of what politics does.</p>
<p>In Peter’s view, the government’s role is to create a level playing field for all citizens, particularly caring for the weakest among us.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must put the resources to the essentials and take care of them first. Over the last 15 years there’s been a noticeable decline in our quality of life and standard of living because our priorities aren&#8217;t right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a diminishing of the government and at the same time we&#8217;ve seen a number of our resources allocated to what I would call pet projects like corporate tax cuts, expensive fighter jets and the G20 summit. &#8221;</p>
<p>The Liberals and the Conservatives typically try to frame the discussion as a two-way race with them as the parties most likely to win. As I mentioned in the beginning, the NDP’s showing more support in the polls currently than the Liberals, but even if they weren’t, a vote for a third party shouldn’t be assumed to be a wasted vote.</p>
<p>Having an NDP MP hasn’t penalized New West in terms of federal funding dollars (we received federal dollars to help build the new youth centre and the riverfront Pier Park, to name two examples), nor has it prevented Peter Julian from passing new legislation. Private Member’s Bills introduced by Peter include tougher drunk driving laws that would lower the blood alcohol limit required to establish impaired driving and eliminating the toxic substances (PBDEs) found in fire retardants, a Bill that is strongly endorsed by firefighters and supported by more than 130 Canadian municipalities including the City of Burnaby and the City of New Westminster.</p>
<p>And so, regardless of how this election turns out: Conservative majority or minority, Liberal or NDP-led coalition, or even a Green Party sweep, Will and I are endorsing Peter Julian as our New Westminster representative, and we agree with Jen&#8217;s endorsement of Fin Donnelly in New Westminster-Coquitlam.</p>
<p>Peter has a track record of tirelessly working for New Westminster and continues to bring an optimism and energy to his work in Ottawa that we admire and respect. He’s a damn good MP and we are lucky to have him. He easily outshines the other candidates in his riding.</p>
<p>In New West-Coquitlam, Conservative <a href="http://www.dianadilworth.ca/">Diana Dilworth</a> is a respectable candidate. She’s a smart woman and has a lot to offer public life. But although she believes she can work for change from within the Conservative party if elected, we respectfully disagree. The Conservatives under Steven Harper are so tightly controlled that we believe it is unlikely that Diana would be able to advance the causes she believes in.</p>
<p>Like Jen, we believe that <a href="http://www.findonnelly.ndp.ca/">Fin Donnelly</a> has shown himself to be a solid advocate for environmental and community issues. We’d like to see him have more time in Ottawa to show us what he can do.</p>
<p>All that said, while we wanted to share who we were voting for and why, we’d like to hear your opinion. Whether you agree or disagree with our choice of Peter Julian and Fin Donnelly for New Westminster, please share your election picks in the comments. And no matter who you vote for, you’re welcome to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=194369867272701">join us in watching the election results roll in at the Vote Party</a>, May 2 from 5:30pm onward at the Heritage Grill. Hope to see you there!</p>

New Westminster District Parent Advisory Council (DPAC) wants to double the eating time for elementary and middle school children from 15 minutes to 30 minutes so that our kids can have more time to chew. In this week's New West Wednesday, let's talk about lunch: do you agree with DPAC that kids need more time to eat?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our kids can eat lunch in 15 minutes, but should they? New Westminster District Parent Advisory Council (DPAC) wants to double the eating time for elementary and middle school children from 15 minutes to 30 minutes so that our kids can have more time to chew.</p>
<p>Currently, students have 15 minutes to eat their lunch, but as I understand it, that time is supposed to include washing up before eating, clearing away lunch kits at the end and getting coats &amp; shoes on for playtime afterwards. Even if washing up &amp; donning boots takes only 5 minutes (and I would guess it&#8217;s longer for 30 small fry in a small space), that only leaves 10 minutes to eat &#8211; and no time for talking.</p>
<p>It may sound like a small issue given the complicated stuff SD40 is wrestling with, but it&#8217;s not just about placating Poky Penelopes and Slow-eater Peters (and their helicopter parents). There are good reasons to believe that a 15-minute eating period is not only uncomfortably short (do you take only 15 minutes for lunch? I sure don&#8217;t) but also has some potentially serious impacts on kids&#8217; health and ability to learn in class.</p>
<p>In a letter of support for DPAC, former Chief Medical Health Officer for Vancouver Coastal Health Dr. John Blatherwick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this time when we realize that the link between obesity and poor health needs a concerted effort by our entire community, it makes sense for the New Westminster School Board to consider <a href="http://district.sd40.bc.ca/sites/default/files/Open%20Agenda%20110427%202%20of%202_1.pdf">the research that [DPAC Vice-chair MaryAnn Mortensen] has put together</a> showing an optimal lunch eating time between 24 and 35 minutes. It becomes obvious that a 45 minute lunch break is insufficient.</p>
<p>We need time for students to wash up, eat, relax and PLAY during their lunch break.  If we need a minimum of 24 minutes for them to eat, it is obvious that a 45 minute period means something is dropped.  Often this is eating (which leads to poor class room outcomes in the afternoon), washing up (which leads to health problems), relaxing (poor afternoon education outcomes) and PLAYING (both poor education outcomes and health problems).</p>
<p>The New Westminster School Board is in the education business.  And good education outcomes come with good health outcomes&#8230;As the former School Medical Health Officer for New Westminster School District, I strongly urge the Board to NOT put this issue aside for another year.  Health and education outcomes will suffer.  This is an issue to address now.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Blatherwick mentions in the last paragraph, <a href="http://district.sd40.bc.ca/events/2011-04-27/school-board-meeting-wednesday-730-pm-city-hall">this issue will be discussed at tonight&#8217;s school board meeting</a>. Those with strong opinions on the issue may want to speak out at the meeting at 7:30pm at City Hall tonight.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should School District 40 extend the eating period for students? If so, how do you think the district should adjust the school day so that teaching and playing time aren&#8217;t impacted?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: this is yet another post about politics &#038; elections in New West. I know many of you don&#8217;t much like this sort of thing, and there&#8217;s been a bit of a run on this topic of late. Please bear with us &#8211; we will return to our regular programming shortly! Voting day is Monday, May 2, and then we have a bit of a break before the real &#8216;silly season&#8217; begins before the municipal elections this November &#8230; </em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/2011/04/14/meet-new-westminster-federal-election-candidates-april-20-at-la-rustica/">all-candidates event</a> co-hosted by New Westminster Environmental Partners, NEXT New West and Tenth to the Fraser went swimmingly tonight, with seven out of the eight candidates representing the Conservatives, NDP, Liberals and Greens showing up to mix and mingle with local voters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tenthtothefraser.ca/2011/04/14/meet-new-westminster-federal-election-candidates-april-20-at-la-rustica/">As promised</a>, &#8216;speechifying&#8217; was kept to a minimum. Although each candidate did get a few minutes to introduce themselves, the tone seemed less scripted than what you typically find at an all-candidates&#8217; event. The real fun was in the social, not just shaking hands with the candidates or bending their ears on a topic of personal concern, but meeting other local people who are motivated to engage in civic life. The people in attendance were quite a diverse crowd, with supporters from all camps as well as some who hadn&#8217;t yet made up their minds who to vote for. There were citizens of all ages, from twentysomethings to retirees. The room was buzzing with great conversation. For the most part, people were respectful of others with different political beliefs. It was refreshing to see.</p>
<p>For those of you who may have wished to attend the event, or who were curious about what the candidates said in their soapbox riffs, I have embedded some video I took with my iPhone at the event. I apologize for the poor lighting, but at least the audio should be clear enough to hear what they had to say. </p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to say a big thank-you to all the candidates who came out. It was great to have representatives attend from the four most popular parties.</p>
<p>I also announced at the event that I&#8217;d like to host a &#8216;Vote Party,&#8217; in which we go out after the polls close and raise a glass together to watch the election results roll in. I&#8217;m taking suggestions for venues now if you&#8217;d like to weigh in with your opinion. Suggestions so far have included <a href="http://www.westminsterclub.com/">the Westminster Club</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/14/1471952/restaurant/Vancouver/Drink-Urban-Lounge-New-Westminster">Drink Lounge</a>, and <a href="http://theterminalpub.com/">The Terminal Pub</a>. Let me know your preferences/suggestions in the comments, and watch for an upcoming post with the details once I pick a venue!</p>

<p>As of May 2 the public health nurses will be offering vaccinations and other services at <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=610+sixth+st.+new+westminster&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hq=&#038;hnear=610+6th+St,+New+Westminster,+British+Columbia+V3L+5V1&#038;z=16">218-610 Sixth St</a>. The phone number will remain the same, 604-777-6740. I just thought I&#8217;d pass on the news because I know I&#8217;d automatically head down to the old office for my kids&#8217; next vaccinations if I hadn&#8217;t heard the news! </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a map showing the new location: </p>
