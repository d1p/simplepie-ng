<p>It is now officially a FitBloggin&#8217; tradition to squish all the attendees into a group photo. This year we did it after the keynote address on Saturday so we lost quite a few folks but it&#8217;s still a fabulous pic of the troopers. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Monica Olivas </strong>of  <a href="http://runeatrepeat.com/">http://runeatrepeat.com/</a> presented &#8220;Blogging 101 &#8211; Breaking into health and fitness blogging.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AbBkv0LjyfmxZGd0d2o1bmhfMjFnaHg5cXRkOA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;authkey=COfg44MM">Her presentation is here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitblogchats.com/presentations/#Monica"> Click here for the webinar</a></p>
<p>This talk applies to WordPress, tumblr, blogger, etc.<br />
Free blogging platforms offer your space  as a subdomain, such as YOUR-NAME.wordpress.com. Check to make sure your domain is available if moving to self hosting. It&#8217;s also a good idea to get your blog name on each platform, such as blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, etc. &#8211; even if you aren&#8217;t going to actively use them.<br />
WIndows Live Writer is great for writing content offline. You can save links to things that you use a lot, which saves time.</p>
<p>Use Feedburner &#8211; it helps people follow you by making it easy.<br />
<strong><br />
Question:</strong> &#8220;What do I blog about?&#8221;<span id="more-1951"></span></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Blog about anything you want!  Blog about what you KNOW, What YOU love, what YOU enjoy.</p>
<p>You can also pick a niche (mommy blogging, Weight Watchers, Gluten Free recipes, Crafts, photography) or try life casting (day to day, Part/whole, daily changes, 3 things Thursday, flashback friday) or anything in-between.</p>
<p>Make sure you personalizing your blog with a bio and photo representation of yourself. You don&#8217;t have to use pictures of yourself, you can not use your name &#8211; but your blog should be consistent so your readers can identify with you.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#8220;How can I approach blogging about food/fitness when I am not a trained prodessional in either of those areas, yet love to talk about them?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You don&#8217;t need to be an expert &#8211; most people aren&#8217;t and yet still offer advice on training, diet, etc. It&#8217;s okay to talk about your own experience &#8211; that&#8217;s what people are interested in. A disclaimer is a good idea stating that your blog is based on personal experience and that you aren&#8217;t a professional [trainer/doctor/dietician]. People want to see other real people.<br />
<strong>Question: </strong>&#8220;How much to I share?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Be mindful of how much you share. Monica shares a lot and doesn&#8217;t have a problem with it. Be ready for a potential backlash if you over-share &#8211; watch the photos you are posting (family &amp; friends &#8211; make sure they don&#8217;t mind)  Make you subjects look good (no boogers hanging out of noses). Teachers should be careful, if not overly cautious.<br />
<strong>Question: </strong>&#8220;How do you blog about controversial topics without fear &amp; censoring yourself? How do you maintain your privacy while blogging?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Monica doesn&#8217;t approach controversial topics much. Rather than censoring herself, Monica will avoid topics.<br />
Monica isn&#8217;t so concerned about shielding her privacy. But, she&#8217;s not foolish, either. She won&#8217;t say exactly where she lives, for example.</p>
<p>Someone mentions that employers look at potential employees information with Google.  &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s very important to know this stuff is out there.&#8221;  You&#8217; don&#8217;t need to answer every question or address every comment and you need to set your own boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>On Generating Content: </strong> Write down ideas, even if they don&#8217;t seem immediately useful or relevant. Keep notes! Someone mentioned they draw inspiration from <a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can keep an editorial calendar.<br />
Pay attention to what readers respond to. You can grow on these subjects</p>
<p>Always cite your sources.<br />
Link Back when you mention someone.<br />
Don&#8217;t copy and past posts or recipes and then casually mention them &#8211; give credit. Someone suggests just linking to original post for the recipe instead of posting it on your own blog.<br />
Link to products and magazines &#8211; companies follow these and may reach out to you.</p>
<p><strong>Get Better at Blogging</strong><br />
Update consistently<br />
Include a picture or video<br />
Make it interesting</p>
<p><strong>Getting more readers</strong><br />
Be patient. It takes work and time.<br />
Again, be consistent<br />
Use Social Media to promote and participate. It builds friendships in addition to driven traffic.<br />
Attend meet-ups or conferences.<br />
Comment on other blogs<br />
Seriously, be patient.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#8220;How do I make time for blogging? How much time do I need?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Answer: </strong>Making time for blogging is just like making time for a gym or crochet or any other hobby. Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you think its possible to be a successfully blogger if you keep your blog hidden from your friends and family?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>It&#8217;s simpler if you don&#8217; have to hide it. Your readership is probably (hopefully) more than your immediate friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Question: &#8220;</strong>When did you decide to tell people? Did it help your blog or make the process easier?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Answer: &#8220;</strong>Monica didn&#8217;t hide it. It made it easier. She announced it to her co-workers. Most said &#8220;Um, ok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people get mad or hurt if they find out you have a blog &amp; you didn&#8217;t tell them.  &#8220;You have this double life!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong> Question: </strong>&#8220;I want to blog about how much my job sucks. Would  you just not post it?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t post anything that affects money or living conditions &#8211; roommates, work, etc.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jennette Fulda </strong><a href="http://www.makemyblogpretty.com/">Make My Blog Pretty</a></p>
<p><a href="http://makemyblogpretty.com/design101/">Slides are here</a> &#8211; with many links.</p>
<p>Ms. Fulda is an experienced Web designer who helps improve their blogs. Also &#8211; she sometimes gets a little splotchy and it&#8217;s nothing to be alarmed about.</p>
<p><strong>What is good Web design?</strong><span id="more-1957"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s up for debate</p>
<p>Site should be both 1) usable &amp; intuitive and 2) aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Excellent boot &#8211; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=roswewapas-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349&#038;creativeASIN=0321344758">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0321344758&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></em>, by Steve Krug</p>
<p>Beautiful design draws people in &#8211; we love beautiful things.</p>
<p>Usable vs. Pretty is a balancing act.</p>
<p>Good design = good user experience.</p>
<p>Basic Tips.</p>
<p>7-9 menu items (secondary items should be in a drop down)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t overstuff the sidebar</p>
<p>We read from top to left &#8211; it&#8217;s good to organize your content that way. Eye scanning studies support this. People SCAN and look for the important stuff, so we need to put it where they can see it.</p>
<p>Important stuff goes at the top. Things like: Navigation, RSS feed, Search Bar, About Statement, Social Media Links.</p>
<p>See Ad sense for maps for ads, based by google, for optimal ad placement.</p>
<p>Use the footer &#8211; great for secondary stuff.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make your header too tall. Put the important stuff &#8220;above the fold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make your site too wide. You don&#8217;t want to scroll in two directions.</p>
<p>How wide should my site be? You can use analytics to find the average screen resolution.</p>
<p>Leave room for the chrome/skin.</p>
<p>Main content area is usually 400-500px wide</p>
<p>Sidebar is usually 1 column 300-320px or two columns each 160px wide.</p>
<p>Standard ad sizes are:</p>
<p>300 X 250</p>
<p>160x 600</p>
<p>Avoid slow loading pages. You have between 4-8 seconds before they leave.</p>
<p>Avoid using too many scripts.</p>
<p>Have you posts load before your sidebars, if possible.</p>
<p>Resize your images to the actual size.</p>
<p>WordPress will adjust images for your site.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make music Autoplay. You might be a work</p>
<p>Use safe, web based fonts.</p>
<p>Google Web fonts.</p>
<p>Categories of Fonts:</p>
<p>Old style, Sans-serif, script, Modern, Slad serif, decorative.</p>
<p>Serifs are the little slope-y things on the ends of the characters &#8211; they have variable widths. Sans-serif font have all widths the same.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use decorative for everything. Only use one type of each font on your site-  for example using two different sans-serif fonts make it confusing and odd. You really just need one.</p>
<p>Make text  legible. Not too Small, or too big &#8211; watch color contrast.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use crazy colors unless you have a reason to. USe a pleasing palette of colors.</p>
<p>See: kuler.adobe. com</p>
<p>Try pulling colors from a photo you like, or a painting, to generate your pallette.</p>
<p>Be consistent with your styles and layout.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s suggests hiding the blogger.com users remove nav bar….</p>
<p>Use a favicon to present a more professional, polished image a blogger. It needs to be in the iCO format.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s online tools to do this, and a free photoshop plugin (see slides for links)</p>
<p>Design for your user, not for yourself.</p>
<p>Good design know no language.</p>
<p>Do you see what I see? Test in Internet Explorer, FF are the dominant browsers.</p>
<p>Chrome and Safari &#8211; you can/should also test using these.</p>
<p>Analytics will help determine what browers your visitors are using. IE has different versions which behave differently.</p>
<p>For Mac, you can try parallels, Virtual PCs, to install Windows for testing.  browsershots.org. browserlab.adobe.com (free for now).</p>
<p>Feed readers format things differently. Don&#8217;t freak out. Your RSS is okay &#8211; the browser is doing it.</p>
<p>Check on mobile.</p>
<p>WordPress.org/ &lt;- mobilepress to create an on-the-fly mobile version of your site.</p>
<p>You can customize blogger themes.</p>
<p>Use images when appropriate. Don&#8217;t steal. Check out creative commons content for images.</p>
<p>You can search flickr for CC content.</p>
<p>iStockphoto.com for stock photos. The credits expire after a year</p>
<p>Social media buttons &#8211; try Sharethis.com &amp; addthis.com or make your own. There are free ones you can use that may match your site. Try to be tasteful.</p>
<p>Image editors photoshop, gimp, picnik.com</p>
<p>Avoid special effects for the sake of special effect.s</p>
<p>Firefox plugins to support Web design: measrureit , firebug, Web developer toolbar</p>
<p>Be inspired by other people. But don&#8217;t steal.</p>
<p>CSSREMIX.com for inspiration.</p>
<p>You have to spend either money or time to make a site great.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don’t BRAND yourself once and call it done – you refine, revamp and return to your brand with every post. Think, “if this were the day that The New York Times/Oprah Winfrey/my grandmother saw my blog, would it fulfill my mission statement?”</p>
<p><strong>Branding: Not Just For the Big Dogs</strong>, presented by <a href="http://katywidrick.com/">Katy Widrick</a> and <a href="http://www.jessruns.com/">Jess Milcetich</a>, covered these topics and left attendees with a to-do list of easy, yet effective changes you can make immediately to build your brand, increase your readership, make yourself more accessible to media and better connect with your community.</p>
<p><span id="more-1834"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://fitblogchats.com/presentations/#Branding"> Click here for a webinar and the slide of the presentation</a></p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>Collaborate, brand, improve and grow your blogging. We want to give you a list of action items for when you go home, how to implement them. This is auditing your own blog &#8211; looking for  the things you can do better and more efficient.</p>
<p>Video is played, a compilation of highlights from the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a> Survey:</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/00YCUVrnQMQ">http://youtu.be/00YCUVrnQMQ<br />
</a><br />
<strong>Katy: </strong>The survey had 62 questions about basic statistics, blogging history (how long have you blogged) and future desires for growing your blog. There were 394 responses. <a href="http://katywidrick.com/fitblogginpresentation/">Take a look at the PDF compiled with all of the results</a> (courtesy of SurveyMonkey) and see where you fit in&#8230; and where you can stand out. What makes YOU unique? How can you be a leader in your niche?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to cover: <strong>Stop, Collaborate, Quantitate and Listen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jess: STOP:</strong> What is your brand? You don&#8217;t have to brand yourself all at once. You don&#8217;t wake up and say you&#8217;re a healthy living blogger. You have to monitor it, revamp it, and continue with it regularly. What I like to do is think about if this: If Oprah Winfrey or the New York Times saw my blog today without warning, would they be able to tell who I am and what I&#8217;m about?</p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>Make yourself a mission statement: what is your blog all about? You can create a long and a short version. Why do you do what you do? Have a clear About page including mission statement and a current photo. This is where people need to know who you are and so they can remember you after one visit so they&#8217;ll come back.</p>
<p>Contact: make sure it&#8217;s easy for people to contact you. Care about your readers and give them an outlet to connect &#8211; don&#8217;t make them work to try to guess about how to contact you because they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Jess: </strong>Mission statement for Kristen of <a href="http://theconcreterunner.com/">The Concrete Runner</a>, social media makeover winner. It&#8217;s okay to have your mission statement more than once &#8211; on your home page and on your About page.</p>
<p><a href="http://ahealthyjd.com/">A Healthy JD Sample: Jamie</a>. She had incredibly inspirational, interesting content, but that wasn&#8217;t represented at all on the site.</p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>Use Categories- break your content into groups and let them know what they&#8217;re getting in the posts. List your categories so people can easily navigate through the topics you cover. Next, go one-step forward: different RSS feeds for different topics: Category-Specific RSS. You can usually burn seperate category feeds in <a href="http://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a>, or you can force it by going to a URL set up like: http://example.com/category/categoryname/feed. Everyone in the room should be using Feedburner to get analytics and information to see what people are clicking through in their feeds. Examples of categories could be: Workouts, Recipes, Photography, etc.</p>
<p>Consider a plugin or custom graphic to highlight those categories in your navigation.</p>
<p>Are there any tater tots fans in the room? When I started my blog, it was called SillyTaterTot.com. No one knew who I was or what my blog was about because of the name. Your name is your brand &#8211; make sure you like it and are happy with what it represents. If not, change it! I changed my site to katywidrick.com because I didn&#8217;t think Silly Tater Tot wasn&#8217;t representative of what I wanted my brand to be. Change is okay! If you don&#8217;t think what you have now will work, don&#8217;t be afraid to change.</p>
<p>Your name is your brand. Grab it across social networks, and grab domains of versions of your name because you are banking on your name to making you a superstar. <a href="http://www.namecheck.com/">NameCheck</a>, <a href="http://knowem.com">KnowEm</a>, <a href="http://namechk.com/">NameChk.</a></p>
<p>Do you own your own domain? Self host?  Don&#8217;t lose credibility by having wordpress.com or blogger.com in the URL. You want to present a strong brand image, and having your own domain is an easy way to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> Do you recognize these images? Princess Beatrice and the Old Spice Guy. What did they do right? How did they do it? They make you want to go back for more, and share them with your friends. They weren&#8217;t afraid to be laughed at, and people wanted to share their photos or stories with friends in order to go viral.</p>
<p>How many of you have a 1-page resume for a job? What about a 1 page blog resume? How about a media kit? You should have these available. They don&#8217;t have to be public, but you should have them available so you can distribute when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>Mine is private to ensure that I can make sure the data is up to date before the brand, media outlet, etc. gets it. Here is a resource from the <a href="http://www.mombloggersclub.com/page/media-kit-template-for-mom">Mom Bloggers Club</a> and one from <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/12759264/Media-Kit-Template">Deal Seeking Mom.</a></p>
<p>Remember your credentials, set goals and inspire confidence in readers, journalists and advertisers. Key points: years in business, testimonials (ask your fellow bloggers or readers), areas of expertise, statistics/ad rates, press coverage, contact information, screen grabs.</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> Stop, Collaborate, Quantitate and Listen. This is the Collaborate part. Reach out to others to do guest posts. When you pitch a blogger, tell them what you want to write about, outline what you&#8217;ll provide. Make it easy to understand what you&#8217;re asking for. You can also moderate a live chat (<a href="http://fitblogchats.com">#fitblog</a>) to help get your name known within a community and to gain followers.</p>
<p>You can also work with reporters. <a href="http://www.helpareporter.com/">HARO</a> (Help A Reporter Out): everyone should get on this email list &#8211; it&#8217;s free. Subscribe and you will receive emails 3 times a day- morning, afternoon and night. The email is a list of journalists and writers looking for people to connect with on a particular topic. You can also look at <a href="http://www.profnetconnect.com/">ProfNet Connect:</a> list yourself and put yourself up as a source PR people and journalists who are searching for certain keywords. Creating a profile for yourself is free.</p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>Another great way to collaborate is by having blogging buddies: Reach out to 5 or so bloggers that you read every day, and vice versa. The buddies help support and spread the word about your blog, and you do the same for them. You all can comment on each others blogs, help discussion, spread the word about new posts. Make sure your page is sticky before setting up your group! To help with organizing the communication between the buddies, you can use <a href="http://groups.google.com">Google Groups</a>, Facebook Groups and old-fashioned email chains.</p>
<p>The next step? <strong>Quantitate</strong>. You need to know what people are reading, how many are subscribing, and what they do when they get there. You can do this through built in WordPress or Blogger stats, Google Analytics, Feedburner and more.  You don&#8217;t have to use the data and do something DIFFERENT from what you are, but you can see patterns to make things BETTER. You can use the information from the analytics information to discover the best time to post, which content gets more comments, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Jess</strong>: Set up a regular blogging schedule also, so readers know when to expect your posts. Let readers get into a pattern and know what to expect, and keeps you in a flow. If you write on different topics, you can designate certain days for each topic. Use Google Calendar to lay out your blogging schedule. It can send you reminders and keep you organized. The schedule can be flexible, but having it roughly laid out is helpful for organization and for readers.</p>
<p>Next, you want to make sure you have clear calls to action: Make sure you know what YOU want your readers to do. Make calls to action very clear and visible. Use strong call to action words: follow me, subscribe, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Katy: </strong>The last step is <strong>Listen</strong>. There are so many ways to listen to what your readers are saying. Tracker, <a href="http://postrank.com">PostRank</a>, <a href="http://google.comanalytics">Google Analytics</a>. Respond to comments. Use a comment plugin that lets you respond by email: <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a>, <a href="http://commentluv.com">CommentLuv</a> and other WordPress plugins. Don&#8217;t make people work to leave a comment. Make sure it&#8217;s easy to leave a comment and doesn&#8217;t require a very specific login or lots of information to leave a comment. If it&#8217;s too hard, they won&#8217;t leave one.</p>
<p><strong>Jess</strong>: After all the steps of <strong>Stop, Collaborate, Quantitate and Listen,</strong> you must <strong>Manage</strong>: Publish your content in more than once place. Do you have your posts publish to Twitter, Facebook and other social networks? Did you know that the lifespan on Twitter is less than 1 hour. Visibility on Facebook, less than 1%. You can repost multiple days. <a href="http://tweetwhen.com">Tweetwhen.com</a>- when is the most efficient time to pubish your content, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot.com</a> has good tools as well under their <a href="http://grader.com/">Grader</a> tools</p>
<p>Do you have a Facebook Page for your blog? You need to do more than just re-post your blog posts. Make it interactive and make it more than what they would get by looking at your blog. Be more fun, be more &#8220;you.&#8221; Make it a richer experience than those just coming to the blog.</p>
<p><strong>Katy</strong>: When to publish your blog: The specific time of day you publish matters less than publishing on a consistent schedule. Pick mornings, afternoons, evenings and stick with it so your readers know when to expect your posts. In general, publishing early is good. People tend to read blogs in the morning before their day starts. Tuesday&#8217;s, Wednesday&#8217;s and Friday&#8217;s are typically the most popular days. Make sure to tweet your links multiple times to hit the different periods of the day.</p>
<p>Measure success. This is critical in learning if the things you&#8217;re doing have an effect on your readers actions. Examine your analytics: pageviews, visits. Measure any changes you&#8217;ve made and see if they&#8217;re worth the change or if you need to re-tool and try something else. Number of coments, Facebook Insights, feedburner stats and email subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Jess</strong>: It&#8217;s important to remember: you have a good blog&#8230; but you can always improve something! Don&#8217;t feel like you have to make changes all at once. It takes time for changes to start to make an impact, so make one or two so you aren&#8217;t overwhelmed, and monitor those changes to see how they impact your numbers. It will take time for these changes to show a difference.</p>
<p>Remember to take the bad with the good. Is any press bad press? Look at the Marie Claire and Focus Rally examples. For bad comments or press: react quickly, transparently and definitively. Provide all sides and provide a place for safe discussion. Keep it on your site if you can. Have a basic crisis management plan at the ready. Have something just in case it happens &#8211; know how you&#8217;re going to repond, even if it&#8217;s just in your head. It doesn&#8217;t have to be formal.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Session was formed partially in response to the Marie Clare article that bashed fitness bloggers as little more that woefully misguided obsessive compulsives.  Please not the author of that article had an eating disorder herself because it seemed she picked and choose information to fit an agenda she was on.  Even though that article was a hyperbole of an inaccurate situation it did help set the platform for the question regarding what responsibilities do bloggers have to their readers and themselves.</p>
<p>The panel was moderated by @LisaJohnson and attended by herself and @MizFitOnline and @CarrotsandCake who had intimate knowledge of the Marie Clare incident even though she is an expert on herself type of blogger.<span id="more-1984"></span></p>
<p>Some of us may have more influence over readers than their doctors as bloggers &#8211; our reach can be quite far-reaching or our influence over a single reader can be quite deep.</p>
<p>The range of information out there is all over the place from bloggers to trainers/professionals who have various education.  The state Lisa Johnson is from nutritionists don&#8217;t even need a certification to carry that title.</p>
<p>Panel is talking about who is more qualified to dispense advice &#8211; bloggers or pros. It varies from person to person as to who is more qualified. As bloggers we need to know our individual limits.</p>
<p>.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/MizFitOnline">@MizFitOnline</a> does not dispense specific fitness regimes because she is conserative because one workout is not for everyone.  She is asked about specific regimens quite often and does not go there.  She tries not to publish information on her site that anyone can follow specifically because that information may not be for them.  She has been gluten-free for 17 years but has only put it on her site recently because she recognizes that diet may not be for everyone as an example.</p>
<p>.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/LisaJohnson">@LisaJohnson</a> goes along the way of hippocratic oath to do no harm to anyone that seeks her advice, also conservative with information.</p>
<p>It is o.k. To say what you believe and why but be aware that people are reading and internalizing your words.</p>
<p>How are bloggers as individuals responsible for our niche?  We do have a responsibility to reach out to newbies if they want guidance or are mistepping.  We also have a right to be true to our stance as individuals.</p>
<p>Reactions to pills and fad diets out there brought out a comparison of a a popular trainer/media personality as one &#8220;who must not be named.&#8221;  The panel and audience were clearly not fans of a trainer using their influence to promote diet pills.</p>
<p>It is your integrity regarding what products you stand behind and publish &#8211; do you use it and support other consumers to use?  It is hard when there are really good offers out there to benefit you for endorsing a product.  With that said there are some controversial brands and products and if you use them then that is your experience.</p>
<p>What when we don&#8217;t have background to be expert on a topic? great question by @Krazy_Kris *BE EXPERT ON YOU</p>
<p>In uncharttered territory write, wait before publish, have others proof and edit, fact check, then publish. Work on it.</p>
<p>If you are only an expert in you (not credentialed) then don&#8217;t be afraid to say you don&#8217;t know or send em to an expert</p>
<p>Do you jump into discourse if a commenter is attacked on your blog? <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/LisaJohnson">@LisaJohnson</a> put up disclaimer to play nice or be deleted</p>
<p>Is this arrogant to assume readers will be influenced by a blogger this much? What about reader responsibility? **There seeemed to be an annoyed contigent in the audience thinking the subject was assuming readers were idiots if we have to be this cautious for them.  Great topic for future discourse.</p>
<p>We as bloggers have an opportunity to aggregate on larger social concerns and right to call each other out when appropriate says Lisa Johnson.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Lisa Johnson ended the session with five pieces of advice for any health and fitness blogger:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Be inspiring and help reader<br />
Truth<br />
Honor reader&#8217;s health<br />
Debunk myths<br />
Honor ourselves</strong></p>
<p>And above all this is OUR LABOR OF LOVE</p>
