			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42" title="Best Comedians of the ATL @ Laughing Skull Lounge" src="http://gabriellapants.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/best-comedians-of-the-atl-laughing-skull-lounge1.jpg?w=500&#038;h=647" alt="Best Comedians of the ATL @ Laughing Skull Lounge" width="500" height="647" />Last night, despite a cold with a RAGING fever, John and I ventured out to see The Best of Atlanta Comedy at The Laughing Skull Lounge. Thanks to some 50% off promo codes (Try &#8220;KSU&#8221; or &#8220;BOGO&#8221; at http://vortexcomedy.com ) we were able to get tickets at $7.50 a piece for general admission. The Laughing Skull Lounge is set in the back of the Midtown Vortex. With general admission seats that include a row of pews in the back and &#8220;VIP&#8221; tables in the front, it&#8217;s just right for comedic performances.</p>
<p>On our way in we not only found that in addition to the aforementioned promo codes, tickets are also 50% off if you eat at the Vortex before the show, but that we were getting WAY more than we bargained for. Another group of comedians who were set to perform at another venue that night had been added to the bill at the Laughing Skull. That meant that instead of 10 comedians we would see 17.</p>
<p>The concept is simple; 17 comedians with a 5 minute set each. So if  the set sucks, don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s almost over.</p>
<p>Overall we had an awesome time. At one point I was laughing so hard that my fever spiked and I had to go outside to get some air. It was a great time, made even greater by the camaraderie you can see among the comedians themselves.</p>
<p>The best part: There are still 2 shows left TONIGHT! The last of the performances for the weekend will be tonight, Sunday, at 7pm and 9pm! I highly recommend checking out the show. The comedy is great, the venue is cozy, and the drinks aren&#8217;t outrageously priced.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So apparently Woody Harrelson, who was recently filming Zombieland here in the Atlanta area, attacked a <span class="BlogPostWords">paparazzo and then claimed it was because he thought the guy was a zombie. For the full story you can visit <a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/popvox/archive/2009/04/13/harrelson-to-tmz-no-biggie-i-just-thought-you-were-a-zombie.aspx">Newsweek</a> or <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/10/woody.harrelson.zombie/index.html">CNN&#8217;s</a> account of what happened.<br />
</span><br />
*PALM TO FACE*</p>
<p>First of all, I was on the set of Zombieland, the zombies are not that realistic. Secondly, IN NO WAY is this an acceptable excuse for attacking someone. Neither is being incredibly stoned, which Harrelson no doubt was. I&#8217;m sure this has nothing to do with the fact that Harrelson has reported anger management issues.</p>
<p>Look, I am the first one to say that if I for one second thought someone was really a zombie, I would beat the crap out of them. I know the zombie apocolypse is coming, I KNOW IT. But for the record, a guy who is putting a camera in your face, pretty obviously NOT a zombie. Come on Woody, smoke some pot, eat some organic food, and chill out. On second thought, smoke a little less pot, maybe then you won&#8217;t say stupid crap like this to the media.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Let&#8217;s Talk About Jane,</p>
<p>I know, I broke up with you. I know we had our differences. You wanted me to write aimlessly and just spill my thoughts, I wanted to have a purpose to my writing. We split up, this I know.</p>
<p>Look, Jane, can I call you Jane?</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>PERFECT.</p>
<p>I know I broke your heart. I got you all excited and spent so much time cultivating our relationship, and then I just left. I left you half finished, half cultivated, half dressed, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m horrible, I know.</p>
<p>I never should have left like that. I just got distracted by a job I hated, the stress of life, and my constant need to second guess my own ability.</p>
<p>But look, Jane, my dear Jane, I find myself with so much extra time on my hands, so much opportunity to turn this thing we have into something great.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t you please take me back Jane? I promise I will stick around this time. Even if life throws YET ANOTHER curve ball at me, I&#8217;ll stay in the game for good.</p>
<p>So please put aside your bitterness, your hatred, nay, your broken heart, and let me come home. Please Jane, please.</p>
<p>The words we created together need a family, a home. Let this be their home, better yet, our home.</p>
<p>I love you Jane. I really do.</p>
<p> In the words of the venerable Al Green, &#8220;Let&#8217;s stay together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Love,<br />Gabi a.k.a. Pants a.k.a. http://twitter.com/pantsoff</p>
<p>P.S. Are you following me on Twitter? You should.</p>

Not being an avid bike person myself, I was reluctant to check it out, but after 1 visit I wanted to buy a frame and start building a bike. I even borrowed a bike from John and RODE a bike. Those of you who don&#8217;t know me wouldn&#8217;t know the signifigance of this, but it&#8217;s HUGE. I have been pretty hesitant to bike since the last crash when I was younger. SOPO brought back that itch to get on a bike and ride anywhere.</p>
<p>Sopo Bikes is a great thing in Atlanta, so everyone should come out this Saturday to The Graveyard to see the premiere of their newest venture. It&#8217;s TV show called This Bike Could Be Your Life. The illustrations I&#8217;ve seen look incredible. Live Bands, contests, and dancing will ensue after the premiere.</p>
<p>John and I have a b-day party to go to but we will be heading over as soon as we can after that.</p>
<p>Support and Donate. Or I will get you. <img src='http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">OK</span> kids, I&#8217;m done. I&#8217;m too old and too over this to watch you anymore.</p>
<p> I have been babysitting a long time, and have taken on a lot of trying children that through basic techniques have improved by my being there. Not anything drastic and life altering, but <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">significantly</span> enough for parents to have mentioned it to me. I&#8217;ve had many parents <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">recommend</span> me to other families as someone who won&#8217;t just watch your kids, but become a positive influence in their lives. I have loved children and working with them for a long time, and find a great satisfaction and joy from it, until now.</p>
<p>The children I most recently took on are spoiled and manipulative. Their parents are rich, affluent, and mannered. Their kids are two of the brattiest kids I have ever watched. They scream and cry for no reason, no, correction, because they want their way and think I will give in if they cry. GUESS WHAT? I didn&#8217;t fall off the turnip truck yesterday! I know your games, hell, I perfected your games as a kid, but at least I was a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">lovable</span> brat, who knew when it was time to give up. They never say anything to me when I arrive, barely talk to me except to tell me what to do, or ask me the EXACT same <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">inane</span> questions over and over, never satisfied with the response. They treat me like a slave to whatever they want, with no real worth (at 3 and 4 mind you!) or value to them otherwise. They argue and try to lie to me and manipulate me at every turn. It&#8217;s beyond disgusting at this point.</p>
<p>Look, I get it, kids are kids. This goes way beyond the allowable amount of &#8220;kid&#8221; behavior. I know their deal, and it&#8217;s not their fault, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to fix them. Their mother is bossed around and controlled by her husband, who is fairly absent in an emotional sense. All I ever hear him do is bark orders at the kids, or his wife to &#8220;handle&#8221; them. It&#8217;s obvious these girls (yes, 2 girls) are craving some sort of disciplinary stability. They are shoved all of these &#8220;things&#8221; to do rather than just letting me interact with the girls and find my own way. I have never once had to make any kind of decision about anything there. Their parents regulate it all. Their mother gives in to the girls at the slightest bit of resistance, e.g. &#8220;*Susy*, no more juice before bed! I mean it!&#8221; &#8220;But mom I&#8217;m thirsty, I want juice!&#8221; &#8220;Oh <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">OK</span>, just one more glass.&#8221; Over and over and over again, about everything.</p>
<p>I try not to judge people, I try not to make assumptions, but after being around them for several months, I just don&#8217;t see it any other way. I tried in the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">beginning</span> to be understanding, and make allowances, but this is ridiculous. This isn&#8217;t terrible two&#8217;s or three&#8217;s. This isn&#8217;t a fight for i<span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">ndependence</span>. This is absent parenting at its finest. I hope they figure this out before these girls get much older, otherwise they are in for a rough ride for the next 15 years. I pity the girls in a sense, but they are such brats, it can make it really hard. I do try though.</p>
<p>So finally, after many nights of coming home exhausted and beaten down by a worthless fight to help these poor girls, I gave up. I told their parents I couldn&#8217;t watch them anymore, and that&#8217;s that. I have never left a babysitting job before, and I hate to do it, but sometimes you have to watch out for your own well-being.</p>
<p>I hope no one is offended by my outspokenness. I really do try to be as non-judgemental as possible about child rearing, as I do not have children of my own. I do however know some AMAZING parents, in all walks of life, with children of all ages, faced with way more trying circumstances than here. I think everyone will relate to the story here, and the underlying issues it brings up.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello All!</p>
<p>First off, sorry the blog has been lacking since I started, but that is about to change.</p>
<p>I just started Guest Blogging on <a href="http://weddiquetteblog.com/?p=155">Weddiquette Blog </a>. It will be a monthly thing until John and I get hitched! Check out the first post<a href="http://weddiquetteblog.com/?p=155"> here</a> . So check that out whenever you can!</p>
<p>Also, without giving too much  away, be on the lookout for a BRAND SPANKIN NEW blog in the coming months. It&#8217;s sorta-kinda a secret, but let&#8217;s just say, if you&#8217;ve read my info on Twitter, there&#8217;s a hint in there. I&#8217;m really excited to get started on this one and am hoping it can be a permanent fixture for me!</p>
<p>Other than that there&#8217;s not much to report. We got a new apartment in Midtown, and an awsome cat named Samson, but more on that later! That&#8217;s all for now. Keep your eyes open for new developments soon!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s been a while, I&#8217;ve been lazy.</p>
<p>Here are the most recent updates in the life:</p>
<p>-Got in a pretty awful wreck, nearly totalled my car. Ended up with 9 staples in my head and a lot of sleep, pain, and subsequently, pain killers.</p>
<p>-Car NOT totalled, Dad helped with that. Got a VW Beetle as a rental paid for by my insurance company! It really does pay to spend the money on good insurance.</p>
<p>-John and I hit the 1 year mark May 5th! It seems like yesterday I was drunk, and sick, and driven home in my own car, ahhh&#8230;memories&#8230; We are going camping in the Blue Ridge near Carter&#8217;s Lake for the weekend to celebrate. So excited!</p>
<p>-Most likely taking a 1 day road trip to Chicago to see The Smoking Popes play their new album release show! Way excited about that too.</p>
<p>-Exploring where I want to go next in my life, job, etc. Book critic, author, artist? Too many decisions!</p>
<p>- John and I are searching for a new place to move in July. Somewhere relatively near where we are now, but not too expensive. We&#8217;ll see how that goes!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s about all the highlights for now! If you are in the Atlanta area this Saturday night you are ORDERED to come out to Lenny&#8217;s to see the best local band you could ever imagine 5-8 play! They have been around for nearly 20+ years and they will melt your face!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message to 6 people, a message I can&#8217;t say:</p>
<p>1) I have always wanted to be accepted by you. I have always wanted you to be my friend. It&#8217;s hard to know someone so well, and yet feel so distant from them. I wish we had made an effort before now. I love you, you are one of my favorite people of all time. I miss you, and to some extent I really do need you in my life.</p>
<p>2)You are amazing, I admire you so much. Since the day you were born there was always something different and extraordinary about you. I have always been grateful for our friendship, and I don&#8217;t want to lose that. I want to offer what you need from me. Sometimes this role is harder than it seems. Just don&#8217;t stop loving me the way we have always loved eachother. You&#8217;re on my list of favorite people and always will be.</p>
<p>3)There are so many things I want to say to you. In so many ways I owe you everything, but its time I made myself happy. I&#8217;m sorry things didn&#8217;t work out the way you wanted for yourself in your life, but doesn&#8217;t that show you? Shouldn&#8217;t I be allowed to make my own decisions now. I value your opinion and your acceptance more than you will ever know, but when the fundamentals of our beliefs differ, it can be hard to look to you without receiving partial advice. You have always been there for me, even recently. Maybe I don&#8217;t take responsibility for what I have to overcome enough, but maybe you don&#8217;t either? I need unconditional love, not judgement. I need you to accept me now for who I am and stop hoping for something different. You held us all together over the years. Hold yourself together now. I love you and I see the unhappiness in your face. When does that become your responsibility? I wish something I could do would fill that void, but it won&#8217;t, I learned that long ago.</p>
<p>4) You have always been there to take care of us, you have always come through when it came down to the wire. You work too hard, and sleep too little. I want to make things better for you. One day I will. I wish you were more present in everything. I wish you didn&#8217;t lose your voice like I do sometimes. It can be hard to speak what you need to, I know, but you can only really  be happy when you are able to express what is at the heart of it all. Don&#8217;t bottle it all up. I know too well how you feel. We are so alike in so many ways, and as I grow up, I see in you things that I know I have to change before I end up stuck. Don&#8217;t stay stuck. You have plenty of time to make things better for yourself. Don&#8217;t waste it. I love you.</p>
<p>5) It feels like a lifetime I have known you. I still can&#8217;t believe that a forced friendship such as ours has become this. You are the sister I always wanted, and the pain in my ass I never knew I could miss. I wish things had been different sometimes, but only because maybe then it would have been easier for you the last year. I know you are confused, and I know it&#8217;s hard to figure out what you really want from life. I know because I&#8217;ve been there, and I never wanted that for you. I&#8217;m glad you are growing up and making your own decisions. Just be careful you don&#8217;t make a decision that changes your whole life permanently until you know what you want. I miss you a lot actually. I got used to what we had. I guess we both thought things would be different when we were both here, but that&#8217;s the surprising thing about life, you never know. Just don&#8217;t forget me, I&#8217;m always here if you need me. I love you, you crazy ass bitch.</p>
<p>6)You are everything I needed and everything I searched for for so long. I never knew I would meet someone at 20 that changed my world so much. The past year has been so amazing. You have helped me grow and learn so much. You accepted who I was and loved that when it felt like no one else did. You never hesitate to be honest with me. Your passion for what you love, and your ability to be so driven is something I truly admire. You have pushed me to realize my dreams. You have always believed in me when I didn&#8217;t, and always supported me. You have become my best friend, and I could never invent someone better. Since we met I have been in awe of how I could have managed to get such a gorgeous, smart, wonderfully funny man to fall in love with me. I love being able to be a part of your life. You make every minute meaningful and fun.   I have never laughed or had so much fun with someone in my whole life. I love you more than I am able to express, and I want to make you happier than you could ever be. Baby-love, we will have a wonderful life together.</p>
