&lt;h4&gt;Zim's Bar and Grill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;814 S 2nd St., Milwaukee WI 53204 (&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=814+S+2nd+St.+WI+53204&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x880519be49a9f4bf:0x8a43048952c48c7e,814+S+2nd+St,+Milwaukee,+WI+53204&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=CfN7TqqwH-PpsQLRo93HAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;); 414-383-3211; &lt;a href="http://zimsbar.com/"&gt;zimsbar.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cooking Method: &lt;/strong&gt;Grilled&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Short Order:&lt;/strong&gt; Grilled burgers are hand-pattied and well seasoned, but temperature and topping issues spoil some burgers&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want Fries With That?&lt;/strong&gt; Fries are frozen but skin-on and well cooked, but the parmesan doesn't add much. Don't bother with the limp, lifeless onion rings&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Milwaukee burger, $8.95; Chef Jovan burger, $9.95; Caribbean burger, $8.95; Ooey gooey sticks, $7.95&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://zimsbar.com/"&gt;Zim's Bar and Grill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; recently relocated from Milwaukee Street to a more low-key location in Walker's Point. The closing of the original location on Super Bowl Sunday was a surprise to everyone, as it appeared to be doing a good amount of business. I'm sure a lot of people are happy to see Zim's reopened, but it's now got a different vibe: more casual and true to their sports bar foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The menu is smaller, with an emphasis on appetizers and burgers. In fact, the only other section of the menu is salads, and there's only two of those to choose from. The kitchen opened in August, and with experience and a focused menu on their side, I was hoping for some really good burgers. In reality, they weren't anything special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three burgers I tried were to overcooked to varying degrees. They were all ordered medium, and all were well done, with one or two having a stray spot of pink somewhere. All three had charring from the grill that ranged from nicely formed grill marks to slightly burnt around the edges. Consistency is definitely an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20110926-171898-zims-milwaukee-burger-half.jpg" src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110926-171898-zims-milwaukee-burger-half.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's too bad, too, because the burgers are hand pattied, and you can tell. They've got that backyard burger irregularity (though perhaps a bit too irregular in one instance) that usually makes for a very tender burger. Unfortunately, being overcooked, they weren't that tender, but at least they weren't anywhere near a hockey puck. The beef's flavor was quite good, with a fair amount of smoke from the grill and just enough seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best burger of the bunch was the &lt;strong&gt;Milwaukee burger,&lt;/strong&gt; essentially a mushroom Swiss burger with fried onions and bacon added. It had the juiciest six-ounce patty of the three burgers and the best toppings. The mushrooms were fresh and buttery, though they were chopped a little too finely to notice them if you weren't looking. They got a little lost with the dark caramelized onions. The bacon, though gnarly on every burger, had a great substantial crunch. Overall, the smokey grilled patty complimented the rich, deep flavors of the mushrooms and bacon, making for a respectable burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20110926-171898-zims-jovan-burger.jpg" src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110926-171898-zims-jovan-burger.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An "award winning burger" according to the menu, the &lt;strong&gt;Chef Jovan burger&lt;/strong&gt; came in second. Because of the thickness and irregularity of the patty, the toppings on this burger were a mess. The fried egg was slightly overcooked; a runny yolk would have helped save the overcooked beef. The pepperjack, while generous and having a bit of a kick, had a weird plastic texture, almost like a processed cheese. The menu states it's topped with "corned beef slaw," which apparently just means a few small cubes of corned beef in a too-sharp vinegar-based cabbage slaw. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20110926-171898-zims-jovan-burger-half.jpg" src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110926-171898-zims-jovan-burger-half.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final burger, a &lt;strong&gt;Caribbean burger,&lt;/strong&gt; was topped with Jamaican relish and grilled pineapple. The relish ended up being some soggy onions and peppers suspended in a thick, gooey, cold sauce, and was really unpleasant with its corn syrup-like consistency. The grilled pineapple was fresh and not canned, but it was unripe and not grilled long enough to bring out the sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20110926-171898-zims-caribbean-burger.jpg" src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110926-171898-zims-caribbean-burger.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the burgers came on an &lt;strong&gt;onion and poppyseed bun&lt;/strong&gt; that was lightly grilled and pretty good, though a little dry. On the side was a piece of leaf lettuce and some quartered cherry tomatoes in a light dressing with some herbs. A nice touch, but eating cherry tomatoes on a burger is a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fries were just ok, even with their parmesan topping. They started off frozen, and you really didn't get many with your burger. I subbed onion rings for fries on one burger and had high hopes because they're homemade. &lt;strong&gt;I should have stuck with the mediocre fries, as the rings were soggy, greasy, and the coating flaked off if you looked at them wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appetizer called Ooey Gooey Sticks was also not bad, but nothing to go out of your way for. They were a blend of four cheeses and bacon in a wonton skin with marinara. Think homemade cheesesticks with bacon. But the barely half-piece of bacon in each didn't lend much flavor and there were plenty of cheese-less pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20110926-171898-zims-interior.jpg" src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110926-171898-zims-interior.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have faith that Zim's will flourish at this new location&amp;mdash;at least for a while. What remains to be seen is if their product and consistency improves over time. They've got the bar stuff down: tons of local beers on tap, a dozen well-positioned TVs, and even live team trivia. That will bring people in, but I don't know if people will return based on the food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week's Food Lab is all about brevity. Not only will I show you how to make mayonnaise at home in two minutes or less, but I'll also explain the entire process in precisely 1,110 words, (making this the briefest Food Lab post ever in its entire long-winded history), and perhaps convince you to buy a hand blender if you don't already have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing here that has not been done before by other people. But it explains one of the most &lt;em&gt;oh-my-god-I-can't-believe-I-just-saw-that-happen&lt;/em&gt; moments I've had in my life, and I'm sharing it in the hopes that it might give at least a few of you a very similar reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the time I saw mayonnaise being made on a late-night full-length informercial for a hand blender (which at the time&amp;mdash;this was the mid-80's&amp;mdash;were remarkably new), I'd always assumed it came from... Heck, I had no idea. Perhaps a big siphon somewhere out in the midwest. The thought that it's made with egg yolks and oil certainly never crossed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've only ever known mayonnaise in the form of the quivering jellyish stuff that comes in the jars with the blue lid, you're doing yourself a disservice. Like switching from briefs to boxers or walking to Mordor, trying homemade mayonnaise is the kind of thing that will forever change your life (or at the very least, your sandwiches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;What Is Mayonnaise?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil and water&amp;mdash;two liquids that generally don't get along. Look at it under a microscope, and you'd see it's made up of teeny tiny fat droplets coated in a thin film of emulsifying agents (mainly in the form of lecithin, a protein found in egg yolks), separated by water. Emulsifiers have the unique property that one end of them is attracted to fats, while the other is attracted to water. By burying their fat-loving heads into the minuscule droplets of oil, their water-loving tails are exposed, allowing both the fat and the water to coexist peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you are attempting to combine two ingredients that really don't want to be combined, Mayonnaise is notoriously difficult to make. Classic technique will have you start by whisking egg yolks, a bit of mustard (for flavor and its emulsifying properties), a few drops of water, and some acid (either lemon juice or vinegar), then slowly slowly slowly trickling in a thin stream of oil as you continue to beat rapidly. The idea is to get the oil to disperse itself into tiny droplets as you whisk it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20111002-mayonnaise-food-lab-1.jpg" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2011/10/20111002-mayonnaise-food-lab-1.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-none" style="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour the oil too fast, and you end up not with a smooth, rich, creamy sauce, but with a broken, greasy, curdled-looking mess. About half the time I try and make mayonnaise with this method, it breaks and I'm forced to start the process over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of techniques for making this process a bit more foolproof, with the blender or the food processor being the usual go-to's&amp;mdash;their high-speed whirring blades make short work of dispersing oil droplets. The problem with either of these appliances, however, is that you need to make a fairly large volume of mayo for them to work&amp;mdash;start with a single egg yolk, for example, and there's not enough volume in there to spin around properly. The egg flies up and splats against the walls, leaving you nothing to work with at the bottom of the jar/bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also still require you to drizzle in your oil ever-so-slowly. Blender/food processor gets me up to about 85% success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy solution? &lt;strong&gt;Use a hand blender&lt;/strong&gt;. With a hand blender you can add all of your ingredients&amp;mdash;oil included&amp;mdash;directly to the blending cup. Because it is less dense than the other ingredients, the oil will float at the top. When you subsequently stick the blades of the hand blender down into the cup, they'll be in direct contact with the egg yolk, water, acid, and mustard. Turn that blender on, and it creates a vortex, gradually pulling the oil down into the whirling blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="369" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GbPF_rLpd9o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it? It is essentially sucking down oil in a thin, steady stream, saving you from having to do it yourself. In no time flat, you end up with a cup full of creamy, perfectly emulsified, real-deal, better-than-anything-you-can-buy mayonnaise, and you've pushed yourself up to a 100% success rate (with the option of making small batches, to boot!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the best part of all this is that you get to flavor it however you'd like. Most often for me that means garlic (I microplane one clove into the mix per egg yolk I use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Pro-tip: Be Careful With Your Extra Virgin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible to make a truly tasty mayonnaise by using high quality extra-virgin olive oil, but there's a problem: Blenders, food processors, and hand blenders are too powerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, extra-virgin olive oil droplets are composed of many tiny fragments, many of which are bound tightly together, preventing our taste buds from picking them up. Whip the olive oil with enough vigor, by say, using a food processor or blender, and you end up shearing those bitter-tasting fragments apart from each other. The result is a mayonnaise with a markedly bitter taste. Not only that, but these tiny fragments actually decrease the efficacy of emulsifiers like mustard or lecithin, making your sauce more likely to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what if you want to have an ultra-stable mayonnaise that's still strongly flavored with extra-virgin olive oil but has no bitterness? The key is to use a neutral-flavored oil like canola or vegetable to start your mayonnaise. Once it's stable, transfer it to a bowl and whisk in some extra-virgin olive oil by hand. You'll still get plenty of flavor, but none of the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, my friends, is how great sandwiches start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dishes in &lt;a href="http://www.elbulli.com/home.php?lang=en"&gt;Ferran Adrià&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Meal-Cooking-Ferran-Adria/dp/0714862533/?tag=serieats-20"&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are designed to be inexpensive, easy to prepare, and enjoyable, but that doesn't mean a bunch of hot dog recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;Catalan-Style Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; legs come from a three-course menu that's both cheap and simple to prepare, whether you're cooking for two or the entire staff of a Michelin-starred restaurant. It's a simple braise made from meaty turkey legs seared and slow cooked with onions, tomatoes, sherry soaked raisins and prunes, and finished with a frugal scattering of pine nuts. It's the sort of dish that requires a bare amount of effort, one that can be put together and left to simmer while the staff (or you at home) continues other prep.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like chicken thighs, turkey legs are an economical cut that's often overlooked.  By braising instead of roasting, these legs emerge juicy and nearly falling off the bone with sweetness and warmth from the sherry, raisins and prunes.  Served up with something starchy like a Saffron Risotto with Mushrooms (recipe to come later this week) and you've got a lovely fall family meal to share either with your restaurant family or your real one at home. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;serves 6, active time 20 minutes, total time 1 hour 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
            
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt; Scant 2/3 cup raisins&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup prunes, pitted&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1 cup dry sherry or &lt;em&gt;vino rancio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;3 red onions, thinly sliced&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;6 turkey drumsticks&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1 cup chopped tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;3 cups water&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons pinenuts&lt;/li&gt;
            
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
            
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put the raisins and prunes in a bowl and pour in the sherry or &lt;em&gt;vino rancio&lt;/em&gt;.  Let soak for 12 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinly slice the onions.   Season the turkey with salt and pepper.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a wide pan over medium heat, then add almost all of the oil.  Brown the turkey for 10 minutes, until golden all over.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the onions.  Try the onions and turkey for about 10 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are caramelized and dark golden brown.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drain off the sherry or &lt;em&gt;vino rancio&lt;/strong&gt; from the fruit, then add it to the pan.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most of the &lt;em&gt;vino rancio&lt;/em&gt; has evaporated, add the chopped tomatoes and continue to cook until everything is well caramelized.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour in the water, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the raisins and prunes.  Cover the pan and let cook for another hour, or until the turkey is very tender and the sauce is thick and tasty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan, then add the pine nuts. Cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often until golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put the turkey onto a serving dish, cover with the sauce, raisins, and plums.  Finish with a sprinkling of pine nuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/ol&gt;

Reservations were made years out for a dinner at the famed restaurant in Roses, Spain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while much has been written about dining at elbulli, the public knows relatively little about what went on behind the scenes.  For instance, has anyone ever stopped and thought about what &lt;strong&gt;Ferran Adrià&lt;/strong&gt;'s 75 employees sat down and ate before the restaurant opened for service each night?  It might be fun to imagine the staff chowing down on Olive Spheres and Hot Cold Gin Fizzes, but in reality things were a little tamer and a lot more practical for the home cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Meal-Cooking-Ferran-Adria/dp/0714862533/?tag=serieats-20"&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is Adrià's latest cookbook, and it's quite a departure from his previous titles.  The title conjures up warm images of families convening around the dinner table, but that's not quite what this cookbook is about.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book about what the most famous chef in the world and his staff ate for dinner.  Those who have worked in restaurants will immediately recognize 'family meal' as something a little different.  Family or staff meal is the pre-service dinner that all members of staff sit down to together and enjoy just before the restaurant's doors open for dinner, and even at a place like elbulli.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bill of fare is simpler and more comforting that you might expect, with nary a foam (well, OK, maybe one foam) or pair of tweezers in sight.  The menus in &lt;em&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/em&gt; served to nourish and satisfy the staff of elbulli, and in turn the cookbook is meant to do the same for its readers' families, whether they are related by blood or by restaurant kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other books about elbulli, &lt;em&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/em&gt; is written as an approachable reference for home cooks, made up of beautifully photographed three-course menus served at the restaurant, pantry stocking and technique tips, and ideas for incorporating Adrià's methods for brining the efficiency, organization, and preparedness found in restaurant kitchens into the home. Each recipe is set up with step by step process photos ensuring that the cook will be able to follow along visually.  As an added bonus each menu can be prepared for 2, 6, 20 or 75 people and is prefaced with a complete shopping list and timetable outlining prep time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we're going to be cooking our way though a few of the menus in &lt;em&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/strong&gt;, from Spanish classics like &lt;strong&gt;Saffron Risotto with Mushrooms&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Catalan-Style Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; to international crowd pleasers including &lt;strong&gt;Cheeseburgers&lt;/strong&gt; (can you believe that they had cheeseburgers before service at elbulli?!?) and Adrià's take on simple &lt;strong&gt;Roasted Chicken&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Win 'The Family Meal'&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the generous folks over at &lt;a href="http://www.phaidon.com/"&gt;Phaidon&lt;/a&gt;, we are giving away five (5) copies of &lt;em&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/em&gt; this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is &lt;strong&gt;tell us about the sort of meals that you imagine chefs and restaurant employees eating before service&lt;/strong&gt; in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pumpkin madness that autumn brings lasts just a few short months, but there's still plenty of time to make and enjoy a delicious homebrewed Pumpkin Ale. Brewers have been using pumpkin in beer for a &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/09/pumpkin-beers-colonial-necessity-to-seasonal-treat-beer-history-brewing.html"&gt;long time&lt;/a&gt;, and the list of commercial versions gets &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/09/serious-beer-10-new-pumpkin-beers-reviews-best-pumpkin-beer.html"&gt;longer every year&lt;/a&gt;. But with no clear defined style, and limitless spicing choices, pumpkin ale is a fun opportunity for beginning and experienced brewers alike to flex their creative recipe skills. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;The Beer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no defined base style for a pumpkin beer. You can start with an amber, pale, wheat, porter, stout or any other style, and simply add pumpkin and spices. Really, it's that easy. The only essential rule of thumb is to &lt;strong&gt;start with a recipe that isn't very hoppy&lt;/strong&gt;, and limit the amount of flavor and aroma hops. Hop additions for all my pumpkin ales typically consist of a single 1/2 to 1 ounce addition at 60 minutes, and nothing more. This keeps the hop flavors and aromas from getting muddled and confused with the pumpkin pie spices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base recipe I used this year is probably the most common: a simple amber ale. It was an extract batch, so I used light dry malt extract, a pound of crystal 20L, and a pinch of chocolate malt. Nothing fancy, and it allows the squash and spice to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Pumpkin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a pumpkin for beer is the same as selecting a good pumpkin for making a pie. Ignore the large, carving pumpkins and select a smaller variety that is specified for pie making. Or, if you're like me, skip the pumpkin selection altogether and pick up a can of your favorite 100% natural canned pumpkin. &lt;strong&gt;Be sure to use a canned pumpkin that is completely free of preservatives, otherwise it may cause issues with fermentation later down the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.verybestbaking.com/Libbys/Products/PurePumpkin29oz.aspx"&gt;Libby's pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;works fine, as does the organic &lt;a href="http://www.farmersmarketfoods.com/"&gt;Farmer's Market&lt;/a&gt; brand that's sold at Whole Foods. How much pumpkin should you use? It's up to you. O&lt;strong&gt;ne pound of pumpkin for 5 gallons of beer is the bare minimum&lt;/strong&gt; needed to impart character, while some flavor-heavy beers can have 5 pounds for a 5 gallon batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods for adding pumpkin to beer vary widely, and professional brewers and homebrewers will offer all sorts of different advice, ranging from adding the pumpkin to the boil or the mash or even tossing it into the carboy after fermentation is complete. Many people even swear that the best pumpkin beer is made without any pumpkin at all, and advise only using pielike spices. While there may be some good pumpkin-free brews out there, to me it seems like a creative cop out. Instead, I see the lack of consensus as an opportunity for homebrewers  to experiment with different techniques to maximize the potential of the pumpkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that most brewers agree on is that &lt;strong&gt;the flavors come out the best if the pumpkin is cooked and caramelized&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you're chopping and mashing the pumpkin yourself, or you get it out of the can, it should be spread in a thin pan and baked for at least 60 minutes at 350&amp;deg;F. This will allow the sugars to start to cook, and give the beer the pumpkiny character that we're aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Spices&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Spices can make or break this style. You have to add some spice to get the flavor that people will be looking for, but it is&lt;strong&gt; way too easy to go over the top and make the beer undrinkable.&lt;/strong&gt; I've always used the quick way and gone with &lt;a href="http://www.mccormick.com/Products/Herbs-and-Spices/Spices-A-to-Z/Pumpkin-Pie-Spice.aspx"&gt;McCormick's Pumpkin Pie Spice&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be the most original, but it gives the flavor that everyone is familiar with. I add one teaspoon in the last five minutes of the boil of a five gallon batch to give a noticeable, but not overpowering flavor. It's a good idea to start with a small amount of spice and add more later if needed. If it comes time to bottle and you don't think there's enough flavor (which almost never happens), you can easily add more spices to the bottling bucket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recipes may call for a more creative blend of spices. Nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and ginger are the common additions. This year, I even added 14 ounces of &lt;strong&gt;dark maple syrup&lt;/strong&gt; to my recipe, which gave a fantastic rich flavor to balance the pumpkin pie spice. If you have a favorite blend of spices that you like to add to pumpkin pie, you can't really go wrong putting it in your beer. Just stick to no more than 1 teaspoon of dry spice for 5 gallons of beer until you have the chance to taste and make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author's Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Leading into this week's recipes from &lt;strong&gt;Ferran Adrià&lt;/strong&gt;'s newly released &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Meal-Cooking-Ferran-Adria/dp/0714862533/?tag=serieats-20"&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we are thrilled to have had the rare opportunity to sit down and chat about life after &lt;a href="http://www.elbulli.com/home.php?lang=en"&gt;elbulli&lt;/a&gt; with Ferran.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20111003-ferran-adria.jpg" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2011/10/20111003-ferran-adria.jpg" width="250" height="375" class="photo-right" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has your life changed after the closing of elBulli?&lt;/strong&gt; It hasn't changed at all. We've been doing pretty much the same thing we've been doing for the past few years.  The difference is instead of thinking about new dishes, we are preparing a new project, the &lt;a href="http://www.bullifoundation.org/"&gt;elBulli Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for 2014, and we've had a lot of work to catch up on. Different sorts of projects from the last few months, documentaries, books, and a &lt;a href="http://www.elbullimovie.com/"&gt;feature film&lt;/a&gt;.  More of less it's the same as before.  I hope that June next year I'll have a bit more free time to concentrate on the future of the foundation and setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your idea of comfort food and what do you cook for yourself at home?&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on the moment. I don't believe that there are categorical questions and answers.  For instance, right now I need a cup of coffee.  And as far as what I cook at home, I don't.  I'm a professional chef so I cook at the restaurant.  But on the other hand, what we cook at the restaurant for family meal, that can be shared at home and cooked at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about so many chefs adopting your techniques?&lt;/strong&gt; It's the normal thing to do.  I also use techniques developed by other chefs.  For example, I didn't invent consomme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel that some restaurants and chefs are focusing too much on presentation and experience rather than flavor and enjoyment of the food?&lt;/strong&gt; Flavor is a subjective issue.  What you consider to be good and flavorful might not be the same for another person.  If you're a good chef than your aim is to try and create a really great experience with really good food. &lt;span class="pullquote"&gt;I believe that everything I do is really good, although there are a lot of people who don't like it.&lt;/span&gt; Otherwise I wouldn't be doing what I do.  This is one of those myths out there, you know, that modern, contemporary chefs are not concerned with flavor, and sometimes not even the traditional chefs are concerned with flavor.  Do you think all pizzas are really good?  It's a question of sensitivity, independently from the type of cuisine you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain the concept of family meal for our readers who haven't worked at restaurants?&lt;/strong&gt; As most people can imagine, we must have a meal everyday in the restaurant, and we don't have that much time or the budget.  A lot of places do the best they can, as quickly as they can, but it's not a good thing because if you don't look after your own staff meals how can you expect them to look after their diners?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few years we decided to make a conscious decision to improve the meals and to look after them in the same way we look after the meals of our diners.  Though that three years process we found the most appropriate kinds of recipes that everybody would enjoy, that would fit in the budget, that could be done relatively quickly so that everyone could enjoy their staff meal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, though that process we created our production cards and recipes and realized, "Hey, we have some great material, why not share this with other people?"  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book focuses on organization, efficiency and preparation which are concepts that don't come into play as much in the home kitchen as they do in restaurants.  How do you think those ideas can translate into home cooking?&lt;/strong&gt; That's precisely one of the issues. People have to learn to get organized in the kitchen. They will save a lot of time and be able to make proper, nice meals.  But they have to get organized and slowly practice by using some of the steps I suggest in the cookbook, like freezing stock and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the typical conversations that took place during the family meals at elbulli?&lt;/strong&gt; We don't talk.  We spend 14 hours a day together so it's actually the opposite, it's a quiet moment. At home it's different because you don't see each other throughout the day, so it's you moment to get together and talk.  Although the younger stagiers, as soon as they finish their meal, often rush outside, have a cigarette and a quick chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of menus in &lt;em&gt;The Family Meal&lt;/em&gt; have an international lean.  Who created the menus for family meals?&lt;/strong&gt; Most of these recipes are known by a lot of people.  Together with some of the international stagiers that worked at elbulli, some of them suggested recipes and helped in making them more effective.  For example, figuring out how to make guacamole for 75 people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite family meals?&lt;/strong&gt; There aren't necessarily any favorites, that's why I created so many menus.  If there were favorites I would have only included four.  Two or three of the menus are really good, really quick, and really simple to make, but that doesn't mean they are the best.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's something very civilized about sitting down to a meal with three courses before a service.  Why do you think a multi-course meal is important?&lt;/strong&gt;  At the family meal, what we do is serve on platters so that everybody takes whatever they want, and we try to make it as varied as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can't make more than three different dishes, that would make it a bit complicated.  When there's such a large number of people it's important to serve them on platters (family style), when you're cooking for yourself at home it's not such an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens after service is finished for the evening? Does the staff sit down and have a drink just like they had dinner together or just clean up and go home?&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing, everybody is desperate to get out, they've already spent more than 12 hours at the restaurant.  Everyone just goes home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who haven't had a chance to visit &lt;a href="http://www.shopterrain.com/"&gt;Terrain&lt;/a&gt; in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, it's a bit tricky to convey the magic of the place.  It's a garden center and nursery, a shop stocking kitchenwares and edibles, a place with one of the most expertly curated cookbook selections I've ever encountered, oh, and it's also home to an incredible restaurant where meals are had in a lush candlelit greenhouse.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And did I mention that they host a series of &lt;a href="http://www.shopterrain.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/event.index/nodeID/370db4fe%2D547b%2D4c47%2D8ddd%2D604138fea382/"&gt;monthly events&lt;/a&gt; with cookbook authors and food artisans?  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've visited New York's &lt;a href="http://www.abchome.com/"&gt;ABC Carpet and Home&lt;/a&gt; and dined at &lt;a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2010/05/abc-kitchen-jean-georges-goes-local-union-square-flatiron-opening-review.html"&gt;ABC Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, this is similar, just add a nursery filled with gorgeous growables and a historic mushroom house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first one is happening on October 5th&lt;/strong&gt; but we had a chance to sneak a peek at some of what Rudolf will be serving.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a brioche baked in a flower pot and served with a lavender honey butter sprinkled with smoked sea salt, the meals will feature produce from &lt;a href="http://www.localharvest.org/happy-cat-organics-llc-M6652"&gt;Happy Cat Organics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lancasterfarmfresh.com/static/controls/"&gt;Lancaster Farm Fresh&lt;/a&gt;, a co-op of eastern Pennsylvania farmers, and cheeses from &lt;a href="http://www.chestercountycheese.org/meet-the-artisans/doe-run-dairy/"&gt;Doe Run Dairy&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudolf is creating an impromptu seasonal menu, taking inspiration from what's on hand during the days leading the first Farm Table dinner.  But you can expect to see plenty of local mushrooms due to Terrain's proximity to &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/07/mushrooom-country-kennett-square-mushroom-country-pennsylvania-how-mushrooms-grow.html"&gt;Mushroom Country U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps in the form of a deeply earthy and wonderfully simple &lt;strong&gt;Mushroom Soup finished with Porcini Oil&lt;/strong&gt;.  And we can only hope that he'll be serving &lt;strong&gt;Local Trout with Quinoa and a Beet-Coriander Purée&lt;/strong&gt; and perfectly delicate &lt;strong&gt;Financier with Sun Dried Cherry and Rosemary Compote&lt;/strong&gt; that we enjoyed during a recent dinner.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To circumvent Pennsylvania's tricky liquor laws as well as round out the local flavor of this event, &lt;strong&gt;the seven-course dinner will be paired with wines from local wineries&lt;/strong&gt; including &lt;a href="http://www.paradocx.com/"&gt;Paradocx Vineyard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.valavineyards.com/"&gt;Va La Winery&lt;/a&gt;, all included in the price of the meal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an easy drive from both Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, but be sure to give yourself plenty of browsing time beforehand to check out all of the lovely culinary and garden offerings to be had.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20080616-servedbug.jpg" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20080616-servedbug.jpg" width="200" height="223" class="photo-right" /&gt;When I get in, the guys (they're all guys) are processing a medium dog-sized wheel of Jarlsberg. That means someone is slicing the hole-y cheese into neat wedges with a wire, someone else is wrapping the chunks in slick saran, stacking them, weighing them, and labeling them. In a few minutes, a third guy will build a careful Jarlsberg sculpture on the shelves. First in first out, so the old Jarlsbergs will be emptied and reassembled in front of the new one. Then &lt;strong&gt;repeat, repeat, repeat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cheese as Far as the Eye Can See&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some 700 cheeses. They include little wheels of pungent Langres (refer to a cheese as stinky only if a customer does so first) and bigger Langres that must be cut and wrapped. There is Fromager d'Affinois, the ultra-filtered double crème, and their goat and sheep's milk cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a laundry list of Brie-ish cheeses: Brie de Meaux, Prince La Fontaine, St Andre, Brillat Savarin. There are little buttons and logs of chevres from many different producers, some plain, some coated in ash or herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of goudas. Young goudas, goudas about to celebrate their fifth birthday; goudas of cow, goat, and sheep's milk. We've got a whole aisle of cheddars. We have hard, rich cheeses from Sardinia with layers and layers and layers of flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have tangy, sheepy, sweet-tart wheels from Portugal. We have salty, mild cheeses from Greece and salty, strong cheeses from Bulgaria. The fresh Mexican cheeses. The Pyrenees cheeses. The gruyeres, the comptes, and their relatives.  Sweet ricotta and savory ricotta. Let's not even get started on the kosher section.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are the &lt;strong&gt;crazy cheeses with dried fruits and nuts and flavors up the wazoo&lt;/strong&gt;. Stilton with ginger and mango, wensleydale with cranberries, havarti with caraway, all sorts of truffle cheeses, cheddar flavored like buffalo wings. Also: toffee cheese! Really? Really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also got artisanal cream cheeses, creme fraiche, butters from around the world, and cheese curds from upstate New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the non-cheese things we sell. Pates and foie gras. Australian fire-roasted tomatoes, orange zest-infused slices of membrillo, and halvah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Day in the Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routine is as follows: pack and process cheese, help customers decipher between Sbrinz and Tomme du Jura, find out for a distressed mom where we have sauerkraut ("but not in bags!!"), weigh out precisely 1.2 pounds of pot cheese for an ancient lady with a big smile, field calls from cheese wholesalers, nibble on caramelly Piave, dole out samples of Etorki, joke with guys at the deli counter next door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest training cheese employee will cut his finger slicing a chunk of farmers' cheese for another old lady. We see a lot of old ladies. &lt;strong&gt;He will bleed through his latex gloves and be rushed to the ER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lady will start to holler. After all is sanitized and a new block of farmers' cheese procured, she will instruct me on how to package her purchase. She wants the plastic wrapper removed and the cheese repackaged in paper, then the cheese-wrapped paper placed in a quart container. Then she wants the quart container wrapped in plastic!!&lt;br /&gt;
She will walk me through the process and wonder how our trainee's poor bloody finger is, and remind me to wrap the plastic very securely. I will tell her, "Have a wonderful day!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later, a cashier will return the deserted farmers' cheese, all painstakingly and strangely wrapped up. I will turn to my coworker and say, "Really? She made me do all this and didn't even take it?" How cruel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ben will laugh and say, "I'm sure we can convince another old lady that &lt;strong&gt;this is the best way in the world to store farmers' cheese&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No!" I urge him, "Don't do it! We'll create another monster!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will wander by and inquire about samples. We'll sliver them a bite of Drunken Goat if we have it out. If not we'll ask, "what do you want to try?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lady will want the &lt;strong&gt;stinkiest cheese we have&lt;/strong&gt; and be disappointed by Stinking Bishop and Grayson alike. A French kid no older than ten will tell me we don't have the best brand of Roquefort, and that this is a tragedy. An Israeli couple will seek my advice on the best stuff with which to fill up burekas, a young father will ask for help cheering up his cheese-loving daughter who just sprained her ankle playing soccer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer-clad woman will tell me, "hello, don't you remember me?" and I will tell her, "I remember you, but&lt;strong&gt; I don't remember what cheese you like&lt;/strong&gt;." She will shoot me a look of ire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big cheese delivery will come right as the early evening rush gets really crazy. We will throw the boxes of cheese across the store, nearly missing heads and shopping carts. Nobody will get hurt. Now there are boxes everywhere, wheels of cheese stacked up, and we are fielding questions and selling taleggio and wrapping cheese like nobody's business. &lt;strong&gt;We are on fire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will sell a $110 wheel of manchego to a Japanese businessman. A man will taste seven cheeses before deciding on nothing. A woman will whip out her notebook, fire cheese questions, and start scribbling notes. I will leave tired and smelling cheesy and feeling good. Another day at the grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you're forced to eat 21 burgers for your job. It's a high class problem, I suppose, but somebody's got to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Annual New York City Burger Bash presented by &lt;a href="http://lafrieda.com/"&gt;Pat LaFrieda&lt;/a&gt; took place at the Brooklyn Bridge Park on Friday evening, with 21 different restaurants representing. Thousands of burgerazzi were on hand to taste the burgers and maybe grab a photo op with the judges; this year's event was hosted by Whoopi Goldberg with a judging panel consisting of Food Network's Anne Burrell, Adam Richman of &lt;em&gt;Man Vs. Food&lt;/em&gt;, Andrew Zimmern of &lt;em&gt;Bizarre Foods&lt;/em&gt;, and David Burke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-burger-bash-23.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="20111002-burger-bash-23.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, food at these events is almost never as good as it is at the actual restaurant, but I left pleasantly surprised by the pretty consistent quality. With few exceptions, these were honest, tasty burgers that didn't fall victim to the typical cheffy pitfall of over-fancy-pantsifying simple foods that should remain simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Shake Shack delivered what I thought was far and away the best burger of the night&amp;mdash;as well seasoned and crusty as it is at any of their locations&amp;mdash;with strong performances coming from Bill's Bar &amp; Burger serving real-deal onion-griddled sliders and Quality Meats with their "F*ck Fancy Cheeseburger." The surprise hit of the evening for me was the Lamb &amp; Brisket burger from Beauty &amp; Essex, which came with an awesome side of duck fat-coated fingerling potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://aht.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-burger-bash-22.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20111002-burger-bash-22.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Marc Forgione topping his hangover burgers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People's Choice went to Josh Capon of Burger &amp; Barrel for their Bash Burger&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the bison burger that they said they were going to serve&amp;mdash;made with beef, bacon jam, pickles, and cheddar. It was a decent burger, if a little mushy. I more closely agreed with the judges' winning pick: the "Wisconsin" Cheese Burger from Abe &amp; Arthur's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the Brewer's Association celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Great&lt;br /&gt;
American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado. Thousands of beer geeks flocked to the&lt;br /&gt;
Colorado Convention Center to take part in the festivities, which featured over 2400&lt;br /&gt;
different beers from 465 breweries. Spread out over three days and four sessions,&lt;br /&gt;
attending GABF is every craft beer fan's rite of passage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denver's already a fantastic beer city during the other 362 days of the year, but the influx of thousands of the beer industry's biggest names and thirstiest patrons makes the city even more exciting for beer lovers. Almost every bar or restaurant had some sort of great beer event going on, so even if you didn't have tickets to the festival there were plenty of other opportunities for drinking delicious craft beer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the festival itself? It was certainly a monumental task attempting to traverse the hall floor; there were so many great things to taste and interesting brewers to meet. Check out a few of our favorite sips in the slideshow. If you attended GABF, what were the highlights for you?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-primary.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-primary.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;[Photographs: Robyn Lee]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good things must come to an end. But luckily, when you hit that depressing moment when a bowl of cereal is done, you still have that magical elixir waiting for you as a last treat. You know what I'm talking about here, people. &lt;strong&gt;Cereal milk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, chocolate cereals were probably the most forbidden of all. Occasionally I could trick my mom into buying some sort of lightly frosted something or other, but my only exposure to chocolate cereals was the very "healthy" variety. You know, the kind that weirdly tastes like vaguely rotting fruit? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was years before I poured myself a bowl of the real stuff and watched the milk turn almost instantly into a delicious chocolate-y pool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I love cereal milks of all shapes sizes and colors, but after the shock of the &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/09/cereal-eats-mexican-vs-american-cereal-showdown-fruit-loops-frosted-flaes.html"&gt;Mexican vs. American&lt;/a&gt; Coco Krispies milk, we got to thinking: are all cereal milks created equal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided it was time to take things a step further. &lt;strong&gt;A blind taste test to find out which chocolate cereal makes the best milk. &lt;/strong&gt;After some deliberation, we decided to go with the three most popular, purely chocolate cereals: Cocoa Krispies, Cocoa Puffs and Cocoa Pebbles. That'd be one from each of the three major brands (Kellogg's, Post, and General Mills). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tasted for sweetness, chocolate flavor and all around drinkability. We crowned one the king of the cereal milks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/user/profile/GoodEaterKenji"&gt;Kenji's&lt;/a&gt; help (OK, he did the whole thing while I stood by helplessly, eating dry Cocoa Puffs) we re-created the cereal + milk =&gt; cereal milk process, in a measured, controlled manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don't I let him explain the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-1.jpeg" width="500" height="202" alt="20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-1.jpeg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each cereal was measured and placed in an identical container and covered with a predetermined quantity of milk. I'm a whole milk drinker myself (everything else just tastes like white water to me), but I know Leandra prefers her icy cold skim, so in the spirit of compromise that so often marks Serious Eats intra-office politics, we went with 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the proper steeping time, we tried to figure out how long it takes someone to eat a bowl of cereal. Again, Leandra downs a bowl in about 30 seconds of choking/shoveling but we opted for what others thought was the more conservative time&amp;mdash;we set our timer to four minutes, with the entire container being stirred with a spoon once a minute during steeping. After, the milk was passed through a fine mesh strainer into three identical containers for tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-2.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-2.jpeg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tasters were given milk in unmarked cups and asked to evaluate them on overall flavor, chocolatiness, and sweetness. The results were then tallied up in a spreadsheet and analyzed by a powerful calculator (by which I mean my brain) in order to determine the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, turned out that &lt;strong&gt;Cocoa Puffs won by a healthy margin.&lt;/strong&gt; In looking at the scores, it was no surprise: of the three cereals, it was the only one marked by true chocolate flavor, without the cloying sweetness of the other rice-based contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to you, Leandra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going with the crowd, my own pick for favorite was Cocoa Puffs as well. It's an all around superior cereal, in my opinion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In third place was Cocoa Pebbles. Can't say I was surprised.&lt;/strong&gt; This milk appeared to be dark at first, but when I poured it, I realized it was just a film of powdery chocolate on the surface. Gross. It ranked second for sweetness, but was the least chocolate-y of the three. Clearly not a winning combo. I tasted almost no chocolate flavor, with more of a sugary caramel thing going on which I was not into. The grainy cereal flavor was especially evident as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In second place came Cocoa Krispies. The Krispies produced a milk that was somehow richer and creamier than the others. Some people equated it with milk chocolate or Swiss Miss. It was ranked the sweetest, with decent chocolate flavor. This tasted the most like straight up chocolate milk to me, with little evidence of cereal. I would gladly drink this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-3.jpeg" width="500" height="218" alt="20111002-chocolate-cereal-milk-3.jpeg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote"&gt;The clear winner was Cocoa Puffs.&lt;/span&gt; Several tasters were able to identify which cereal it was from first sip. The delicious chocolate-y flavor of those satisfyingly crunchy little puffs was evident throughout this milk.  Tasters found this one to be the least sweet of the three, but with the most chocolate flavor. One taster referred to it as "complex and toasty." For me, it had that distinct cereal milk taste that I love so dearly. Bottle that business up! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which of these is your favorite chocolate milk producer?&lt;/strong&gt; Is there another chocolate cereal that you think makes better milk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been attending SWEET, the city's ultimate sugar fest at the New York Wine and Food Festival, for four years now; and just like every year, we loved the diversity of sweets on offer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had your highbrow plated desserts from restaurants including Mas (farmhouse), db Bistro Moderne, dell'anima, and Gotham Bar and Grill; and homey creations from CookieBar, BabyCakes NYC, and First Prize Pies. Newcomers this year included miniature pies from The Blue Stove and cupcakes from Sprinkles, among many others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was as fun to wolf down mini-doughnuts from the Doughnut Plant as it was to devour petite mascarpone ice cream sandwiches at Locanda Verde. Check out all of our favorite sweets from SWEET 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to be going just fine: You've got freshly ground coffee brewing in your French press, your timer ticking the seconds away until that precious four-minute mark. You're mere moments away from enjoying the first cup of the morning when&amp;mdash;uh oh&amp;mdash;the plunger won't depress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your caffeine-deprived state, maybe you succumb to the obvious option and push harder. And then harder. It won't budge! One more push and then...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OH NO&amp;mdash;SHATTERED FRENCH PRESS, HOT COFFEE EVERYWHERE!!! &lt;em&gt;AAARGH!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened, and how can you avoid coffee winding up everywhere in your kitchen &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; your favorite mug?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This actually happened to me two weeks ago, five minutes before the beginning of an 8 a.m. conference call for which I always desperately need a cup of coffee. Yes, even though I knew better, I kept applying more and more pressure to the lodged plunger, eventually causing the beaker to shatter under the strain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a rookie mistake, but &lt;strong&gt;it doesn't have to happen to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the plunger stalled is because of a buildup of what we call "fines" among the coffee grounds, which get clogged in the press's metal-mesh screen and jam it up, which prevents it from moving easily through the brewing liquid. The term &lt;em&gt;Fines&lt;/em&gt; describes a kind of &lt;strong&gt;pulverized coffee dust&lt;/strong&gt; that most grinders will create, even when on a relatively coarse setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower-quality grinders&amp;mdash;say, the whirly-blade type&amp;mdash;and those with dull burrs will create more fines. In the former case, the blades whip the beans around somewhat at random, creating uneven particle size within the same batch. (While some beans get the blade treatment over and over again until they are reduced to powder, others get roughly and coarsely chopped.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter instance, the fines are created because the dull edges of the burrs need to be brought closer and closer together over time to create as fine a grind as they did when they were fresh; at a certain point, they will be so close as to simply decimate the beans, as in a mortar and pestle, rather than more acutely chopping and grinding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that being said, what should you do if you find yourself with a press pot you can't press? &lt;span class="pullquote"&gt;Whatever you do, don't force it!&lt;/span&gt; Simply apply a little pressure to the plunger, then lift it back up about a quarter of an inch, to dislodge the finicky fines. You'll usually find that&lt;strong&gt; backing up on the plunger once or twice&lt;/strong&gt; will loosen the coffee glue that's jamming up the works, allowing you to depress the thing at last with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's better than a kitchen floor full of hot coffee and soppy grounds, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ribs.  When I think about them, my eyes roll back, and my mouth starts to water.  The way the meat falls off the bone; so sweet, so savory, so smoky.  Few things are as simple but complex as the well-cooked rib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So discovering that I can make ribs at home was a revelation.  It's a simple technique.  Marinating, followed by a couple of hours covered in a low oven, and then just a few more minutes uncovered to get those burnt edges.  And they are tender, and delicious, and you made them all yourself without so much as a barbecue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipotles are the perfect secret ingredient in the ultimate rib barbecue sauce because they themselves are already smoky.  So, if you love the smoky flavor of barbecue, but want to make ribs in your kitchen, this is the recipe for you.  I make a simple barbecue sauce from ketchup, onions, garlic, chipotles, and the adobo sauce in which they are packed.  When you first taste the sauce, it'll seem far too hot.  But after the ribs soak in it overnight, and once the sauce roasts and cooks down, it is only mildly hot, smoky, tangy, sticky.  The meat falls off the bone.  The edges are black and crisp.  This recipe is a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;serves 4, active time 10 minutes, total time 3 hours, plus overnight marination&lt;/p&gt;
            
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons vegetable oil&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1/2 Spanish onion, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;2 cloves garlic, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;14 ounces ketchup&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;7.5 ounces chipotle in adobo&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1 cup molasses&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;1/3 cup granulated sugar&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;6 pounds baby back ribs, separated&lt;/li&gt;
            
            &lt;li&gt;Kosher salt&lt;/li&gt;
            
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
            
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat the oil on medium-high, and add the onion and garlic.  Sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the rest of the ingredients, except the ribs; turn heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 25 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put the ribs and the sauce in a large plastic sealable bag, and refrigerate overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 300°F.  Arrange the ribs on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, season with salt, and cover tightly with foil.  Bake for 2 1/2 hours.  Meanwhile, bring the barbecue sauce to a boil in a pot on the stove.  Boil for 3 minutes, and set aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover the ribs, turn them over, and bake an additional 30 minutes.  Brush with barbecue sauce on both sides, and serve hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/ol&gt;
