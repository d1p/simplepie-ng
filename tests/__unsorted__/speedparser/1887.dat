			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back I did a little experiment with building a ruby gem &#8211; the result was <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/regexhelper" title="regexhelper gem ">Regexhelper</a>. You can check out the gem on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/regexhelper">Rubygems.org</a>, or check out the source at Githu.com. Of course, you can install by by running &#8216;gem install regexhelper&#8217; if you&#8217;re so inclined. As of now its been downloaded 45 times. </p>
<p>I used a the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jeweler">jeweler</a> gem to help create regexhelper. Right now the gem is pretty empty, and probably very amateurish, but I plan on updating and cleaning it up as soon as possible.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While learning Rails, I&#8217;ve come across a fair number of really interesting subsets/addons to Rails. This is a list of the ones I plan to investigate in greater detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra &#8211; Super simple and quick rails app setup</a> &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t get much easier than this:<br />
<blockquote><p>
require &#8216;sinatra&#8217;</p>
<p>get &#8216;/&#8217; do<br />
  &#8220;Hello World!&#8221;<br />
end</p></blockquote>
<p>I love the way Sinatra does routing, and the erb :erbname syntax just makes sense right off the bat. Also is supposed to work well with heroku, though I haven&#8217;t goten that far yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://refinerycms.com/">Refinery</a> &#8211; Also super-quick and easy Gem, but builds out a bare-bones but extensible CMS/blogging engine. COWPU and Bend.rb are using it during the weekly hack night in Bend to build hot sexy pizza websites.</li>
<p><a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">Coffeescript</a> &#8211; Coffeescript is a kind of Ruby-ish language that compiles into javascript, and as of Rails 3.1 will come bundled with rails. I like coffeescript because I&#8217;m a dork who can&#8217;t type and I always mess up javascript, which is then just a PITA to debug.</p>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heroku is pretty cool: a free host for your rails apps that also works really well with git/github. Since my current hosting has some pretty odd hosting for rails, I&#8217;ll be using heroku to host my demo apps. While adding a demo app, I received this error:</p>
<p>heroku keys:add  &#8230;/custom_require.rb:36:in `require&#8217;: no such file to load &#8212; readline (LoadError)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://dirk.net/2009/04/05/no-such-file-to-load-readline-loaderror-when-running-scriptconsole/">dirk.net</a>, this error is due to missing libraries after installing ruby from source. </p>
<p>The provided fix worked just fine for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev<br />
    sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, I cd to where I unpacked the Ruby source and ran:</p>
<blockquote><p>ruby extconf.rb<br />
make<br />
sudo make install</p></blockquote>
<p>heroku keys:add worked fine from there. Thanks to <a href="http://dirk.net/">dirk.net</a> for the fix.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my quest to get ruby on rails up and running on all three OSes tat live in my house (windows, mac OSX leopard, linux), I ran into a snag in the install process on Ubuntu 10.04. </p>
<p>Ruby v 1.8.7 was alive and well, however, following the steps at <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">rubyonrails.org</a>, when I tried to update gem:<br />
sudo gem install rails<br />
OR<br />
sudo gem update &#8211;system<br />
I received this error:</p>
<blockquote><p>/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require&#8217;:<br />
    no such file to load &#8212; zlib (LoadError)</p></blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, I received the same error when trying to create a rails app or start the rails server &#8211; even though rails *seemed* to be installed. Mysterious!<br />
I had previously installed ruby via the synaptic package manager, gotten the same message, then tried again via sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential, none of which had relieved the issue.<br />
So, searching the googlenet, I came across this post:<br />
<a href="http://thoughtsincomputation.com/posts/ubuntu-and-ruby-191-zlib-missing">http://thoughtsincomputation.com/posts/ubuntu-and-ruby-191-zlib-missing</a><br />
He had run into the same issue, and noted that the actual missing library was called zlib1g. I checked synaptic, and I had that installed &#8211; but, he noted that he had compiled Ruby from source, which I hadn&#8217;t tried. So, following his instructions:<br />
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev</p>
<p>I then went to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a> and got the source for version 1.9.2 (since this was the version I&#8217;m currently running on windows). I compiled ruby1.9.2 from source, and the problem was resolved.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notes for myself on learning rails </p>
<p>I set up rails using:<br />
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/download">http://rubyonrails.org/download</a><br />
Everything below here deals with the Windows install &#8211; since Tomcat on linux is causing me problems, I&#8217;m using windows right now so I can switch between jsp/servlets/php/rails more easily. </p>
<p><strong>After initial setup</strong>, I always received this error:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could not find gem &#8216;sqlite3 (>= 0)&#8217; in any of the gem sources listed in<br />
your Gemfile.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually Google gave me this solution, which is to specify WHICH sqlite3 gem to use:</p>
<blockquote><p>gem &#8216;sqlite3-ruby&#8217;, &#8217;1.3.2&#8242;, :require => &#8216;sqlite3&#8242;</p></blockquote>
<p>After which, I ran bundle install and everything went fine.<br />
This is in total contrast to trying to run rails using mysql &#8211; both version 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 seem to only want to use mysql2, even after specifying in the Gemfile and in config/database.yaml to use mysql. I would always get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could not find gem &#8216;sqlite3 (>= 0)&#8217; in any of the gem sources listed in<br />
your Gemfile.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually I worked around this by downloading an older version of the libmySQL.dll (when I find the link I&#8217;ll update this) and putting that directly into the Ruby/bin dir. Not a great workaround. An actual &#8216;fix&#8217; for this seems to be described on this page:<br />
<a href="http://rorguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/installing-mysql2-gem-on-ruby-192-and.html">http://rorguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/installing-mysql2-gem-on-ruby-192-and.html</a> &#8211; however, this solution is only for a full install of the mysql server on your machine. I use WAMP for PHP dev, so I decided rather than remembering to stop and start WAMP mysql ten times a day, I would just use this workaround:</p>
<p>First, install the DevKit from here:<br />
<a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads</a> &#8211; make sure to read the docs first.</p>
<p>Then, update the Gemfile in your rails app:<br />
gem &#8216;mysql2&#8242;, &#8217;2.8.1&#8242;</p>
<p>Run bundle install.</p>
<p>run rake db:migrate (after rails generate to generate the models. More on this later.)</p>
<p>Following this tutorial:<br />
<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#top">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#top</a></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
While using the github client for windows, always use git bash. Half of the time, commands work from the windows cmd prompt, but the other half they don&#8217;t.<br />
ex: c:\Ruby\rails\first_app>git push origin master<br />
error: src refspec master does not match any.<br />
error: failed to push some refs to &#8216;git@github.com:jgbarr/first_app.git&#8217;</p>
<p>While using git bash remember to cd to the correct directory! After 1st setup (on windows 7), you&#8217;ll be in your home directory, where the .ssh dir was created.<br />
Using the git client for windows was pretty painless, so long as I remembered to do things correctly. I ended up with this (github profile: <a href="http://github.com/jgbarr/">http://github.com/jgbarr/</a>):<br />
<a href="http://github.com/jgbarr/first_app">https://github.com/jgbarr/first_app</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m experimenting with HTML5 &#8211; it&#8217;s given me faith that eventually I will be able to develop/design for the web without all the cross-browser nonsense that we all know so well. I doubt the day of full cross-browser compatibility will every arrive, but until then HTML5 is a really exciting advancement in what can be done with HTML and CSS. One day I hope to be able to develop web apps with nothing more than a solid, stable javascript library (jquery is probably the best candidate right now), HTML, and CSS. Until then, I&#8217;m putting up a portfolio of code that I&#8217;ve written for the web as an accessible resource/demo repository.</p>
