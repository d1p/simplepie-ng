Which is why we&#8217;ve introduced to dotCommerce Gift Cards so you can help your customers allow their recipients to choose what they really want from you.</p>
<p>The immediacy of Gift Cards means that your gift can be delivered to your recipient in seconds, landing directly into their inbox with a message from you. We&#8217;re not talking a plain text email either, an engaging multi-part email designed just like you want it to, will arrive on the day and time you want it to, including as soon as you&#8217;ve bought the gift card!</p>
<p>Forgotten an anniversary? No problem, they&#8217;ll never know! And they get to choose what they want from all the products on the site you chose the Gift Card from.</p>
<p>Stuck for something to choose for your loved one this Christmas? Well dotCommerce clients Rodial and Want The Look.com are both using dotCommerce&#8217;s Gift Card functionality to allow you to purchase Gift Cards on their site.</p>
<p>When you implement dotCommerce&#8217;s Gift Card functionality on your site you can set email campaign reminders to the recipients of the Gift Card to remind them that they still have the Gift Card to spend. The Gift Card is a totally virtual gift offering the most flexibility for your customers. They can spend as much or as little as they like in any one purchase. Using dotCommerce, you can also set emails as reminders to the gifter that their recipient still has money to spend.</p>
<p>Gift cards are a must for any store to capture the gift market. dotCommerce allows you to create a virtual gift card offering which all your customers will love.</p>

<p>Retaining customers can be quite tricky online. Online retail is predominantly about price. The accessiblity of different stores all in one place makes it easy to check prices between different stores, not even considering the abundance of price comparison sites. You may have the best price and value, remember value is not just price, but next time around when that customer is searching for something else you sell, or to repeat purchase, someone else may offer better value than you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not advocating continually dropping your price, you wouldn&#8217;t make any money and you could easily join the wealth of high street stores which over the past years have fallen into administration. Choosing who to purchase with online is a matter of value which includes service, delivery, and product information to name a few elements as well as price.</p>
<p>In our role offering ecommerce consultancy, we like to advise our clients to give your existing customers a reason to return, and make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Sounds easy, but not always as easy as it sounds without constantly running promotions.</p>
<p>Amongst other activities, dotCommerce offers 2 features which can dramatically impact on your returning visitors.</p>
<p>1. Loyalty Schemes</p>
<p>2. Member Pricing</p>
<div id="attachment_5703" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.dotdigitalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/members.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5703" title="members" src="http://www.dotdigitalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/members-300x254.png" alt="" width="240" height="203" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Muscle Finesse Member &amp; Loyalty Scheme</p></div>
<p>Loyalty schemes are in abundance on the high street and everyone is a member to at least one, if not ten, but loyalty schemes are less popular online.  They shouldn&#8217;t be and you shouldn&#8217;t be choosing an ecommerce provider who doesn&#8217;t have one or who can&#8217;t integrate with an external scheme.</p>
<p>Loyalty schemes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewards members for purchase</li>
<li>Encourages them to choose your store over another store with the same price and delivery offering</li>
<li>Encourages stronger interaction between your brand and your customers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Member Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Member pricing allows you to offer preferential prices on your site to customers who hold an account with you. When they&#8217;re logged in, all the prices will update to show their price. Different levels of membership can have different pricing discounts, and with dotCommerce, the level of membership can change month to month depending upon the amount they spent in the previous month!</p>
<p>Member pricing helps reward increased spending and change a customer&#8217;s behaviour to favour your online store over other channels.</p>

<p>Everyone always says “if your email doesn’t get opened in the first 24 hours of sending – forget about it!” and after reading Dave Chaffey&#8217;s recent blog &#8216;<a title="Half life of comms- chaffey" href="http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing-alerts/did-you-know-how-scary-the-half-life-of-your-online-comms-is/">Did you know how scary the Half-life of your online comms is?</a>&#8216; we were keen to put some science behind common held opinions and investigate this further. And our research, looking at dotMailer’s own monthly newsletter (<a title="newsletter signup" href="http://www.dotmailer.co.uk/newsletter_signup/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BlogPost&amp;utm_campaign=LifeofEmail">sign up here</a>) shows otherwise.</p>
<p>While it goes without saying the majority of email opens will happen in the first 24 hours, we were keen to find out what happens after that; do opens and click-throughs suddenly just self-destruct? You might be surprised to know we found it can take up to two weeks for the real traffic from our email newsletter to drop off.</p>
<h2>30% of opens happen after 24 hours</h2>
<p>Looking at results from the past six months I found that while 70% of opens happened in the first day, an additional 30% happened after this time. That’s a relatively large proportion, especially if you’re sending to large numbers of recipients or if you are sending a highly targeted campaign that has high conversion rates.</p>
<p>We found that if recipients hadn’t clicked in the first 24 hours then the majority would click within the following week. This period (2-6 days after) accounts for 80% of those not clicking on the first day, week two (7-14 days) brings an additional 12%. The really interesting point here is that the remaining 8% click through any time from 14 days to a whopping 148 days after! That’s five whole months after sending, would you Adam &amp; Eve it! (see the graph below).</p>
<h2>Don’t panic! You have plenty of time</h2>
<p>The point here is if you’ve not quite got the response rate you wanted on the first day, don’t worry, it’s not to say your campaign won’t get results in time. People are busy and it’s easy for your email to slip down the list, but this doesn’t necessarily mean it’s lost forever and more often than not if it looks of interest they will go back to it, even if it is 5 months later.</p>
<p>It’s also good to remember that sending out a follow up campaign to non-openers (which is super easy in dotMailer) can vastly improve your response rate. Simply go into the reporting page of your campaign, click on more reports, select ‘Non openers’ and export to a new address book. Then copy your campaign, compose a new subject line and you’re away!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dotdigitalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-22-at-14.24.02.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5761" title="Screen shot 2011-09-22 at 14.24.02" src="http://www.dotdigitalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-22-at-14.24.02-300x182.png" alt="" width="300" height="182" /></a>Back in 2008, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/apr/05/google.google">Google relaxed previous rules</a> and announced that companies using Adwords could bid on competitor keywords. For example, M&amp;S could bid on Interflora searches. And they did!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many companies – Interflora included – weren’t very happy about this and decided to take legal action.</p>
<p>The Interflora case went before the UK and European courts and, yesterday, the EU ruled in its favour. The full ruling can be read <a href="http://www.barker.dj/blog/inteflora-vs-marks-and-spencer-ecj">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>No winners?</strong></h3>
<p>However, to say competition law is complex is a massive understatement and the ruling, which still has to be interpreted by British courts, doesn’t give Interflora every concession it might initially have wanted.</p>
<p><span id="more-5757"></span></p>
<p>In simplistic terms, M&amp;S is still allowed to bid on trademarked keywords as long as the advert doesn’t damage the reputation of the rival brand.</p>
<p>Most people would probably conclude that this is fair and M&amp;S would likely follow this best practice advice in any case. So it seems as though everyone concerned here is claiming a (albeit small) victory!</p>
<p>Do a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1&amp;nord=1#hl=en&amp;nord=1&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=interflora&amp;gs_sm=s&amp;gs_upl=0l0l0l1190709l0l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;ion=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=a71d7f6706798683&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1375&amp;bih=885">search for Interflora</a> and see who (still) comes up…!</p>
<h3><strong>Managing reputation</strong></h3>
<p>The ruling dictates that trademarked brands retain the right to protect their reputation. It’s a tricky one to define though. And the web is full of examples of brands that are looking to protect themselves. For example, take <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/23/google-louis-vuitton-search-ads">Louis Vuitton’s court case</a> last year, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/lock-down-your-xxx-domain-before-the-land-rush-begins/">the roll out of XXX domain names later this year</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/09/netflix-qwikster-elmo-pothead/">Qwikster’s recent Twitter problems</a>.</p>
<p>In the 90s, protecting domain names was all the rage, but these days it’s more about search and social.</p>
<p>Online reputation management is increasingly important for companies where competitors can openly advertise on branded searches. The fact that Interflora took this action suggests they are losing considerable revenue because of trademark bidding.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean for brands?</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, what is really interesting is what this means for other companies out there. Here are my top pieces of advice, many of which haven’t changed following the ruling:</p>
<p>-       <strong>Bid on your trademarks</strong> – if you have a trademark, you need to make sure you register it with Google and then potentially bid on it</p>
<p>-       If you feel someone is using your trademark incorrectly then you can <strong>challenge this</strong></p>
<p>-       If you are bidding on a trademark, <strong>don’t infringe the copyright</strong> of the brand you are bidding against (and correspond to <a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Regulation-Explained/Online-remit.aspx">ASA rules</a>)</p>
<p>-       <strong>Don’t criticise the brand you are bidding against</strong></p>
<p>-       Make it clear about <strong>your relationship to the brand</strong> – don’t try and deceive searchers</p>
<p>But, at the end of the day, this ruling doesn’t change the fact that you can still bid on any term out there and many, M&amp;S included, will.</p>
<p>There is plenty of information out there about trademark bidding. I’ve included some useful links below and, of course, get in touch if you want to know more.</p>

With CEO <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2011/sep/12/carol-bartz-yahoo">Carol Bartz</a> sacked and a takeover imminent, many are claiming that one of the big internet giants has fallen. But I think these claims are a bit presumptuous. Let’s take a look at Yahoo and where the recent news leaves the brand and the wider search engine market.</p>
<p>At the start of August, Yahoo started offering organic search results directly from Bing as part of a deal struck in 2009. Why have they decided to bow out of the race you may ask? Well if you’re anything like the ninety-something percent of Brits who use Google every day, the answer is probably already pretty clear.</p>
<p><span id="more-5749"></span></p>
<p>Last year, Yahoo accounted for fewer than 3% of all searches in the UK, which looks pretty measly next to Google’s 90% market share.  Yahoo doesn’t perform this poorly across the globe; in fact in the US, Yahoo has (or had…) 15% of all organic searches. When looking at these figures it makes much more sense. With Yahoo’s users on board, the Bing search engine will account for close to a whopping <a href="mailto:http://www.seospecialist.co.uk/google-lose-market-share-in-usa-to-bing/">30%</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I’m sad to see Yahoo go. It means less choice for us users and, if this were a traditional bricks-and-mortar industry, the competition committee would have been all over the deal.</p>
<p>Bing is a relative newbie in the search engine world and is yards behind the rest of the pack. It will mature though; with more traffic running through it, the greater the experience it will build.</p>
<p>Search engines use high volumes of searches to work on honing their algorithms; the better these become, the faster and more intuitive the search process will be. The backing of Microsoft has clear benefits: Bing is the default search engine on all new PCs so we may soon see a new guy at the top.</p>
<h3>What’s next for Yahoo?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, Yahoo is still a great content provider and the more original content it offers, the more credible it will become. You only need to look at <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Answers</a> to find an example of a Yahoo product that grabs serious traffic, whatever search engine you’re using.</p>
<p>This increasing specialisation is in stark contrast to Google’s diversification – some would say it is also an indicator that you need to strip things back to your core capabilities before you can build out successfully again. We’re seeing a similar pattern of behaviour from companies like HP as it scales back its consumer operation to focus on becoming a dedicated enterprise provider.</p>
<h3>What you need to do</h3>
<p>The Yahoo/Bing move will have varying immediate effects for UK firms but the key thing, as always, is to understand your own situation. Our advice is to check into <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster/">Bing’s Webmaster tool</a>, get to grips with the new face of your rankings and then make decisions based on that.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re currently working with us, get in touch and we’ll walk you through the transition and any effects it will have on your business.</p>
