  <title>Futures</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/42353.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ld8rzxNRDe1qax3ido1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 253px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;i&gt;I&amp;#39;m sharing this article that I wrote for the OFW special section of The Philippine STAR published last April)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Futures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Don Jaucian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Remton Siega Zuasola&amp;#39;s Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria (The Dream of Eleuteria), a criminally underseen film and quite possibly the best Filipino film of 2010, the titular character is, in a sense, shooed of by her parents, particularly her mother, to Germany to marry one an aging, rich German and eventually rescue her family from the mounds of debts that they have incurred. It&amp;#39;s not exactly a circa-2000s scenario where Filipinas are still traded as mail-order brides (in the film, a woman actually arranges the marriages) as a possible gateway to a better life but in a sense, it embodies the ills and the heartaches that form the core of the Filipino Diaspora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teria&amp;#39;s cousin, who has been to Germany and has married a rich German, willingly flaunts the comforts of her new found life, even sporting a ridiculously accented English. The promises of a better life abroad can be gleamed through her brightly colored clothes, her seemingly endless romance with Germany and her expensive shoes, one of which she lends to Teria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s as simple as shedding off the worn, discarded clothes that reek of poverty and donning shinier, new ones that bear the stamp of a progressive and forward-looking fortune. Amidst the backdrop of an unmistakably third-world coastal town, we witness the signals of Teria&amp;#39;s journey from her hometown to making her first steps out into the wild blue yonder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display: none; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display: none; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Great Filipino Dream&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display: none; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teria isn&amp;#39;t exactly going to be working as a domestic helper in Germany, although the woman who arranges these marriages give the, for the lack of a better word, unfortunate looking ladies a chance to catch a droplet of The Great Filipino Dream by working as helpers in the aforementioned country. It&amp;#39;s an opportunity laid out before their very eyes and it&amp;#39;s up to them whether to seize it or turn it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways, Teria&amp;#39;s plight mirrors the hopes and dreams of every Filipino who has sought out a better life by working overseas. Seeing the opportunities brought about by the economic boom in the Middle East during the 70s, the Philippine government has since sent millions of Filipinos to work in oil companies, construction sites, hotels and hospitals and tend to the needs of the ruling class and rake in dollar remittances in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their February 2011 issue, global affairs magazine Monocle has looked into the story of our Overseas Filipino Workers as one of the pumps that keep the heart of the Philippine economy going. Writer Liv Lewitschnik observes the astounding feats of our OFWs and the lengths that the government goes through to ensure their welfare and protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Today, one in nine Filipinos works abroad, where they can earn salaries five or six times higher than they can at home. During 2010 alone, 53, 532 people left the Philippines while those nine milion already settled across 180 countries sent 17bn euros home to their relatives. Only India, China and Mexico receive more remittances than the Philippines. At 12 per cent of the GDP, it is a source of income the government is more than happy to see coming in,&amp;quot; wrote Lewitschnik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OFW remittances has long been a core element of the Philippine economy. Just February this year, a healthy surge of 6.2% growth in overseas remittances has posited a positive gain for the economy, bolstering the confidence of local and foreign investors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A long running plight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s a story that has been written so many times in national publications yet it perfectly reflects the attention that the OFWs warrant; an alarm call for the government to actually do something to preserve the brilliance of Filipino minds that has been slowly trickling away since the brain drain. Although the government has taken measures to pamper OFWs by giving them privileges, the increase in the number of people going abroad still reflects the tired attitude of the rest of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Eleuteria&amp;#39;s long and obstacle-ridden walk to the port, where her journey is yet to begin, Filipino overseas workers ultimately leave a lasting proof of our kind of bravery, withstanding challenges to give their families, and eventually themselves, a better future to look at.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <title>Wherqing It</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/41809.html</link>
  <description>My work life is seriously fucked up. I have several articles to write but I don&amp;#39;t feel like writing. I have no idea why. This general lack of motivation is bothering me. The deadlines are piling up so pretty soon shit will definitely hit the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, this is the general disarray of my desk reflects the muck that I swim through every time I try to write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw1tdIElK1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&amp;#39;d give myself a kick by downing this little can of espresso. WRONG. It made me giddy. My attention span jumped out of the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw1ya5Eip1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juggling reading my notes and GQ&amp;#39;s July 2011 issue. Contrary to what you think, I actually read GQ for the srs~*~ stuff. Like the feature on Al Jazeera. Also, their restaurant features are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw20sQleO1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my failed attempt to create a mood board of sorts using my cubicle wall. Most of them are film-related stuff. &amp;nbsp;I have no idea where I got that name tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw23bXyTE1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s Firday and our office looks depressed as I am. Yesterday was Kat&amp;#39;s last day. She&amp;#39;s off to more fabulous things, I suppose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw25nJjCM1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God, I make things seem even more depressing. I should definitely get wasted tonight.</description>

  <title>Break Brake Down</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/41074.html</link>
  <description>The past few days have been, to quote Cady Heron, &quot;a stressful, surreal blur&quot;. I&apos;m hardly productive. So I try to do little things that give me some semblance of productivity: washing my underwear, organizing my closet, burning .avi files that just sit and gather megabyte-dust on my netbook. Things like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some days, I go up but then I come down too abruptly. At some point, I did break down. I&apos;m 23. I&apos;m alone and I have wounds that haven&apos;t healed yet. I am allowed to break down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commute from work is even more exhausting. Jeepney drivers don&apos;t know how to stay in their lanes. Car and bus exhausts are suffocating, it&apos;s unbelievable that 99% in Manila don&apos;t have lung cancer. Or they haven&apos;t been diagnosed yet. I ride three jeepneys just to go home so when I get there I&apos;m more like a ghost. I hardly speak to my roommate and I idly waste my time online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are books to be read, movies to be seen but most of the time, I just want to waste away and sleep.</description>

  <title>Hold On, Holding On</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/40895.html</link>
  <description>I&amp;#39;m juggling three books. I don&amp;#39;t think its unheard of, it even has a name, book AD[H]D, I think, but it is of course very peculiar. Imagine three (or more, if you&amp;#39;re reading multi-storylined books) narratives going through your head within the span of time you&amp;#39;re reading, cris-crossing and swimming until it feels like you&amp;#39;re reading Hawking&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; or a book about the 2008 economic crash written in ugly jargon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here I am with two books by the bed, Jessica Hagedorn&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dream Jungle &lt;/i&gt;(I&amp;#39;m reading this upon a friend&amp;#39;s recommendation) and Joshua Ferris&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Then We Came To The End&lt;/i&gt;, a book about death in the land of post-its and shuffling papers. The other one is in my closet (ha ha), &lt;i&gt;Siglo: Passion&lt;/i&gt;, which I started reading last night and suffice it to say it has been an unpleasant reading experience so far (bad fonts, and even worse stories). At least the cover is gorgeous, obviously gunning for a Dave McKean mystique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From time to time, I continue plowing through James Hynes&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Next&lt;/i&gt;, a pleasantly written book that ocassionally evokes feelings of joy, passion, self-deprecation, nostalgia and anger. It&amp;#39;s been months since I started reading it and hopefully, I&amp;#39;ll finish it by the end of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new route to work doesn&amp;#39;t permit reading in transit. Jeepneys are no place for reading, much less the scraggly roads of Mandaluyong to Manila. Sometimes, I ride the train but the trip&amp;#39;s too short, covering only three stops as opposed to the former Recto-Santolan trip where I&amp;#39;ve finished books, magazines and even journal entries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get properly listen to new albums either. Most of the time, I listen to something familiar, tunes I can sing along to, even out loud while on public transportation. All this shaking down and moving around is slowly eating up the best of me. Even my friends have noticed it. And I apologize for that. Right now, I feel like I&amp;#39;m an unfortunate character in Morrissey&amp;#39;s head. I go up, I come down. There is a recognition of pain but it lingers without any promise of a better future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world is bleak and there is nothing to do but wait. That&amp;#39;s all we do anyway, wait until it all goes away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <title>In Transit</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/40465.html</link>
  <description>I live in another place now. Somewhere alien and unwelcoming. It didn&apos;t help that we are the first tenants of this place. We didn&apos;t have much with us. No furnishings, just beds, a handful of clothes and books, well, they&apos;re mostly Aldrin&apos;s. It&apos;s only been a week since I moved in here and it &apos;s already been a rollercoaster of emotions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it felt amazing to actually be independent, no hang-ups or anything. But really, I had a lot of things in tow. It&apos;s kinda hard that I&apos;m finally getting back up on my feet, again, but there are still things that try to tie me up to things I&apos;d rather let go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;11:54, I heard one of the&lt;em&gt; tanods&lt;/em&gt; say to one of her colleagues. They huddled around a &lt;em&gt;balut &lt;/em&gt;vendor, trying to pass the boredom of looking after an almost empty road. There are the occasional cars that pass by, taxis with passengers whose minds are sleeping already. I was in my walking shorts, worn out slippers and a shirt I usually wear to sleep. I&apos;m out because we didn&apos;t have drinking water at home. There are a lot of things missing in our room. No refrigerator, water dispenser, rags, cooking utensils, stove or even a broom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go up and down the streeet looking for an open store until I stumble upon what probably is the hallelujah&amp;nbsp;moment of the day: a 24-hour Tapa King outlet. I didn&apos;t have dinner so I blew out mu supposed lunch money and ordered their house special. For a kid like me, who missed dinner, it was like eating at El Bulli. The plate of tapa, sunny-side up and a mound of fried rice looked like heaven to me, and it tasted like so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few slices of chocolate cake left in the counter. I was too tempted to order it. They looked like mudpies. Or Bannaple&apos;s Goblin pies. Just thinking about them now makes me want to run down the street and buy an entire cake. But alas, the glorious looking cake and I were not meant to be. With a heavy heart, I walked away and finally bought lonely looking bottle of water from Andoks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, there&apos;s still yesterday&apos;s cassava cake, from Chard. &amp;nbsp;I will devour it right after I hit the post button.</description>

And for the past few days, I think it also applies to me. I&amp;rsquo;m desperately trying to get back on my feet. I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of guy who tells my friends &amp;ldquo;Cheer up! Things will get better!&amp;rdquo; whenever they&amp;rsquo;re depressed or just plain sad. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to tell myself that every time I wake up in the morning. So, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrdqgIco51qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing too much of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_besixdouze&apos; lj:user=&apos;besixdouze&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://besixdouze.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://besixdouze.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;besixdouze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://awarewolves.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Petersen&lt;/a&gt; lately. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic that a newly single person like me hangs out with a new couple (with all their sweet talk, holding hands and such) but hey, they&amp;rsquo;re good friends of mine. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m bitter or anything but, yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://walkingparadox.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jansen&lt;/a&gt;, watched &lt;em&gt;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&lt;/em&gt; last Tuesday night at Mogwai, as part of .MOV&amp;rsquo;s Idiot&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Heartbreak IV. Man, that movie&amp;rsquo;s sad despite the burst of color (thoughts &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/7025400194/the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg-jacques-demy-1964&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Nothing is ever good, even in the movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrdtdZXTb1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It took the day off to claim something from Lowell Philippines. My sister won this Alaska thing and they produced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/summerapsummer/posts/125464057539195&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;10-minute short&lt;/a&gt;, directed by Jade Castro, based on her story (loosely based, more like it), which was shown in Cinema One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the afternoon lurking around Ayala. I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://sedricke.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sed&lt;/a&gt; telling me he grew up wanting to work here; with the promises of a corporate life from any of these tall buildings. I guess we all kind of did at some point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrea7ccQN1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shoot, I went to Krispy Kreme for &amp;ldquo;lunch&amp;rdquo;. I tried my donut stamina and after two donuts and a huge mug of Mountain Dew, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can successfully take on the donut challenge (last Fete, Jansen challenged me to eat a dozen of Krispy Kreme Donuts in one sitting). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also reading James Hynes&amp;rsquo;s Next. So far so good. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I finished  a book (the last was Carljoe Javier&amp;rsquo;s Geek Tragedies) so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get my reading mojo back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 6PM, I went to Ortigas to meet&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_geeuh&apos; lj:user=&apos;geeuh&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;geeuh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to watch the new Transformers flick. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thursday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrhyxYNYi1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out alone for a change. It was a rainy Thursday night so it didn&amp;rsquo;t help at all. Was it the universe&amp;rsquo;s way of telling me that things will be this sad? Fuck you, then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrfm1slFq1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payday weekend!&lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/7121014749/oh-you-know-its-payday-weekend-and-im-a-mess&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; I bought a lot of books&lt;/a&gt;, probably to intimidate me into reading a lot of them. Or is this me trying to fill The Void with material things? IDK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrfl5jlP51qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancelled my plans to go home to Olongapo and stayed home [alone] instead. I talked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiderdrug.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lui&lt;/a&gt; most of the day. Talking to Lui makes me fat because we talk about food most of the time. Hey, whaddya know, you&amp;rsquo;re a good influence, bb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to write, hoping that the promise of a new spiffy notebook would do me good. The attempt was mildly successful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrfojA0tx1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Met my sister at Gateway for some family stuff. Lurked around Fully Booked for a while. I was really tempted to buy the last sealed copy of Manila Envelope 3 (2007) but it costs P500 and it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly in mint condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrfulhBds1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw these gorgeous new editions of China Mieville&amp;rsquo;s books. They cost around P500-600. Oh god, they&amp;rsquo;re beautiful. I might buy one every payday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrfvvMeFg1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Booksale too, hoping to score some cheap and decent books. I ended up buying hardcovers of The Devil Wears Prada (P55) and Boy Meets Boy (P75) and a copy of BlacBook Magazine. I was supposed to buy a copy of Complex Magazine since Nan told me to read one but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrf5qtJmV1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrg2qGTKH1qzqgeq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had McDonald&amp;rsquo;s to cap the night off. While I was reading Boy Meets Boy, I was also checking out the cute guy in the corner but he was deeply occupied doing his homework or something.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, there goes my week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photos taken using my Sony Ericsson S312 cameraphone (hence the crappy images so STFU LOL).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>Mix: Fuck Me, I&apos;m a Faggot</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/39821.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llpfh8KShd1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST:&amp;nbsp;I suppose I can say these past few weeks have been a terrible blur of personal triumphs and disappointments. The cosmos right now is a baffling mix of questionable content and it is both amusing and annoying at the same time. But hey, we should all soldier on, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW THIS: A rowdy night with some of my weirdo-but-nonetheless-awesome gay friends and a flickering discussion about the merits of Lady Gaga&apos;s new album (which I really liked!) prompted me to make a mix of some old school gay tunage. Partly to educate these kids about recognizing the forebears of today&apos;s&amp;nbsp;regurgitated pop music and partly to do something that requires a bit of creativity (no, the cover is made by&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_besixdouze&apos; lj:user=&apos;besixdouze&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://besixdouze.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://besixdouze.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;besixdouze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;.&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&apos;s the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/5831524177/mixtape-fuck-me-im-a-faggot-dance-isnt-what&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>2010: Year in Film, Part 2</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/39645.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/stills/7366/original.jpg?1289446439&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bluebeard (Catherine Brelliat)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fairy tales are known for their discerning fates: how societal strictures dictate gestures and futures. But in Catherine Brelliat&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Bluebeard&lt;/em&gt;, an adaptation of Charles Perrault&apos;s story, we see how the director&apos;s hard-wired feminist graces frame the otherwise beaten-down story into a psychosexual play that defies everything they&apos;re set out to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkltg2Jevj1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. White Material (Claire Denis)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something beautiful about the devastation and collapse in Claire Denis&apos;s &lt;em&gt;White Material&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe it&apos;s the way Isabelle Huppert&apos;s hair brushes against the air or how her clothes cling to her body as if to push aside the chaos that surrounds her. When the fires break loose, the last thing on our minds is who has survived but how the blood on their hands will gradually reveal the haunted lives of these people.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkltflndxR1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Everyone Else (Maren Ade)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slow dissolve of relationships are never easy. They may never be as brutal as we make out them to be but the psychological disappointments of these fallouts peel away our own fractures expectations of our lovers and ourselves. Maren Ade&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Everyone Else &lt;/em&gt;is as sparse and intimate as you can get without immersing yourself into the trickster wiles of relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkltgoZ0er1qzq9yqo1_500.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Apichatpong Weerasethakul)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Werasethakul&apos;s films aren&apos;t exactly otherwordly in the fantastic sense. Particularly in his Palme d&apos;Or winning film, Joe posits the correlation of the supernatural in our daily lives as if they are part of the very fabric that we inhabit. Ghosts of deceased relatives, nephews appearing in monkey-man form and a militarized vision of the future foretell signs of Joe&apos;s maximized folkloric vision and we&apos;re all willing to dive into all of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldm2zizIbr1qzy1su.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria (Remton Siega Zuasola)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Remton Siega Zuasola&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria (The Dream of Eleuteria)&lt;/i&gt;, the titular character is, in a sense, shooed off by her parents, particularly her mother, to Germany to marry one an aging, rich German and eventually rescue her family from the mounds of debts that they have incurred. It&apos;s not exactly a circa-2000s scenario where Filipinas are still traded as mail-order brides (in the film, a woman actually arranges the marriages) as a possible gateway to a better life but in a sense, it embodies the ills and the heartaches that form the core of the Filipino Diaspora.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Amidst the backdrop of an unmistakably third-world coastal town, we witness the signals of Teria&apos;s journey from her hometown to making her first steps out into the wild blue yonder.&amp;nbsp;It&apos;s as if everything is as simple as shedding off the worn, discarded clothes that reek of poverty and donning shinier, new ones that bear the stamp of a progressive and forward-looking fortune. But bearing the hardships of practically every Filipino who wants a sweeping change with a windfall of cash, Teria walks to the port with the dawning realization that leaving her home may be the greatest adventure she will ever make lest she choose to rot in her hometown.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>2010: Year in Film</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/39232.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lelcsu7qHb1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that you care but for obligatory reasons, here&apos;s a rundown of my favorite films of 2010. Four months late, this is actually irrelevant and the list-making isn&apos;t actually that good. But I&apos;m just hoping you&apos;ll read past the shortcomings and lapses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the dust of the awards season has settled, I discarded Oscar baits and winners to make way for some of the far more relevant and beautiful films of the past year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk8uk3m21S1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Never Let Me Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Mark Romanek)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadness is the palpable dread of a vividly foreseeable future waving its hand at you, urging you to go on and jump into the abyss. The sad characters of Kazuo Ishiguro&amp;rsquo;s Never Let Me Go doesn&amp;rsquo;t face absolute uncertainty; their lives are mapped out to a certain end but whatever is in between is left for them to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk8uspCgXR1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Scott Pilgrim vs the World &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Egar Wright)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High-speed thrills, geek-culture pumped references and hits make Edgar Wright&apos;s adaptation of Scott O&apos; Malley&apos;s beloved comic books an exploding tribute to young adult angst and quirks, haters be damned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj0ntbawyC1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Alamar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Pedro Gonzalez-Rubio)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depicting the complacency of the everyday routine, seafaring and the bond between generations of men, among other things, Pedro Gonzales-Rubio&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt; Alamar &lt;/em&gt;is easily an intriguing piece of cinema that blurs the definition between fiction and real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk8uofqlxT1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Monsters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Gareth Edwards)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title alone leads us to believe that the film is a splice between&lt;em&gt; District 9&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/em&gt; but&lt;em&gt; Monsters&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;hits immigration, smuggling and third-world ills right on the spot. Skirting these heavy hitting issues is a Richard Linklater-esque acquaintance between the two characters of the film, never knowing where their feet and the danger that they flee from will take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/39605_476851555241_368964780241_6684904_6263433_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Senior Year (Jerrold Tarog)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;High school as an experience has been overused to death in numerous foreign films but local cinema, where a year in high school means shuffling through trite love triangles, has yet to catch up. Senior Year marks a landmark achievement in depicting the lives of Filipino kids without exploiting emotions, class issues and economic limitations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5-1 to follow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</description>

  <title>It&apos;s Still Like a Secret</title>

  <description>&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljvstfNLSB1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5026/5633406409_ddd9f89da3_b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5633989496_f8d555549e_z.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those random moments that you feel artsy and gutsy enough to dump your pretentious photographic shit for everyone else to claw at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an early (read: 7:30AM) interview yesterday at Paseo de Roxas. Afterwards, I had breakfast at Coffee Bean in Greenbelt. Since I&apos;ve been on a shooting spree lately, using my semi-reliable 2MP cameraphone, I thought I&apos;d take pictures of some of my favorite buildings in Ayala (and then Ortigas). Nothing deep or artsy fartsy. For wallpaper potential, perhaps.</description>

Upon consultation with the vet, we think he died of rodent poisoning. He turned one a few months ago. We buried him yesterday at the PAWS graveyard. Here&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeuh.tumblr.com/post/4353215229&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jay&apos;s post &lt;/a&gt;for you to read. He explains things much better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss Sufjan, terribly. As much as I try to write sentences describing how Sufjan is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me, to us, I can&apos;t. Unless I&apos;ll willingly show everyone here how much of a baby I am.&amp;nbsp;My eyes still hurt from crying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you&apos;re doing well wherever you are, Sufjan. We miss you so much.&amp;nbsp;</description>

  <title>That General Feeling of Dread</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/38655.html</link>
  <description>With the&amp;nbsp;occasional burts of adrenaline from time to time, I am getting by fine. I guess this general feeling of lethargy is a residue of the exhausting jumps, curves and switches of 2010. Funny that my 2011 hasn&apos;t seem to have begun even though it&apos;s already almost four months into the year, There are little triumphs here and there: finishing Roberto Bolano&apos;s&lt;em&gt; 2666&lt;/em&gt; which frankly, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll get around reviewing; accomplishing my daily quota of blog submissions every now and then; that gratifying feeling of finishing an album review; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;slowly&amp;nbsp;realigning&amp;nbsp;the fractures of my so-called life, which doesn&apos;t seem to have caught on with the rest of the world. There&apos;s this feeling of restlessness and dread every now and then, like these pile of books on my desk will fall on me any second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paranoia and depression aside, I&apos;ve managed to finish five books since opening &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt;. The most recent proof of accomplishment would be Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s &amp;quot;Never Let Me Go&amp;quot;, a book which I have been dying to read since I heard about Mark Romanek&apos;s adaptation (which still remains one of my favorite films of 2010). The book was off to a faltering start. I hated how whiny and bitchy Kathy H. was to the point that I thought the whole rambling was to discredit Ruth, who eventually turned out to be a bigger bitch and then redeemed herself at the last minute. I kept complaining about the structure of the book but I realized that it reflected their cloistered upbringing; how Hailsham tried to pry their eyes open about all the things in the world, only to have it shut again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.mos.totalfilm.com/images/c/carey-mulligan-s-never-let-me-go-trailer-online-00-420-75.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;We&apos;re all automatons, really,&amp;quot; Regina told me through a text message after I told her about how I thought the lives of the students of Hailsham were similar to ours: we&apos;re guarded, given a steady sense of freedom, now matter how false it may be, we follow a direct course in life but there&apos;s this looming finality that&apos;s always at the corner of our eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying &amp;quot;I cried and it was sad&amp;quot; would be an understatement. Upon finishing the book, my eyes lingered on the last few lines of the book. How Kathy&apos;s wishful thinking reflected every inch our desire to go on but then we realize there&apos;s still the ghost of the past still&amp;nbsp;tethered&amp;nbsp;to our soles. &amp;nbsp;</description>

  <title>The 2011 Book Purge List</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/38172.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lga7cg3UYt1qbvqopo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller; &quot;&gt;(*not actual image of books)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m going to make this a yearly habit: I&apos;m letting go some of the books that I don&apos;t really have a chance of reading. The bulk of these books are from my science fiction/horror/fantasy phase and Book Sale purchases for the sake of purchasing (back when I used to make monthly trips to Manila just to raid Book Sale stores).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&apos;s the list. As much as I want to write a short description for each of the books, you might want to head on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com.ph/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to check whether you like the book or not. Some of the copies are worn or old, though. And please, don&apos;t ask me about the Bo Sanchez book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andrei Codrescu - Wakefield&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;William Gibson - Virtual Light&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jim Butcher - Storm Front (Dresden Files 1)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Dan Simmons - Summer of Night &lt;/strike&gt;(Danae)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philip Jose Farmer - Gods of Riverworld&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Clive Barker - The Thief of Always &lt;/strike&gt;(PauBau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robert M. Prisig - Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greg Bear - The Anvil of Stars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Jasprer Fforde - The Big Over Easy &lt;/strike&gt;(Pau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Return of the King - JRR Tolkien&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neil Gordon - The Sacrifice of Isaac&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caleb Carr - The Alienist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Kurt Vonnegut - Deadeye Dick &lt;/strike&gt;(Drin)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roger Zelazny - Frost and Fire&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Roger Zelazny - Lord of Light&lt;/strike&gt; (Danae)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Ramsey Campbell - Midnight Sun&lt;/strike&gt; (Chui)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gene Wolfe - The Citadel of the Autarch (Book 4 of The Book of the New Sun)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Peter Straub - Lost Boy, Lost Girl &lt;/strike&gt;(Andrea)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;James Blaylock - The Rainy Season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Ubaldo Steccconi (ed.) - Daydreams and Nightmares&lt;/strike&gt; (Chui)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alan Warner - These Demented Lands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Anne Rice - The Witching Hour &lt;/strike&gt;(Helga)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Anne Rice - Christ the Lord Out of Egypt &lt;/strike&gt;(Helga)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Robert Olen Butler - Mr. Spaceman&lt;/strike&gt; (Pau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven - The Burning City&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Margaret Atwood - Oryx and Crake &lt;/strike&gt;(Andrea)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kage Baker - In The Garden of Iden&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kage Baker - Sky Coyote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charles Grant - Black Oak: Winter Night, Genesis and The Hush of Dark Wings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Louis de Bernieres - Red Dog &lt;/strike&gt;(Pau)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neal Asher - Gridlinked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bo Sanchez - You Have the Power to Create LOVE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Naoya Shiga - A Dark Night&apos;s Passing &lt;/strike&gt;(KB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Ismail Kadare - File on H&lt;/strike&gt; (Joey)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helen Fielding - Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Joe Connely - Crumbtown&lt;/strike&gt; (Jansen)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Steven Heighton - The Shadow Boxer &lt;/strike&gt;(Danae)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Madeline L &apos;Engle - A Wrinkle in Time &lt;/strike&gt;(Andrea)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;How to be Good - Nick Hornby&lt;/strike&gt; (Hil)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Natsume Soseki - Kokoro &lt;/strike&gt;(KB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Comment or send me an email for your choices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(image &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshelfporn.com/post/3314671657&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

  <title>The Great Book Recap of 2010</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/38035.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgk253KLQw1qzq9yqo1_500.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so this is me procrastinating. But Carina&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookreport.nothingspaces.com/2011/01/overdue-2010-recap/#comment-159&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; actually made me think about the books I&apos;ve read for the past year. I haven&apos;t really been as productive with finishing books like I used to back in college, where I voraciously read every book I set my eyes on (well, not really).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of helped that I moved out and that I had more book-loving friends.It also helped that I became a book reviewer for a website (I reviewed four books, I think).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&apos;s a rough guesstimate of the books that i finished last year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scott Pilgrim Vols 1-6- Bryan Lee O&apos;Malley&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;News From The Shaman - Karl De Mesa (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepoc.net/thepoc-features/metakritiko/literature/9662-gods-of-the-intangible-news-of-the-shaman-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philippine Speculative Fiction 5 - Alfar and Simbulan (eds.) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepoc.net/thepoc-features/pinoy-pop/reviews/8977-the-strangeness-philippine-speculative-fiction-volume-5-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any Easy Intimacy (Of Us) - Jeffrey Brown (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepoc.net/thepoc-features/pinoy-pop/reviews/9157-the-pains-of-being-a-twee-at-heart-aeiou-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20th Century Ghosts - Joe Hill (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepoc.net/thepoc-features/pinoy-pop/reviews/9262-childhood-with-invisible-serpents-20th-century-ghosts-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ilustrado - Miguel Syjuco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Virgin Suicides - Jefffrey Eugenides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Norwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perks of Being a Wallflower - Stephen Chbosky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boy Meets Boy - David Levithan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looking For Alaska - John Green&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apathy and Other Small Victories - Paul Neilan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dressmaker&apos;s Child - William Trevor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Russian Affair(Penguin Great Loves) - Anton Chekhov&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Eaten Heart (Penguin Great Loves) - Giovanni Boccacio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sandman Volumes 3, 5-10 - Neil Gaiman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fragile Things - Neil Gaiman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy - David Sedaris&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twisted 9 - Jessica Zafra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love is a Mixtape - Rob Sheffield&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexing the Cherry - Jeannete Winterson&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Eternals - Neil Gaiman and John Romita, Jr.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neverwhere - Neil Gaiman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Kobayashi Maru of Love - Carljoe Javier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pulotgata (The Love Poems) - Danton Remoto&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smaller and Smaller Circles - F.H. Batacan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Time for Dragons - Vin Simbulan (ed.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wide Awake - David Levithan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let The Right One In -&amp;nbsp;John Ajvide Lindqvist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No Country For Old Men - Cormac McCarthy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haroun and the Sea of Stories - Salman Rushdie&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010 was actually a good year for Filipino books for me. I didn&apos;t cheat with a Bob Ong book, okay? His new one&apos;s reportedly crap anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Danton Remoto&apos;s&lt;em&gt; Pulotgata &lt;/em&gt;is actually a gift for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_geeuh&apos; lj:user=&apos;geeuh&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;geeuh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and I read it on the bus to Manila (haha, the days where I actually had a weekly trip to Manila just to visit him).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remember I finished &lt;em&gt;Love is a Mixtape&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href=&quot;http://aldr.in&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; gave to me) in his (&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_geeuh&apos; lj:user=&apos;geeuh&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;geeuh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&apos;s not Aldrin&apos;s) room, while he was away working. I actually downloaded a Pavement&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Slanted and Enchanted&lt;/em&gt; just so I could listen to it while reading the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of these books were read during the final half of the year, when I got my reading &amp;quot;mojo&amp;quot; back (i.e., I finished a book per week).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I read half of Margaret Atwood&apos;s &lt;em&gt;The Blind Assassin &lt;/em&gt;for the Read Hard group. When the month ended, I abandoned the book too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I actually liked all these books that I read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My finishing of Neil Gaiman&apos;s &lt;em&gt;The Sandma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; books cemented my love for the series, which I could easily name as my favorite book of all time. And no, I won&apos;t even attempt to review the books.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;With my Nook, I&apos;m hoping I could double my read list this year. But so far, I&apos;m off to a slow start, finishing only two books so far (which nets me a one book per month). I&apos;m still reading &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt;, which I&apos;m hoping to finish this week.</description>

  <title>Something About Books (and eBooks)</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/37650.html</link>
  <description>&amp;nbsp;I feel like I have to defend myself from people who berate me for getting an eBook reader, which is probably the closest thing to &amp;quot;joining the dark side&amp;quot; as I&apos;ll ever do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/2724972433/finally-heres-a-picture-of-me-with-my-nook&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Nook&lt;/a&gt;, Snooki is sorta my best friend (which is weird really, branding an inanimate object as my best friend). Since getting Snooki, I&apos;ve saved a shitload of money and torturous trips to the bookstores which usually ends up with me in tears because I can&apos;t get buy the book that I want because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The book&apos;s too expensive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m broke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&apos;M BROKE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;I&apos;M BROKE!!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Take the case of those McSweeney&apos;s anthologies and the Roberto Bolano books that I &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/2680842544/i-now-conclude-that-aldrin-is-my-most-evil-friend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/2680233628/after-months-of-looking-for-a-copy-of-this-at&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about. If I bought those I would probably have to live on Skyflakes and Funchum for two weeks. But miraculously, some kind stranger decided to upload the books online, available for free download.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve also saved up on shelf space. I have this recurring dream that my books (particularly the books on my office cubicle) would bury me alive. I have a shitton of books, actually and my mom hates me for it because the bookshelves occupy a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snooki also gave me the opportunity to give away books. I already gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://awarewolves.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hil&lt;/a&gt; my copy of &lt;em&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/em&gt; and as soon as I get home to Olongapo, I&apos;ll be giving away more books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I have rekindled my love for physical copies of books. The suspect: J.D. Salinger&apos;s &lt;em&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepolysylabbicspree.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bumblebitch.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;peo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skippertheeyechild.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ple&lt;/a&gt; have been telling me to read it because they said not reading the book at my age makes me a lesser human being. You know me, I easily cave in to peer pressure and I gladly took on Salinger&apos;s book. I finished it just a couple hours ago and I can say it was an, for the lack of a better word, awesome reading experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a nut reading my dog-eared copy on the train and clutching it like I&apos;m John Lennon&apos;s assassin or Andrew Cunanan. I voraciously pored over Holden Caulfield&apos;s skewered view of the world; how he dismissed almost everyone as a bunch of phonies. But despite his crumby demeanor, Holden is just like everyone else longs for connection and is goddamn afraid of alienation and its accompanying threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how to folded the book and the pages which lines and passages &amp;quot;killed me&amp;quot; (it was a mass market paperback I got from Booksale for only P40). I actually have a copy of the book on my Nook but I preferred reading the actual copy for the &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot;. For the past three weeks I&apos;ve been wrestling with Roberto Bolano&apos;s &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; on my Nook and I can&apos;t wait to get back to it,especially after watching And Soon the Darkness its missing girls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should alternate reading an eBook and physical copies of books, no? After all, Filipino-penned books are not available on eBooks. Maybe I&apos;ll finally reward myself with a copy of Aldus Santos&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Repeat While Fading&lt;/em&gt; for finishing two books since the new year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some useful links&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aldrin Calimlim&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepolysyllabicspree.com/post/2891242610/prelude-to-a-kindle-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prelude to a Kindle Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carljoe Javier&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/211642/review-the-kindle-vs-the-king&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Kindle vs The King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/geeksturr/IJhhAmWalw30njloPQgaDSDI6KVbPrk4FMxzPzRlm91R7WGHBNRJZrLd8css/DSC00079.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine, you&apos;ll say I&apos;m biased but I really love Status Magazine. It has a kick ass design and the layout&apos;s awesome (and yes my vocabulary right now is an eight year old&apos;s). This month, Olivia Munn is on the cover as well as street artist Invader, which of course became even notorious with Banksy&apos;s Exit Through the Gift Shop, which I think has a huge chance of taking home an Oscar given the Academy&apos;s propensity for awarding innovative and groundbreaking works. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://aldr.in&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, I was wearing a tee (the black one, pictured above) with a game icon, which he first mistook as something from Space Invader, when I got home, I realized that I did have a tee with Space Invaders. These babies only cost P299, mind you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, buy a copy of this month&apos;s Status Magazine. I &amp;quot;reviewed&amp;quot; Matthew Stokoe&apos;s Cows and wrote about Cut Copy for this issue. BUY, BITCHES!</description>

  <title>Frank Herbert, The Dune Cat and the eBook</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/37297.html</link>
  <description>&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/geeksturr/eRj90CuMB66u0MRx9o0EVd9M65to8hvPxcZi59ArXGRfDKyxwYU6aRdczPIM/dunecat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, Jay and I were in a David Lynch frenzy.&lt;em&gt; Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt; was the initial suspect. Then, we spent half the day looking for a DVD of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; in Metrowalk. Of course we didn&apos;t find any. One fortunate day, he found a torrent link of the series, which he immediately downloaded. We watched the first few episodes right away but stopped after Jay had nightmares from watching the show. In the meantime, I was able to download a copy of his adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, which he disowned after the disastrous results. I planned to read the book before finally watching the film but I couldn&apos;t find my copy, which was worn, dusty and very old, kinda like the book you see at the bottom of the bargain bin in NBS Cubao. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found my copy months later but we&apos;ve already moved on from our David Lynch fixation. I also lost interest in reading the book, having amassed newer books that I&apos;ve been dying to read for so long such as Richard Yates&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Revolutionary Road&lt;/em&gt; and [a borrowed copy of] Haruki Murakami&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt;. My copy of &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;of course went to my to-be-read-maybe-in-another-lifetime pile here in my office desk and has been gathering dust since, like everything else in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have an eBook reader, I can read books without worrying about getting asthma or anthrax (those old books must have something lethal in them) and it was just tonight that I realized I should get an eBook of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, which I immediately found, thanks to a mediafire link (ILU Mediafire!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So probably after &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt;, maybe I should take on&lt;em&gt; Dune &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Once and Future King &lt;/em&gt;(read: two of Jessica Zafra&apos;s favorite novels)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should make the Dune Cat happy anyway.</description>

  <title>My Relationship with Jessica Zafra (sort of)</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/36871.html</link>
  <description>&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/geeksturr/w3WCpIkL7jykIfT2cePuHKcEltvNlc1fHa2mqjUZH9hA6Hy76vLGjjGfauGG/photo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Jessica Zafra when I was about to enter college (that was 2004, I think and god, it feels like a long time ago already) and I&apos;ve been reading her work since. She&apos;s the reason why I got into so many things. I had a brief hate phase when she got into blogging and her writing wasn&apos;t as good as it was but hey, until now her love for books/reading/literature is infectious and I still want to be like her (i.e., an award winning writer who lives with three cats and a shitload of books).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got the chance to see her in the flesh last Saturday when our company organized a forum with her as the moderator. It was about favorite books. So of course, I had to think what my favorite book was and the first thing that came into my mind was Neil Gaiman&apos;s The Sandman. I think there was one panelist who picked a Gaiman book as a favorite but I forgot who it was. I&apos;m tempted to say Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell but I still haven&apos;t finished it. Or maybe Rob Sheffield&apos;s Love is a Mixtape. Looking for Alaska? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh shit, I totally forgot The Virgin Suicides. Yeah, maybe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Jessica Zafra, I pulled some strings and I got my picture taken with her. I&apos;m still waiting for it. I&apos;ll post it later. &lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to write about how I &amp;quot;grew up&amp;quot; reading Zafra&apos;s works but I&apos;m too lazy now. Maybe later? Maybe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://katsebastiannn.tumblr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kat&lt;/a&gt; for the Instagram.</description>

  <title>Landlocked Dreams</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/36668.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/geeksturr/yfdeIPLr3Wo8xysH2Ct7MkPQoRgDyG42rvcrePzenVRUIk1UTfAy2x6Lbx7L/TennisEnvelope_0001-e129124143.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick Riley, one half of the band/duo Tennis, wrote the above pictured postcard to his then girlfriend Alaina Moore (vocals) while prepping the sailboat they bought. Riley and Moore will then emabark on a six-month trip into the North Atlantic coast, leaving their landlocked lives behind them into the welcoming promise of the open sea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of sounding trite and bohemian, Riley and Moore&apos;s trip is actually an amazing alternative to the digitally enhanced lives that we currently live. Six months in the ocean isn&apos;t that bad, especially if you&apos;re weary of the batshit crazy life that the cosmos has chosen to give you. At sea, everything else feels distant and the only things that matter are the direction of the wind and the call of the waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tennis could have easily capitalized in a post-rock record that could have captured the complacency and the roar of the ocean. But one night after their trip, inspired by a Shirelees song, the newlyweds decided to write a breezy-indie pop record to recall their adventures. The result is Cape Dory, a record that has endeared Tennis to be everyone&apos;s new favorite band. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just by the song titles &amp;quot;Bimini Bay&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Seafarer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;South Carolina&amp;quot;, the record reads like a port-of-call, an overture into a long cruise into the ocean. At its best, Cape Dory is undeniably a couple&apos;s record: an album with songs that you may want to dance with your boyfriend or sing while lounging beside the sea on a good Sunday afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen : &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.stereogum.com/files/mp3/Tennis%20-%20Marathon.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tennis - Maratahon&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://stereogum.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stereogum&lt;/a&gt;) Image &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourstru.ly/2010/12/02/tennis-video-premiere-pigeon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <title>The Notebook Issue</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/36367.html</link>
  <description>I have six notebooks here with me. My desk is a museum of my failed attempts in reading and writing. I have almost ninety books here. Of course most of them are unread. But that&apos;s another story (and a very long and bloody one). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&apos;s talk about my notebooks. I love notebooks. Apart from books, notebooks are the only ones that can make me go crazy when I&apos;m in a bookstore. Not those batshit expensive Moleskine types, mind you. The most expensive notebook that I probably bought costs around P250 and I can&apos;t remember which one of these notebooks is it. It used to frustrate me that National Book Store (well, at least the one in Olongapo) didn&apos;t carry good notebooks apart from the school/college variants. I wanted a good journal-type notebook to add to my pretentiousness and actually motivate me to write because I believe in this equation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; &quot;&gt;sexy/good quality notebook + nice pen = productivity&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Unfortunately, I am a proof of that equation&apos;s failure. Or maybe it&apos;s just because of the circumstances that have led me to that failure. I shall explain. You see, every since I started working (and getting into functional relationships), I wrote less frequently as I did when I was still studying. Being chained to desks or entering the corporate world have their share of crippling side-effects. Even though all my previous work experiences required me to write, by the end of the day I was too exhausted to actually even write something in my notebook. Factor my &amp;quot;blogging&amp;quot; attempts on Tumblr and other blogging sites and I get zero time at all to sit down and write. My free time is spent reading because I find reading easier than writing. If you have faced a blank notebook or word processor with a looming deadline, you know the pain that I am talking about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, I keep trying to resuscitate my plan to write in my journal. I&apos;ve acquired several notebooks in the process. I&apos;ve written in all of them but I never did continue. Here are some of the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made the mistake of re-reading the entries which of course I dismissed as crap and should be consigned to non-existence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start and break-ups of relationships. Cringe worthy at best. I almost killed myself once after re-reading the shit that I wrote about under this category&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Procrastination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Succumbing to the &amp;quot;New Year&apos;s Resolution&amp;quot; hype, I resolved to write again. This time I bought a new nootebook, a ruled and cheap one that looked decent enough (it actually looks like a Moleskine notebook) and wrote in it a few minutes after my acquisition. A few minutes into it, I found the paper too shaky and fragile and it couldn&apos;t handle the ink of the pen that I bought to go along with it. A few days after my supposed &amp;quot;Project 365&amp;quot;, I conked out because of my new toy, the Nook, which threw me out of the loop again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier I was in Powerbooks and I thought of buying another notebook so I could start over. The recent one had header dates but no entries and it made me sad. But maybe I should continue writing in that one and start acting like a man and not waste more time and money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, it&apos;s a challenge to maintain a blog and an actual journal at the same time. I am really a sadomasochist.</description>

  <title>FaceNook</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/36189.html</link>
  <description>&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;614&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ley2vovZvM1qzq9yqo1_r3_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally! Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of me with my Nook, courtesy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_geeuh&apos; lj:user=&apos;geeuh&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://geeuh.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;geeuh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aldr.in&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; sold me his Nook (at a relatively cheap price) since his uncle [boonmee] got him a Kindle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has changed my life, seriously. I got books that would have cost me thousands of pesos (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/2680842544/i-now-conclude-that-aldrin-is-my-most-evil-friend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksturr.tumblr.com/post/2680233628/after-months-of-looking-for-a-copy-of-this-at&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt;). Mind you, I am finishing them in record time. I already finished Odd and the Frost Giants and would have reached 200+ pages in 2666 if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for my 14-day trials of New York Times and The New Yorker, many thanks to Aldrin (yeah I was that idiot who was reading NYT on the train to work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember vehemently striking down Kindle when it came out and I swore I would always be a lover of books. And I still am. My desk is still a tough testament to that. I think I have hundred books and magazines here and I plan to read them. But eBooks easily give me access to books I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have access too (because I refuse to buy them) such as Stieg Larsson&amp;rsquo;s Millenium Trilogy or Michael Chabon&amp;rsquo;s McSweeney&amp;rsquo;s anthologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve almost filled up the 2GB space. That&amp;rsquo;s how much books I have crammed in there.&amp;nbsp;</description>

  <title>Steadier Dreaming </title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/35902.html</link>
  <description>I&apos;ve forgotten how beautiful Death Cab for Cutie&apos;s &apos;Steadier Footing&apos; is. And it&apos;s amazing how I rediscovered the song right at this moment, where my perception of everything is possibly changing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up watching too many movies, I had this notion of a grand romantic life: late nights at parks, reading books while laying side by side on the bed, waking up tangled in each other&apos;s arms. To some extent, I did or I have that and I consider myself lucky for that. There are a lot of people out there who cry themselves to sleep because their fear of being alone gnaws them slowly every night they spend on a loverless bed. But I remember something Jay said: it&apos;s better to cry yourself to sleep alone than cry yourself to sleep while your back is turned on your lover who&apos;s just sleeping soundly on the other side of the bed. It&apos;s the infinite chasm that I dread every now and then.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;</description>

  <title>Albums : 2010</title>
  <link>http://chinoisdead.livejournal.com/35721.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvdvdcyzx1qzq9yqo1_500.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two towering figures loom over the music scene this year: Kanye West and Robyn. Future pop music queen, Lady Gaga was pretty much content working on her forthcoming album&lt;em&gt; Born This Way &lt;/em&gt;while appearing and receiving accolades in music award shows and putting out impressive music videos that continues to be imitated by other musicians. But for this year, Kanye West yet again seized our attentions by releasing a record that is far beyond anyone&apos;s expectations. At the same time Robyn has pushed her three-part outing to create a buzz that has only served to raise the bar that she herself has set from one EP to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are far more important discoveries that 2010 has cruelly overlooked, including what I picked as album of the year. Eliminating the risk of sounding generic or overly pretentious, the albums I included in this list are the ones that have served as overtures and bookends to a fascinating year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvbatKsrM1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Major Lazer + La Roux - Lazerproof&lt;br /&gt;Diplo and Switch of course have been known to turn pretty much anything they touch into gold and &lt;em&gt;Lazerproof&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. Potentially lackluster Euro-dancehall tracks are now brimming with syrupy goodness thanks to the samples and beats thrown in by the duo. Tracks seamlessly flow into each other making &lt;em&gt;Lazerproof &lt;/em&gt; a perfect mixtape of 80s and Jamaican flavor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvbfzI9k61qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The National - High Violet&lt;br /&gt;Warm fuzzy guitars interlace the album&amp;rsquo;s opening track &amp;lsquo;Terrible Love&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather sinister song that runs with even more sinister images of spiders, depression and more woes, setting the template for the rest of the album. Matt Berninger sounds like every arthouse kid&amp;rsquo;s older yet wiser brother who has had his fair share of heartbreak, affairs and broken/beat-up days spent nursing with a bottle of vodka or any preferred alcoholic beverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvbhmyVbY1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Sufjan Stevens - The Age of Adz&lt;br /&gt;The old Sufjan Stevens we know opens&lt;em&gt; The Age of Adz &lt;/em&gt;with &amp;lsquo;Futile Devices&amp;rsquo;, operating on guitars that could be mistaken for a music box tinkling you away to sleep. But Stevens drops the auto-tuned bomb with the next song &amp;lsquo;Too Much&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s his way of telling us that he&amp;rsquo;s grown up but still haunted with the ghosts of his past: lovelorn explorations, bravura choirs, impressive instrumentation and brave forays into the unknown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvbu2B1Lw1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The Black Keys - Brothers&lt;br /&gt;Snazzy riffs, slick choruses and stories which could potentially be about barnyard sex, The Black Keys&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt; Brothers&lt;/em&gt; is a record hardwired with traditional blues and a good &amp;lsquo;ol shot of whiskey. Tracks like &amp;lsquo;Black Mud&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Howlin&amp;rsquo; For You&amp;rsquo; only serve to strengthen the album&amp;rsquo;s grip on the material they have always been good at: an impeccable throw back to a straightforward record of blues, dejection and serenading. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvbvyh8qI1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Youth Pictures of Florence Henderson - s/t&lt;br /&gt;Even the sub-genre itself is tired and done but in their self-titled album, Youth Pictures of Florence Henderson manages to resuscitate the beaten-down music tropes. The album launches an assault of atmospheric wonders through intricate arrangement, echoic vocals and jangling guitars rivaling those of Sigur Ros and Explosions in the Sky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvdjwlyoY1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;br /&gt;What is left to be said of&lt;em&gt; My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;? Kanye West continues to defy expectations (particularly with the apologia of &amp;lsquo;Runaway&amp;rsquo;) and he&amp;rsquo;s armed with a battering ram this time and accompanied by an array of the best musicians and artists that he could arrange. Whoever thought Bon Iver would appear alongside hip-hop heavy weights such as Nicki Minaj (in a scene stealing bit in &apos;Monster&apos;) &amp;nbsp;and Jay-Z and still create eerie atmospherics with their signature stripped down template? As always, this album is built on West&amp;rsquo;s continually erect dick, only this time it&amp;rsquo;s more grandiose and slightly, dare I say it, emotional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldve0yBLuR1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sleepwalk Circus - Great Secret Show&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty uncanny for Sleepwalk Circus to open their debut album with Bahasa. If it&amp;rsquo;s a message about the diversity of their soundscape, Sleepwalk Circus has got it right. &lt;em&gt;Great Secret Show&lt;/em&gt; is rife with melee of guitars tinkling and jangling away to reveal the eccentric personalities that inhabit the world of &lt;em&gt;Great Secret Show&lt;/em&gt;. From the math-rock stop-start of &amp;lsquo;Sideshow&amp;rsquo;, the sci-fi dynamics of &amp;lsquo;Flies are Falling&amp;rsquo; to the sensuous finale of &amp;lsquo;Farmers After Party&amp;rsquo;, Sleepwalk Circus&amp;rsquo;s debut record is a stunning promise of better things to come from such a young band.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;173&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldve6vp5e41qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Robyn - Body Talk&lt;br /&gt;The exclusion of fan favorites such as &amp;lsquo;Include Me Out&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Cry When You Get Older&amp;rsquo; may have marred the consistency of &lt;em&gt;Body Talk &lt;/em&gt;to a number listeners but nevertheless, the record is an amazing display of Robyn&amp;rsquo;s antithesis to everything that passes itself as squeaky, electro-dance pop. The entire catalogue of the three EPs is definitely rich with potential triple-platinum singles (such as the newly released &amp;lsquo;Call Your Girlfriend&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;None of Dem&amp;rsquo;). Despite the generic lyrics, &lt;em&gt;Body Talk &lt;/em&gt;is an amazing pop record that will never wear down after repeated listening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldvecf602P1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Olafur Arnalds - ...and they have escaped the weight of darkness&lt;br /&gt;Is it the Icelandic dreamscape the fuel that gives artists such as Olafur Arnalds the capacity to put out record after record of such grand and brilliant proportions? Just like what the title and the album art depicts, the album is a tenuous tread into the borders of light and dark; a struggle that Arnalds perfectly captures in each of the nine instrumental tracks that run the album&amp;rsquo;s blood. With such quality present in this neo-classical work, it&amp;rsquo;s baffling that many music critics have overlooked Arnald&amp;rsquo;s 2010 record. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldved0yuyF1qzq9yqo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shearwater - The Golden Archipelago&lt;br /&gt;Apart from Sufjan Stevens, Shearwater may be the only reason why concept albums still exist in the digital music arena. Accompanied by a gorgeous fifty-page booklet of photographs and documents obtained by Jonathan Meiburg in his trips to places such as Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and Galapagos, &lt;em&gt;The Golden Archipelago&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect finale for the band&amp;rsquo;s The Island Arc trilogy (the other two are Palo Santo and Rook). Filled with sprawling imageries of islands, exotic animals, dreamscapes, prows and maps, &lt;em&gt;The Golden Archipelago&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning work that transcends the boundaries of narrative and musical arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>
