Why invest that much money when you can pick up perfectly serviceable Windows laptops for a third of the price?<br /><br />Here are my top 3 reasons:<br /><br />#1 Ease of use--- fast booting, effortless backups with Time Machine, OS X Lion, the great software--- I can go on and on, but the bottom line is there's no easier machine to use than the Air.<br /><br />#2 Reliability--- What's the number one reason most laptops fail? The hard drive.  Solid state drives on the Air means no moving parts except the fan. The aluminum case construction makes it not indestructible, but certainly rugged for teen use.  And the fact still remains that Apple machines are far less prone to virus, malware, and system crashes than their PC counterparts.<br /><br />#3 Integration with our main home computer--- Our main computer is an iMac (which I've also reviewed on Amazon). Having the Airs means that my kids can listen to music and watch movies stored on my iMac via home sharing. Sharing files is a breeze using airdrop. Wireless printing is a breeze too.  They can even do automatic backups to my iMac using time machine. And as long as I keep all the computers on the same iTunes account, apps like Pages & Keynote that I buy from the App Store can be downloaded and used with all the computers in my house.<br /><br />So I paid more money than I would have for an Asus or Toshiba? Yes, that's true, but the power & versatility that my kids now have is more than worth it.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B005CWHZP4&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx3A2PIC6A1WFVV&amp;reviewID=R1IQTLYDJHJEJ9&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Writer for iPad keyboard (ipad 1 keyboard) + Case (Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard, Quick Eject and Easy Angle for your iPad)</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1309046020-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B004OQLSLG</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004OQLSLG&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx1Z2EEJDUS6B71&amp;reviewID=R2NQXRK864FG3F&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2011 23:53:40 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writer-keyboard-Aluminum-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B004OQLSLG">Writer for iPad keyboard (ipad 1 keyboard) + Case (Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard, Quick Eject and Easy Angle for your iPad)</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Adonit</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writer-keyboard-Aluminum-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B004OQLSLG" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KN-dERtzL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2NQXRK864FG3F"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        16 of 16 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Exceeded My Expectations</b>, <nobr>June 25, 2011</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writer-keyboard-Aluminum-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B004OQLSLG">Writer for iPad keyboard (ipad 1 keyboard) + Case (Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard, Quick Eject and Easy Angle for your iPad) (Electronics)</a></b>      </div>I've been waiting for over a year to get a keyboard for my iPad. I've written tens of thousands of words on it--- using Pages, iA Writer, and other apps.  I've become facile with the touchscreen keyboard, but I've wanted something better.<br /><br />Now I've found it. This keyboard case is close to perfect.<br /><br />The keyboard itself is high quality, with good solid keys and a brushed metal exterior. There are a full set of function keys, including one touch access to search, the home button, the onscreen keyboard, photos, and music controls.  There's a button in the top right hand corner of the keyboard that instantly turns the screen on or off-- handy for too nosy eyes. There are also standard 4-directional keys-- a godsend.  The keys are by necessity small to fit the dimensions of the iPad, but I've adapted to them easily (I'm, naturally, typing this review with them.) My only quibble is that the right shift key is too small, and I would have preferred the directional keys on the top of the keyboard rather than the bottom.<br /><br />The case is very cleverly engineered.  The part of the case that folds back under to brace the keyboard is magnetized, so that you can easily adjust the tilt of the iPad in relation to the keyboard through a wide range of angles.  It's hard to describe, but it works beautifully. The iPad itself is held in place simply but securely by a single pop latch at the top. Popping it in and out of the case takes only a second. The case closes with an elastic strap, again quickly  but securely.<br /><br />I'm impressed more every day by this keyboard case. If you use your iPad as a word processor it is a must buy.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004OQLSLG&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx1Z2EEJDUS6B71&amp;reviewID=R2NQXRK864FG3F&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: The Practice Test</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1306330392-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-160910613X</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=160910613X&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1K15Z6ULN0CI9&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 13:33:12 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Test-Edwin-Leap/dp/160910613X">The Practice Test</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Edwin Leap</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Test-Edwin-Leap/dp/160910613X" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511D7XFBuoL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R1K15Z6ULN0CI9"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Every Medical Student ( & Physician) Should Read This</b>, <nobr>May 25, 2011</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Test-Edwin-Leap/dp/160910613X">The Practice Test (Paperback)</a></b>      </div>I love teaching medical students. Not to try and cram more facts about dengue fever into their heads, but instead to pass along wisdom: that rare and subtle knowledge about the art of medicine and the art of life that you can't learn in a lecture hall.<br /><br />This book, written by a seasoned Emergency Medicine physician who also loves to teach, is now required reading for all my medical students. Its pages eloquently detail so much of what I try to communicate as well, that life is more than medicine, that patients are worth caring for, and that medicine, despite its hassles and challenges, is still a wondrous and worthwhile profession.<br /><br />If you are entering medicine, are in medicine, or know someone who is, I can't think of a better introduction (or refresher course) to a healthy perspective on the joys and challenges of a physician. Highly recommended.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=160910613X&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1K15Z6ULN0CI9&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 4 stars to: Max On Life</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1303127854-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-0849948126</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0849948126&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2WPGD0R59MX6J&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2011 11:57:34 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Max-Life-Insights-Important-Questions/dp/0849948126">Max On Life: Answers and Insights to Your Most Important Questions</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Max Lucado</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Max-Life-Insights-Important-Questions/dp/0849948126" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mGIHkK5RL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2WPGD0R59MX6J"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        0 of 1 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-4-0._V192240704_.gif" width="64" alt="4.0 out of 5 stars" title="4.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Wise Counsel on Practical Life Matters</b>, <nobr>April 18, 2011</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Max-Life-Insights-Important-Questions/dp/0849948126">Max On Life: Answers and Insights to Your Most Important Questions (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>Perspective. Wisdom. Guidance. They're always welcome, and often sorely needed, in each of our lives.<br /><br />And that's exactly what Pastor Max Lucado delivers in his new book Max on Life-- godly pastoral wisdom and counsel on 170 different topics. Questions that he has been asked over his decades of ministry, ranging from "How can I be sure of my salvation?" to "How can my husband and I agree on spending?"<br /><br />The questions are grouped under seven topics: hope, hurt, help, him/her, home, haves/have-nots, and hereafter. Each question is succinctly answered in Lucado's trademark straightforward style in a page or two. At the back of the book is a short addendum with some of his advice to aspiring writers as well.<br /><br />What shines through each page is how pastoral these answers are. They are not the discourses of one theologian to another, nor are they simply feel-good self-help mantras. They are ordinary answers targeted to ordinary people, gentle, kind, soaked in Biblical wisdom, always looking to God's love & grace. Even though you probably will think, "Yes, I knew that..." at each answer, Lucado's way with words will cause you to pause, reflect, and see the truth just a bit more clearly.<br /><br />I can see this book being used as a devotional, as a gift to a young believer, and as a resource when you need a starting point for counseling or encouraging a friend on a difficult issue. A fine addition to any Christian's library.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0849948126&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2WPGD0R59MX6J&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 4 stars to: Food Rules</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1296945133-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-014311638X</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=014311638X&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2R6GW51KJ1N2S&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Sat, 5 Feb 2011 22:32:13 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X">Food Rules: An Eater's Manual</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Michael Pollan</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414UgY9NlsL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2R6GW51KJ1N2S"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        0 of 1 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-4-0._V192240704_.gif" width="64" alt="4.0 out of 5 stars" title="4.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Refreshingly Simple Approach on What to Eat</b>, <nobr>February 5, 2011</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X">Food Rules: An Eater's Manual (Paperback)</a></b>      </div>If you scan the stacks of your local bookstore, you'll find hundreds of diet & nutrition books, each one written by an "expert" who spouts scientific research to assure you that his book contains the secret to good nutrition. <br /><br />Although there is a lot of good material out there, they all suffer from two shortcomings: 1) Tunnel vision-- where the author can't see or glosses over other research or perspectives and 2) Lack of Humility-- in not acknowledging how little we really do understand about the human body. <br /><br />Enter Michael Pollan, journalist. Not diet guru, not scientist, not supplement huckster, just a journalist. After extensive research (see his other books), he correctly concludes that nutrition science IS in its infancy, & that we DON'T have all the answers. But we do know one thing: the modern American diet kills people. That fact everyone agrees on. And so he makes a modest proposal:<br /><br />Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much. <br /><br />Food Rules is a simple & playful expansion of those three basic principles to 64 rules, such as:<br /><br />#20-- it's not food if it arrived through the window of your car. <br />#36-- Don't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk. <br />#57-- Don't get your fuel from the same place your car does. <br /><br />Pollan is actually not giving rules as much as giving a paradigm, a way of looking at food and nutrition that tries to be simple and yet true. He invites us to think about food differently, what it is (and it is not) and what place it should have in our lives. <br /><br />To accomplish this task does not require a lot of prose: the entire book has less than a hundred paragraphs, which really should qualify as a booklet. However, the economics of publishing do not put booklets on best seller lists, and so the book is padded with whitespace and illustrations to make it run over 100 pages. As long as you realize you're paying full book price for a mini book content, I think you will enjoy the wisdom of Food Rules.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=014311638X&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2R6GW51KJ1N2S&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: The 4-Hour Body</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1295413025-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B003EI2EH2</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B003EI2EH2&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3LMM5K3XIZ0CC&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2011 04:57:05 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2">The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Timothy Ferriss</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OSuh5vFDL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R3LMM5K3XIZ0CC"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Most Fun I've Ever Had Reading a Health Book</b>, <nobr>January 18, 2011</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2">The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman (Kindle Edition)</a></b>      </div>I'd never read a health book which starts out by describing being backstage at a NIN concert.<br /><br />I knew I was in for a wild ride.<br /><br />In the 4-Hour Body, Tim Ferriss chronicles his eclectic experiences at hacking his body: weight loss & muscle gain, perfect abs and perfect baseball swing, tripling his testosterone, holding his breath for three minutes, & more.<br /><br />As a family physician, I can tell you that most of his material is not that revolutionary: his diet is just a simple variant of a low glycemic load diet, and many trainers will tell you that kettle bells rock as an exercise. But Tim is a showman at heart, as well as probably being just a little bit crazy, and this book reflects his devil-may-care take-life-by-the-throat until it screams for mercy approach to living.  The book is intentionally designed to give you a potpouri of ideas and projects to pick from, and he encourages you to find something that you want to change about your body and go for it.<br /><br />Even if you don't implement a single thing in this book, you'll have a barrel of fun reading it.  And most everyone will find at least one chapter that they will find intruiging enough to implement his concepts to try on their own. He's motivated me to get back to my ideal weight, and I'm already half way there by implementing some of his regimen. Best health book of the year.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B003EI2EH2&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3LMM5K3XIZ0CC&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: A Memory of Wind</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1278083028-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B003OYIA74</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B003OYIA74&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1RHJBC188Q3OD&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Fri, 2 Jul 2010 15:03:48 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Wind-Tor-Com-Original-ebook/dp/B003OYIA74">A Memory of Wind: A Tor.Com Original</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Rachel Swirsky</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Wind-Tor-Com-Original-ebook/dp/B003OYIA74" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E47snzwWL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R1RHJBC188Q3OD"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Hauntingly Beautiful Tale of Betrayal & Loss</b>, <nobr>July 2, 2010</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Wind-Tor-Com-Original-ebook/dp/B003OYIA74">A Memory of Wind: A Tor.Com Original (Kindle Edition)</a></b>      </div>A new fantasy drawn from a liitle known Greek myth, this short story hauntingly recounts the life of a young woman before she is sacrificed to a god.

Willie Aames and company did a great job in whipping up a series of funny DVDs that taught some practical Biblical wisdom with enough chuckles to "make the medicine go down" easily. We bought the DVDs, watched them over and over, bought the costume, even went to a live stage show.<br /><br />So even though my kids are older now, I still have a soft spot in my heart for the Bibleman character. Consequently, I got a review copy of one of the newer episodes, Combating the Commandment of Confusion, and watched it with my eleven year old son.<br /><br />I could not have been more disappointed.<br /><br />First, it was a poorly-done recording of a live stage show in a church. Lighting, audio, costumes, & cinematography were all sub-standard, bordering on amateur. Second, the story itself was banal: no plot, no intelligence, and none of the old wit & charm of the old series. Within a few minutes my son was pleading to watch something else, and I had to force myself to finish out the DVD. My recommendation: find one of the old series instead.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400316111&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1DDE8J18WZ96Q&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 3 stars to: This is Your Brain in Love</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1267672328-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-0785228756</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0785228756&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3G8C9H1Z18HSP&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Thu, 4 Mar 2010 03:12:08 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Love-Breakthroughs/dp/0785228756">This is Your Brain in Love: New Scientific Breakthroughs for a More Passionate and Emotionally Healthy Marriage</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Earl R.

I was expecting this new book to be a helpful exploration of the physiology and biochemistry of love.<br /><br />However, this book really isn't much about the biochemistry of love at all, but is instead an uneven and disappointing mashup of various topics, some helpful, some confusing. There is a short first chapter which serves as a warm introduction to the concept of romantic love and its biochemistry.  Next is a chapter on sexuality and spirituality, which was a nice read but has really no connection to the rest of the book.<br /><br />Suddenly, he launches into the main part of the book- talking about the five "love styles" which are trumpeted on the book's cover but are really just a thinly retooled rehash of his first book-- describing five basic types of brain pathology.  I was frankly confused-- "wait, this is just talking about pathology, this isn't about love at all"  "what if my spouse and I don't have any biochemical pathology, do I just skip the next 130 pages?" "where does personality style end and pathology begin?" "Is he implying that most people have deficient biochemistry that needs treating?"<br /><br />He ends the book with another unrelated chapter titled "The Secret to Lasting Love" (short version: be kind, patient, honest, & forgiving), and then appendixes on brain-healthy eating, sexual addiction, brain scans, and hormone therapy for women.<br /><br />Overall, the book has some helpful new information, but fell far short of my expectations.  Read his first book instead.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0785228756&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3G8C9H1Z18HSP&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: How People Change</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1265224888-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-1934885533</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1934885533&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1ZKEAY0RCUAZ8&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Wed, 3 Feb 2010 19:21:28 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-People-Change-Timothy-Lane/dp/1934885533">How People Change</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Timothy S.

We often struggle and fail at the same sins, have the same divorce rates, and generally don't stand out as being more kind or loving than devoted moral adherants of other religions--- despite our theology that we have been "born again." Ask many, including pastors, the question, and the reply often comes down to some variant of "they aren't trying hard enough" or "they aren't really saved after all."<br /><br />But the question behind the question is "So, how do people really change--- how does a person who has become a child of God actually become radically more loving, more peaceful, more self-controlled, in a way that isn't mere psychology and that can't be explained or experienced by a non-Christian?"<br /><br />Few people can give a robust, Biblical, detailed explanation to this fundamental question. Timothy Lane & Paul Tripp can, and do, in this wonderful book.  They give us a truly Biblical & congruent theology of how people change, and show us a path to meaningful personal change in our own lives.<br /><br />The first five chapters lay a foundation for what real Biblical life change is and isn't-- they talk about how easy it is to substitute external change like formalism and activism for true change of the heart.  They lay out the crucial understanding of our marriage to Christ, and how God designed real change to take place in the context of community.  There is a lot of rich thought provoking truth on every page of these foundation chapters.<br /><br />Next, they move onto their central Biblical picture of how God has designed change: that of the tree.  They explain chapter by chapter that the "heat" of living in a fallen world brings out fallen human responses of sin and evil "thorns."  But as we turn to the cross of Christ and His presence we gain the ability to bear beautiful fruit, new supernatural responses to the same "heat" that before would only produce thorns.<br /><br />True "fruit" only comes from the nourishment that God provides, and we need to be able to recognize the thorns and the fallen nature behind them to be able to choose Christ instead.  This book is a wonderful Biblical mirror to hold in front of your soul, to be able to see yourself, the good and the bad, and see the work of God within.  Highly recommended.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1934885533&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1ZKEAY0RCUAZ8&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: The Spark</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1262085594-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-1401926452</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1401926452&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx39INQUD0VP59K&amp;reviewID=R379CATGHEVKXJ&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2009 11:19:54 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spark-28-Day-Breakthrough-Getting-Transforming/dp/1401926452">The Spark: The 28-Day Breakthrough Plan for Losing Weight, Getting Fit, and Transforming Your Life</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Chris Downie</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spark-28-Day-Breakthrough-Getting-Transforming/dp/1401926452" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VBxZZcwBL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R379CATGHEVKXJ"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        283 of 340 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Much more than just another diet book!</b>, <nobr>December 29, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spark-28-Day-Breakthrough-Getting-Transforming/dp/1401926452">The Spark: The 28-Day Breakthrough Plan for Losing Weight, Getting Fit, and Transforming Your Life (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>True or false: People fail to lose weight and keep it off because they don't realize they need to eat healthy food and exercise.<br /><br />We know that isn't true-- everyone knows about healthy food and exercise. But isn't that the message of most "diet" books?  Once you find the right magic foods and the right magic exercise, once you have that secret knowledge not found in any other diet book, then YOU will lose that weight!<br /><br />If we are willing to be honest, the real reason we are not losing weight is US--- we end up choosing to eat that dessert, to sleep in instead of pounding the pavement, to say to ourselves "this is never going to work."<br /><br />And that's where The Spark starts: with how we view and live our life and how we can make sustainable positive change.  In fact, it doesn't even start talking about what foods to eat until page 84.<br /><br />Where it starts is with four "cornerstones" of positive living: focus, fitness, fire, and positive force.  The author takes a chapter on each of these concepts and lays out how they apply to life in general and a life shift like weight loss in particular.<br /><br />So, does this work? Does the effort to really understand the principles of positive change make a difference?  Well, this book is really just the distillation of a website & online community, [...], which has helped tens of thousands of people make meaningful change.  In fact, the center of the book contains short bios and color photos of seventeen people, real people, real people who you can actually contact through the sparkpeople online community, who have used the principles to lose big weight (most of them 100+ pounds) and keep it off and really change their lives.<br /><br />Yes, the healthy diet and exercise tips are in there, just like in every diet book.  But what makes this book different, and special, is that the focus isn't the food, but you: a practical plan to change your outlook and jump-start your motivation so that you can practice a healthy lifestyle and change your life. A very good way to start out the new year, or any time you decide to change for the better.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1401926452&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx39INQUD0VP59K&amp;reviewID=R379CATGHEVKXJ&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Love and War</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1262054640-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-0385529805</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0385529805&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3A6TXYGP7Q3MZ&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2009 02:44:00 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-War-Finding-Marriage-Dreamed/dp/0385529805">Love and War: Finding the Marriage You've Dreamed Of</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by John Eldredge</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-War-Finding-Marriage-Dreamed/dp/0385529805" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iT6176h1L._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R3A6TXYGP7Q3MZ"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        36 of 39 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>The Most Honest Book on Marriage I Have Read</b>, <nobr>December 28, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-War-Finding-Marriage-Dreamed/dp/0385529805">Love and War: Finding the Marriage You've Dreamed Of (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>This is the most honest book on marriage that I've ever read, and the one that has the most promise to be truly helpful.<br /><br />I've read marriage books that basically say follow these principles, or just learn these handy techniques, and all your troubles will melt away. And I've read other well-meaning books that are some variation of a Bible lesson: here's what God intends for you to be as a godly husband and wife, so just obey all these verses to guarantee you a picture-perfect relationship.<br /><br />John & Stasi Eldredge take a different approach: that marriage is hard, and that it is hard because of our own sin & brokenness, and that no principle, technique, or even Bible verse will magically fix the mess that is our souls. Eldredge writes, "So long as we choose to turn a blind eye to how we are fallen as men or women, and to the unique style of relating we have forged out of our sin and brokenness, we will continue to do damage to our marriages."<br /><br />What is the solution? It is first to realize the nature of the battle and the nature of what marriage can be, then to let God use the crucible of marriage to change you, transform you into the holy man or woman that He has intended you to be, while battling against the Enemy. Eldredge summarizes it thusly:<br /><br />1. Find life in God.<br />2. Deal with your brokenness.<br />3. Learn to shut down the spiritual attacks that come against your marriage.<br /><br />Love & War contains a lot of Biblical wisdom, a lot of honest, hard, and humorous stories, and a lot of very blunt tell-it-like-it-is in-your-face challenges. It's unlike any other book on marriage I've come across, that lays out the true nature of the soul ugliness behind marital dysfunction, and shows a path to growth and healing.  You need this book: for you, for your spouse, for your friends.  Get it, read it, and have the courage to move forward with your marriage and your life.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0385529805&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3A6TXYGP7Q3MZ&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 4 stars to: HoMedics WFL-ROCK EnviraScape Illuminated Rock Garden Relaxation Fountain</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1260220641-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B0000AKN9T</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0000AKN9T&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2DSZW4LYW4VY5&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Mon, 7 Dec 2009 21:17:21 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-WFL-ROCK-EnviraScape-Illuminated-Relaxation/dp/B0000AKN9T">HoMedics WFL-ROCK EnviraScape Illuminated Rock Garden Relaxation Fountain</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by HoMedics</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-WFL-ROCK-EnviraScape-Illuminated-Relaxation/dp/B0000AKN9T" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5130CT4DEWL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2DSZW4LYW4VY5"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-4-0._V192240704_.gif" width="64" alt="4.0 out of 5 stars" title="4.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Good for the price, very satisfied a year later</b>, <nobr>December 7, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-WFL-ROCK-EnviraScape-Illuminated-Relaxation/dp/B0000AKN9T">HoMedics WFL-ROCK EnviraScape Illuminated Rock Garden Relaxation Fountain (Health and Beauty)</a></b>      </div>I've had this fountain for almost a year on a bookshelf in my office, so it's been running 40 hours a week consistently without a hitch. Yes, there is a little motor noise, but if you try some of the tips & tricks in the other reviews (don't use the suction cups, keep the water full, etc.) it's not very noticeable.  The water sound really is quite lovely.  And the reviewers are right, it has an "ugly" side and is really designed to be in a bookcase and not in a 360 degree view on a desk or table.  Since the water in our area is quite hard (mineralized), I refill it with grocery store jugs of distilled water, and have not had to clean it at all since I purchased it.<br /><br />Overall, it's really been great and I've had a lot of positive comments.  I would certainly buy another one and think my money was well spent.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0000AKN9T&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2DSZW4LYW4VY5&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Monster A IPH CHG CASE Leather Charging Case for iPhone</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1259608190-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B00277C9JY</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00277C9JY&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2QEBS8T9X2M14&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2009 19:09:50 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-IPH-CHG-CASE-Charging/dp/B00277C9JY">Monster A IPH CHG CASE Leather Charging Case for iPhone</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Monster Cable Products, Inc.</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-IPH-CHG-CASE-Charging/dp/B00277C9JY" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Lw%2BWTwH2L._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2QEBS8T9X2M14"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Is a Must-Have if You're Traveling or Using Internet Heavily</b>, <nobr>November 30, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-IPH-CHG-CASE-Charging/dp/B00277C9JY">Monster A IPH CHG CASE Leather Charging Case for iPhone (Wireless Phone Accessory)</a></b>      </div>Yes, I'm constantly using my iPhone, but usually I can last the day without recharging.<br /><br />But.... if I'm traveling or vacationing and using the GPS and internet away from any chance to recharge (like my recent trips to DC and Disney World), taking tons of photos and uploading them to Facebook on the fly, there's no way my iPhone will last a full day.<br /><br />So... enter this great case.

On the whole, it's an enjoyable jaunt, but after a while it seems like you keep going around in the same circle, and you may end up growing a little tired of it.<br /><br />Strangely enough, that describes my experience of reading Nate Wilson's new book Notes From the Tilt-a-Whirl. Although his analogy is supposed to refer to our life on this world (and it does), it also describes his writing. His prose sometimes made me smile, sometimes made me think, but other times just made me tired.<br /><br />In a dozen chapters, essays really, he explores the strange and wonderful nature of life, in all its simplicity and complexity, and the nature of how it helps us to relate to God and to ourselves. He wants us to revel in the "wide-eyed wonder of God's spoken world," and to an extent he succeeds, while musing on philosophers and kittens, Socrates and snowflakes.<br /><br />There are sparks of true beauty scattered in the book, such as:<br /><br />    If I were infinite, I could read and love each (snowflake as a haiku). I could remember the dance of each flake since the world was born.<br /><br />    Faith is hard... but faith brings with it the only possibility of peace and joy in this world-- the only possibility of laughter on this mad, mad ride.<br /><br />    Logic cannot give you goodness, just validity.<br /><br />    Why do we so often ignore the beautiful in exchange for the cute?<br /><br />    -and-<br /><br />    Do not resent your place in the story. Do not imagine yourself elsewhere. Do not close your eyes and picture a world without thorns, without shadows, without hawks. Change this world. Use your body like a tool meant to be used up, discarded, and replaced. Better every life you touch. We will reach the final chapter. When we have eyes that can stare into the sun, eyes that only squint for the Shekinah, then we will see laughing children pulling cobras by their tails, and hawks and rabbits playing tag.<br /><br />There is treasure to be found in this book, but you have to also wade through pages that are far less inspired as well. Overall an interesting read.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0849920078&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3RCBWG64TWQNW&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Apple iMac MC413LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1257276163-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-B002C74GOK</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002C74GOK&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx2H0BLP5LU8IHR&amp;reviewID=R3LTDVTGSEZKZK&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Tue, 3 Nov 2009 19:22:43 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iMac-MC413LL-21-5-Inch-Desktop/dp/B002C74GOK">Apple iMac MC413LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Apple</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iMac-MC413LL-21-5-Inch-Desktop/dp/B002C74GOK" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NTb0MCcWL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R3LTDVTGSEZKZK"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        56 of 57 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Five Reasons to Buy This Computer</b>, <nobr>November 3, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iMac-MC413LL-21-5-Inch-Desktop/dp/B002C74GOK">Apple iMac MC413LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop (Personal Computers)</a></b>      </div>You can read elsewhere for tech specs or geek rantings, but here's my "I've got it set up as my family computer" five point review:<br /><br />FAST: this computer screams, doing about anything you need it to without annoying pauses.<br /><br />STYLE: yes, it does look like a fashion statement.  And lest you say, "I just care about how it performs"-- you probably have other possessions that you admire their beauty--- some of your clothes, furniture, perhaps your car--- why shouldn't you be able to admire your computer as well?  Apple says "YES YOU CAN!"<br /><br />SILENT: its internal fans and hard drive are so well designed that it's very hard to hear any noise.  I didn't expect that to be a big deal but I can really notice the difference between my old computer's noise level and my new iMac.<br /><br />THE SCREEN: yes, it's a thing of beauty, bright, crisp, big, in full HD resolution that you can use to do any type of computing or watch a movie in complete comfort.<br /><br />THE OS: Snow Leopard rocks.  It's the best personal computer operating system on the planet, period.<br /><br />All the tech magazines have raved about this computer, and sitting in front of it on my desk I now know why.  If you need a new computer I guarantee you will fall in love with it.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002C74GOK&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx2H0BLP5LU8IHR&amp;reviewID=R3LTDVTGSEZKZK&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Born to Run</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1257275364-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-0307266303</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0307266303&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1O38U69INNFNT&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Tue, 3 Nov 2009 19:09:24 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303">Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Christopher McDougall</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fpSM7oO2L._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R1O38U69INNFNT"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>A Wild Rollercoaster Ride of a Book!</b>, <nobr>November 3, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303">Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>In Born to Run, Christopher McDougall spins a wildly careening tale of colorful personas, from hidden tribes to research scientists, penniless college coeds to bizarre millionaires, shameless promoters to reclusive loners. From the plains of Africa to the mountains of Colorado, from Death Valley to the Sierra Madre, he weaves one common thread that binds them all: the love of running.<br /><br />McDougall, an editor for the magazine Men's Health, had to stop his recreational running due to foot pain. That pain triggered a bizarre cascade of events that culminated in a secret grueling ultra-marathon in the remote mountains of Mexico that included some of the best runners on the planet. Born to Run is his travelogue of those events.<br /><br />Each chapter whips and turns like an out of control roller-coaster carrying you on a wild ride where you never know what's around the next bend. Along the way, McDougall explores the body and soul of the runner, visiting bio-mechanics, evolutionary anthropology, philosophy, nutrition, and more. <br /><br />I tremendously enjoyed this book on several levels. One, the story itself was a trip, living through all the people and places that culminated in this amazing race. Second, the dips into science were fascinating to me: how uniquely engineered the human body is to run down to the placement of specific ligaments. But most intriguing was the explorations on the spiritual aspect of running, how nourishing running is to the human spirit and how closely tied it can be to our capacity to love.<br /><br />Born to Run is fascinating reading for anyone with a taste for adventure and a love of running. I had a blast reading it.<br />      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0307266303&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R1O38U69INNFNT&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 5 stars to: Find Your Strongest Life</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1254738122-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-1400202361</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400202361&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2WNAZS6AJC7LO&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Mon, 5 Oct 2009 10:22:02 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Find-Your-Strongest-Life-Differently/dp/1400202361">Find Your Strongest Life: What the Happiest and Most Successful Women Do Differently</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Marcus Buckingham</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Find-Your-Strongest-Life-Differently/dp/1400202361" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pVEmiUZEL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R2WNAZS6AJC7LO"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        5 of 6 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-5-0._V192240867_.gif" width="64" alt="5.0 out of 5 stars" title="5.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>A Path out of the Jungle of 21st Century Living</b>, <nobr>October 5, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span class="crVerifiedStripe"><b class="h3Color tiny" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Amazon Verified Purchase</b><span class="tiny verifyWhatsThis">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase" target="AmazonHelp" onclick="amz_js_PopWin('http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase', 'AmazonHelp', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,toolbar=0,status=1');return false; ">What's this?</a>)</span></span>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Find-Your-Strongest-Life-Differently/dp/1400202361">Find Your Strongest Life: What the Happiest and Most Successful Women Do Differently (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>Marcus Buckingham has bad news: it's tough to be a woman.<br /><br />But he also has good news: every woman can surmount her challenges and live a full life by listening to, living in, and being led by her strengths.<br /><br />This is Buckingham's latest book on the subject of strengths, and it is directly targeted towards women.  He starts out by spewing out a slew of sad statistics.  He points out how women, as a population, are sadder than men, sadder as they grow older, and sadder now than they were 40 years ago.  They are also more stressed and far more likely to suffer clinical depression than their male counterparts.<br /><br />Why is this? He argues that both the complexities and responsibilities of a modern woman's life have mushroomed, and the push to "have it all" but lead a "balanced" life have led to a massive stress overload.<br /><br />What is the solution?  Buckingham offers a strengths-based life as a path out of the jungle the 21st century woman finds herself entangled in. For those unfamiliar with his previous works, he defines a person's "strengths" as actions that give a person a feeling of satisfaction & accomplishment.  These are specific areas that are hard-wired into a person and stay fairly constant throughout life- the roles they were born to play.<br /><br />The secret to a fulfilling life is to discover your areas of strengths, to nurture them, and to let them guide you.  Chapter by chapter he discusses strategies for searching for "strong moments" (specific times you feel "in the zone") and then intentionally "imbalancing" your life towards them.  There are also specific tactics chapters for career, relationships, and kids.<br /><br />I think the book suffers from some inevitable tunnel vision: while I believe living in your strengths is an important component to a fulfilling life, it is only a part.  He also makes trusting one's feelings a major focus of the book, and (sorry, Marcus) feelings can't always be trusted. Finally, he skitters too close to "Law of Attraction" like concepts in some of the material for my tastes.<br /><br />All in all, Find Your Strongest Life is, (couldn't resist it!), a strong book.  Reading and applying its principles will indeed help women navigate the jungle of 21st century living to find their strongest life.  I found it useful myself, both for its universal principles and also to help me understand the challenges that women face today.  Highly recommended.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400202361&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R2WNAZS6AJC7LO&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>      <item>         <title>James John Hollandsworth, M.D. gave 4 stars to: A Million Miles in a Thousand Years</title>         <guid isPermaLink="false">1254228302-A1HOLJW15Q5S5V-0785213066</guid>         <link>         http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0785213066&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3LRSFA8B83RUE&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail         </link>         <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2009 12:45:02 GMT</pubDate>         <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V">James John Hollandsworth, M.D.</a> reviewed:</p><span class="amzRssTitle" ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Million-Miles-Thousand-Years-Learned/dp/0785213066">A Million Miles in a Thousand Years: What I Learned While Editing My Life</a></span> <span class="amzRssByline" >by Donald Miller</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Million-Miles-Thousand-Years-Learned/dp/0785213066" style="display:block; float:left; clear:left; padding-right: 5px;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B8KR7DgkL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" width="75" height="75" border="0" /></a><a name="R3LRSFA8B83RUE"></a><br /><div class="small" style="margin-left:0.5em;">          <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:      </div>      <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <span style='margin-left: -5px;'><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/customer-reviews/stars-4-0._V192240704_.gif" width="64" alt="4.0 out of 5 stars" title="4.0 out of 5 stars" height="12" border="0" /> </span>        <b>Nobody cries at the end of a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo</b>, <nobr>September 29, 2009</nobr>      </div>      <div class="tiny" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">        <b><span class="h3color tiny">This review is from: </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Million-Miles-Thousand-Years-Learned/dp/0785213066">A Million Miles in a Thousand Years: What I Learned While Editing My Life (Hardcover)</a></b>      </div>"Nobody cries at the end of a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo."<br /><br />That single insight, from the first page of the book, effectively distills the wisdom of 288 pages down into one sentence.<br /><br />In A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, Donald Miller writes of how collaborating on a screenplay based on his life transformed his perspective on life, and then transformed the living of his life. As he thought on the fictional story of his life, he began to see his real life as a story, and that, as the saying goes, is what made all the difference.<br /><br />He thought about the elements of a good story-- conflict, sacrifice, character transformation, and realized that the "elements that made a story meaningful were the same that made a life meaningful." And as he was rewriting the fictional story of his life, he realized that his own life was his to write, by intentionally living out what a good story would be.<br /><br />Miller writes in his honest and open style about both his failings and his victories in this memoir, and there is much to be appreciated and pondered over here. I underlined dozens of sentences like the ones above, sentences that ought to be deeply worked down into the soul.<br /><br />Don's story is a good story, but it isn't a great story. Where it falls short of greatness is that Christ is not at its center. Yes, as far as I know Don is a Christian, but his story as chronicled in the book is one that anyone with any belief in God could undertake. I believe that every truly great life story involves the glory of Christ and His Kingdom at the center of it all-- the inciting incident, the conflict, the transformation, the climax-- Christ must be seen as behind all, before all, the center of all, and the purpose of it all. I'd like to hear more of the story of Christ in the story of Don next time around.      <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;">      </div></div>]]></description>                           <comments>http://www.amazon.com/review/discussions/start-thread.html?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0785213066&amp;authorID=A1HOLJW15Q5S5V&amp;store=yourstore&amp;reviewID=R3LRSFA8B83RUE&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail#wasThisHelpful</comments>               </item>   </channel></rss>
