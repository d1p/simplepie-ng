-Got acquainted with Derek&#039;s project as far as the main question addressed in his research. The impact of esthetic estrogen on the physiology of oysters: Reproduction, immune system, hormone levels.&lt;br/&gt;
-Derek explained how to prepare aragose gel for PCR:&lt;br/&gt;
1. Fill up the loading tray with water to determine the volume of TAE needed (150ml)&lt;br/&gt;
2.Tap around the edges of the loading tray to allow for the solution to be contained&lt;br/&gt;
3.Choose teeth depending on how many samples are to be run&lt;br/&gt;
4.Take 0.8% of the volume of the TAE: 150x 0.008= 1.2 g of Agarose&lt;br/&gt;
5. Microwave the solution until boiling point&lt;br/&gt;
6. Keep away from face when taking out from the microwave&lt;br/&gt;
7. Let it cool down for about 20 minutes and then add water to compensate for the evaporated solutio&lt;br/&gt;
8. Add ethidium bromide 15 microL&lt;br/&gt;
9.Let it solidify&lt;br/&gt;
-Observed Derek perform his PCR&lt;br/&gt;
Monday September 19th:&lt;br/&gt;
Was introduced to Sam&#039;s project: Characterizing Cyclooxygenase in oysters, by sequencing the gene and pointing out interesting features it might have, homologs, looking at gene expression in different tissues.&lt;br/&gt;
Went over how to design primers, what blast is and how it works, how sequencing works, why cloning is used and SNP&#039;s.&lt;br/&gt;
Tuesday September 20th:&lt;br/&gt;
Discussed Caroline&#039;s, Dave&#039;s, Emma&#039;s and Mac&#039;s project with Sam and got an idea of the techniques they use.&lt;br/&gt;
Went over techniques such as High-Throughput sequencing, Pyrosequencing and Illumina.&lt;br/&gt;
Made a short trip to the lab where the fish is kept and to the labs where all the high-tech instruments are.&lt;br/&gt;
Monday September 26:&lt;br/&gt;
Did some reading on sequencing technologies: Pyrosequencing, SOLiD, Illumina.&lt;br/&gt;
Wednesday September 28th:&lt;br/&gt;
Attended the writing workshop and learned how to properly share my calendar with the Robert&#039;s lab.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thursday September 29th:&lt;br/&gt;
Performed PCR with cDNA from salmon liver tissue.&lt;br/&gt;

Attended the writing workshop and learned how to properly share my calendar with the Robert&#039;s lab.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Notes:&lt;br/&gt;
Make sure to change to the pipette tips every time you add a solution.&lt;br/&gt;
Do not put hand inside bag of tubes but rather, try pouring them out slowly to avoid contamination&lt;br/&gt;

What&#039;s next?&lt;br/&gt;
Generate PCR product using primers that anneal OUTSIDE of each of the qPCR primers and then sequence those bands to ensure that the qPCR primers are actually annealing to two different isoforms.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Ethanol Precipitation - Full-length PGS1 cDNA (from 20110921)&lt;br/&gt;
Performed an EtOH on gel-purified PCR products from 20110921. Briefly, added 0.1 vols of 3M sodium acetate (pH=5.2; 43uL), mixed and then added 2.5 vols of 100% EtOH (1182.5uL). Mixed, split into two tubes (due to high volume not fitting in a single tube) and incubated @ -80C O/N. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 20mins, 4C. Discarded supe. Washed pellet w/ 1mL 70% EtOH. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 15mins, 4C. Discarded supe. Resuspended in 25uL Qiagen Buffer EB (10mM Tris-HCl) and spec&#039;d.&lt;br/&gt;

DISSECTION PROTOCOL&lt;br/&gt;
Work with one oyster at a time, leaving all the others in their water until right before dissection (this minimizes extra stress).&lt;br/&gt;
Shuck your oyster by either a) inserting your shucker at the hinge and twisting it, followed by slicing the adductor or b) inserting your shucker in the side of the oyster adjacent to the adductor and slicing it.&lt;br/&gt;
Carefully open your oyster, scraping the mantle off of the valve you are removing so that the entire, intact body is in one shell.&lt;br/&gt;
Using a sterile forceps and blade, dissect out the tissue you want to analyze and put into pre-labeled tubes. Place on dry ice. Be sure to sterilize your instruments by dunking in bleach and then ethanol in between tissues and between oysters.&lt;br/&gt;
When you are done, place your leftover oyster parts in the waste bin in the hood and clean out the containers that held your oysters.&lt;br/&gt;
RNA Extraction - follow the procedure from Labs 1 and 2.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Procedure Background &lt;br/&gt;
SDS-PAGE is the process of separating proteins from one another on the basis of molecular weight. A mixture of proteins is subjected to an electric field and pulled through a polyacrylamide matrix towards the cathode. However, proteins must be treated prior to separating them in this manner. This is because the charge on any given protein is dependent upon the amino acid sequence as well as the pH of the solution. Thus, a crude protein extract from cells or tissue contains a hetergenous mixture of proteins with varying charges. Without treating them in some manner, the proteins will migrate independent of their molecular weight. Additionally, proteins have various tertiary or quarternary structure that can influence the rate at which they migrate in an electric field. In order to address these issues, protein samples are prepared in a specific fashion to linearize the proteins and impart the same charge to all proteins in the sample to ensure that they become homogenous and their migration rate during SDS-PAGE is solely due to molecular weight.&lt;br/&gt;
Protein samples are combined with a reducing sample buffer. This reducing sample buffer contains sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), B-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, Bromophenol blue and a buffer. SDS imparts an overall negative charge to all the proteins in a sample. This ensures that all of the proteins will migrate in the same direction (towards the cathode) when placed in an electric field. B-mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent. It accepts electrons from disulfide bonds formed between two cysteine residues. It serves as one step to help break any tertiary or quartenary structure of proteins in the sample. Glycerol simply serves as a sinking agent for your sample. It has a greater density and will allow your sample to sink into the buffer contained in the wells of the gel. Bromophenol blue is a negatively charged dye that allows one to visually track the migration of your samples through the polyacrylamide gel. Bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate of proteins ~5-7kDa. Finally, the buffer is present to maintain the appropriate pH for your sample. Once samples have the appropriate amount of reducing sample buffer, they are boiled. Boiling causes the proteins to fully denature, eliminating any tertiary or quartenary structure and leads to linear chains of amino acids.&lt;br/&gt;
Samples are then run through polyacrylamide gels. Traditionally, a single polyacrylamide gel is actually comprised of two gels with different percentages of polyacrylamide, pH and buffer. The top portion of the gel, relative to the bottom portion of the gel, has a lower percentage of acrylamide, a lower pH and a lower concentration of buffer. This gel is referred to as the stacking gel. The bottom gel has higher mounts of all three components listed above and is called the running gel.&lt;br/&gt;
The low percentage of polyacrylamide in stacking gels allows all the proteins in the sample, regardless of molecular weight, to quickly and easiy migrate through the gel. When the samples begin to enter the lower gel containing a higher percentage of polyacrylamide (running gel), the proteins are now all &amp;quot;stacked&amp;quot; upon one another. This allows all of the proteins in a sample to enter the running gel at essentially the same time. Additionally, the differences in pH and buffer content between the stacking and running gels leads to a local increase in voltage around the sample, which helps drive the sample from solution in the well into the polyacrylamide matrix of the stacking gel.&lt;br/&gt;
After SDS-PAGE is complete (when the dye front has reached the bottom of the gel), the gel is either set&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;insert&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/ins&gt; up&lt;del class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt; for Western blotting or is stained to reveal the proteins. There are a number of stains that can be used, depending on the sensitivity needed to visualize proteins of interest, but we will use Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This is a non-selective stain, meaning it binds all proteins regardless of their amino acid makeup. Additionally, it is cheap and rather sensitive. The dye will initially turn the entire gel blue and even a short exposure (5 minutes) often results in over staining. Thus, it is necessary to destain the gel to wash the dye out of the areas of the gel where no protein is present. After destaining, the proteins should appear as blue/purple bands and the rest of the gel should remain relatively clear.&lt;br/&gt;
SDS-PAGE PROTOCOL&lt;br/&gt;
Also see Manufacturers Protocol / Manual: Precise™ Protein Gels &lt;br/&gt;
Begin boiling water on hot plate.&lt;br/&gt;
Thaw&lt;/del&gt; your &lt;del class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;protein extract from last week. This is your protein stock. Mix well by inverting tube several times.&lt;br/&gt;
In a fresh, 1.5mL SCREW CAP tube add 15uL of your protein stock&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;insert&quot;&gt;group experiments&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;15uL of 2X Reducing Sample Buffer. Return your protein stock to the box in the -20C freezer labeled protein samples.&lt;br/&gt;
Mix sample by flicking. Briefly centrifuge (10s) to pool liquid in bottom of tube.&lt;br/&gt;
Boil sample&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;insert&quot;&gt;make schedule&lt;/ins&gt; for &lt;del class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;5 mins.&lt;br/&gt;
While sample is boiling, observe assembly of gel box and gels. Rinse gel wells thoroughly as demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;
When sample is finished boiling, immediately centrifuge for 1min. to pool liquid.&lt;br/&gt;
Slowly load your entire sample into the appropriate well using a gel loading tip.&lt;br/&gt;
Put lid on gel box and plug electrodes into appropriate receptacles on the power supply.&lt;br/&gt;
Turn power supply on and set voltage to 150V. Run for 45mins. WHILE THE GEL IS RUNNING BEGIN YOUR RNA EXTRACTION PROCEDURE.&lt;br/&gt;
Add ~150mL (does not have to be measured - just need enough to cover the gel) of Coomassie Stain to a designated container.&lt;br/&gt;
Turn off power supply and disconnect gel box from power supply.&lt;br/&gt;
Remove lid from gel box.&lt;br/&gt;
Disengage the tension wedge.&lt;br/&gt;
Remove gel from gel box.&lt;br/&gt;
Carefully crack open cassette to expose gel.&lt;br/&gt;
Trim wells at top of gel.&lt;br/&gt;
Notch a designated corner of the gel to help you remember the correct orientation of the gel (i.e. which is the top/bottom of the gel, which is the right/left side(s) of the gel)&lt;br/&gt;
Place gel into container with Coomassie Stain.&lt;br/&gt;
Incubate on shaker/rocker for 5 mins.&lt;br/&gt;
Carefully pour stain back into original container. Be careful not to dump out gel!&lt;br/&gt;
Rinse gel briefly with 10% acetic acid and pour this wash down the drain.&lt;br/&gt;
Add ~250mL (no need to measure) 10% acetic acid to container with gel. Incubate on shaker/rockers for 15mins. Change out buffer and repeat until bands become clearly visible. This may need to incubate overnight. If so, cover container with plastic wrap and leave on shaker/rocker.&lt;br/&gt;
Take picture of gel.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;insert&quot;&gt;maintaining them&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Procedure Background&lt;br/&gt;
SDS-PAGE is the process of separating proteins from one another on the basis of molecular weight. A mixture of proteins is subjected to an electric field and pulled through a polyacrylamide matrix towards the cathode. However, proteins must be treated prior to separating them in this manner. This is because the charge on any given protein is dependent upon the amino acid sequence as well as the pH of the solution. Thus, a crude protein extract from cells or tissue contains a hetergenous mixture of proteins with varying charges. Without treating them in some manner, the proteins will migrate independent of their molecular weight. Additionally, proteins have various tertiary or quarternary structure that can influence the rate at which they migrate in an electric field. In order to address these issues, protein samples are prepared in a specific fashion to linearize the proteins and impart the same charge to all proteins in the sample to ensure that they become homogenous and their migration rate during SDS-PAGE is solely due to molecular weight.&lt;br/&gt;
Protein samples are combined with a reducing sample buffer. This reducing sample buffer contains sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), B-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, Bromophenol blue and a buffer. SDS imparts an overall negative charge to all the proteins in a sample. This ensures that all of the proteins will migrate in the same direction (towards the cathode) when placed in an electric field. B-mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent. It accepts electrons from disulfide bonds formed between two cysteine residues. It serves as one step to help break any tertiary or quartenary structure of proteins in the sample. Glycerol simply serves as a sinking agent for your sample. It has a greater density and will allow your sample to sink into the buffer contained in the wells of the gel. Bromophenol blue is a negatively charged dye that allows one to visually track the migration of your samples through the polyacrylamide gel. Bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate of proteins ~5-7kDa. Finally, the buffer is present to maintain the appropriate pH for your sample. Once samples have the appropriate amount of reducing sample buffer, they are boiled. Boiling causes the proteins to fully denature, eliminating any tertiary or quartenary structure and leads to linear chains of amino acids.&lt;br/&gt;
Samples are then run through polyacrylamide gels. Traditionally, a single polyacrylamide gel is actually comprised of two gels with different percentages of polyacrylamide, pH and buffer. The top portion of the gel, relative to the bottom portion of the gel, has a lower percentage of acrylamide, a lower pH and a lower concentration of buffer. This gel is referred to as the stacking gel. The bottom gel has higher mounts of all three components listed above and is called the running gel.&lt;br/&gt;
The low percentage of polyacrylamide in stacking gels allows all the proteins in the sample, regardless of molecular weight, to quickly and easiy migrate through the gel. When the samples begin to enter the lower gel containing a higher percentage of polyacrylamide (running gel), the proteins are now all &amp;quot;stacked&amp;quot; upon one another. This allows all of the proteins in a sample to enter the running gel at essentially the same time. Additionally, the differences in pH and buffer content between the stacking and running gels leads to a local increase in voltage around the sample, which helps drive the sample from solution in the well into the polyacrylamide matrix of the stacking gel.&lt;br/&gt;
After SDS-PAGE is complete (when the dye front has reached the bottom of the gel), the gel is either set up for Western blotting or is stained to reveal the proteins. There are a number of stains that can be used, depending on the sensitivity needed to visualize proteins of interest, but we will use Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This is a non-selective stain, meaning it binds all proteins regardless of their amino acid makeup. Additionally, it is cheap and rather sensitive. The dye will initially turn the entire gel blue and even a short exposure (5 minutes) often results in over staining. Thus, it is necessary to destain the gel to wash the dye out of the areas of the gel where no protein is present. After destaining, the proteins should appear as blue/purple bands and the rest of the gel should remain relatively clear.&lt;br/&gt;
SDS-PAGE PROTOCOL&lt;br/&gt;
Also see Manufacturers Protocol / Manual: Precise™ Protein Gels&lt;br/&gt;
Begin boiling water on hot plate.&lt;br/&gt;
Thaw your protein extract from last week. This is your protein stock. Mix well by inverting tube several times.&lt;br/&gt;
In a fresh, 1.5mL SCREW CAP tube add 15uL of your protein stock and 15uL of 2X Reducing Sample Buffer. Return your protein stock to the box in the -20C freezer labeled protein samples.&lt;br/&gt;
Mix sample by flicking. Briefly centrifuge (10s) to pool liquid in bottom of tube.&lt;br/&gt;
Boil sample for 5 mins.&lt;br/&gt;
While sample is boiling, observe assembly of gel box and gels. Rinse gel wells thoroughly as demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;
When sample is finished boiling, immediately centrifuge for 1min. to pool liquid.&lt;br/&gt;
Slowly load your entire sample into the appropriate well using a gel loading tip.&lt;br/&gt;
Put lid on gel box and plug electrodes into appropriate receptacles on the power supply.&lt;br/&gt;
Turn power supply on and set voltage to 150V. Run for 45mins. WHILE THE GEL IS RUNNING BEGIN YOUR RNA EXTRACTION PROCEDURE.&lt;br/&gt;
Add ~150mL (does not have to be measured - just need enough to cover the gel) of Coomassie Stain to a designated container.&lt;br/&gt;
Turn off power supply and disconnect gel box from power supply.&lt;br/&gt;
Remove lid from gel box.&lt;br/&gt;
Disengage the tension wedge.&lt;br/&gt;
Remove gel from gel box.&lt;br/&gt;
Carefully crack open cassette to expose gel.&lt;br/&gt;
Trim wells at top of gel.&lt;br/&gt;
Notch a designated corner of the gel to help you remember the correct orientation of the gel (i.e. which is the top/bottom of the gel, which is the right/left side(s) of the gel)&lt;br/&gt;
Place gel into container with Coomassie Stain.&lt;br/&gt;
Incubate on shaker/rocker for 5 mins.&lt;br/&gt;
Carefully pour stain back into original container. Be careful not to dump out gel!&lt;br/&gt;
Rinse gel briefly with 10% acetic acid and pour this wash down the drain.&lt;br/&gt;
Add ~250mL (no need to measure) 10% acetic acid to container with gel. Incubate on shaker/rockers for 15mins. Change out buffer and repeat until bands become clearly visible. This may need to incubate overnight. If so, cover container with plastic wrap and leave on shaker/rocker.&lt;br/&gt;
Take picture of gel.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
