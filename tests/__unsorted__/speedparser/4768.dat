&lt;p&gt;It has emerged that Manning is of Welsh heritage from his mother’s side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the British Nationality Act of 1981, anyone born outside the UK after 1 January 1983 who has a mother who is a UK citizen by birth is British by descent, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/01/bradley-manning-uk-citizen"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty’s UK director, Kate Allen, sent a statement to the press last night saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Welsh parentage means the UK government should demand his ‘maximum custody’ status does not impair his ability to defend himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to see Foreign Office officials visiting him just as they would any other British person detained overseas and potentially facing trial on very serious charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty are calling on the government to ensure that the army private’s detention conditions adhered to international standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sunny Hundal</name></author><gr:likingUser>05835795084159631342</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Liberal Conspiracy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://liberalconspiracy.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296837749047"><id gr:original-id="http://liberalconspiracy.org/?p=21634">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/50cf77df393d23eb</id><category term="Blog"/><category term="Conservative Party"/><category term="Local Government"/><category term="Westminster"/><title type="html">Why the Big Society will be as dead as a Dodo</title><published>2011-02-04T09:05:11Z</published><updated>2011-02-04T09:05:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/02/04/why-yhe-big-society-will-be-as-dead-as-a-dodo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://liberalconspiracy.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m on the board of a local charity, which deals in ‘conflict resolution’. Basically, it reaches out to young kids in areas where there is tension (gangs, racial tension, religious etc) and gets them involved in activity to deal with that tension. It also does a lot of local community work with people of different backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its also teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, thanks to funding being slashed at local councils, schools and grant donors. Several other charities and local community organisations in the area have already gone bust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This tale is being repeated across the country, and we’ve reported on it plenty of times here on Libcon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single head of any voluntary organisation or charity is screaming that their sector is being decimated. This isn’t hyperbole, it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather coincidentally, Liverpool Council &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/03/liverpool-big-society"&gt;pulled out of Cameron’s Big Socety project&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. I’m surprised it didn’t happen earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lgcplus.com/news/spending-review/big-society-on-the-rocks/5024980.blog"&gt;Allister Hayman reports for the LGC&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks earlier, David Robinson, founder of charity Community Links (described by Mr Cameron as “one of Britain’s most inspiring community organisations”) wrote an open letter to the prime minister warning that the massive spending cuts will wipe out vital voluntary groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forcing an unsustainable pace on a barrage of uncoordinated cuts that hit the poorest hard is not an act of God. Why let it be your Katrina?” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our board members are small-c conservative people who like helping out at the Church, doing local fundraising and getting involved in community initiatives. They’re not average Labour voters. They’ll also watch their community organisations disintegrate in front of their eyes. I doubt they’ll be very happy about it either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is obvious to state, but rather than creating Big Society, Cameron and Osborne are actively destroying it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course many Tories will dismiss this as typical lefty whinging about how state funding is being cut. Perhaps. But I don’t think the ideologically driven Tories understand or even comprehend the impact of what that means in practice. The chart below says all there needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government approval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three years time, when Cameron might have some money to throw back at taxpayers, the Big Society project will be long dead and buried.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sunny Hundal</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Liberal Conspiracy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://liberalconspiracy.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296837562328"><id gr:original-id="http://crookedtimber.org/?p=18764">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fda0118f8d1a5e11</id><category term="World Economy"/><category term="World Politics"/><title type="html">Trans-Atlantic plane wars</title><published>2011-02-04T10:24:13Z</published><updated>2011-02-04T10:24:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/02/04/trans-atlantic-plane-wars/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://crookedtimber.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My post on the end of US decline, suggesting that the US now has about the influence that would be expected, given its population, relative to other developed countries, attracted a fair bit of criticism from International Relations specialists. In particular, my suggestion that the EU and US typically bargain on relatively equal terms (as would be expected since they are about equal in size and income) was criticised by &lt;a href="http://ipeatunc.blogspot.com/2011/01/power-and-influence-atypicality-of-us.html"&gt;Kindred Winecoff&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="http://ipeatunc.blogspot.com/2011/01/atypicality-of-us-power-and-influence.html"&gt;reprise&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href="http://fparena.blogspot.com/2011/01/amen.html"&gt;Phil Arena&lt;/a&gt;). We could go on for a long while picking examples to suit one case or the other, but as it happens, I can take my best illustration directly from the news headlines appearing at the same time as my post. The &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgsSba4S7YmLvT29rsRZpGnhvH9A?docId=e7ea052bd4bb457e9c4f4245699f7cb3"&gt;World Trade Organization has completed its report on US subsidies to Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, following an earlier report on EU subsidies to Airbus. Although the report is not yet publicly available, both sides have received it, and are leaking/spinning like made, each claiming victory.  Reading the competing claims, it seems that the &lt;span&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; has found that that the US subsidies to Boeing have broken the rules (yay, Europe!), but not by nearly as much as EU subsidies to Airbus (yay, &lt;span&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;In terms of the legal dispute, this looks like a win on points for the US side. But in geopolitical terms, it’s the other way around. Not only has Europe bent the rules more, it’s done so without suffering any real consequences, and to much greater effect than the US.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;From a standing start in the 1960s, Airbus has taken the lead over Boeing in the commercial aviation market, while the rest of the once vigorous US commercial aviation industry has been wiped out. And, thanks in part to the launch subsidies against which the &lt;span&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; has ruled, Airbus not only has the jumbo end of the market to itself with the &lt;span&gt;A380&lt;/span&gt;, but has been able to counter Boeing’s successful (at least terms of orders) 787 with its own &lt;span&gt;A350 &lt;/span&gt;(running only a couple of years behind the &lt;span&gt;B787&lt;/span&gt;). Perhaps the &lt;span&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; ruling will eventually force Airbus to give back some of the money, but as far as the global aviation market is concerned, the deed is done.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;While this is only one example, it’s one that ought to give advocates of the US hyperpower theory a lot of pause. If spending more on the military than the rest of the world combined (the disproportion must surely be even larger in relation to military aviation) can’t preserve a position of dominance (or even leadership) in a closely related sector like commercial aviation, it’s hard to believe that it can be of any significant value in relation to other sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly possible to argue that the kind of industrial policy that produced Airbus is economically inefficient, and that the Europeans would have been better off leaving the field to the US. But this kind of argument applies in spades to anyone who wants to claim indirect benefits from military pre-eminence.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it’s still possible that Boeing will win, or at least regain parity, in the marketplace. But if so, it will be due to a combination of good commercial judgement and good luck, not because Boeing has benefited from being part of the US military-industrial hyperpower rather than the supposedly outmatched EU.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the general question, I’d say that the outcome of negotations where the EU and US appear with opposed agendas depend mainly on such things as the existence or absence of veto points, and the extent to which one side or the other cares about the outcome. Where there are lots of veto points (climate change negotiations or the Multilateral Agreement on Investment) the status quo has an obvious advantaage. Conversely, even a united EU can’t stop the US from going to war if it wants to, and the US couldn’t stop the International Criminal Court or the Law of the Sea convention.  The US can often split the UK and sometimes others off to prevent the emergence of a common EU position, but the veto points within the US system often mean that the US itself can’t act one in any coherent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;All of this is a long way from my original post, which was mainly concerned with convergence in economic performance. But it’s certainly been  interesting to engage with the very different way IR specialists view the world. This is the kind of experience that you get from blogs, and much less from official academia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Quiggin</name></author><gr:likingUser>00508281799989680422</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13756961792896667726</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>01996374081610625595</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://crookedtimber.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://crookedtimber.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Crooked Timber</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://crookedtimber.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296831296625"><id gr:original-id="http://crookedtimber.org/?p=18803">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f51dba116efed1ff</id><category term="Academia"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Sociology"/><title type="html">Gender divides in Philosophy and other disciplines</title><published>2011-02-04T11:27:20Z</published><updated>2011-02-04T11:27:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/02/04/gender-divides-in-philosophy-and-other-disciplines/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://crookedtimber.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on a conversation with a friend in Philosophy, I took a quick look at the &lt;a href="http://www.norc.org/projects/survey+of+earned+doctorates.htm"&gt;Survey of Earned Doctorates&lt;/a&gt; to see the breakdown by gender for Ph.Ds awarded in the United States in 2009.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report evidence from a real-effort experiment confirming that worker performance is sensitive to the process used to select the compensation contract. Groups of workers that voted to determine their compensation scheme provided significantly more effort than groups that had no say in how they would be compensated. This effect is robust to controls for the compensation scheme implemented and worker characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;This is especially impressive because it focuses upon only one channel through which democracy raises productivity, and ignores others - for example that workplace democracy increases workers’ monitoring of co-workers, or increases motivation over longer periods than can be measured in laboratory experiments.&lt;br&gt;One message I take from this is that a government that was serious about wanting to increase the efficiency of the public sector would consider ways of empowering workers. &lt;br&gt;At this stage, glibertarians ask: if worker democracy is so productive, why is there so little of it? Why don’t efficient worker-owned firms expand and put inefficient capitalist ones out of business?&lt;br&gt;In one sense, the premise of the question is false. Only about one firm in 1000 separates ownership from control by being listed on the stock market; co-ops and partnerships are much more common. And they are almost ubiquitous in businesses where worker effort is the key to performance, such as law firms. &lt;br&gt;In another sense, the question ascribes too much efficiency to market forces. These don’t grind as finely as you might think. In his classic &lt;a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/cesptp/halshs-00155762.html"&gt;survey &lt;/a&gt;of firm growth, Alex Coad writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is ample evidence suggesting that low productivity helps to predict exit…productivity levels are not very helpful in predicting growth rates. Put differently, it appears that selection only operates via elimination of the least productive firms or establishments, while the mechanism of selection via differential growth does not appear to be functioning well. As a result, the mechanism of selection appears to be rather ‘suboptimal’ in the sense that its effectiveness is lower than it could conceivably be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;A second question is: why am I so keen on worker democracy but sceptical about political democracy?&lt;br&gt;Simple. The best forms of democracy don’t ask; “what do you think?” This just invites speak-your-branes drivel. Instead, it asks: what do you know? Workplace democracy does this. &lt;br&gt;In this sense, workplace democracy does what Hayek &lt;a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html"&gt;attributed &lt;/a&gt;to markets: it mobilizes dispersed, fragmented knowledge (this is a separate virtue from maximizing efficiency). My enthusiasm for worker democracy probably owes less to Marx’s influence  than it does to Hayek’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>chris dillow</name></author><gr:likingUser>12813170326913873233</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>04197419871517887228</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>10277589810545275175</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13492324707549339119</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Stumbling and Mumbling</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296830483229"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7518007.post-1039347144102364108">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/124e96dcd2d1c336</id><title type="html">Chaos, chaos I tell you</title><published>2011-02-04T03:31:00Z</published><updated>2011-02-04T03:37:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WhateverItIsImAgainstIt/~3/LGDWsMlhWWw/chaos-chaos-i-tell-you.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whateveritisimagainstit.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/04/mubarak-stands-fast"&gt;Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;: “If I resign today, there will be chaos.”  He claims he told Obama, “You don’t understand the Egyptian culture and what would happen if I step down now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s actually a great personal sacrifice for him to remain dictator because he’s “fed up” with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the violence by his thugs (who state tv are referring to as “pro-stability demonstrators”): “I was very unhappy about yesterday.

&lt;p&gt;Google accused Microsoft this week of that most dire of third-grader crimes: copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Microsoft search engine &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/"&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; is populated in part with the top Google results. Google proved this with some clever tricks, like directing &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20030370-501465.html"&gt;searches for &lt;em&gt;hiybbprqag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a site for buying e-tickets and seeing that Bing shortly displayed the same result for the same search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s response to this was, and I quote, “Search parameterization partner clickstream ranking engine hypertext visualization experience algorithm team. Excellence data customer principles quality. Tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little surprising that anyone is surprised by this. The last time Microsoft came up with a wholly original product was when Bill Gates wrote a program in eighth grade that scanned any supplied text and replaced the word &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;butt&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft’s official mission statement is, “Apple’s mission statement, except in one of our ugly-ass fonts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when Microsoft would announce plans to enter into an established market, and industry giants would tremble in fear, but these days such a proclamation only inspires a mild concern that the third-place contender in the category might fall to fourth place. I don’t think &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-English-Dictionary-Vols-1-20/dp/0198611862"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is going to have to replace the verb &lt;em&gt;to google&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;to bing&lt;/em&gt; anytime soon, not least because &lt;em&gt;bing&lt;/em&gt; is already a verb meaning “to have sex with a leprechaun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Also, the Internet Runs Out of Parking Spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other web-related news, the &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/internet-addresses/"&gt;internet is running out of places&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, the supply of IP addresses is exhausted, and I’m feeling pretty run-down myself. In layman’s terms, consider the internet as a giant parking lot, with a huge but finite number of parking spaces, each representing the IP address of a particular internet server or other device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few parking spaces left, and if you want to have a place to park your intercar, you’re going to have to … HEY! That guy just totally grabbed your space! You were signaling and everything! Oh, man, and of course it’s a &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beemer"&gt;Beemer&lt;/a&gt;. “I can’t wait for a space, because I have a BMW and I’m soooo important!” Douche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you’re currently driving in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"&gt;Parking Lot 4&lt;/a&gt;, and Parking Lot 6 is just across the street. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"&gt;Parking Lot 6&lt;/a&gt; has enough parking spaces for every star in the entire universe, with enough left over for every YouTube cover of “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_%28Lady_Gaga_song%29"&gt;Poker Face&lt;/a&gt;.” In fact, Parking Lot 6 has been sitting there across the street, nearly empty, since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not just go and park in Parking Lot 6? Well, because the parking lots aren’t intercompatible. You can’t drive on Parking Lot 6 with Parking Lot 4 tires — that’s just silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, most vehicles being sold today come with a nice set of Parking Lot 6 tires stored in the trunk, waiting to be switched out at will. The bad news is, remember explaining to your mom about the whole &lt;a href="http://www.leemark.com/digitaltv/index.html"&gt;digital-television thing&lt;/a&gt;? And how to get Wi-Fi to work? And why she can’t just put Blu-ray discs in her old DVD player? Well, pull on your explaining boots, because this one’s going to be a toughie.&lt;/p&gt;

The US trusts him, of course, because in addition to torturing Egyptians he helped run the CIA's kidnapping and torturing ring, known as 'rendition'.  The New Yorker &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/01/who-is-omar-suleiman.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;summarises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;While he has a reputation for loyalty and effectiveness, he also  carries some controversial baggage from the standpoint of those looking  for a clean slate on human rights. As I described in my book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Side-Inside-Terror-American/dp/0307456293"&gt;The Dark Side&lt;/a&gt;,”  since 1993 Suleiman has headed the feared Egyptian general intelligence  service. In that capacity, he was the C.I.A.’s point man in Egypt for  renditions—the covert program in which the C.I.A. snatched terror  suspects from around the world and returned them to Egypt and elsewhere  for interrogation, often under brutal circumstances.     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As laid out in greater detail by Stephen Grey, in his book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Plane-Rendition-Torture-Program/dp/031236024X"&gt;Ghost Plane&lt;/a&gt;,”   beginning in the nineteen-nineties, Suleiman negotiated directly with  top Agency officials. Every rendition was greenlighted at the highest  levels of both the U.S. and Egyptian intelligence agencies. Edward S.  Walker, Jr., a former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, described Suleiman as  “very bright, very realistic,” adding that he was cognizant that there  was a downside to “some of the negative things that the Egyptians  engaged in, of torture and so on. But he was not squeamish, by the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;So, if we can summarise.  The US backed Mubarak for more than three decades after the assassination of Sadat, supplied him with billions in aid, military equipment, torture equipment, tear gas, etc.  They trained the army, forging close ties with the military top brass.  The IMF vended largesse, with the usual strings attached.  Beginning with Sadat's 'Open Door' policies and the peace treaty with Israel, Egypt was transformed from a nationalist, corporatist, anti-imperialist polity, into a &lt;a href="http://www.merip.org/mero/mero040508.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;neoliberal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comprador regime.  A new fraction of rentiers emerged as the financial sector grew and private sector capitalists were given greater opportunities to profit from public investments.  Every crisis of the system, whether it was produced by a financial crash, a slump in oil prices, the upending of BCCI, or the long-term collapse of fruit and vegetable exports, was an occasion for further austerity, cutting 'profligate' state spending.  When revenues from the nationalised petroleum company and the Suez canal bolstered state revenues, the credit for growth was allocated to the IMF and its free market wizardry.  The result was that wealth was perpetually transferred to an increasingly aloof ruling class, affiliated to the regime.  When Mubarak slaughtered opponents, as during the anti-Islamist counterinsurgency in 1992-97, which included the famously brutal wipe-out in a working class quarter of Embada in 1992, the US sent more money, more weapons.  The CIA forged ties with the security apparatus, .  Mubarak's regional importance for the US was heightened during the 'war on terror', and especially when he agreed to help impose the Quad's blockade on Gaza.  The flow of weapons, money and diplomatic support was not interrupted by a wave of protests arising from the Second Intifada in 2002, or from mass strike action radiating from &lt;a href="http://www.merip.org/mero/mero050907.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Mahalla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, both of which Mubarak's police cracked down on viciously.  But then the global capitalist system went haywire, sinking into its worst crisis for decades, which struck at the heart of the fragile accumulation regimes pursued by north African states.  The protests against the regime did not begin when Tunisia went up, but it was a catalyst for a drastic escalation of the revolt.  And in the last couple of weeks, the accumulated grievances and agitation of decades has exploded in an astounding revolt which has withstood waves of massacres from armed police, looting and chaos by officers out of uniform, terror by mounted and armed terror gangs (again, largely populated by Mubarak's police force) .  The US responds with concern, calls for protesters to make nice, and pays tribute to Mubarak's courageous work in the fictitious 'peace process'.  Officials urge Mubarak to embark on political and economic reforms to placate the opposition.  For well over a week, throughout all the bloodshed, Hillary Clinton insists that the US has no plans to revise aid to the regime.  US officials fearmonger about the Muslim Brothers, asserting that there must be a managed, 'orderly transition', but do not call for Mubarak to step down.  The Egyptian army, presumably under instructions for the US, protects the regime, and allows it to try every measure to crush the revolt.  It also moves to secure the Rafah crossing, so that no one gets any ideas.  Egyptians form people's committees to manage local resistance.  Workers form new trade unions, and embark on a general strike.  They fend off wave after wave of assault.  The US begins to hint that Mubarak should step aside and appoint a transitional government to replace him.  And, unsurprisingly, it emerges that they've been negotiating to impose a trusted regime hard man.  And if Egyptians won't accept Suleiman, as they almost certainly won't?  Watch this space...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://leninology.blogspot.com"&gt;Copyleft of Lenin's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5509475-7942700744238838578?l=leninology.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>lenin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://leninology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://leninology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">LENIN&amp;#39;S TOMB</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://leninology.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296818535523"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3699020.post-5457434061188571884">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bd7ab35819a72d0</id><title type="html">*Format revamp suggestion*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was also watching the Noreena</title><published>2011-02-04T10:09:00Z</published><updated>2011-02-04T10:12:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2011/02/format-revamp-suggestion-i-was-also.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/feeds/5457434061188571884/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3699020&amp;postID=5457434061188571884&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;b&gt;Format revamp suggestion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was also &lt;a href="http://bloodandtreasure.typepad.com/blood_treasure/2011/02/television-criticism.html"&gt;watching&lt;/a&gt; the Noreena Hertz trainwreck on Question Time and it reminded me of my idea for livening up this &lt;a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2009/07/seals-of-dimblebore-heres-evenings.html"&gt;horribly tired&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, the whole thing should be conducted in the &lt;i&gt;Watchdog&lt;/i&gt; studio, in front of its ranks of desk-researchers who would be looking things up in the background as the show went on.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;John &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/01/28/rape-victims-first-then-disabled-vets/"&gt;noted the other day&lt;/a&gt; that after attacks on Rape Victims and Veterans he expected somebody to introduce the &lt;em&gt;“Kick an Orphan and Beat a Puppy Act of 2011”&lt;/em&gt; any day now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I don’t know yet about the &lt;em&gt;“Kick an Orphan”&lt;/em&gt; part of the law, but it turns out that the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Beat a Puppy”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; part is real. Hearings have already been held and three Bills are working their way through the Republican controlled Missouri State House.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;BJ commenter Michael Bersin &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/02/02/locking-up-the-pro-ethnic-cleansing-vote/#comment-2407980"&gt;passed along the tip&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;“Beat a Puppy Act”&lt;/em&gt; is being field tested by the wingnuts of the Show-Me-State. I did some quick checking and it is true.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Last November the voters in Missouri &lt;a href="http://www.aspca.org/Blog/victory-missourians-vote-in.aspx"&gt;approved the Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act by over 60,000 votes&lt;/a&gt;. So, naturally the wingnuts in charge of the Missouri House and Senate have put overturning the law as a top priority for their 2011 Legislative agenda. Three bills to help protect puppy kickers from oversight and anti-cruelty measures &lt;a href="http://house.mo.gov/BillsAssignedToCommittee.aspx?com=453&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;code=R"&gt;have already been introduced in the Missouri House&lt;/a&gt;. The Missouri Senate and House have already held hearings and the &lt;em&gt;“Beat a Puppy Act”&lt;/em&gt; is on its way to becoming law. As for the voters, the message from their TeaBagger representatives is clear: piss off and shut up. One can imagine many other &lt;s&gt;Republican&lt;/s&gt; Confederate controlled State Houses following the lead of their comrades in Jefferson City.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;You can follow the amazing venality of these folks in the&lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/01/25/2610445/puppy-mill-law-is-hotly-contested.html"&gt; local papers as they write about&lt;/a&gt; Republicans and puppy mill operators arguing that they could not function if their ability to be cruel was restricted and that voters in Missouri were very, very wrong and mean-spirited to demand oversight and regulation of dog breeding factories.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It is yet another story of why these people are assholes.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://wtpotus.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/tidal_wave_800x480.jpg" width="300" align="right"&gt;Thank you, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Scorriganus/status/32982361067110400" title="Sean on Twitter"&gt;Sean on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, for making my day last night by drawing my attention to the latest front in the battle of wingnuts vs. science.  Often, when we pro-science sorts are arguing about evolution with wingnuts, they’ll pull the “it’s just a theory” card, to which we often reply, “It’s also called the theory of gravity.  Are you going to argue with &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt;?” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Answer: Of course they are. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sometimes still find that people on the liberal, or at least thoughtful, side of the fence still think that global warming denialism and creationism are discrete things borne out of an emotional need not to believe either in global warming or evolution, and while that’s true, I think it’s deeper than that.  I think that science itself is under attack, and that the reason that conservatives are so eager to lash out against it has to do with an anti-modernist bent.  This is especially true when you understand that science really is a threat to religion.  A lot of people say it’s not, because science doesn’t address “spiritual”  needs, but said folks are really overrating the importance of spirituality for most people---or assuming that this urge isn’t better scratched by loving others and enjoying life.  Religion really draws its power from explanation.  It gives order to the world.  And science is poaching that territory rapidly, which pisses off authoritarians, because they rightfully understand that if they lose the power to create facile goddidit explanations for everything from gravity to the problem of evil, they will lose their power over people. Thus, the attack not just on specific scientific theories, but on science in general, and most of academia, as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The latest installment is Bill O’Reilly’s war on gravity. Or, specifically, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/06/oreilly-god-causes-tides_n_805262.html" title="his belief that goddidit is a better explanation"&gt;his belief that goddidit is a better explanation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;the tides&lt;/i&gt; than the real explanation, which is that they’re created by a combination of moon and Earth gravity.  He had this exchange with David Silverman, president of the American Atheist Group on his show:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’REILLY: I’ll tell you why [religion’s] not a scam, in my opinion: tide goes in, tide goes out. Never a miscommunication. You can’t explain that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SILVERMAN: Tide goes in, tide goes out?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
O’REILLY: See, the water, the tide comes in and it goes out, Mr. Silverman. It always comes in, and always goes out. You can’t explain that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the problem with this is that 3rd graders can in fact explain that, at least well enough to basically trump the goddidit theory.  You don’t need in-depth knowledge to understand that gravity pulls on the oceans, and they basically slosh around, except with predictable regularity because the moon is predictable.  Once this was pointed out to O’Reilly, he called people who understand the theory of gravity “pinheads” and suggested they hadn’t thought this through, because they totally didn’t know where the moon came from!  Also, &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5750082/bill-oreilly-challenges-scientists-to-explain-how-the-moon-got-there" title="they can&amp;#39;t explain why god gave us a moon"&gt;they can’t explain why god gave us a moon&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t give those uninhabited planets moons.*
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UyHzhtARf8M" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to point out that O’Reilly’s explanation of why you have to believe in god because that means there is “order”.  To which I must point out that this is the authoritarian, patriarchal mind at its best---he wishes to believe that him being on top of others is the natural order, so he creates a parallel fantasy of a white guy in the sky who created everything, and his power is derived from the magical white guy in the sky, because presumably they look alike and are both assholes. Also, said white guy in the sky making all the rules means you don’t have to think any more, just obey.  People who say that religion is about “spirituality” miss this, because really, many religious people like O’Reilly like religion because it makes the universe seem small and orderly.  In reality, the universe is huge and, from the small human perspective, seemingly chaotic, making an atheist understanding of nature ironically more awe-inspiring than any petty god invented by mostly illiterate people from the ancient world. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At one point in this rant, O’Reilly, in an attempt to be satirical, suggests that the non-god explanation is something crazy, like suggesting that a meteor hit the planet and created the moon.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/31/bill-oreilly-tidal-bore/" title="In fact, this is basically what happened."&gt;In fact, this is basically what happened.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we know how the Moon got there (a Mars-sized planet struck the Earth a glancing blow about 100 million years after it formed, splashing debris into orbit which coalesced to form the Moon). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/31/bill-oreilly-tidal-bore/" title="I&amp;#39;d read the whole post by Phil Plait"&gt;I’d read the whole post by Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, who breaks down just how silly this all is.  Basically, we know all the stuff that O’Reilly claims we don’t know: where the Sun came from, where the moon came from, and of course, why other planets don’t have moons.  The answer to that is, they do.  Mars---who O’Reilly says doesn’t have a moon---has two.  If I recall from my days of star-gazing with my dad, Jupiter has like eleven billionty moons.  If you’re trying to make an argument that god loves us special best by looking at moons as evidence, then you have to believe god loves Jupiter most of all.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only move O’Reilly can make now is to attack the theory of gravity, which is how all these other ideas hang together.  Screw attacking Darwin!  It’s time to go after Newton!**  Maybe O’Reilly can work with the Insane Clown Posse on their next big hit single, “Miracles II: Falling Apples, How Do They Work?”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that this expanded war on science from conservatives is going to eventually come into conflict with their support of endless spending on weapons research, some of which requires knowledge of the basics of astronomy and physics that explain how the moon got there and the tides works. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
*Yes, I know.  Finish the post before leaving a comment crowing about how I didn’t note that there are other moons, because I did, in fact, do so later in the post.  I don’t want you to look foolish in your eagerness to demonstrate your swift recall that Mars has two moons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
**Seriously, we all know is more complicated than that, and that Einstein played a role in revising Newton’s theories, etc. Just let that pedantry go for a moment and enjoy the joke.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nasa has released a second batch of planet-scouting data,
revealing that its Kepler Space Telescope has spied earth-sized
worlds, planets in the habitable range and an exciting new
six-planet system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;span&gt;The findings come from Kepler, the world's largest telescope
outside Earth's orbit, during its observation of the sky between 12
May and 17 September, 2009. In that time it studied more than
156,000 stars in a field of view which covered approximately 1/400
of the sky, and has come back with a treasure trove of new cosmic
discoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equates to some 15% of the total. It would have been more but Wales, Scotland and N Ireland don’t want to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that where their plans stop, as some say? Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has already admitted it is just a starting point; they just need the law changed so in future they can sell them off quietly and without debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defra minister Jim Paice MP told a House of Lords Committee last November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wish to proceed with… very substantial disposal of the public forest estate, which could go to the extent of all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to have substantial disposal, we need to change the law. Our lawyers advise us that up to about 15% of the forest could be sold without risk of transgression of current legislation, which requires the Commission to own and manage the public estate. To get beyond that, we would need to change the law. That is the reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the law change required in this exchange (via &lt;a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2011/02/stanley-johnson-the-government-must-be-hell-bent-on-self-destruction-if-it-goes-ahead-with-its-plans.html"&gt;Stanley Johnson&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chair of the Committee: “That’s a once and for all legislative permit, that you will never again as a Department have to come back for future sales of forestry or such?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defra civil servant: “That is the intention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State, Mrs Spelman: “The Public Bodies Bill is an enabling Bill on the reform of a wide range of arm’s-length bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chair: “So you will never, ever again have to come and ask permission?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State, Mrs Spelman: “We should not have to, no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chair: “So this is our one and only chance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defra civil servant: “Yes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rot (excuse the pun) has already started. It is likely this will be used as an excuse to push the plans forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times reported today:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Millions of trees will be threatened by disease under the Government’s plan to cut Forestry Commission funding and privatise public woodland, according to an internal document leaked to The Times. Deer and other wildlife will be neglected and charging could be introduced for many recreational facilities to which the public now have free access, the report says.  The commission announced yesterday that it would cut more than 400 jobs&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported &lt;a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/02/02/govt-plans-jobs-cuts-in-forestry-and-makes-plans-for-asset-sales/"&gt;on the job cuts here&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the best example of how Conservatives plans are much more driven by free market ideology than necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sunny Hundal</name></author><gr:likingUser>12361057045150344313</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Liberal Conspiracy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://liberalconspiracy.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296756401408"><id gr:original-id="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=11874">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc66b21a9f9a6b0f</id><category term="photography"/><title type="html">Libby Bulloff</title><published>2011-02-01T19:30:46Z</published><updated>2011-02-01T19:30:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=11874" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.warrenellis.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Haven’t run a shot by &lt;a href="http://exoskeletoncabaret.com/"&gt;Libby&lt;/a&gt; in ages.

With the weaselly amateurism we’ve wearily come to expect. Probably waiting for the nod from the Americans. &lt;a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/catch-up/display/playlistref/010211/clipid/010211_HAGUE_01"&gt;Here’s Foreign Secretary William Hague on Channel 4 news last night&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Snow: There is surely something inconsistent about Britain being perfectly happy to call for the removal of Saddam Hussein and indeed for Mr Milosevic in Yugoslavia. Why is it not possible for Britain now to say that this one too should go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague: You can see there the difference that someone like Milosevic was a danger to the peace of Europe and of other nations. Here President Mubarak clearly has accumulated this enormous unpopularity, the huge demand for change that you’re seeing on the in the streets, but has not been a danger to the peace of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not to the peace of the world merely to Egyptians, at least 300 bullet-riddled corpses of who have been passing through the country’s morgues in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the way Saddam was ignored in Hague’s answer. Is that an implied admission that he wasn’t ‘a danger to the peace of Europe and of other nations’? And you know something? The Mubarak regime &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; has a nuclear programme along with chemical weapons production facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like &lt;a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/human-rights/around-the-world/google-map"&gt;this map on the Foreign Office website&lt;/a&gt; showing ‘some of our human rights work around the world’. We are asked to ‘click on one of the pins to view our work in a particular country’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chickyog.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fco_human_rights_map.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.chickyog.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fco_human_rights_map.jpg" alt="fco_human_rights_map" title="fco_human_rights_map" width="450" height="296"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now? Egypt doesn’t have a pin.&lt;/p&gt;

And, hey, maybe one day every single person in the country can be underpaid by the same company that's the only one they can afford to buy necessities from. Honestly, do people like him really think that some people are "under-served" and others aren't for just no reason at all?&lt;/blockquote&gt;IOZ answers:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like a lot of collegegraduates and newyorktimesreaders, Matthew Yglesias has picked up a vague language of socioeconomy, a sort of loose vocabulary cobbled together from the business press, Brad Delong, and Nobel Paul Krugman, recipient of the Rhinegolden Nordic Memorial Guilty Conscience Pseudoprize for Piggybank Essayism.  Perhaps he read a Michael Lewis book somewhere along the way.  He is self-convinced, because he is able to deploy a somewhat particularized economics argot, that he understands "economics," but like so many collegegraduates who have never worked in a business, who took Econ 101 but never learned what to them appears a lower-order, secretarial skill like, oh, say, the basic principles of accounting, the actual movement and recording of money continues to elude him.  He understands graphs, but not budgets; He has opinions on quantitative easing, but give him a deal, a couple of partners, some income streams, some shared expenses, and a blank Excel sheet, and he will stare in mute incomprehension.  Don't forget to do the cash rec, Matty!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, to the world's Yglesiasses: yes, some people and communties are "under-served" for effectively no reason at all.  Oh, they understand that some kind of vague tidal forces of inequality and inequity are at work; especially in minority communities, they may prattle half-sympathetically about, oh, the legacy of Jim Crow or whatever.  The end of manufacturing and the decline of labor does not especially concern them.  What these people need are the new skills to win the future of the economy today for the children of tomorrow.  Ethan bitterly jokes that "every single person in the country can be underpaid by the same company that's the only one they can afford to buy necessities from," but that's being unkind to Yglesias.  Only half of the country will be underpaid by the same company that's the only one they can afford to shop at.  The quarter of the country above that will get paid to update their twats, and the quarter above that will work for Goldman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The so-called mom-and-pop model of manufacture, wholesale, distribution, and retail that WalMart et al. have destroyed did make a pound of sugar or a pair of jockey shorts a bit more expensive relatively speaking, but because actual human beings were employed throughout the entire nodal system of production, distribution, warehousing, wholesaling, further distribution, and retail sales, the modest relative increase in final retail price could be offset by the distribution of income throughout the entire system.  I guess in the eyes of a DC think-tank scumbag this whole thing reeks of "inefficiency," but a world of Ben Franklin general stores seems to me to be far preferable to a world in which there are a dozen Walton family billionaires and a billion &lt;a href="http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/"&gt;people of WalMart&lt;/a&gt;.  To an Yglesiass, there is no correlation between these things, obviously; that the destruction of traditional modes of production and distribution in order to sell more crap for less has not only lowered prices, but lowered income, driving more people to buy the cheapest shit possible, causing corporate retail to behave in an even more predatory manner when it comes to pricing by making up for in volume what it loses on the margins, is totally beyond his capacity to understand.  In part, this is because he is an privileged, oblivious dickhead whose encounters with the less fortunate consist of watching &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt; and yipping about social realism.  In equal part, this is because for all his &lt;i&gt;superbandant&lt;/i&gt; recent discovery of the obfuscatory language of economics, the most complex encounters he's ever had personally with money consist of balancing a checkbook and filing a 1040EZ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To return to those "under-served communities," I think it is worth noting that Jim-Crow style apartheid was a crude and blunt instrument, and that the twined drug-war penal system and "service" economy economic segregation are no less destructive but far more resistent and resilient.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24057986-8288797242538556895?l=whoisioz.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WhoisIOZ/~4/39zDpy_O8QU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>IOZ</name></author><gr:likingUser>13300774910269985315</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>08091802778031262378</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://whoisioz.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://whoisioz.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Who Is IOZ?</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://whoisioz.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry></feed>
