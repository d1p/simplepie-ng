Incorporating anything from shells and buttons to broken cups and old CDs, Gardner's growing mosaic became an icon of the neighborhood. <br />
Gardner began the project to "make a celebratory statement," without much consultation from her neighbors. But since her mosaic has grown, the neighborhood has come out in full support of the work, even going as far as to bring her new materials to work with. With the help of the community, the mosaic has stretched up to the second floor windows on the house. Gardner has even begun to cover the iron fence in front of her house as well. <br />
Up close, the mosaic is a swirling mass of colors and textures. But from far away, the incredibly detailed patterns and faces emerge. When Gardner is not working on the facade of her house, she is a teacher at Yeshiva University, and is always willing to talk about her work and her house with curious onlookers.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/mosaic-facade">Read more about Wyckoff Street Mosaic on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections">Museums and Collections</a>, <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/miniatures/microminiature-art">Microminiature art</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities">Architectural Oddities</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york/brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york">New York</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states">US</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/aboychuk">aboychuk</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Installed everywhere from Japan to the Wisconsin Dells, Fisher has confused and frustrated his patrons throughout his entire career. <br />
With a firm belief in the excitement of being lost in a maze, Fisher has designed mazes in 30 countries, and is credited with inventing the corn maze. Along with his successes in outdoor labyrinths, since 1990, Fisher has focused his time on mirror mazes, which he considers the most challenging and filled with seemingly endless corridors. While most mazes simply have a right or wrong turn and a few dead ends, in mirror mazes "Most of the false turns are actually impossible journeys through a sheet of glass." <br />
In 1994, Fisher designed the mirror maze in Peaugres Safari Park, which he named Labyrinthe des Dragons. The maze was constructed with angled mirrors to give the impression of endless possibilities, and reflect the lost maze adventurer. As a quirky addition, Fisher also installed live fish tanks in the maze. When reflected, the fish add a layer of movement, further confusing those wandering the labyrinth. <br />
Throughout his career, Fisher has set a number of world records and is considered an innovator in his field. He has built half of the world's mirror mazes and had his hand in mazes across the world for the last 35 years.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/labyrinthe-des-dragons">Read more about Labyrinthe des Dragons on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/mazes">Mazes</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Created with over 32,000 lead pieces, each under an inch high, the museum chronologically documents the most important battles of human history. <br />
Beginning in the early 1960s, Carlos Royo-Villanova collected every miniature soldier he could find. Roman warriors with red plumage and long shields stood face to face with members of the Tsar’s army. His collection grew to 35,000 pieces, and in 1984 the city of Jaca purchased the collection and began a display. In 2001, the collection was moved to its current home in the Jaca Citadel, where the Ministery of Defense authorized the creation of the Military Miniatures Musem. <br />
At the museum, visitors walk through 23 dioramas from vastly different parts of world history. Although the museum covers world events, the general focus is on Spain’s involvement including the local Kingdom of Aragon. With the intention of educating, the last few displays show modern military activity by the Spanish army. For those who cannot make the trip to Spain, the  museum’s website  offers a live stream of the displays.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/museo-miniaturas-militares">Read more about Military Miniatures Museum on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/unique-collections">Unique Collections</a>, <a href="/category/miniatures">Miniatures</a>, <a href="/category/miniatures/small-worlds-and-model-towns">Small Worlds and Model Towns</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Yugoslavia was taking shape under Josip Broz Tito and as the German and Italian tanks rumbled out of the region Tito ordered monuments to be built commemorating Slavic victory in World War II. <br />
Today in the town of Korenica - near the border between Croatia and Bosnia - a huge monument stretches out over an open field. Little is known about the wing-shaped monument. Commemorating Yugoslavia's victory in World War II, it symbolizes a new found freedom for the people of Yugoslavia. <br />
Of course, as it was commissioned by Tito, the authoritarian leader who ruled Yugoslavia for the next 60 years, the symbolism can also be read not as wings of freedom, but lines of Tito's power spreading over the Balkan region. In this context the monument represents both the end of Nazi's in Yugoslavia, and the beginning of a new dictatorial era.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/korenica-monument">Read more about Korenica Monument on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/unusual-monuments">Unusual Monuments</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/strange-statues">Strange Statues</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/kosovo/korenice">Korenice</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/kosovo">Kosovo</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

New megachurches often lack the beauty of religious institutions of the past, and new temples tend toward functionality rather than grandiosity. <br />
The Sanctuary of Truth is an exception to the rule, with a curious modern take on classic Thai temple architecture. Began in 1981, as a reaction to the Cold War, according to the temple philosophy, as egotistical people attempted to tear the world apart using modern technology, the temple would serve as a counterpoint.<br />
The Sanctuary of Truth towers 345 feet above the beach and covers 3,200 square meters. Every inch of the temple is carved delicately out of wood and manages to bring together a number of disparate beliefs of Southeast Asia. Each inch features a carved wooden sculpture, which are said to reflect the ancient knowledge of the world.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/sanctuary-of-truth">Read more about Sanctuary of Truth on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/curious-places-of-worship">Curious Places of Worship</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/outsider-architecture">Outsider Architecture</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/thailand/bang-lamung">Bang Lamung</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/thailand">Thailand</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Qenqo Temple located in Cusco, Peru | The side of the megalith" title="The side of the megalith" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/temple-of-qenqo.13453.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/temple-of-qenqo">Qenqo Temple</a></h3><b>Death rituals and sacrifice inside a Peruvian megalith</b></p><p>The Incan Empire was completely destroyed by European forces in the 16th century. Many of their massive temples, fortresses and cities were left standing, but without any clues as to their purpose. Qenqo Temple, fifteen minutes from Cusco is similarly mysterious and a dark account has formed in the historical vacuum. <br />
In Quechua, Qenqo means labyrinth or zig-zag and the temple is named for the crooked canal cut out of its rock. Although it is clear the canal carried some sort of liquid, researchers have been forced to guess at its purpose, and at what liquid it transported. Hypotheses range from carrying holy water, chicha (corn beer), or blood. All three indicate that Qenqo was used for death rituals, possibly to embalm bodies or detect whether a person lived a good life by the course the liquid followed. <br />
Qenqo is a unique temple in its construction as well, having been entirely carved out of a gigantic monolith. Stretched across a hillside, the temple is carved out of rock and marries the man-made tunnels with natural chambers. One of these chambers features 19 small niches and is set up as an amphitheater. Once again, the purpose of the theater has been lost over time, but most agree the area was used for some type of sacrifice to the sun, moon and star gods who were worshipped at the site. <br />
From the information available, it appears Qenqo Temple was an extremely holy site for the Incas. Their dead were judged and possibly embalmed in Qenqo’s winding tunnels, and blood sacrifices were offered to the heavenly gods. Despite the probable grisly purpose of the temple, its carved tunnels and chambers are an amazing work of ancient architecture, and a trip to Qenqo is sure to turn the wheels of mystery inside every visitor.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/temple-of-qenqo">Read more about Qenqo Temple on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations">Cultures and Civilizations </a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/rites-and-rituals">Rites and Rituals</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/lost-tribes">Lost Tribes</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/incredible-ruins">Incredible Ruins</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/south-america/peru/cusco">Cusco</a>, <a href="/globe/south-america/peru">Peru</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

No catastrophe befell the small farming town, and no earth-shattering natural disaster struck. There was a smattering of invasion and disease, but mostly, Serjilla simply melted away into the landscape, forgotten yet preserved in time. <br />
Known as the Dead Cities of Syria, a series of 800 small villages from the 5th century are remarkably preserved and give the world clues to life in a small Byzantine farming community. Serjilla is only 50 miles Southwest of Aleppo, and is one of the best kept of the Dead Cities. <br />
Founded in 473 C.E, Serjilla was a small but prosperous agrarian town. Like all the villages in the area, Serjilla produced olives, olive oil, grapes, wine and wheat. Fruitful trade routes ran through the area and the people lived a modest Christian life with little luxury or grand monument. Archeologists who have studied the area have pointed to this modesty as a defining characteristic of the city, and have viewed the town as an average farming town from 1500 years ago. <br />
In the 7th century, as the Umayyad dynasty began to gain power, trade routes shifted out of the area and the Dead Cities were slowly abandoned. There were some attacks during the time from Arab invaders. However, the migration from Serjilla and its neighbors was mainly based around economic concerns. <br />
Today, the ruins feature many structures of the ancient town, including a Christian church, two-story villa and a small building with an olive press. Although the city was not abandoned in chaos, the many have remarked on the eerie setting around Serjilla and the absolutely barren landscape that surrounds it.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/serjilla">Read more about Dead City of Serjilla on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/ghost-towns">Ghost Towns</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/syria/khirbat-serjilla">Khirbat Serjilla</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/syria">Syria</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

The yellowing trees stood out prominently against the surrounding evergreens to form the illegal symbol of the Nazis. Visible only from the air, the swastika had stood in the forest for 60 years before it was finally discovered. <br />
After locals realized the existence of the 100-tree swastika during an aerial survey in 1992, they took immediate action to destroy it. In 1995, half the trees were cut down to render the symbol unrecognizable. Despite efforts to destroy the site, German tabloids posted a picture 8 years later showing that the yellow swastika was still very much alive, as some of the trees had begun to regrow. In 2000, 20 more trees were removed, leaving no trace of the illegal symbol. <br />
It remains unclear who planted the symbol, although it is known that it was created during Hitler's peak in the 1930s. Most say a forest warden zealous for the Nazi party, or possibly coerced planted the trees. Some also assert that a group of Hitler Youth were instructed to carry out the forestry. <br />
While the symbol in Germany is now gone, a similar tree-formed swastika was discovered in Kyrgyzstan near the base of the Himalayas. Although also planted under mysterious circumstances, it is suggested that the 60-year-old trees were formed into a swastika by German prisoners of war, hoping to defy their Soviet captors. <br />
Even with vigilant removal of living swastikas, it is clear the legacy of the Nazi regime will not leave without a fight. Stumps from the Brandenburg swastika could retain the image as the forest grows, and only one year ago a cornfield was stomped into the symbol as well by neo-Nazis.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/site-of-the-forest-swastika">Read more about Site of the Forest Swastika on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/horticultural-marvels">Horticultural Marvels</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/germany/zernikow">Zernikow</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/germany">Germany</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

In its history, the seam has covered a total area of 6.5 km, making it the oldest continuous coal fire in the world. <br />
Coal seams are extremely common across the world, and at any time there are more than 1000 burning. They happen frequently in lesser-developed mineral rich countries, but are often put out within a few days or at most a month. Considering the average duration of a coal seam fire, Mount Wingen’s fiery longevity has become something of a wonder across the globe and tourists have flocked to see the sulfur-tinged smoke emanating from the mountain. <br />
Although Mount Wingen has attracted tourists in droves, it has also caused massive ecological damage to the area’s vegetation. The path of the fire has left a barren and rocky trail, with no traces of life. Most assumed the fire was caused by volcanic activity, but it is now clear coal was ignited by a lightning strike or brushfire thousands of years earlier. The area is administered by NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and is a natural reserve.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/burning-mountain">Read more about Burning Mountain on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders/fiery-wonders">Fiery Wonders</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/oceania/australia/wingen">Wingen</a>, <a href="/globe/oceania/australia">Australia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Facebook_530873109">Facebook_530873109</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Baconao Park located in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba | Animals graze below the massive dinosaurs (Flickr/raunov)" title="Animals graze below the massive dinosaurs (Flickr/raunov)" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/el-valle-de-la-prehistoria.13179.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/el-valle-de-la-prehistoria">Baconao Park</a></h3><b>Roam Cuba with life-sized dinosaurs</b></p><p>Santiago de Cuba is known as the “Cradle of the Revolution.” The southern city holds a claim to fame in Cuba for being the staging area for Fidel Castro’s raid on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. Although the raid led to Castro’s arrest, it is accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. <br />
With this nationalist framework, Baconao Park 20 km from Santiago de Cuba has developed as a microcosm of Cuba’s history and culture. Although at times the attractions in the park seem unrelated and even a little bizarre, they all recall one of the glories of Cuba’s past and they start from the very beginning. One of the main highlights of the park is the Valle de Prehistoria, a few acres of tropical vegetation complete with 200 roaming dinosaurs of the Jurassic Period. Adding to the strangeness of the exhibit, the dinosaurs were all constructed by inmates from a local prison. <br />
Moving chronologically through history, the park also features a lush lagoon and a typical village of the Taino, a pre-Colombian Caribbean people. Visitors can pull up to the Taino village and grab drinks at the bar before taking a dip at the beach nearby. Along with a range of natural history, Baconao also has a collection of 2,500 miniature car models and a museum dedicated to the attack on Moncada. <br />
Although the attractions scattered over 330 square miles draw many visitors, Baconao’s focus is always the revolution. Granjita Siboney, a small farm on the land, is the very place where Fidel and his rebels planned their July 26th movement. The farm includes artifacts from the rebels such as weapons, uniforms and what Santiago de Cuba’s tourist website describes as “countless memories of those days.” <br />
Baconao is filled with untold mystery and a strong Cuban pride and sense of nationalism. How these ideas exactly relate to miniature cars and models of dinosaurs is unclear, but thousands of visitors from across Cuba seem to understand well enough.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/el-valle-de-la-prehistoria">Read more about Baconao Park on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/cuba/santiago-de-cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/cuba">Cuba</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

The walls are bedecked with bright red fabric and imposing wooden chairs form a semi-circle around a marble operating table in the center of the room. <br />
Despite its likeness to a sacrificial chamber, the Sala Gimbernat was actually a renowned anatomical amphitheater. Although a bit grisly in its nature, the amphitheater was used to teach anatomy through the dissection of human corpses. Students and scholars would line the room's stadium seating as a full dissection was performed before their eyes. The theater was created for use by the Royal College of Surgery of Barcelona, which trained many of Catalan's doctors during the 18th century. <br />
Built in 1762, the Sala Gimbernat is one of the oldest surgery theaters in Europe. Its old-world splendor complete with stained glass and golden fixtures can still be toured today during a short span on Wednesday mornings.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/sala-gimbernat">Read more about Sala Gimbernat on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/strange-science">Strange Science</a>, <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/medical-museums">Medical Museums</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Monument to the Victims of Fascism located in  | Three massive steles commemorating the victims of the Nazis" title="Three massive steles commemorating the victims of the Nazis" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/monument-to-the-victims-of-fascism-kaunas.14138.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/monument-to-the-victims-of-fascism-kaunas">Monument to the Victims of Fascism</a></h3><b>A memorial to the murdered Jews of Kaunas</b></p><p>Fort IX in Kaunas has played host to two occupying powers. Tsarist Russia constructed the fort as a stronghold used to defend Russia’s border in the West, and the Soviet Union used the fort as a way station to the Gulag. However, the Soviets held the fort for only one year, until the Nazis invaded Lithuania in 1941, sending Soviet troops scattering back to the border. <br />
At the turn of the century, Kaunas had a flowering Jewish community. 1/3 of the 75,000 people in the town were Jews and the town was considered a cultural and learning capitol of the Jewish world. Prior to World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population totaled 220,000, a very significant portion of the population. <br />
Unfortunately, the Nazi occupation of Fort IX brought tragedy to the community. A ghetto was set up in Kaunas, eventually holding 40,000 Jews. During the entire course of the war, only 500 Jews escaped, many joining the army to fight the Nazis in Southern Lithuania. <br />
Immediately after its occupation, the fort was used for mass killings of Lithuanian and German Jews. In 1941, the first mass killing of German Jews took place in the forest behind the fort. The atrocities continued through the war, and between 35,000-50,000 Jews were murdered at Fort IX in Kaunas. Many were placed in unmarked graves they were forced to dig themselves. 2,000 Jews also perished in the Kaunas ghetto when the Nazis destroyed it with explosives in 1944 as they were losing ground. <br />
In 1958, a small memorial was placed in the field behind Fort IX to memorialize the horrifying loss of Jewish life in Lithuania and Kaunas. Sadly, it took another 33 years before the current monument was erected. In 1991, the remaining Jewish community of Kaunas unveiled three massive steles designed by Alfonsas Ambraziūnas.The current Jewish population of the entire country of Lithuania stands at 3,200.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/monument-to-the-victims-of-fascism-kaunas">Read more about Monument to the Victims of Fascism on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/unusual-monuments">Unusual Monuments</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/strange-statues">Strange Statues</a>, <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/disaster-areas">Disaster Areas</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Storm King Art Center located in New Windsor, New York, US | A sunny day at Storm King Art Center" title="A sunny day at Storm King Art Center" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/storm-king-art-center.14460.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/storm-king-art-center">Storm King Art Center</a></h3><b>100 massive sculptures in the Hudson River Valley</b></p><p>With 500 acres, Storm King Art Center can hardly be called a sculpture garden. As its 100 installations interact and even change the grounds of the Art Center, it is more aptly described as a sculpture landscape. <br />
In 1960, Ralph E. Ogden opened a small museum for local painters an hour north of Manhattan. Within a few years, the picturesque setting around the museum had begun a transformation, quickly attracting the sculptures and installations of a number of famous artists including Roy Lichtenstein and Isamu Noguchi. As steam built for the creation, the Storm King Art Center began receiving more art donations, as well as some installations made specifically for Storm King.<br />
As the grounds of the living museum swelled to 500 acres, the park took on a new life, weaving itself into the rolling landscape. Storm King Art Center spent the next 40 years, developing a philosophy of integrating art and nature. <br />
No work better sums up the philosophy and style of art at Storm King than Maya Lin’s “Storm King Wavefield.” The massive installation created for the grounds, is composed of seven giant man-made hills that appear to move. Giving the grounds a dynamic illusion of motion, the “Wavefield,” is not just on the grounds, but a part of them, swaying with the breeze and set dramatically against the hills and woodlands around Storm King. <br />
Although large installations dominate Storm King, the museum itself houses nine galleries and a wide variety of works. Consistent with the idea of improving and blending into the landscape, the museum is extremely aesthetically pleasing and is housed inside an 85-year-old chateau. Visitors are invited to come and wander the grounds, interacting with the art and the scenery simultaneously.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/storm-king-art-center">Read more about Storm King Art Center on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/strange-statues">Strange Statues</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york/new-windsor">New Windsor</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york">New York</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states">US</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/aboychuk">aboychuk</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Coming into port in Spain, Hernan Cortes and his conquistadors brought the spiced treat with them after pillaging the Mayan and Aztec empires of Central America, where cocoa beans had been used to create chocolate variants for over 3,000 years. <br />
In honor of this trans-Atlantic transfer, the Barcelona Confectionary Guild has set up the Chocolate Museum to tell the story of chocolate and its modernization. Although the history section of the museum is in no way perfect, visitors get a general trajectory of chocolate’s evolution, moving from bitter water, to the stunningly detailed sculptures that fill the museum. By using the statues to visibly depict the modern use of chocolate innovation, the arc of the history of chocolate feels fairly complete. <br />
Upon entrance to the museum, guests are greeted by a massive white chocolate ape named Snowy, along with their own chocolate bar as part of their admission. As they gnaw down the confectioner’s chocolate, guests walk past glass-covered sculptures made entirely of chocolate. The sculptures include some famous cultural icons such as Minnie Mouse and Louis Armstrong. However, the bulk of work focuses on Spanish architecture, proudly featuring Sagrada Familia, one of Gaudi’s famous houses and creatures from Parc Guell. <br />
Combining history, the world’s favorite treat and a small dash of Spanish pride, the museum offers something for every chocolate lover.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/chocolate-museum">Read more about Chocolate  Museum on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/unique-collections">Unique Collections</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/spain/barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/spain">Spain</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Standing at three miles above sea level, the rocky path has been used as a highway for the ancient pre-colombian civilizations of Peru for hundreds of years. <br />
Miles above the Colca Canyon on the pass to Arequipa, are a series of cairns known as Apachetas. Roughly translated from Quechua, Apacheta means "the source where the flow begins," and marks high points along the mountain path. However, the real value of Apachetas was spiritual, and the piles were used to commune with a higher power while miles above the sea in the mountains. The cairns were built up as more travelers passed the spot.<br />
The stones were picked up and carried along the trail, and then placed on an Apacheta as a sacrifice to the gods. Apachetas were seen as having supernatural powers, and connecting with them through a prayer was said to bring good luck and protection while on the trail. Prayers were often said to Pachamama, the god of the sky, soil and underworld. Those who did not have a rock to carry, often left other belongings behind as a sacrifice. These included coca leaves, shells and even alcohol and sweets. <br />
Hundreds of Apachetas were built, and served as altars to guide people along the path. Today, entire fields on the trail between Arequipa and Chivay are covered with the cairns, some stacked shoulder level and higher. Combined with the bizarre Yareta plants that grow along the arid rocks, the trail takes on a seriously martian landscape set to a dramatic background of volcanic mountains.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/apachetas-of-alto-de-chivay">Read more about Apachetas of Chivay on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/strange-statues">Strange Statues</a>, <a href="/category/inspired-inventions/marvelous-maps-and-measures">Marvelous Maps and Measures</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/lost-tribes">Lost Tribes</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/curious-places-of-worship">Curious Places of Worship</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/incredible-ruins">Incredible Ruins</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/south-america/peru/puente-el-inca">Puente El Inca</a>, <a href="/globe/south-america/peru">Peru</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Opened in 2001, the 5 Pointz is an outdoor graffiti space, where aerosol artists are given free reign and freedom from arrest. Even without police interference, the 5 Pointz is not home to mayhem and anarchy. With 200,000 square feet of surface to paint, the warehouse is curated by artist Jonathan Cohen who schedules times for artists to work and requires a sample from aerosol painters wishing to add their work to the warehouse. <br />
Since opening more than 10 years ago, the 5 Pointz has connected a diverse group of artists from around the world, and has even attracted celebrities to its stylized exterior. Named for the five boroughs of New York, the warehouse has become a center of the graffiti world.<br />
Unfortunately, the space's prime location in Long Island City could result in its demolition in the next few years. Although the owner of the building has allowed for the art to flourish, a plan for development into two residential high-rises, could the life of the rogue public art project that has become an icon in New York.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/5-pointz">Read more about 5 Pointz on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york/long-island-city">Long Island City</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/new-york">New York</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states">US</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/aboychuk">aboychuk</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

The meteorite pieces, which reached speeds of 40,000 km per hour, created twelve craters that are still visible today. Though most of the craters have eroded and become lined with plantlife, their footprints create an interesting diversion from the surrounding flat Australian desert landscape. A 1.5 km path winds around the largest craters, which are best viewed at sunset and sunrise.<br />
Today, the area is a protected reserve, with rustic camping facilities available. Visitors can expect only long drop toilets and fire pits, and all water and firewood must be brought into the reserve. Most visitors will have the Australian desert to wander without interruption, as this piece of desert is visited by only a handful of guests each day. If you're camping overnight, you will be rewarded with utter silence and a night sky filled with more stars than can be counted.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/henbury-meteorites-conservation-park">Read more about Henbury Meteorites Conservation Park on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/oceania/australia/henbury">Henbury</a>, <a href="/globe/oceania/australia">Australia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Sporkster">Sporkster</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

After beginning to drive erratically, she crashed and was killed in the ensuing wreck. After her death, her father had dreams of what she saw the night she drove. Over the next forty years, he set about to memorialize her tragic death with massive reflector-covered windmills.  <br />
A wrecked car on a dirt road running alongside Acid Park supposedly gave further testament to this story, and built a lasting urban legend. In truth, the park was simply the creation of Vollis Simpson who referred to his creation as "whirligigs." They were not created in memorial, but as public art for drivers to enjoy. Simpson does have a daughter, but she is alive and well, making her existence the only truthful part of the tale. <br />
The windmill-like structures are built with scrap parts from old cars and reflectors, with eight total in the park area. The whirligigs are a tremendous example of individual creativity and recycling. Since their creation, the whirligigs have achieved a certain notoriety, with four of them being installed in Atlanta for the 1996 Olympic games. They can be viewed along the road near Acid Park. Although entrance to the area is considered trespassing, many have reported that Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are gracious enough to show visitors around the park. Just don’t ask about Mr. Simpson’s alleged daughter and her harrowing experience with LSD.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/acid-park">Read more about Acid Park on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments">Unusual Monuments</a>, <a href="/category/memento-mori">Memento Mori</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/north-carolina/wilson">Wilson</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/north-carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states">US</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/burningsaviour">burningsaviour</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

However, her shoe collection totaling more than 1,000 pairs was her pièce de résistance. <br />
Known as the Iron Butterfly, Marcos and her family ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from the mid 1960s until her exile in 1986. During that time, their unprecedented wealth earned them the world's distaste, and her shoe collection became a symbol of an evil regime that used the people to enrich themselves. Today, a part of Marcos' shoe collection can be seen at the Marikina Shoe Museum. <br />
Marikina is known as the shoe capitol of the Philippines, and fittingly holds Marcos' collection as well as the Guinness Record for the World's Largest Pair of Shoes. The vast majority of the collection held at the Shoe Museum, 749 pairs to be exact, was from Marcos' personal wardrobe. Strangely, the museum has placed a portrait of her near her collection as well. Considering her legacy, a portrait commemorating and almost honoring her opulence seems bizarre.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/museum-marikina">Read more about Marikina Shoe Museum on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/unique-collections">Unique Collections</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/philippines/marikina-city">Marikina City</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/philippines">Philippines</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

With a wide range of options, the hotel lets guests escape the heat of Cappadocia in seven naturally cooled cave houses with 30 different rooms. <br />
Situated in the Ayvali Village of  Cappadocia, visitors get the opportunity to stay overnight in the local architecture; caves cut right into the soft volcanic rock. After recently upgrading some of the rooms of the hotel, guests now have their choice to stay in one of 28 standard rooms or the Byzantine and Roman King Suites. Both rooms radiate opulence and provide a unique opportunity to engage with the history of the region while traveling in style. Both the Byzantine and Roman Empires occupied Cappadocia at one time. <br />
The Byzantine suite is located thoughtfully next to a 1000-year-old Byzantine cave church, and also features a private sauna, minibar and large-screen LCD television. Straddling the line between luxury and history seems to be the modus operandi of the Gamirasu. Whatever a traveler desires, the hotel offers, as it is strategically situated in the center of the historic region of Cappadocia.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/the-gamirasu-cave-hotel">Read more about Gamirasu Cave Hotel on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities/odd-accommodations">Odd Accommodations</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/turkey/nevsehir">Nevsehir</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/turkey">Turkey</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

La Scarzuola is the work of Milanese architect Tomaso Buzzi who acquired the property for his own dreamland in 1956. <br />
Buzzi began working on La Scarzuola to create a complex representing the ideal city. His vision intended to blend reality with surrealist architecture and fantasy. His architectural styles are varied and range from Classical to Medieval and even Renaissance, all completed with a personal flair from the artist. Buzzi's flair tended toward the surreal, and La Scarzuola shows his influences with stairways leading in multiple directions, along with a few fantastical statues of creatures and headless naked women. <br />
His work spans the body of surrealism from Dali and Miro to M.C. Escher, echoing their dark works in his immense compound. All together, the compound has seven small theaters, multiple grottoes and reflecting pools, and even a replica of the Arc de Triomphe. Each work is carefully constructed to represent the inner thoughts of the artist, as well as a blend of the philosophical tenets that guided his life. Although the styles and buildings change by the meter in the compound, his overall surrealistic approach is defined especially through the random scattering of quotes and strange symbols placed in La Scarzuola. <br />
Considered the artist's autobiography, La Scarzuola is deeply personal and those familiar with the artist will find him in every brick laid in the compound. After his death in 1981, his nephew continued to work on La Scarzuola, eventually completing the vision his uncle had for his ideal city.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/la-scarzuola">Read more about La Scarzuola on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/curious-places-of-worship">Curious Places of Worship</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/outsider-architecture">Outsider Architecture</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

The lake is a "perched lake" meaning it exists well above the water table and is thus comprised of pure rainwater only. <br />
This unique environment, along with the high levels of acidity in the lake, makes the water unsuitable for nearly all forms of plant and fish life. Without natural waste from plant and animal life, the lake is extremely pure. Strangely enough, the lake is too pure to sustain natural life that would otherwise inhabit its waters. Along with the clean water, the sand around Lake McKenzie is pure silica, giving the beach a shimmering white color.  <br />
Unfortunately, human introduced compounds, such as sunscreen, soaps and lotions, which wash off bathers' bodies is a growing concern and could degrade the pristine blue lake.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/lake-mckenzie">Read more about Lake McKenzie on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders/watery-wonders">Watery Wonders</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/oceania/australia/tyroom-roads">Tyroom Roads</a>, <a href="/globe/oceania/australia">Australia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Sporkster">Sporkster</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Turda Salt Mine located in Cinepesti, Romania | Interior of Turda Salt Mine" title="Interior of Turda Salt Mine" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/abandoned-turda-salt-mine.13712.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/abandoned-turda-salt-mine">Turda Salt Mine</a></h3><b>Table salt and halotherapy beneath the ground </b></p><p>As with many natural resources in Europe, the Romans were the first to the table. They began excavating Turda Salt Mine in the 2nd century and after the fall of the Roman Empire, other regional powers continued mining, picking away at the 3 billion tons of salt and creating the space for a massive underground world. <br />
Turda Salt Mine, aside from its gigantic size, is fairly straight forward in its history. Explosives were never used to hollow the mine, and it was all done by hand or machine, making its size more impressive. One of the many halls of the mine measures a massive 260 by 130 feet with 160-foot ceilings.<br />
After being abandoned in 1932, the mine reopened for tourists in 1992. Thanks to a $6 million renovation, the Salt Mine is now a large tourist draw for halotherapy, a treatment for allergies and asthma that uses the ionized air, pressure and humidity of the caves. The effects of salt caves were first discovered during a study of miners with improved breathing ability in the  Wieliczka Salt Mine. <br />
Along with the spa attraction inside the caves, some of the old mining equipment has been converted to lead visitors through on tours. One of the most prominent features is a panoramic wheel that lets tourists see the stalagmites that have formed over the cave’s 1000-year history. A small lake in the mine also offers the opportunity to paddle around the highly textured salt caves. <br />
As the cave has grown in popularity over the last 20 years, it has attracted a number of high-profile visitors. Rumors have even circulated over the last few months that the new Christopher Nolan-directed Batman film will be shot heavily in the mine, with Turda acting as the new Batcave. On opening night, moviegoers should look for Turda Salt Mine’s characteristic old mining equipment and damp, cavernous surroundings.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/abandoned-turda-salt-mine">Read more about Turda Salt Mine on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/wonders-of-salt">Wonders of Salt</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/curious-caves">Curious Caves</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/subterranean-sites">Subterranean Sites</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/romania/cinepesti">Cinepesti</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/romania">Romania</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Houses are pushed precariously close to the edge of a 160-foot drop off, and wind along the cliff looking over the countryside and rivers that flank the town below. <br />
Inhabited for over 1000 years, the town’s narrow streets still carry the characteristics of its medieval origin, and the city center features ramparts that fortified the town during the civil war. Many houses and streets in the city center are also built of the dark, volcanic rock that serves as a pedestal for the town. The main street of Castellfollit winds through the entire town narrowly pressed between houses on both sides, straining to remain on the cliff face. <br />
From its peak on the layered, volcanic formation, the town offers stunning views. To both sides, the rivers Fluvià and Toronell amble by the rock face of the town through the volcanic zone of Garrotxa. To add to the drama of the landscape, the cliffs are illuminated from sunset until midnight for six months out of the year.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/castellfollit-de-la-roca">Read more about Castellfollit de la Roca on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/spain/castellfollit-de-la-roca">Castellfollit de la Roca</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/spain">Spain</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

According to Corbu, the priest, Bérenger Saunière had discovered something of great material wealth and power. <br />
Since the exact nature of the treasure was a mystery, an explanation vacuum was created and conspiracy quickly filled the void. Overnight, the treasure was anything from jewels and gold to some document or proof that would damage the Catholic Church forever. The latter became the focus of visitors to the town, and attracted an opportunistic Parisian named Pierre Plantard. <br />
Plantard used the chance to popularize the Priory of Sion, which was allegedly a 1000-year-old secret society, founded in Jerusalem during the first Crusade. With the intent of restoring a Merovingian order across Europe and fulfilling prophecies of Nostradamus, the Priory became one of the most discussed orders in the world during the 1960s when Plantard proposed the idea. <br />
Unfortunately, the Priory of Sion was not real. It was never real, and was in fact an elaborate hoax. He created a number of false documents and led the world to believe a secret society existed. These claims were later picked up in bestselling books, and most notably, in the “Da Vinci Code.” Despite the excitement generated by Plantard's claims, the order was completely debunked.<br />
However, while the myth was destroyed, the small commune of Rennes-le-Château was changed forever. Thousands of tourists poured into the town, whose native population had hardly reached 100. Excavations were performed looking for treasure and clues to the world’s biggest conspiracy theory. Today, even after all conspiracies have been proven false, hundreds search Sainte Marie-Madeleine Church and other buildings in the village for clues proving the sleepy town is in fact more interesting than it really is.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/rennes-le-chateau">Read more about Rennes-Le-Château on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/hoaxes-and-pseudoscience">Hoaxes and Pseudoscience</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/repositories-of-knowledge">Repositories of Knowledge</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Castle of  Wewelsburg located in Wewelsburg, Germany | Triangular Wewelsburg Castle, where Nazi leaders strategized their attack on Europe" title="Triangular Wewelsburg Castle, where Nazi leaders strategized their attack on Europe" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/infamous-castle-of-wewelsburg.14270.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/infamous-castle-of-wewelsburg">Castle of  Wewelsburg</a></h3><b>Magical Nazi castle of the SS</b></p><p>In 1933, Heinrich Himmler signed a 100-year lease for the 17th-century Wewelsburg Castle. At that point in time, the interior of the structure was badly decaying, but Himmler saw potential in the triangle-shaped hilltop castle for use as a training facility for the SS, which he commanded. <br />
Many prominent Nazi leaders harkened back to mythology and legend to influence their plans for world domination. Himmler himself was fascinated with prophecy and magical power. Desperately wanting to set up a facility to teach these values to SS soldiers, Himmler began working to turn Wewelsburg into a non-military training facility focused on the occult, pagan rituals and making Wewelsburg the center of the world. <br />
Himmler viewed Wewelsburg as the Grail Castle, and believed that when the Nazis were the rulers of the entire world, artifacts from the castle would radiate magical power. Much work was put into acquiring such artifacts as the Spear of Destiny, which Hitler himself had claimed showed him his future. <br />
Along with artifacts from around the world that the SS were working to acquire, Wewelsburg became the center of a number of pagan rituals led by Himmler. Although the exact nature of the rituals are unknown, it is clear that baptism-like rituals took place, and a former cistern in the castle was turned into a crypt also used for ritual. After the Allies took control of the castle, a round table with 12 chairs was also discovered, an obvious reference to King Arthur and his knights.<br />
During the 12 years that the SS had control of Wewelsburg, the castle was far from finished and the grand plans Himmler had in mind were not completed. Himmler had hoped to design a castle with a circular fortification around the hill, and a gigantic moat. To create the moat, the SS had ordered the evacuation of the surrounding town, and were intending on flooding the entire valley around Wewelsburg. <br />
Due to the massive amount of work, Himmler also set up his own private concentration camp, formed mostly of criminals, prisoners of war and Roma people to use as slave labor in restoring the castle. The camp, called Niederhagen, held 4,000 people of which more than half died. As the Nazis were losing the war, Himmler ordered the castle demolished and a fire was set inside. <br />
Although most of the interior was destroyed, the exterior walls were preserved and Wewelsburg was turned into a museum for reflecting on the horrors of the Nazi regime and Himmler’s bizarre plan for world domination.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/infamous-castle-of-wewelsburg">Read more about Castle of  Wewelsburg on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/rites-and-rituals">Rites and Rituals</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/curious-places-of-worship">Curious Places of Worship</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/eccentric-homes">Eccentric Homes</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/germany/wewelsburg">Wewelsburg</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/germany">Germany</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Inakadate Tanbo Art located in  | A god of fortune depicted in the field (Flickr/chrissam42)" title="A god of fortune depicted in the field (Flickr/chrissam42)" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/inakadate.14423.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/inakadate">Inakadate Tanbo Art</a></h3><b>Giant art made in Japanese rice fields</b></p><p>For over 2,000 years, people in the small town of Inakadate, Japan have grown rice. Unfortunately, growing rice was all the town was known for until 1993. In a near desperate attempt to generate attention and tourist revenue, the townspeople began working on a public art project. <br />
By embracing their agricultural past, and adding a little 20th century technological know-how, Inakadate was able to create massive living art, made out of colored rice stalks. Called Tanbo (Paddy) art, the designs are wondrous. Spanning entire fields, the rice paddy art takes 1,200 people from the community and $35,000 to create. But the end result is an amazing multi-colored design, stretching hundreds of feet and featuring incredible detail. <br />
In 1993, the first work of art was only a depiction of a mountain, using a few colors. Since then, the town has become much more bold, even incorporating multiple fields to create a dramatic battle scene between a monk and a samurai. Each year the rice is planted and a new image is created. For the most part, the images reflect Japanese culture and traditions. However, in an attempt to draw more tourists to the town, the Mona Lisa was also attempted in 2003. <br />
To provide the full effect for the designs, the town invested in a small 20 meter observation deck in front of the fields. On the tiny deck, 200,000 visitors per year come to marvel at the artistic fields. Given the success of the project in Inakadate, other rural Japanese towns have followed suit, creating other Tanbo art in a similar fashion, incorporating words and pictures to add flavor to their work. <br />
Although the fields have been a massive tourist draw, a 2010 NY Times article reported that the town has still not generated as much revenue as they had hoped, and have had to ask for donations to keep their Tanbo art alive.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/inakadate">Read more about Inakadate Tanbo Art on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/horticultural-marvels">Horticultural Marvels</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Blue Whale of Catoosa located in Township of Catoosa (inactive), Oklahoma, US | Smiling blue whale of Catoosa (Flickr/Caveman Chuck Coker)" title="Smiling blue whale of Catoosa (Flickr/Caveman Chuck Coker)" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/catoosa-whale.14417.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/catoosa-whale">Blue Whale of Catoosa</a></h3><b>Nature's biggest mammal swims in landlocked Oklahoma </b></p><p>Hugh Davis built the Blue Whale of Catoosa for his wife as a 34th wedding anniversary present in 1972. Since then, the smiling whale has greeted visitors cruising down Route 66 and become a major hub for visitors passing through Oklahoma. <br />
Although Davis had his wife in mind when he built "Blue," he was also considering the neighborhood children. Prior to building the whale, Davis had built two petting zoos, one filled with cats and the other, known as the "Ark," filled with reptiles. After noticing children swimming in a pond near their property on Route 66, Davis decided to build the whale as a gift to his wife, and as a swim dock for children looking to dive and slide into the old pond. <br />
The Davis' maintained the whale through the 1980s and even had a small concession stand at the pond. However, after Hugh Davis passed away, the whale began to fall into disrepair and was not restored until 1988, when his son Blaine took up the project. Fixing damage from vandals and repairing the decaying cement, Blaine Davis restored the happy whale, and it has now smiled at visitors for 40 years.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/catoosa-whale">Read more about Blue Whale of Catoosa on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/strange-statues">Strange Statues</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/oklahoma/township-of-catoosa-inactive">Township of Catoosa (inactive)</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states/oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/globe/north-america/united-states">US</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

This centuries-old tradition stems from trying to avoid fear. Many believed it was easier to climb to the peak if the ground was hardly visible in the darkness of night. <br />
Although Huashan takes no climbing expertise to ascend, it is considered the most dangerous hike in the world. To reach the North Peak, stone steps have been carved from the mountain at an impossibly steep incline. Although technically a set of steep stairs, the way up the peak is more akin to a ladder, requiring a slow and deliberate climb. On both sides of the treacherous steps are chains, which are the only safety precaution available to climbers. <br />
While the climb to the North Peak is only meant for the boldest visitors, the most dangerous hike available on Huashan is a horizontal climb from the North to the South Peak. The trek actually follows a narrow wooden outcropping next to the cliff face, barely wide enough to accommodate two feet in hiking boots. Once again, only a chain stands between the climber and a mile-high drop off. Over the years, the trek between peaks has claimed the lives of many visitors, causing Chinese authorities to work to improve safety on the peaks. <br />
Despite the dangers, people have been climbing to the North Peak for over 2000 years, and Huashan is regarded as one of the most sacred Taoist mountains in China. It is believed that spirits and a god live on the mountain and on many parts of the mountain, there are small Taoist shrines and temples frequented by pilgrims and hermits. <br />
The dangers of hiking Huashan are very real, and visitors should take precaution when climbing. Visiting during the winter months can also be treacherous due to ice and snow on the steep climb to the North Peak.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/huashan">Read more about Huashan Mountain on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/china/hua-shan">Hua Shan</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/china">China</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Dylan">Dylan</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

There is everything on the menu, ranging Asian specialties, to American standbys like steak and pizza. Overall, Craters is not that remarkable as a restaurant. However, Craters is remarkable and is immediately set apart from other cheap eateries, by the giant bomb shells flanking the patio seating. <br />
For those who visit without any knowledge of history, the decor seems a bit off-putting, but with a little background, begins to make sense. The city of Phonsavan was absolutely pummeled during the Vietnam War. The American military was convinced Vietcong were escaping the country into Laos through Phonsavan. In response, American forces dropped 500,000 missiles onto the surrounding area, making it one of the most bombed places in the world. <br />
In the aftermath of the war, people moved back to Phonsavan and began rebuilding, often using the remnants of bombs in their construction. Craters opened up, ironically to serve Western backpackers from the very country that left Phonsavan in ruins. Essentially, Craters is a kitschy exploitation restaurant, playing on the war-torn past of the city to either deliver a socially-conscious message, or bring in tourists desiring to be photographed in front of the restaurant.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/craters-restaurant">Read more about Craters Restaurant on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/disaster-areas">Disaster Areas</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities">Commercial Curiosities</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities/bizarre-restaurants-and-bars">Bizarre Restaurants and Bars</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/laos/ban-phonsavan">Ban Phonsavan</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/laos">Laos</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Yet very little information is available on the stunning and minuscule dwelling. <br />
Situated in the center of a dormant volcano in Olot, Spain, the crater seems to open up to reveal a tiny stone shack. There is not a single building in the depressed area, just the hermitage. Covered in dense vegetation on all sides, the shack is bizarrely situated on flat arid land in the middle of the formation. <br />
The region is well known for its volcanic zone and is regularly visited, but there is almost no information on the hermitage.

Worries simply drift away into a calmer state of being. This Buddhist ethos is perfectly portrayed in Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram, a temple with a giant reclining Buddha. <br />
Unlike monuments to other spiritual figures, the Buddha is not supposed to create feelings of sadness or loss. Instead, the 100-foot-long golden Buddha is meant to inspire, showing all of those who follow in his path the supreme happiness achieved from nirvana. Sprawled across the entire temple, the Buddha is slightly smiling and natural light shimmers off of his gold and white finish. <br />
Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram is actually a Thai temple, and is not directly connected to Malaysia in origin. The temple was built in 1845 by a Thai monk, and has been a location of serious Buddhist devotion since. Many of the most devoted to the temple have had their ashes placed in niches behind the massive Buddha statue. There they rest and accompany the smiling and tranquil Buddha after their death.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/wat-chaiya-mangalaram-buddhist-temple-penang-malaysia">Read more about Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/giant-buddhas">Giant Buddhas</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/asia/malaysia/pulau-tikus">Pulau Tikus</a>, <a href="/globe/asia/malaysia">Malaysia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/JBHewlett">JBHewlett</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Built directly into the rocky cliffs surrounding the town, its whitewashed houses melt into the rolling hills of Andalucía. <br />
Although it is only a town of 3,000 people, Setenil de Las Bodegas has played an important role throughout Spanish history. There is record of people living in the town since the Roman invasion 2000 years ago. Although inhabited, Setenil de Las Bodegas was not developed until the 12th century by the Moors, who used the cliffs as natural protection to fortify the city. <br />
During the Christian Reconquest, the Moors held the city against repeated Spanish attacks. According to some translations, Setenil de Las Bodegas refers to seven attacks from the Spanish on the town. The Moors withstood six, and finally lost the cliff-side stronghold on the seventh. <br />
Other translations hold that the name refers to the underground storage facilities used to hold the locally produced wine, which has become a major tourist draw to the quiet town. Whatever the translation, most travelers make their way to Setenil de Las Bodegas for the rocky setting. Boulders hang precariously between many of the winding streets, often creating natural roofs for the homes and stores in the town. <br />
Most amazingly, one large overhang covers an entire block of white houses, providing shade and natural cooling during warm summers in southern Spain. Even more remarkable, are homes built on top of the overhang, giving the town layers of houses separated by natural rock formation. On a walk through the town, the cliffs and homes work together so naturally, it is difficult to see whether the town formed around the boulders or vice versa.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/setenil-de-las-bodegas">Read more about Setenil De Las Bodegas on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/eccentric-homes">Eccentric Homes</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/spain/setenil-de-las-bodegas">Setenil de las Bodegas</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/spain">Spain</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Pinocchio Park located in Collodi, Italy | Pinocchio's face in the landscape of the park" title="Pinocchio's face in the landscape of the park" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/pinocchio-park.13679.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/pinocchio-park">Pinocchio Park</a></h3><b>Walk through a fairytale in Tuscany</b></p><p>Carlo Collodi published the first Pinocchio story in 1883, introducing the puppet and his extending nose to Italian audiences. <br />
Although Disney’s version from 1940 featured the same basic premise as the original, Collodi’s Pinocchio was a dark fantasy tale that posed an entire different world than the story that was embraced by families and children throughout the 20th century. In Pinocchio Park, near the town of Collodi, visitors can wander through this dark world, envisioned by the original author. Born Carlo Lorenzini, his pen name was actually taken from his mother’s place of birth, Collodi, Tuscany. Today, a park near the town pays homage to the writer and his story. <br />
In 1951, the concept of creating a monument to Pinocchio was presented, and 84 artists from around Italy submitted works for approval. Although only a few were chosen, the Pinocchio Park was born. In 1956, the park opened its doors, featuring a wide range of artistic expressions of the classic story. As the park evolved, artists added a number of mediums, working with mosaics, statuary and even fountains. <br />
The most popular work in the park is the fountain of the Terrible Dogfish, a creature envisioned by Collodi and portrayed as a whale in the Disney film. Visitors can actually stand inside the monster to simulate the capture of Pinocchio by the great sea beast. Given the variety of the works, Pinocchio Park works to properly portray and honor the great story Collodi penned before the turn of the century. <br />
Walking the winding paths of the Park, visitors can lunch amidst the adventures of the wooden hero in the Land of the Toys and Pinocchio Village. Each detail of the park is meant to involve visitors in the classic tale. As a word of warning for vain tourists, telling lies on the park’s premises is not advised.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/pinocchio-park">Read more about Pinocchio Park on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/unusual-monuments/peculiar-fountains">Peculiar Fountains</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/horticultural-marvels">Horticultural Marvels</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/italy/collodi">Collodi</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/italy">Italy</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Cumbe Mayo and Los Frailones located in Cajamarca, Peru | Los Frailones or Stone Monks in Cumbe Mayo" title="Los Frailones or Stone Monks in Cumbe Mayo" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/stone-forest-los-frailones.13485.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/stone-forest-los-frailones">Cumbe Mayo and Los Frailones</a></h3><b>Pre-Incan aqueduct amidst a stone forest in Peru</b></p><p>11,000 feet above the sea in the Peruvian Highlands, a 3,500-year-old aqueduct cut out of volcanic rock snakes down hills and valleys toward the city of Cajamarca. <br />
Built by an advanced pre-Inca society around 1500 B.C.E, the Cumbe Mayo, which translates to thin river, is thought to be one of the oldest man-made structures in South America. It carefully follows the grade of the land, draining water from the hills’ melting snow, to the arid cities in the valleys below. As water was a scarcity, it was worshipped by the Cajamarca people thousands of years ago, and every drop was carefully collected.  <br />
Besides the aqueduct, which is cut from the volcanic rock around it, a number of petroglyphs on the structures and in surrounding caves provide some insight into the culture that built the infrastructure. <br />
Towering above the Cumbe Mayo, are Los Frailones, the Stone Monks. Los Frailones are massive volcanic pillars, some stretching as high as 60 feet. The stone forests suddenly appear from the landscape, starkly contrasting the flat, tree-less plains around Cajamarca. Many of the pillars, carved by wind and rain have taken on new shapes, resembling hands and even animals, and allowing the mind to wander in the pristine Peruvian setting. <br />
Although the stone forests and ancient ruins of pre-Incan society give the area a beautiful and almost spiritual dimension, it is hard to overlook Cajamarca’s tragic history, as the location where Spanish forces slaughtered the Incas, thousands of years after Cumbe Mayo was constructed.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/stone-forest-los-frailones">Read more about Cumbe Mayo and Los Frailones on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a>, <a href="/category/inspired-inventions/retro-tech">Retro-Tech</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/lost-tribes">Lost Tribes</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/incredible-ruins">Incredible Ruins</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/south-america/peru/cajamarca">Cajamarca</a>, <a href="/globe/south-america/peru">Peru</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Kadykchan located in Kadykchan, Russia | Soviet-style apartments decaying in the city (Flickr/Магадан)" title="Soviet-style apartments decaying in the city (Flickr/Магадан)" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/kadyckchan.14329.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/kadyckchan">Kadykchan</a></h3><b>Siberian ghost town built by gulag prisoners</b></p><p>This might not surprise anyone, but Kadykchan, a Russian mining town a few clicks below the Arctic Circle, is completely unpopulated. More people might be surprised by the fact that Kadykchan has only been unpopulated for two years. <br />
Built in the 1930s by Gulag prisoners, the town of Kadykchan was constructed in the modern Far Eastern Federal District around the coalmines in the region.  After the Gulag prisoners were released in 1960, many stayed in the Russian Far East to continue living in the cities and working in the mines. <br />
Considering that the Far Eastern Federal District boasts only 2.5 people per square mile and permafrost cuts the growing season to three months, Kadykchan did not exactly grow into a vibrant metropolis. However, the population slowly grew and hit a peak in 1986 at 10,000 people, fairly respectable by Siberian standards. <br />
Unfortunately, the town was hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union, and subsequent devaluation of coal. Throughout the 1990s, a steady stream of Kadykchan residents left for larger cities. In 1996, an accident in the mine killed 6 people and was the final straw. Throughout the post-Soviet era, the population of Kadykchan dropped from over 10,000 people, to under 300 in 2007. Since many of the residents left very quickly, Kadykchan is now eerily filled with relics of its past. Posters still hang on walls, books are flung about on coffee tables and broken-down cars still haunt old garages. <br />
A bust of Lenin is also still visible in the town, although fairly decrepit at this point. It seems only a matter of hard winters before the father of the Soviet party crumbles with the rest of Kadykchan.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/kadyckchan">Read more about Kadykchan on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/ghost-towns">Ghost Towns</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/russia/kadykchan">Kadykchan</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/russia">Russia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

In the 1930s, the area was still productive farmlands, but poor farming practices resulted in the creation of the rolling martian landscape. <br />
As dirt and vegetation was worn away by the elements, the landscape was left with exposure of the Queenston shale below the surface farmland. Unfortunately, the shale supports little or no vegetation and has left the area as barren badlands. The reddish hue of the Badlands is caused by iron oxide, while narrow greenish bands show where groundwater has transformed the rock from red to green iron oxide.<br />
Care should be taken while visiting as this area is very fragile. Visitors should not climb on the hills after a rainfall or when the ground appears soft. Violation of this unwritten rule will also result in a nasty reddish dirt stain that most travelers work to avoid while on vacation.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/cheltenham-badlands">Read more about Cheltenham Badlands on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/natural-wonders">Natural Wonders</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/martian-landscapes">Martian Landscapes</a>, <a href="/category/natural-wonders/geological-oddities">Geological Oddities</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Facebook_28106485">Facebook_28106485</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

The little they left standing, they mislabeled with incorrect European designations with no oversight from the cultures they were trampling. The Horca del Inca is a perfect example of Spanish colonial misrepresentation. <br />
Horca del Inca, which means Gallows of the Inca, is not a gallows, and was not made by the Inca. Actually, the Horca del Inca was a pre-Incan astronomical observatory, built during the 14th century by the Chiripa people. The remains of the Horca del Inca was actually a part of seven trilithic structures, positioned to study the sun, moon and stars above Lake Titicaca. <br />
Unfortunately, the other six structures were destroyed by the Spanish, leaving only one of the horizontal beams in place. The purpose of the rock structure was only discovered in 1978, when a researcher noted that the sun shone through a different rock structure onto the cross beam of the Horca during the summer solstice. <br />
With the help of local guides, the steep and dangerous path to the Horca can be traversed for a closer look at the observatory. Once near the Horca del Inca, the hill offers stunning views of Lake Titicaca and Copacabana.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/orca-del-inca">Read more about Horca del Inca on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/inspired-inventions/retro-tech">Retro-Tech</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/lost-tribes">Lost Tribes</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/incredible-ruins">Incredible Ruins</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/south-america/colombia/copacabana">Copacabana</a>, <a href="/globe/south-america/colombia">Colombia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Her life was one of torment until she tragically took her own life just before her 20th birthday. Forgotten by those of her own time, her sad legacy is preserved by a single gravestone in Dartmoor, where she has rested alone for 200 years. <br />
Mary Jay was abandoned by her mother in the late 18th century and given up to a local orphanage. She was given the surname J (stylized as Jay) because she was the 10th girl to arrive at the orphanage. Until her teens Mary was content at the orphanage, living and taking care of the younger children, but living in disgrace as a penniless orphan. <br />
When she grew older, she was sent to Canna farms near neighboring Manaton in Dartmoor to earn money. She was employed to work in the house as help, and also in the field as a laborer. At this point in her life, she was given the nickname Kitty, which had become synonymous with promiscuity. Shortly after she arrived at the farm, she was raped by a male farmhand and became pregnant. <br />
Cursed by the locals as a whore, she was forced to leave the farm, as no one would employ such a woman. With nowhere else to turn, she ended her life by hanging herself in one of the local barns. Since she had committed suicide, she was not allowed to be buried on church land. Instead, she was buried at the crossroads of three parishes, none of which would accept and bury her. <br />
Following her death, stories of haunting began immediately, as locals claimed a hooded figure often knelt by the grave in the moonlight. Legend asserts that the spirit of Kitty Jay haunts her grave and Dartmoor. Besides the ghostly happenings around her grave, fresh flowers mysteriously appear on the grave everyday, with no indication of who places them there. <br />
The tales of the supernatural surrounding the grave has drawn visitors for years, hoping to catch a glimpse of Kitty Jay or the spirits that haunt her lonely grave.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/tomb-of-mary-jay">Read more about Jay's Grave on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/memento-mori">Memento Mori</a>, <a href="/category/memento-mori/catacombs-crypts-cemeteries">Catacombs, Crypts, &amp; Cemeteries</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Dvina Missile Silo located in Plateliai, Lithuania | A launch silo, stretching 100 feet into the ground" title="A launch silo, stretching 100 feet into the ground" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/abandoned-missile-base-r-12u.14149.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/abandoned-missile-base-r-12u">Dvina Missile Silo</a></h3><b>Launch site for nuclear war against Western Europe</b></p><p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union could have hit the United Kingdom with a nuclear warhead with only four minutes warning. There was no time for reaction or defense, placing the entire British island on the edge of destruction at any moment. <br />
In the midst of the placid lakes and thick forests of Žemaitija National Park, is Dvina Missile Base. If an attack on Western Europe had taken place, missiles would have launched from this Russian compound underground in Western Lithuania.  <br />
In 1959, the Soviet Union began construction of the R-12 (Dvina) Missile. Constructed as a medium-range warhead capable of delivering a massive nuclear bomb, the missile marked a sea change in the threat level of nuclear attack during the Cold War. The R-12 is best known as the missiles deployed during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the actual missiles sent to Cuba were moved from a base just a few miles from Dvina.  <br />
Besides a threat to the United States, the R-12 was the largest nuclear threat to Western Europe during the Cold War, and that threat came directly from Dvina Missile Base. With a series of complicated tunnels and four missile silos, the Dvina Base was built in secret during the early 1960s. The Soviet government went to great length to conceal the construction from the United States and Europe, only allowing transportation of materials at night. To keep the project in a small circle and avoid too much attention, soldiers took turns digging the complex in five-man teams.<br />
Construction on the 100-foot deep tunnels finally finished in 1962, and the massive compound stood in secret for almost 20 years. In 1978, United States reconnaissance teams finally discovered the compound, only to find that the missiles had been removed in 1974. Finding the compound abandoned, locals turned the once apocalyptic site into a museum and tours of the tunnels are now available.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/abandoned-missile-base-r-12u">Read more about Dvina Missile Silo on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/inspired-inventions/retro-tech">Retro-Tech</a>, <a href="/category/intriguing-environs/disaster-areas">Disaster Areas</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/subterranean-sites">Subterranean Sites</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/lithuania/plateliai">Plateliai</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/lithuania">Lithuania</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Ga-Adangbe Caskets located in Accra, Ghana | Animal and shoe caskets of the Ga people" title="Animal and shoe caskets of the Ga people" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/Ga-Adangbe-Caskets.14048.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/Ga-Adangbe-Caskets">Ga-Adangbe Caskets</a></h3><b>Elaborate coffins celebrate the dead in Ghana</b></p><p>When members of the Ga-Adangbe in Ghana die, they move into their next life and can affect the living from beyond the grave. To guarantee their smooth transfer into the next world, their ancestors bury them in elaborate coffins, made to symbolize their lives. <br />
In the 1950s, a fisherman from Accra was buried in a fish-shaped coffin. He had made his livelihood from the sea and wanted to move into his next life in a reflection of the being that had supported him. Shortly after the first symbolic fish coffin was built, a number of skilled carpenters popularized the practice around Accra. Seth Kane Kwei, one of the original creators of the coffins, opened the first special workshop dedicated to making the specialized caskets and the trade began to blossom. <br />
Coffins range from representations of careers, such as the fish or a taxicab, to more detailed depictions of the deceased habits. Alcohol bottle and cigarette-shaped coffins depicting the vice of the dead is also not unknown. Anything representing the life of the family member is chosen, and serves as the vessel guiding the to their next life. <br />
Today, the Ga-Adangbe are well known for their coffins, which often appear bizarre to Western visitors used to solemn funerary rights. Although Ga funerals are still a sad event, the unique coffins allow them to celebrate the life of the deceased and cull favor with their ancestors. Even though many Ga have very low income, they spend massive amounts buying specialized coffins, which can cost anywhere from $50 to $600.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/Ga-Adangbe-Caskets">Read more about Ga-Adangbe Caskets on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/memento-mori/catacombs-crypts-cemeteries">Catacombs, Crypts, &amp; Cemeteries</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/rites-and-rituals">Rites and Rituals</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities">Commercial Curiosities</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities/odd-accommodations">Odd Accommodations</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/africa/ghana/accra">Accra</a>, <a href="/globe/africa/ghana">Ghana</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Located on the Red Sea in Northern Sudan, the former port of Suakin is now a crumbled relic of the wealth that passed through its coral walls from around the world. <br />
Ramses III initially developed the port of Suakin during the 10th century B.C.E. At the time, Suakin offered an outlet to the Red Sea for trade and exploration. 1000 years later, as Islam gained followers and spread from the Hijaz region of modern day Saudi Arabia, the port took on new importance and became an outlet for Africans on pilgrimage to Mecca. <br />
While Suakin constantly evolved, it remained prosperous throughout its existence, bringing great riches to the shores of Sudan. Local legend tells of a king who operated out of the old city and had 360 wives and lavish quarters in the old city. Stemming from its great wealth, Suakin developed into a rich, gated island port. Every building was made out of stunning coral and the walls were decorated in detailed wood and stone coverings. Suakin was the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea. <br />
During the 19th century, Suakin evolved for the last time, becoming a hub for the slave trade from Eastern Africa. As the slave trade diminished, the port became increasingly unnecessary. By the 1920s, Suakin was falling into complete disrepair. Shallow waters and rough coral had pushed most trade North to Port Sudan and the coral buildings that were once the crown jewel of the port were not maintained and disintegrating. <br />
Only ruins of the once great coral city still exist and are carefully guarded as part of the tourism industry. Besides being a tourist destination, the port still serves ferries to the Saudi coast and provides access between the continents for thousands of pilgrims completing the Haj every year.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/suakin">Read more about Suakin Island Ruins on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/incredible-ruins">Incredible Ruins</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/outsider-architecture">Outsider Architecture</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/africa/sudan/fort-sphinx">Fort Sphinx</a>, <a href="/globe/africa/sudan">Sudan</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Image of Necropolis of the Banditaccia located in  | Etruscan tombs with mountains in the backgroudn (Flickr/Nelima)" title="Etruscan tombs with mountains in the backgroudn (Flickr/Nelima)" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://static.atlasobscura.netdna-cdn.com/images/place/necropoli-etrusca-della-banditaccia.14213.main.jpg" /><h3><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/necropoli-etrusca-della-banditaccia">Necropolis of the Banditaccia</a></h3><b>Largest necropolis in the Mediterranean </b></p><p>The Necropolis of the Banditaccia evolved in a similar way to many cities, even though its residents were dead. As Etruscan culture changed and advanced over a period of 600 years, their burial structures in this massive city of the dead followed suit. <br />
Just outside the modern city of Cerveteri in Rome Province, the sprawling 1000 acre complex began. 3000 years ago when Etruscan society was beginning to flourish, the simplest tombs were just small pits and holes, where ashes of the dead were kept. From there, the city expanded, requiring more architecture and even a bit of city planning. <br />
Soon, they moved to build burial mounds scattered around the site, diversifying the landscape and creating an expansive city beneath the mountains in the background. The mounds neatly tied nature to man, as they were often carved out of living rock or built out of earth. As the Etruscans grew even more powerful moving into the 6th century B.C.E, they began to make streets lining the area. Along the two main streets of the Necropolis, they built rows of square tombs, each housing the remains of important people from their society. <br />
Resulting from these changes in burial style and architecture, is a whole city, built over 600 years. The slight changes in burial show impressive changes in power and wealth as well as custom, as the Etruscan civilization plunged toward their demise in the first centuries before the Romans overwhelmed them militarily. <br />
Easily accessible from Cerveteri, the entire area has been dedicated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/necropoli-etrusca-della-banditaccia">Read more about Necropolis of the Banditaccia on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/memento-mori/catacombs-crypts-cemeteries">Catacombs, Crypts, &amp; Cemeteries</a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations">Cultures and Civilizations </a>, <a href="/category/cultures-and-civilizations/lost-tribes">Lost Tribes</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/radicalmatters">radicalmatters</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Used by both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union during their control of Latvia, Karosta Prison was used solely to crush the spirit and free will of everyone who entered a cell on the property. <br />
Today, guards still walk the halls, and courageous people still occupy the cells, even though the prison has been obsolete since 1997. Instead of prisoners, tourists now roam the prison grounds, looking for a bizarre experience replicating that of a Latvian prisoner in the 20th century. <br />
On a visit to Karosta, visitors can take a quick guided tour, or spend a night in one of the cold, barren cells that broke the spirit of many soldiers in the past. For the full experience, tourists are given prisoner garb and interrogated, then harassed by prison guards wearing military uniforms. To complete the simulation, guards even lock tourists into their cells for their night in Karosta Prison. <br />
As a note of warning, not all of the guards are completely fluent in English, and as such, American visitors are often surprised by the amount of abuse they actually receive. Before embarking on the full prison experience tour, tourists are warned that disobedience in the prison could result in insult or worse, physical punishment by means of exercise or cleaning. <br />
Aside from a curiosity of prison life in the former Soviet Union, some visitors journey to Karosta to experience a haunting. According to Ghost Hunters, Karosta Prison is one of the most haunted sites in Europe, and allegedly, hundreds died within its walls.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/karosta-prison-hotel">Read more about Karosta Prison Hotel on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/crime-and-punishment">Crime and Punishment</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities/odd-accommodations">Odd Accommodations</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/latvia/liepaja">Liepaja</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/latvia">Latvia</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Although the concept is off-putting at first, the eggs have been standard street fare in Dongyang in Zhejiang Province for hundreds of years. <br />
The process for making Tongzi Dan is similar to making other types of boiled eggs, such as tea eggs. Just instead of tea or water, the eggs are soaked in urine. After being brought to a boil in the steaming urine, the eggs are removed, their shells are cracked and they are placed back into the boiling urine to soak up flavor. Residents of Dongyang have described the powerful smell of the process as both rejuvenating and completely disgusting. <br />
Most people in Dongyang fall into one of those camps, either swearing by the unmatched taste of the egg, or staying fifty feet away from the vendors. Besides the taste, many people attest to the medicinal properties of the eggs as well, stating that they increase blood flow and lower internal temperature. While historical studies show that this may hold some weight, doctors in the area do not advocate the consumption of anything boiled in human waste. <br />
Even more amazing than the process itself, is how vendors acquire the urine for boiling. They actually place buckets at primary schools for young boys to pee into. The buckets are then collected through the day and used to make the delicacy. For the most part, the practice is accepted throughout primary schools in Dongyang. However, boys who are sick are asked to refrain from using the buckets, to keep the process of boiling eggs in urine as hygienic and healthy as possible.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/bizarre-boiled-eggs-tong-zi-niao-jidan">Read more about Tongzi Dan: Boy Eggs on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities">Commercial Curiosities</a>, <a href="/category/commercial-curiosities/bizarre-restaurants-and-bars">Bizarre Restaurants and Bars</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/"></a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Sorel is a self-taught architect and designer who typically works with found objects to create bizarre and often minimal living spaces. <br />
Referred to passionately by the artist as a "love nest," The Star of Love is a spherical metal contraption dangling from trees and supported only by a series of wires. Initially, the structure had a much darker intention and was going to be made to resemble Darth Vader's star base. Sorel even tentatively named the project L’Etoile de la Mort, the Death Star. In the end, he optioned for a fur-lined interior and only vent-like windows, making it more "love nest," than Imperial stronghold. <br />
Permanently installed in deep nature in the beautiful region of Auverge in France, The Star of Love is has little else other than the countryside in all directions. With a backdrop of forest and local volcanoes, it is a modern and unique dash of industrial art upon the landscape. For those interested in the technical details of the Star, the plans are available on Mr. Sorel's Myspace page.<br />
It is only visible during the summer, if it has not yet been sold. In 2009, Sorel auctioned the Star of Love, along with a few other creations. It is unclear whether the structure has been purchased and moved from its location in Auvergne.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/l-etoile-de-l-amour">Read more about L'Etoile de l'Amour on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/eccentric-homes">Eccentric Homes</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/outsider-architecture">Outsider Architecture</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/france/job">Job</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/france">France</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/Facebook_1020106339">Facebook_1020106339</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>

Since the late 1500s, The Lost Gardens of Heligan belonged to the Tremayne estate evolving and becoming more extravagant with each passing generation. One head of the household inspired the jungle gardens, while another requested that giant rhododendrons be cultivated. Although the Tremayne family often inspired new additions to the garden, they were above manual work and hired countless low-paid gardeners to take on the tasks of improving and maintaining the gardens. <br />
Throughout the 19th century, the gardens thrived, growing larger and requiring greater staff to manage them. Before the outbreak of World War I, the Tremayne estate employed 22 gardeners. Many of those loyal gardeners went to fight, and after the war their numbers had diminished so that the gardens fell into severe disrepair. As the rest of the estate was rented out, the gardens became an afterthought and were not rediscovered until the 1990s. <br />
Their rediscovery by a distant relative of the Tremayne estate, led to a widely publicized attempt to bring the gardens back to life. The restoration of the Heligan Gardens was undertaken by Tim Smit, the same architect who conceived The Eden Project, the largest Greenhouse complex in the world. <br />
Under his innovative and watchful eye, the Heligan Gardens were restored to their original size. Besides restoration, floral art was commissioned as well, resulting in the Giant’s Head and the Mud Maid, a sleeping woman of the forest made out of wood, grass and earth. As the gardens quickly became a tourist attraction, the gardens also served to bring life back to St. Austell, and some of the other neighboring towns in Cornwall. <br />
Today, the spectacular gardens feature everything that they were once renowned for including massive rhododendrons, Italian gardens and the jungle gardens.

Many women still even walk the harbor streets dressed in the traditional pointed bonnet and floral dress. It’s a town proud of its heritage and every detail of every building reflects that tradition. <br />
In the Volendam museum, the traditional details continue with a dash of artistic flash. Next to the main building of the museum is the cigar band house, a collection of mosaics made entirely from cigar bands. The cigar band project began in 1947, when a local artist began collecting and assembling the bands into designs. Over the years, he collected 11 million bands, creating vibrant scenes from Volendam of people in traditional dress, sailors and fish in the harbor. <br />
Beautifully reflecting the Dutch lifestyle, the work found its permanent home in the Volendam museum in 1995, where mosaics cover the walls and even the tables of the rooms.</p><p><a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/cigar-band-house">Read more about Cigar Band House on Atlas Obscura...</a></p><p><small>Category: <a href="/category/museums-and-collections/outsider-art">Outsider Art</a>, <a href="/category/architectural-oddities/eccentric-homes">Eccentric Homes</a><br>Location: <a href="/globe/europe/netherlands/volendam">Volendam</a>, <a href="/globe/europe/netherlands">Netherlands</a><br>Edited by: <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/serflac">serflac</a>, <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/user/atimian">atimian</a><br></small></p>]]></description>
