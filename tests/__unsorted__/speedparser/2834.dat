			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something that I&#8217;m a big fan of when I go to yum-cha is the deep fried salt and pepper whitebait &#8211; pale strips of delicately crispy, fishy, salty goodness. The only thing hampering me from indulging in them is the inconvenience of going to a yum-cha restaurant :/</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsardust.com/?attachment_id=351" rel="attachment wp-att-351"><img src="http://www.tsardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111003-1145211-300x223.jpg" alt="I am salivating ~~D:" title="Whitebait" width="300" height="223" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-351" /></a></p>
<p>This is where <a href="http://www.mizuya.com.au">Mizuya</a> comes in with its novel(ty) touch-screen menu. Every time my friend <a href="http://sirtulka.blogspot.com">Dan</a> and I are in the city, we usually duck in for a beer or two and a plate (or two) of their delightfully crunchy whitebait (they name them silverfish on their menu). The real kicker is that they&#8217;re served sprinkled with flecks of nori on top which is the bestest addition that could be made for them. Sadly, they tend to be a little under-salted, so order a side of salt to serve. </p>
<p>Suffice to say, I am ridiculously addicted to these and would be quite happy if there was a possibility of me having a bucket of these to munch on whilst sitting in front of the telly watching a movie or waiting during load screens ;D</p>

<p>I turned a year older on Friday, and, for once, my birthday didn&#8217;t end up being too bad at all.  Work people surprised me with a giant cupcake and one of the girls at work spoiled me with not one, but TWO Illamasqua pure pigments from their <i>Theatre of The Nameless</i> range!  I had to stay back though because I got pulled into a meeting which went for like two and a half hours or something.</p>
<p>When I finally escaped the office, I ran to the QVB&#8217;s bathrooms to fix my face despite one of my friends asking if I could just use the shotgun to put it on as he was already at <i>La Bodeguita Del Medio</i> waiting for everyone else.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of my friends turned up to celebrate which was really awesome.  I had a few too many cocktails and I think I&#8217;m friends with one of the bartenders now after we traded fake-eyeglasses o_O</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also upgraded my moisturiser to prepare for what may be an onslaught of wrinkles.  Hoping Biotherm&#8217;s White D-Tox moisturiser will do the trick.  It feels very nice on my skin even though I find its scent a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>Hoping this year will produce some win.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had originally wanted to see Duncan Jones&#8217; <i>Moon</i> at the Moonlight Cinema in Centennial Park at the beginning of last year but things didn&#8217;t pan out and I couldn&#8217;t find anyone who wanted to see it with me. I was in JB Hi-Fi the other day in search of <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> (I was unsuccessful, however for some reason there were plenty of copies of <i>The Man With The Screaming Brain</i>), came across <i>Moon</i> on the shelf and recalled that once upon a time, I really wanted to see that film.  Also, it was ten bucks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_341" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 393px"><a href="http://www.tsardust.com/?attachment_id=341" rel="attachment wp-att-341"><img src="http://www.tsardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/moon.jpg" alt="" title="Moon" width="383" height="224" class="size-full wp-image-341" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The shots on the moon&#039;s surface are simple, yet evocative. (Image © Sony Pictures)</p></div> I think this has to be one of the best science fiction films in recent years and it demonstrates how a film of this genre can be excellently produced without the use of CGI.  Oh yeah, and Clint Mansell produced the score (can&#8217;t wait to hear what he&#8217;ll do with <i>Mass Effect 3</i>. I can&#8217;t believe some fans were up in arms that he was composing the music for it en lieu of Jack Wall).</p>
<p>Reviewing <i>Moon</i> is a bit redundant since it&#8217;s been out for two years and there are already scores of reviews floating about the Internet.  In short, it is a beautiful, bittersweet film about a man coming to terms with loneliness, homesickness, and his identity, with a solid performance(s?) by Sam Rockwell.  </p>
<p>I might also have to pick up the poster for it, too.</p>

It was nice of her to have taken the time to visit us and she bought us some jewellery and gave us each a little L&#8217;Oréal pack as she works in their head office in Clichy.  We had lunch, another teary goodbye and went back to the hotel to drop our stuff off.</p>
<p>We decided to do the Galeries Lafayette and the big Printemps store across the road from it.  Didn&#8217;t end up buying anything as it was the end of the big sales and there was not much good stuff left.  We ended up having some delicious afternoon tea at the Ladurée inside Printemps.  I had a salted caramel milkshake (divine!) and shared a violet religieuse with my sister along with some tea.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we got ready to head out as we were meeting my cousin Emilie and one of her friends at St Michel to go out.  We went to this really crap place in the Latin Quarter where the water was the same price as the alcohol.  My sister didn&#8217;t really feel like drinking stuff from there and apparently every person at the table had to order a drink.  Because of that, my cousin and her friend couldn&#8217;t order their drinks and they intitially wanted to get one shot each, but get this, the waitress said it was a minimum of two shots that could be ordered per person.  Needless to say, we left without buying anything and we convinced the girls to go to Prescription.  There was a bit of a wait to get in and inside it was really cramped and cosy, but the cocktails were really nice.  </p>
<p>I think my sister and I have really different tastes to Emilie and Virginie because they wanted to take us to Queen which is the last type of club either of us would want to find ourselves in.  My sinuses had started to kick in so we decided to catch a cab and call it a night.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_255" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://www.tsardust.com/?attachment_id=255" rel="attachment wp-att-255"><img src="http://www.tsardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110821-064558-223x300.jpg" alt="SUNSHINE!!!!" title="Le Marais" width="223" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-255" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A tiny little ray of sunshine in Le Marais!</p></div> The aim of the game for our last days in Paris/our holiday is to generally cruise around and browse the shops.  We want to do our own thing since we&#8217;ve already done the family visitation duties (aside from having arranged to meet our aunt Yveline when we had arrived in our first week).</p>
<p>Our plans to visit the catacombs were foiled as we were a bit late and the queue stretched around almost the entire block (this block was a circle and it felt like we were walking around and around until we got to the end of it) and it was moving very slowly.  We decided to cut our losses and catch the Metro to St Paul to browse around Le Marais and sure enough it started to rain!  Luckily, it subsided after about 20 minutes and we were off again.  We spent about an hour in the Diptyque store sniffing all of the candles &#8211; if I had the money, I&#8217;d buy a candle in each of the fragrances.  It was so difficult choosing as we wanted to get a 3-pack of mini candles for mum and a regular sized one each for ourselves.  I eventually settled on honeysuckle.</p>
<p>We had a big plate of falafels swimming in hummus with peppermint tea for lunch and went on a tea-purchasing spree at the Mariage Frères and Kusmi tea stores.  The <a href="http://www.mariagefreres.com">Mariage Frères</a> store in Le Marais is like a really old school tea salon, unchanged from its founding years of the late 1800s and there is a big selection of their standard teas and special editions.  I picked up a tin of <i>Alexandra David-Néel</i> (named after the French explorer).  We then walked by <a href="http://www.kusmitea.com">Kusmi Tea</a> and dropped in, where I ended up walking out with a set of their wellness teas after being intrigued by their <i>Algothé</i> (a blend of green tea, peppermint and seaweed).</p>
<p>As we had tickets for the Moulin Rouge, we didn&#8217;t want to dawdle too long. I was starting to get a sore throat from the dodgy aircon we have in our hotel room.  I&#8217;m going to be so cut if I managed to survive four weeks of mostly troubling weather unscathed only to have fallen sick two days before coming home D: Anyway, we got changed and walked to Pigalle where we ended up being seated all the way up the freaking back!  The champagne served was shit, too, and probably came from Carrefour or something.  I ended up having most of the bottle to myself since I figured it&#8217;d make the show more enjoyable the more drunk I was.  The show itself was pretty corny and we were both confused that there are as many guys as there are girls in the show.  I thought it was all about the ladies! The whole thing was like a Disney movie/musical with boobs with some random guy juggling for 10 minutes halfway through.  We snickered at some of the &#8220;romantic&#8221; song lyrics and wondered what all the non-french-speaking crowd would think if they knew what they meant.</p>
<p>After it was over, we took a little stroll through the seedy strip of Pigalle, ignoring the cries from the numerous kebab store owners trying to get our attention.  The great thing about speaking the language is that we could flick them off easily as they thought we were locals and immediately stopped hassling us.  We stopped at a brasserie in Montmartre for a fairly late night dinner and just got in before the cutoff time.</p>

Our objective was to cram as much as we could in 1.5-2 hours (which is doable depending on how in-depth you want to visit stuff).  Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t have time to check out the Tate, which made me a bit disappointed.  </p>
<p>The hotel minded our bags and from there on we went to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben.  I was genuinely shocked that they charge something like £16 to get into Westminster Abbey under the guise of that it is for maintenance.  That&#8217;s almost 30 bucks, man!  The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona has a legitimate excuse to charge for entrance as it is still being built, but seriously, they should just take example from the Catholics and put a whole bunch of prayer candles for sale inside the church.  If Notre Dame de Paris is free, then this should be, too.</p>
<p>From Big Ben, we went to the Tower Bridge then Trafalgar Square, and back to Soho for lunch.  We ate at <a href="http://www.yauatcha.com">Yauatcha</a>, which is a fancy-pants dumpling restaurant.  The food was good, although a bit too pricey for what you got (think normal yum-cha stuff with a little bit more dazzle).  We took another look at Harrods before returning to our hotel to pick up our bags and catch a cab to St Pancras/Kings Cross Station (no way were we going to lug our suitcases on the tube).</p>
<p>The guy at customs was a bit of a jerk (I&#8217;m sorry if my suitcase is big, heavy and awkward, guy! >:/).  I ended up buying a few bags of assorted chips to take back with me (Hula Hoops, Frazzles and Monster Munch) and we walked down to our carriage which was the last one on the platform and once again struggled to find space with our suitcases.  I slept most of the train ride back to Paris and apparently my sister has some good photos of me sleeping with my mouth open :<</p>
<p>We caught a cab from Gard du Nord to our hotel, the Holiday Inn Garden Court in Montmartre.  Our cab driver was a nice viet guy who actually has relatives in Sydney and told us we should go check out Paris Plage (artificial beaches are set up along the banks of the Seine from the end of July to August) so that we could "tell everyone back home that we went to the beach in Paris and no one would believe that we did!"  We told him if the weather was like it was now (cold and raining) we'd probably have to give it a miss.  Our hotel room smelled a bit funny, but we were on the top floor so that was cool.  </p>
<p><div id="attachment_251" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://www.tsardust.com/?attachment_id=251" rel="attachment wp-att-251"><img src="http://www.tsardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110821-020857-223x300.jpg" alt="Tasty good" title="Oeufs en cocotte with fois gras @ Le Potager" width="223" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oeuf en cocotte.  Everything just melted in hot, goopy goodness</p></div> For dinner, we ate at Le Potager du Père Thierry which has the most awesome food ever.  We were lucky that there were two seats left at the time we swung by it only seats no more than 15-20 people and the food is cheap, rustic and very French.  I highly recommend it solely because it&#8217;s traditional food and isn&#8217;t a ripoff tourist trap like the places in nearby Pigalle (the majority of the mains are less than $20 at Le Potager).  We shared an entree of œufs en cocotte topped with fois gras and served with slices of Poilâne sourdough bread and for main course I had a tartiflette with smoked duck breast.  Biggest cholesterol hit ever.  It felt like they used an entire wheel of cheese on my tartiflette!  We waited a while for the bill to arrive as there was only one guy manning the front of house and he was constantly whizzing around the tiny room.  Tired and satisfied, we made our way back to our hotel.</p>

Huffing &#038; puffing with a suitcase probably didn&#039;t help.</p></div> It was high-time we bailed out of the Holiday Inn.  I swear, their concierge is so incompetent.  We asked if he could make a reservation for us for high tea at either The Goring or The Langham and he was kind of looking at us as if we were from Mars, asked us to write the names of the places on a piece of paper for him to look up in a phonebook (uh, hello, The Goring was only where they had the Royal Wedding&#8217;s reception!).  Afterwards he walked back and gave us the piece of paper with the telephone number written on it as if it was now up to us to ring up and make a booking!  OMG.</p>
<p>We took our bags as we decided to walk to our new hotel.  It was a fair trek, having to walk all the way to Marble Arch and through Hyde Park.  We gave up when we got to the Knightsbridge tube and caught a cab the rest of the way to the <a href="http://www.gorehotel.com">Gore Hotel</a>.  It was nice to be somewhere nice that has a concierge who knows how to actually do his job (seriously though, the concierge at this place, Vladimir, is really friendly and helpful).  Our room wasn&#8217;t ready but they minded our bags and we were free to have some tea and coffee and have a bit of a rest.  We managed to get a table for high tea at the Langham, too!</p>
<p>Being enamored by our Swedish breakfasts, the Scandinavian Kitchen was in our sights for lunch.  We went to Camden Town first to check it out and stayed for about 10 minutes to take a few photos as the shops aren&#8217;t really our style.  Lunch at the <a href="http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk">Scandinavian Kitchen</a> was delicious &#8211; smorgasbord style lunch where you pick and choose which 3 or 5 items you want out of a selection of about a dozen different things.  I had danish curried herring, swedish meatballs, skagenröra seafood salad, toast skagen and Danish liver pate all on rye bread.  Way too much food and I was so stuffed afterwards.  I also picked up a tube of Kalles Kaviar :], and was tempted by the bags of Cheez Doodles (lolname).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_235" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.tsardust.com/?attachment_id=235" rel="attachment wp-att-235"><img src="http://www.tsardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110821-013140-300x223.jpg" alt="Sugar overload" title="High Tea @ The Langham" width="300" height="223" class="size-medium wp-image-235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The diabetic&#039;s nightmare</p></div> We returned to our hotel where our room was ready.  We&#8217;re on the top floor and the room is gorgeous and the bathroom is all old fashioned and marbley and has Penhaligons toiletries and aaaaahhhh!  The $300 for the night is worth it IMO.  We got changed for our high tea and made our way to the Langham.  It was raining again, but luckily we had an umbrella with us this time.  We opted for the &#8220;Wonderland&#8221; and the &#8220;Bijou&#8221; high tea selection and we thought that we weren&#8217;t going to be full afterwards, but those little tiny cakes and sandwiches are deceptively filling.  I couldn&#8217;t even finish my last scone!  Since it wasn&#8217;t until after 5 that we got served we decided that this was going to be our dinner.</p>
<p>Since you can&#8217;t go to London without visiting Harrods, we stopped there on the way back to our hotel.  I guess it&#8217;s ok.  The thing I really dislike about it most is the food hall where most of their teas and stuff is all Harrods-branded.  Meh.  After telling our concierge how disappointed we had been with the London nightlife, he recommended we go to Mahiki in Mayfair.  We chilled out a bit and headed out just before 11 and crossed our fingers we would be able to get in.  A group of about 10 trashy-looking girls got rejected at the door and we were let in!  Success!  </p>
<p>Mahiki is a tiki-themed cocktail bar and all of the cocktails have their own special vessel in which they are served in.  They also do cocktails to share which come out in things like smoking treasure chest. A lady was celebrating her 40th birthday and offered us some Veuve Clicquot @_@ and I ended up dancing with this weird French guy in his 40s who was that lady&#8217;s boss D:  This guy was chatting with my sister who was supposedly an Abercrombie &#038; Fitch (the height of fashion >_>) model and really into himself and this guy I was chatting with and I were laughing away at how &#8220;subtle&#8221; he was. It was a pretty awesome night though.  We caught a cab-that-wasn&#8217;t-a-cab that I think the bar organises and we were taken back to our hotel by a guy who was not unlike an East-Russian mafioso-type dude with an extensive knowledge of what bars were in and which ones were out and what years they started not being cool anymore.</p>
<p>The bed in our room was so comfy.  More photos below (I swear, all I&#8217;ve been taking is photos of food &#8230;):</p>
