			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong>There’s nothing radical about going to work every day.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, that presupposes that you have a job to go to. An increasing number of us do not. For me, that’s the whole point of the Occupy Wall Street Movement.</p>
<p><strong>People are not radical</strong> – especially as we get older and take on more responsibilities. That’s just the way it is. It’s hard to imagine carrying a sign, chanting slogans, and risking arrest when we are busily running as fast as we can to keep that hamster wheel spinning.</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phodopus_sungorus_-_Hamsterkraftwerk.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4524" title="Doenertier82 [GFDL (www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], via Wikimedia Commons" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/300px-Phodopus_sungorus_-_Hamsterkraftwerk.png" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a>JP Morgan Chase doesn’t care if the social fabric of the country is disintegrating; your mortgage payment is due on the 1ST. Your boss expects you to keep your focus on the bottom line. Your children need things that you must provide.</p>
<p><strong>Who has time to protest?</strong></p>
<p>We are overworked, overwhelmed, and scared to death of falling off the wheel.</p>
<p>We leave the risk-taking to the young. They have nothing better to do, right?</p>
<p><strong>It’s okay to admit it.</strong> Most of us are not cut out to be heroes. It’s easier to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the few while we try to make our own way. Unemployment is just a number to those who are employed – it holds no more importance than a batting average or a Neilson rating. We hear the number, we shrug, and we move on.</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Volunteers_of_America_Soup_Kitchen_WDC.gif" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4532" title="By Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Volunteers_of_America_Soup_Kitchen_WDC.gif" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>But to the unemployed, it means everything. When millions are looking for work that isn’t there, the future looks bleak.</p>
<p>For years, there has been a whittling away of the social safety net. It’s a net whose first strings were strung when the country was at its fiscal worst. We learned what can happen when the economy goes to Hell, so we took steps to avoid a repeat in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Good idea.</strong></p>
<p>Then it happened. The rich began to feel that they weren’t rich enough. They used their wealth to game the system. Too many politicians have a price, and Wall Street was able to meet it. How else can one explain the repeal of laws that were enacted to keep the greed of bankers in check? It’s commonly believed that banks took too many risks which led us into a recession. Bullshit.</p>
<p>There was <strong>no risk involved</strong> in what they did &#8211; at least not to them. They were golden from the start. It was an ingenious plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lie, cheat, and steal from investors as you package bogus mortgages and sell them as if they were bonds.</li>
<li>Get the ratings agencies to bless your offerings with AAA ratings and collude with insurance companies to cover your butt when the crap hit the fan.</li>
<li>Call in your markers with all of those politicians that you “carry in their pockets like so many nickels and dimes,” by lobbying for and getting huge bailouts. (Apologies to The Godfather.)</li>
<li>Gouge consumers, toss them from their homes by the millions, hoard cash, and continue to devise new schemes for ripping people off.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do we really need more reasons to be angry before we actually do something about it?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not headed to downtown Manhattan today. I’m not proud of that, but there are other things that we can do to support the activists and it begins by paying attention.</p>

<p>There are no excuses for being uninformed. Even the media is slowly recognizing the movement. There’s something happening here. You don’t have to go to Liberty Square yourself, but you can Tweet it, blog it, or spread the word with some good old-fashioned talking.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with the activists and my check is in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>They are fighting the good fight.</strong> If they are successful, society will benefit. If they are bullied into submission, or starved out from lack of support, each of us who chooses to stay on the sidelines will own a part of the blame.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong>The woman told her story with such clarity that she could have been speaking of something that was just experienced.</strong></p>
<p>The details, the guts of any compelling story, had the ring of a yarn told and retold over the years. She spoke of her remembrances of September 10, 2001.</p>
<p>I was on my way home from work yesterday and had tuned in to NPR and caught their All Things Considered program: &#8220;<a title="NPR - The Day Before America Was Interrupted" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/09/09/140339003/the-day-before-america-was-interrupted-nine-people-recall-sept-10-2001" target="_blank">The Day Before America Was Interrupted: Nine People Recall Sept. 10, 2001</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4489" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="September 10, 2001" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-10-2001.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" />A man from Omaha, Nebraska was next. His story was just as detailed.</p>
<p>For those who lived through the horrors of September 11TH, the memories of that day are indelible. The chronology of 9/11 – where we were, who we were with, and what we felt at each point of that dreadful day are vividly replayed in our minds, especially when the sad anniversary nears.</p>
<p><strong>Buy what about the day before?</strong></p>
<p>As I listened, I strained to recall my “day before”. I could think of nothing. I realized that I had absolutely no memory of September 10TH. It’s funny how the mind works. It’s as if the immense sorrow of 9/11 has commandeered the available space of my brain for that period of time.</p>
<p>This is a three year old video that was recorded on a cheap webcam, so the image is grainy. Seven years after the attacks, I spoke of what I remembered about that day. I made no references to September 10TH.</p>

Imagine that, my mug on a billboard in Times Square. I can see it happening. Can you?</p>
<p>I went to <a title="Ray Colon's About.me Profile" href="http://about.me/raycolon" target="_blank">my profile</a>, read the contest rules, and clicked the Opt-In button. That was the easy part. The hard part is going to be using my powers of persuasion to get you – <strong>yes, you</strong> – to click on <a title="Vote for me!" href="http://about.me/raycolon" target="_blank"><strong>this link</strong></a> and cast your vote.</p>
<p>Go ahead. It’ll open in a new tab, so you can come back to this post when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll wait.</strong></p>
<p>There, that was easy, wasn’t it? Please be sure to tell me that you&#8217;ve supported the narcissist in me, and know that I love <del>me</del> you, my loyal readers.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the story.</p>
<p>After opting in, I was presented with options for spreading the word, so I started by tweeting this:</p>

Facebook was next. With no 140 character limit to hold me back, I saw an opportunity to harness the influence of my 69 Facebook friends. Here’s what I posted:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/RamonEColon" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4450" title="FB_About.me" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FB_About.me_.png" alt="" width="489" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>Now all that’s left for you to do is to spread the word by sharing this post. Think of it as your good deed for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Jon was right</strong>, you know. This contest is narcissistic at its core, but these days, that&#8217;s what passes for normal.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong><br />
Working full-time from home this year has turned me into a cave-dweller.</strong></p>
<p>Days can go by without my seeing the sunshine. Aside from my family, the rest of the world is piped in through my DSL.  But morphing into a mangy Neanderthal has unintended consequences.  My <a title="Ray's YouTube Channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/raycolondotcom" target="_blank">video-making</a> has suffered.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4363" title="Ray's home office" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rays_home_office2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="90" />I used to make a lot of videos, and I’ve come up with some pretty good ideas lately, but none have been recorded because I only shave when the nubs start to itch.</p>
<p>It’s a little disturbing, I know, but I can change anytime I want. Or can I?</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theodore_Kaczynski.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4340" title="Theodore Kaczynski, By Federal Bureau of Investigation [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Wiki-Theodore_Kaczynski.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><em><strong>“I look like Ted Kaczynski.”</strong></em></p>
<p>My oldest daughter looked puzzled.</p>
<p><em><strong>“You know, the Unabomber.”</strong></em></p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>Because this happens a lot, she knew what to expect – a brief history lesson.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Oh, no! Here it comes.”</em></strong></p>
<p>She’s a teenager, so it’s unfair to expect her to be up on the history, knowledge, and cultural references of all that has come before. Unfortunately, her disinterest in these things also applies to current events – unless they are featured on MTV News.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t know everything either.</p>
<p>About a year ago at a local Tweetup, I asked,<em><strong> “So who is this Seth Godin?”</strong></em></p>
<p>It was either the first or second time that I had attended, so I was still trying to figure out what the group was all about. They are a friendly group of people who have an interest in social media and I enjoyed their company, but it’s been a while since I’ve attended. They referenced Seth a lot in their group discussion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4373" title="Pocono Tweetup photo shared on Facebook - Daria, Jennifer, Lorie, Bruce, Patricia, Jason, and me." src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pocono-tweetup2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="303" />Lisa offered the first response, <em><strong>“Seth Godin.”</strong></em> I couldn’t tell if it was a question or if she said his name in the way someone would say, “Elvis” or “Madonna” and automatically assume that I would know who the person was.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Yeah, is he some kind of social media guru?”</strong></em></p>
<p>Daria, seated to my right, looked up.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Yes, he’s famous. You should read his books.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Since that day, I have read one of his books. I think that it was Jason who loaned it to me. I haven’t been to a Tweetup in a very long time, so the book hasn’t been returned. That could be why he unfollowed me on Twitter. I’ll have ask him when I see him.</p>
<p>I subscribe to <a title="Seth's Blog" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/" target="_blank">Seth’s Blog</a> and I’ve watched some of his interviews. He’s a very interesting guy, but it seems to me that a lot of his fans are not doing the things that he continually asks them to do.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kid_aviano_2007_crop.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4386" title="Kid Rock: Rock Star - By derivative work: Emdee (talk) Kid_Rock_Aviano.jpg: U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Michael R. Holzworth (Kid_Rock_Aviano.jpg) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/300px-Kid_aviano_2007_crop.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="390" /></a>He’s like a rock star in Social Media</strong>, so people disseminate his posts daily. Like those who tweet famous historical quotes all of the time, there’s a striking dearth of imagination involved in retweeting Seth over and over again. He probably doesn’t care about any of that because he advocates building real relationships and not the kind of dogmatic response to his every utterance that some fans seem to have.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Working full-time from home this year has turned me into a cave-dweller.

Days can go by without my seeing the sunshine. Aside from my family, the rest of the world is piped in through my DSL.  But morphing into a mangy Neanderthal has unintended consequences.  My video-making has suffered.

I used to make a lot of videos, and I’ve come up with some pretty good ideas lately, but none have been recorded because I only shave when the nubs start to itch.

It’s a little disturbing, I know, but I can change anytime I want. Or can I?

“I look like Ted Kaczynski.”

My oldest daughter looked puzzled.

“You know, the Unabomber.”

She shook her head.

Because this happens a lot, she knew what to expect – a brief history lesson.

“Oh, no! Here it comes.”

She’s a teenager, so it’s unfair to expect her to be up on the history, knowledge, and cultural references of all that has come before. Unfortunately, her disinterest in these things also applies to current events – unless they are featured on MTV News.

Of course, I don’t know everything either.

About a year ago at a local Tweetup, I asked, “So who is this Seth Godin?”

It was either the first or second time that I had attended, so I was still trying to figure out what the group was all about. They are a friendly group of people who have an interest in social media and I enjoyed their company, but it’s been a while since I’ve attended. They referenced Seth a lot in their group discussion.

Lisa offered the first response, “Seth Godin.” I couldn’t tell if it was a question or if she said his name in the way someone would say, “Elvis” or “Madonna” and automatically assume that I would know who the person was.

“Yeah, is he some kind of social media guru?”

Daria, seated to my right, looked up.

“Yes, he’s famous. You should read his books.”

Since that day, I have read one of his books. I think that it was Jason who loaned it to me. I haven’t been to a Tweetup in a very long time, so the book hasn’t been returned. That could be why he unfollowed me on Twitter. I’ll have ask him when I see him.

I subscribe to Seth’s Blog and I’ve watched some of his interviews. He’s a very interesting guy, but it seems to me that a lot of his fans are not doing the things that he continually asks them to do.

He’s like a rock star in Social Media, so people disseminate his posts daily. Like those who tweet famous historical quotes all of the time, there’s a striking dearth of imagination involved in retweeting Seth over and over again. He probably doesn’t care about any of that because he advocates building real relationships and not the kind of dogmatic response to his every utterance that some fans seem to have.

He writes insightful posts, but so do a lot of other people, so why is so much attention paid to this one individual? From everything that I’ve read by him, that’s exactly what he urges people not to do. Don’t parrot what he says, mimic what he does, or live in the shadow of his words.

Be yourself.

I think that any good teacher would advise that you sit and take in their lessons and then rise from your seat and make those lessons work for you. If you can derive inspiration from Seth's posts, that’s great! If you draw it from elsewhere, that works too.  Take that inspiration and go do the thing that brings you joy, become the person that you want to be, and do it in a way that is uniquely you - even the unshaven, no sunlight seeing, fuzzy slipper wearing you.


The odds are long that you or I will ever achieve the kind of success that Seth enjoys, but if you did, wouldn’t it be a shame if the person that makes it isn’t really you?</itunes:summary>

I couldn’t even tell you what she looks like, but I follow her blog and learn about the parts of her life that she chooses to share. Intelligent, thoughtful, and caring are just a few of the words that I would use to describe her. Many comments to her blog go unanswered, which is usually a no-no for me, but for her, I make an exception.</p>
<p>She’s suffered heartaches.</p>
<p><strong>Real ones.</strong> Somehow she keeps moving forward.</p>
<p>I can usually find the bright side in anything. It’s an aggravating trait to some, because many people are quick to point to the negatives in life as examples of how things are; of how they will always be. Those who have that mindset harp on “what’s wrong” instead of celebrating “what’s right.” They curse what is lost and neglect what they still possess. Venting comes as easily to them as taking in a breath.</p>
<p><strong>Alicia is not one of those people.</strong></p>
<p>I have problems. We all do. The world has problems. Lot’s of them: War, famine, economic tumult, and a seemingly endless string of natural disasters. We become numb. The size and scope of the world’s problems are just too much to take, so we insulate ourselves from the horror and begin to forget how to feel.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a bond</strong> that is formed between people who follow each other&#8217;s blogs. We read most every post and grow to feel that we know each other better than we know some of the people with whom we share air. I have a handful of relationships like this. These connections are often difficult to explain to others. People tend to reveal more of themselves on their blogs than they do in their day-to-day lives with acquaintances.</p>

<p>Last night, Alicia wrote about the anniversary of her widowhood. Seven years is a long time and minds have a tendency to bend toward forgetfulness, but I suspect that she has a clear memory of every time that she has begun to call his name, turned to look for him, or woken up expecting to see him lying there beside her.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine the hurt that follows in the next moment when reality returns.</p>
<p>This morning, she posted a vignette from last night. This one brief personal story of her and her boys struck me very deeply.</p>
<p><strong>She’s been on my mind all day.</strong></p>
<p>The clumsy comment that I left on her post did not adequately express how I feel about her. I hope that I’ve done a better job here.</p>
<p>I think that we’ve become too accustomed to our world of harsh realities. We may feel for each other, but I don’t think that we empathize with one another – at least not often enough. As I read her words this morning, her pain was in the room with me, and through that pain I felt connected to her in a very real way.</p>
<p><strong>Read <a title="Heartbreak upon heartbreak" href="http://penthaslist.blogspot.com/2011/08/heartbreak-upon-heartbreak.html" target="_blank">her story</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It will make you sad, but it will also make you feel.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>“Well Jane, it just goes to show ya.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s still early in the day, too soon to tell really, but already I feel different.</p>
<p>I’m not in the mood to be nostalgic, contemplative, or even happy. Today is my fifty-first birthday. It’s a day that will pretty much go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I lift my mug and savor a sip of coffee. As I drink, I let go a sigh. The steam fogs my glasses for a moment. The coffee is strong. It’s stronger than I feel this morning. I take in a long drag from my cigarette and send a plume of smoke into the air. It’s there for me now, ready to be sucked in and drawn out again with every breath. These are two habits that I should have given up long ago.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s always something.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Life can be hard, but I have no cause to complain. My problems are neither unique nor unworkable and I know that things could be worse. Things can always be much worse. I’ve just been preoccupied lately with my worries.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“If it’s not one thing, it’s another.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I poke my fingers through the blinds and peek out onto a cloudy day. I’ve read that the weather isn’t supposed to affect our moods, but it does. If the sun were to come out I know that I would feel much better.</p>
<p>The house is silent as everyone else sleeps. The only sounds that I hear are the hum of my aging computer and the click of the keyboard as I type. Oh, and the sighs.</p>
<p>My legs ache, my fingers feel crampy, I feel a cold coming on, and I still have the crick in my neck that I woke up with. As Roseanne Roseannadanna would say:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I sound like a real attractive guy!”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I laughed at myself as I wrote that last line. Laughing always makes me feel better.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to me.</p>
<p>I’ll leave it to Roseanne to say the rest.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s always something.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“If it’s not one thing, it’s another.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Either you smoke or you have a sweat ball hanging from your nose.</strong></p></blockquote>

I’ll leave it to Roseanne to say the rest.
“It’s always something.”

“If it’s not one thing, it’s another.”

“Either you smoke or you have a sweat ball hanging from your nose.

Nero may have had it right when he fiddled while Rome burned.</strong></p>
<p>Once the die is cast and calamity is upon us, there’s little that an individual can do – even an emperor.</p>
<p><a title="By shakko (Own work) [CC-BY-SA-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nero_pushkin.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Nero_pushkin.jpg/500px-Nero_pushkin.jpg" alt="Nero pushkin" width="300" height="350" /></a>The historical accuracy of Nero’s actions notwithstanding, the scenario is a perfect description for what has been going on in Washington. <strong>536 people</strong> (members of the <a title="United States Senate" href="http://www.senate.gov/" target="_blank">Senate</a>, the <a title="United States House of Representatives" href="http://www.house.gov/" target="_blank">House</a>, and the <a title="The White House" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank">President</a>) can choose to put an end to this self-induced crisis, or they can fiddle for a few more days until the deadline, when we can all see what happens.</p>
<p>I used to write about politics much more often. I thought it was important and I&#8217;ve always tried to look at the positive aspects of politics. I don&#8217;t rant and rave, resort to name calling, or turn those with opposing views into caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>None of those things are helpful.</strong></p>
<p>Politics is more important than that because the issues that our elected officials are supposed to address affect us all, so a more serious approach is warranted.</p>
<p>But ever since last year’s midterms, I find that I have no words to describe the paucity of positive activity that has taken place since those elections. I predicted as much last September in my <a title="A One-Term President" href="http://raycolon.com/blog/2010/09/11/a-one-term-president/">A One-Term President</a> post, where I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think that Republicans will gain enough seats to wrest control of the Senate, but whether or not they are in control, the next two years will bring few improvements. The margin of votes in the Senate will be razor thin, so neither Party will be able to muster a 60-vote super-majority.</p>
<p><strong>Gridlock in the Senate is a foregone conclusion.</strong></p></blockquote>

The immediate concern is the raising of the debt ceiling. Without passage of this formerly routine bit of legislation, the lives of every citizen will be negatively impacted in one way or another. The idiotic idea of linking the debt ceiling and the deficit has created a problem of their own making.</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly what a struggling economy does not need.</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, the debt ceiling concerns money that has already been borrowed and spent. It has nothing to do with deficit reduction, so it is being used as a bargaining tactic – nothing more. Using it this way is not surprising, but bringing us this close to the deadline because of it is.</p>
<p><strong>If the US defaults</strong>, borrowing will become more expensive for everyone. Businesses will pass along the added cost to consumers, who as usual, will get shafted. No surprise there. They can argue about budgets and deficits all that they want, but they should not be playing this dangerous game with the debt ceiling.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Nero may have had it right when he fiddled while Rome burned.

Once the die is cast and calamity is upon us, there’s little that an individual can do – even an emperor.

The historical accuracy of Nero’s actions notwithstanding, the scenario is a perfect description for what has been going on in Washington. 536 people (members of the Senate, the House, and the President) can choose to put an end to this self-induced crisis, or they can fiddle for a few more days until the deadline, when we can all see what happens.

I used to write about politics much more often. I thought it was important and I've always tried to look at the positive aspects of politics. I don't rant and rave, resort to name calling, or turn those with opposing views into caricatures.

None of those things are helpful.

Politics is more important than that because the issues that our elected officials are supposed to address affect us all, so a more serious approach is warranted.

But ever since last year’s midterms, I find that I have no words to describe the paucity of positive activity that has taken place since those elections. I predicted as much last September in my A One-Term President post, where I wrote:

Gridlock in the Senate is a foregone conclusion.
This prolonged debt ceiling melodrama has even gotten the attention of people who do not usually track what goes on in Washington, mainly because the entire fiasco is asinine at its core. The immediate concern is the raising of the debt ceiling. Without passage of this formerly routine bit of legislation, the lives of every citizen will be negatively impacted in one way or another. The idiotic idea of linking the debt ceiling and the deficit has created a problem of their own making.

This is exactly what a struggling economy does not need.

To be clear, the debt ceiling concerns money that has already been borrowed and spent. It has nothing to do with deficit reduction, so it is being used as a bargaining tactic – nothing more. Using it this way is not surprising, but bringing us this close to the deadline because of it is.

If the US defaults, borrowing will become more expensive for everyone. Businesses will pass along the added cost to consumers, who as usual, will get shafted. No surprise there. They can argue about budgets and deficits all that they want, but they should not be playing this dangerous game with the debt ceiling.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong><br />
Even though most of them are never developed, keeping track of ideas can get messy.</strong></p>
<p>I used to write them on Post-it notes. That worked for a while, but sometimes I had trouble reading my own handwriting. There’s no time for good penmanship during the hurried scribbling of an idea before it disappears into the ether. I’ve also experimented with voice memos on my iPhone, Evernote on the iPad, and keeping a notebook on the nightstand.</p>
<p><strong>Incomprehensible dream notes make for poor story ideas.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4221" title="Story Ideas" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Story_Ideas1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="270" />The most useful approach for me has been to always have my word processor open. I type the ideas as they come and save the file. I don’t bother to name them, so the first few words are the default filenames, which makes looking for a particular idea difficult. I should review them and erase the files that contain ideas that are going nowhere, but I’m afraid that I may need them someday. It’s like I’m a word hoarder.</p>
<p>I write this blog in relative obscurity.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I kidding?</strong> This blog is written in abject obscurity. The odds are long that any success will ever come out of it, but I enjoy writing and believe that I have a unique voice. And why wouldn’t I believe that? Each of us has a unique perspective, so anyone who feels the need to share their view of the world should.</p>
<p>My writing style may not be the result of years of creative writing classes, and I can’t tell a gerund from a dangling participle, but I think that I make a connection with readers. Isn’t that what writing is all about?</p>
<p>Like most things in life, success takes effort – unless your name is Hilton, Snooki, or Kardashian. I need to make sure that I sit and write every day because the good ideas come after the writing begins and not the other way around.</p>
<p>In the last week, I’ve come across two bloggers who have published eBooks. They are both new to me, so I’ve only read a few of their posts. Because I know how difficult it is to maintain focus and a regular writing schedule, I think that this is fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>I bought them both.</strong></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that I will buy every eBook that I encounter; this was just my small way of congratulating the two writers on their accomplishments. So far, I’ve read a couple of chapters of each eBook and they are not bad.</p>
<p>The first writer is from a blog titled <a title="Wordbitches" href="http://wordbitches.com/" target="_blank">Wordbitches</a>. How&#8217;s that for an eye-catching name? I read a post by Elena Aitken. She’s one of three women who collaborate on that blog and the author of <a title="Nothing Stays in Vegas" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/73142" target="_blank">Nothing Stays In Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>The second eBook, <a title="The Doorway" href="http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/74704" target="_blank">The Doorway</a>, was written by Lyn Murphy whose blog is titled, <a title="Attitude Matters" href="http://briselle.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Attitude Matters</a>. Lyn is like a lot of us in that her day job has nothing to do with writing, so she writes because something inside tells her that she has to.</p>
<p>Whether these two books are successes or read by just a handful of people isn’t the important part of this story. The important part is that these two people envisioned writing a book and each of them followed through on that notion by actually writing one and putting it out there for the world to see.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s cooler that that?</strong></p>
<p>We all have long lists of would’ves, could’ves, and should’ves.</p>
<p>Daydreaming is natural. We all do it. What we don’t all do is work on turning those daydreams into reality.</p>
<p><strong>But we still can.</strong></p>
<p>What would you like to do? I’m not talking about a bucket list because that places the onus on the finish line (death) and not the process (doing). Achieving something before I die, and dying the next day is not something I would be able to brag about – literally. Instead, we should enjoy what we are doing as we are doing it. Then when we have turned something that existed only in our mind’s eye into something tangible, we can view that accomplishment as just a step toward something else.</p>
<p><strong>No finish lines, just continually learning and growth.</strong></p>
<p>Have you envisioned yourself doing something for a long time, like writing a book, painting a portrait, or learning a new skill? What has stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>Too tired? No time? No money?</strong></p>
<p>Some would call it taking a leap of faith, but that’s too easy. Leaping into something is a one step action. Putting in the work each day allows us to learn as we do. We learn about what we are trying to do and we also learn about ourselves. Putting in the work allows us to determine if the desire to do something is real. Putting in the work is hard.</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, putting in the work is also wonderful.</strong></p>
<p>There are always excuses for not doing things, but if you are willing to make the effort and brave enough to put ourselves out there, others will support us and we will be better off from the experience.</p>

If we don’t have these things, life can be hard.</strong></p>
<p>The fear of losing them can paralyze.  Their importance is overlooked during good times, yet we can be driven to seek them out by the point of a blade if other, more rational, options are closed off to us.</p>
<p>The basics – <strong>we all need them</strong>.  We need enough to eat and drink; shelter from the elements; and clothes to cover our naked bodies.  We can’t imagine an existence that does not have these basic needs satisfied.</p>
<p>Most of us are blessed.  A pursuit of the basics is not the focus of our day-to-day lives.  Survival alone is not enough.  We need more.</p>
<p><strong>I needed more.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4148" title="My Office - Hey, that's a blimp in the background!" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/my-office.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" />I needed a job.  Then I needed a career.  If I had a career I could advance to a position where my input was valued.  I could make decisions that balanced the needs of employees with the needs of the company.  There are an abundance of people in conference rooms (the Dwight Schrutes of the world) who will take a Sharpie to a budget and cross out names without ever considering alternate solutions.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s easier that way.</strong></em></p>
<p>They slash expenses with no thought to the impact they are making on lives.  I could change all of that if I had that position.</p>
<p><strong>The dream job, that’s all I needed.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4161" title="The Girls" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/the-girls2.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" />I needed children – precious, loving, and determined children.  I needed them to come into my life and give greater meaning to every day thereafter.</p>
<p>I needed children to love who loved me back and made the world a better place just by being themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, children are all that I needed.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4164" title="In The House" src="http://raycolon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/living-room.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" />That house – the one in the country where my children could have a yard, room to grow, and safety.  I needed that house.  It could be built on a small lot surrounded by tall trees.  It could be near good schools.  With that house I could offer them a way of life that I could only dream of as a child.</p>
<p>It was very clear to me.</p>
<p><strong>That house was all that I needed.</strong></p>
<p>This list could get very long.  Like Steve Martin’s “Jerk”, who at first thought that all he needed was “this ashtray”, we never get to have all that we need.  Once we get <em><strong>that thing</strong></em>, something else takes its place.  That’s good.  Otherwise, we may just stop trying.</p>
<p>Then one day, we realize that we didn’t really need all of the things we thought we did.  Some of the things that we accumulated along the way were nice, but they may not have been what we really needed.</p>
<p>We needed to connect to the world around us.  We needed to spend the time that we had with the ones who we love.  We needed to never take life for granted.</p>
<p><strong>Hopefully</strong>, when we look back on our lives, we can say that we worked hard for the things that we wanted without sacrificing our relationships with the people who we really needed.</p>

The fear of losing them can paralyze.  Their importance is overlooked during good times, yet we can be driven to seek them out by the point of a blade if other, more rational, options are closed off to us.

The basics – we all need them.  We need enough to eat and drink; shelter from the elements; and clothes to cover our naked bodies.  We can’t imagine an existence that does not have these basic needs satisfied.

Most of us are blessed.  A pursuit of the basics is not the focus of our day-to-day lives.  Survival alone is not enough.  We need more.

I needed more.

I needed a job.  Then I needed a career.  If I had a career I could advance to a position where my input was valued.  I could make decisions that balanced the needs of employees with the needs of the company.  There are an abundance of people in conference rooms (the Dwight Schrutes of the world) who will take a Sharpie to a budget and cross out names without ever considering alternate solutions.

It’s easier that way.

They slash expenses with no thought to the impact they are making on lives.  I could change all of that if I had that position.

The dream job, that’s all I needed.

I needed children – precious, loving, and determined children.  I needed them to come into my life and give greater meaning to every day thereafter.

I needed children to love who loved me back and made the world a better place just by being themselves.

Yes, children are all that I needed.

That house – the one in the country where my children could have a yard, room to grow, and safety.  I needed that house.  It could be built on a small lot surrounded by tall trees.  It could be near good schools.  With that house I could offer them a way of life that I could only dream of as a child.
