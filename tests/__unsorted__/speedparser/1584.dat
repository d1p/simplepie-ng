We were lucky enough to take part in 5 events, both readings and panels (see link). Thanks to Halli Villegas and Heather Wood who did the heavy lifting, organizing this incredible adventure. I would go back in a second!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common response to the statement, “I’m a poet from Canada” was met with genuine admiration! Here in Canada, we get a look of pity or a blank stare, followed by “what do you do to pay your bills?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I must admit, this excitement has lasted. I’ve been back a month, it’s pouring rain out, but I’m still filled with the adrenalin rush I had while I was in Scotland. And the memory of the performances (a 23-cast play called Traumatikon and art exhibit of Boltanski’s work, among many others). I even went to hear Best of Scottish comedy on my last night there, and despite the variety of accents and the cultural references that went over my head, I laughed my ass off. Edinburgh, I miss you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/10569241706</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/10569241706</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 17:37:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>What I did on my summer vacation: The Edinburgh Fringe Fest 2011</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe it’s been two months since I updated my blog. For those of you who write every day or every week, I applaud you. As for me, I get so caught up in life that I actually forget I have a blog for periods of time, which is probably not a good thing for a writer hoping to attract people to her work. My novel, &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Reluctant Cougar&lt;/em&gt;, was long listed for the ReLit Award this summer and I had an excellent review in Canadian Notes &amp; Queries, written by Nyla Matuk. This fall and winter I’ve got a bunch of readings coming up but what I am still most excited about is what I did this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with poets Jim Nason, Maureen Hynes, Ruth Roach Pierson, Moira MacDougall, and writer/publisher Halli Villegas, we were the Canadian Poets lucky enough to appear at SUMMERHALL, Venue #26. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/10567876184</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/10567876184</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 17:02:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>birthday update, make a wish and blow out the candles</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Eve of another Birthday, I guess it’s officially my birthday now. No numbers please; they just don’t add up. It’s a year and a few weeks since my first novel, &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Reluctant Cougar&lt;/em&gt;, was launched at the Proof Vodka Bar. Since then there’s been reviews, interviews — both print and radio — and all kinds of readings close and far. I had a co-launch in Vancouver this past fall with Leanne Averbach, also a Tightrope author. I read in Ottawa last spring at the small press fair pre-readings and all over Toronto for the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots still upcoming: a reading in Coburg next month, August 18th, at the Third Thursday, I think it’s called, and a reading in Perth at First Edition October 21st. I’m teaching a course in Erotic Writing at The University of Toronto starting Sept. 22nd, registration info can be found on my website’s main page. So all kinds of excitement coming up. And a reading in the Junction I am organizing in September during their Arts Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are the lazy dog days of summer. Hanging out celebrating my birthday all week I expect — all month if I can wrangle it. Nathaniel G. Moore regaled some of us with his cutting-edge marketing ideas last night. He is a visionary — you’ve got to give him that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t figured out a way to save the world or get a book deal or both with my blog yet. It’s just intermittent meanderings into the life of a writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one other thing: I spoke as a guest on the panel of “Success Stories” at Humber College on July 9th and had an amazing time! Met some fabulously interesting people. Dawn Pomislow and I, already Facebook friends, became friends for real, bonding with our stories of publishing and book promotion challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Mak, a filmmaker and I, collaborated on a short poem-video which I am submitting to Visible Verse for the fall. I will keep you posted. Eventually I’ll post it to Youtube but first I want to see how it does in the context of a video fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I want for my birthday? Great sales. More reviews (check out The Women’s Post and CNQ in the upcoming month and also Lipstick Indie online). And the holy grail for all Canadian writers: an agent. Like Bigfoot, they’ve been spotted but seldom stay put long enough to get a photo of them or prove they exist. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/7755639982</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/7755639982</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 03:34:31 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>letters lost and letters found</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Today in the news a young couple in Nova Scotia were renovating their house and found love letters written by their late father — when he was stationed in France— written to their mother. She had tucked the missives into the wall, and when her children went to fix old wiring, came upon a cache of about 27 letters. There’s a book or screenplay, or both, I thought, in that discovery. The letters were about 50 years old. And both parents long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I got a letter from Australia, from poet and visual artist, &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Hiemstra-van der Horst &lt;/strong&gt;(why don’t I have such an impressive name?) who had written me a letter in December of 2010. The envelope got waylaid in the Tightrope offices, under manuscripts and grant proposals. Once the move took place this past weekend, it reappeared, I got hold of it and immediately got in touch with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica is now in Sierra Leone (there’s a story there, I just don’t know it yet) and has an idea for a book she wants me to be part of. Thankfully I reached her and it’s not too late for me to take part. It’s not that often one is asked to take part in a book so I am thrilled. The concept is fascinating, involving the translating, “laterally or literally” of a poem that she wrote and sent to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 Jessica and I were the two Honourable Mentions in the Descant/ Winston Collins Prize for Best Canadian Poem, so that’s what made her think of me. I love the random synchronicity of events that often take place in the world of publishing. It’s just such a treat to be thought of when someone has a project in mind and wants to include you in it — even before they see what you’ll come up with. The coolest part of this is that I have never met Jessica in person, but admire her poetry tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought as I opened my letter from Australia, how seldom one receives a hand-written letter. It’s almost anachronistic. I love stamps, penmanship, the whole aesthetic experience of a letter. We must bring them back! Write a letter today, it will be treasured.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/5213746385</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/5213746385</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2011 03:51:20 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>feminist porn awards </title><description>&lt;p&gt;I had the dubious distinction of being asked to be one of the presenters at the 6th annual Feminist Porn Awards (sponsored by Good For Her) held at the Berkley Church this past Friday, April 15, 2011. To say I had fun would be a gross understatement. As my “plus one” Halli Villegas said, “Those people really know how to party!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were burlesque performances interspersed on the Awards show program, and for me Boylesque TO was a highlight. They were hilarious. Darryl Scorpio and I were co-presenters and I managed to get a clip of video posted to YouTube today of my presenters gig. Not sure how to attach it here. So I’ll post the link.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s done through &lt;strong&gt;Tightrope Books’ Writing Without a Net Workshop Series&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s based in Toronto, downtown, on Markham St. in the Annex area. (The complete info is attached in the website link accompanying this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you teach erotic writing? Well, that’s a good question. I hope to share writing exercises aimed to loosen inhibitions and arouse the imagination. Some of the most famous writers fall down when it comes to writing a sex scene. They succumb to cliche and find themselves on the worst sex scenes list published every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in a honest way about sex can get to the truth about a character and can be a compelling way to tell your story. Sexuality is both an integral part of our lives and an integral part of our characters’ lives. Why on earth can’t it be written about on many levels, from humorous and engaging, to startling and sometimes sad. But most of all authentic! Come on down and have some fun this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, a reading coming up &lt;strong&gt;March 26th, at the Painted Lady, with Heather Wood and Basil Papademos. We’re calling it the “Orally Gifted”&lt;/strong&gt; evening of readers. And we have an accompanying provocative photo for the poster. We were initially worried that Facebook would take it down if we posted it. So far, so good.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/3440320813</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/3440320813</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2011 01:16:49 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>CBC Books - The Book Club - The Bookies, part two: Content categories</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/books/bookclub/2011/02/the-bookies-part-two-content-categories.html"&gt;CBC Books - The Book Club - The Bookies, part two: Content categories&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;The deadline’s Sunday, Feb. 6th, for nominations for the Bookies.

Just found out I was shortlisted for the prestigious &lt;strong&gt;2011 Winston Collin/Descant Prize for Best Canadian Poem&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I was also shortlisted and my poem, “Death, Wildlife and Taxes” made the top three, earning me an Honourable Mention and publication in Descant’s spring issue. So, my fingers are crossed, my legs are even crossed, that lightning will strike again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join the party and prize announcement at Supermarket on February 8th, @ 7:30 pm in Toronto. Free appetizers will be served, and as I recall, Descant throws one helluva party. Shall I wear my black gloves and pearls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come, join me and all the poetry aficionados. Descant is proud to present the poetry event of the season!&lt;/p&gt;

Up late again as I’m a part-time insomniac. The year’s been a good one and even cougars look back at what’s been accomplished, what’s left to be done in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last January I was off to Paris with Halli Villegas, where we shopped, ate, and met the ex-pat English speaking writers at Shakespeare &amp; Co. at a Sunday workshop. Halli’s decided to do an anthology for those writers, with a Canadian editor, and some of the Tightrope crew will head there in spring for a launch. I hope I’ll be among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was last January when Halli, who was my editor/publisher for Confessions, did my initial edit and suggested ideas for the structure of my soon-to-be-published novel. So I came home full of ideas as well as new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February I won the 2010 Winston Collins/Descant Prize for Best Canadian Poem, and then got to work on my manuscript’s final draft. I worked all winter long in near-seclusion, finishing it. By May’s end it was finished and I started doing readings. The novel was launched on June 23rd at Proof Vodka Bar, a splashy, fun, fabulous launch that spared no expense! A Jazz band, headed by singer/pianist Fern Lindzon, two hosts, surprise singers, a mountain of cheese and treats — it was a delectable evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for August, which was quiet, I’ve been doing readings all summer and fall, from Toronto, to Ottawa, to Vancouver’s Jazz Cellar in November and then back to Toronto. We did the “Ice Ice Baby” Bookstore Readings at Another Story and Nicholas Hoare, five Tightrope authors, both novelists and poets. It’s been a blast and things are winding down now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the year’s end I got a corporate sponsor in Meet Market Adventures, who is doing an event, a martinis and author meeting and reading with me, March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetmarketadventures.com/events/4456/Toronto-Confessions-of-a-Reluctant-Cougar-Martini-s-and-Reading.html"&gt;http://www.meetmarketadventures.com/events/4456/Toronto-Confessions-of-a-Reluctant-Cougar-Martini-s-and-Reading.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lots of interviews, interest, and a couple of excellent reviews. More are coming in the New Year. The best part: people are enjoying it! Yes, it’s marketed as Chick Lit, and could be considered part of that genre, but it’s got a bit more going on, in terms of intelligence and wit, at least the reviewers are saying so. And it’s my blog, so I am blowing the proverbial horn. Why does that sound dirty all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snuggle up to a reluctant cougar this holiday, if you haven’t picked it up yet. My book’s available at all the Chapters/Indigo stores across Canada, most of the independents, too. And online at Amazon, too. Also, it makes a great gift!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of it. Just head over to my website, &lt;a href="http://www.mynawallin.com"&gt;http://www.mynawallin.com&lt;/a&gt; and drop me a line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. In the new year I am going to be collaborating with a filmmaker (Henry Mak) on a book trailer. Can’t wait. Artistic collaboration is a direction I want to move in, so this is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Holidays everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2443880814</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2443880814</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2010 04:40:04 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Confessions of a Reluctant Cougar Martini's and Reading in Toronto</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.meetmarketadventures.com/events/4456/Toronto-Confessions-of-a-Reluctant-Cougar-Martini-s-and-Reading.html"&gt;Confessions of a Reluctant Cougar Martini's and Reading in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;I’ve got a new corporate sponsor, how cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2396217556</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2396217556</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 21:29:05 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>A review by Sue Bowness</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Another Confessions review!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2180169538</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2180169538</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2010 20:19:07 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>"Ice Ice Baby" and other readings</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was one of five Tightrope Books authors who made two bookstore appearances, in the morning at Another Story on Roncesvalles and in the afternoon at Nicholas Hoare. The lineup was: &lt;strong&gt;Danila Botha&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nathaniel G. Moore&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Phoebe Tsang&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Scott Tysdal&lt;/strong&gt;, and me. Tightrope intern &lt;strong&gt;Megan Polley&lt;/strong&gt; did the hosting honours and we had a decent crowd at each reading. At Another Story the staff set up hot cider and a table of goodies to snack on, and at Nicholas Hoare we read by a roaring fireplace. The staff at both indie stores were great! There was something very intimate about both readings: no mike stands hitting you in the face inadvertently, no cappuccino machines whirring in the back or beer being poured. Just snacks and books. Kind of like kindergarten story time only with gown up material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly 6 months since my novel came out and I am really enjoying reading the book in stores, clubs, readings series, etc. I just came back from Vancouver where I read at the Cellar Jazz Club to a packed room, with poet &lt;strong&gt;Leanne Averbach&lt;/strong&gt;. That night was a blast, connecting with a whole new writing community, many of whom I had already met when they had come to Toronto, like Dennis E. Bolen and Russell Thornton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve had a couple of reviews, one in &lt;strong&gt;Broken Pencil&lt;/strong&gt; and another in the &lt;strong&gt;Literary Lollipop&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more coming, or so I’m told. Momentum seems to be gathering! I even may have attracted a corporate sponsor. A tie-in for my book with a big company may be just the push the book needs. I’ll tell you more when the whole thing’s a done deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy shopping everyone. I’ll take anything animal print! I’ve got a huge collection now, everything from hats and shoes to broaches and leggings!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2180108285</link><guid>http://myna-wallin.tumblr.com/post/2180108285</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2010 20:13:05 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Broken Pencil Review is online!</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&amp;q=http://www.brokenpencil.com/view.php%3Fid%3D5476&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=:s7:f2:v0:d1:i1:ld:e0:p0:t1289376048:&amp;cd=mItrgRfxOm0&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3ZUieUyJ9L7y7iMDBs7-P3kteKQ"&gt;Broken Pencil Review is online!&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;Wonderful review of Confessions.

I read “The Sommelier and the Bus Boy,” a chapter in &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Reluctant Cougar &lt;/em&gt;that has a little more sex. Sold a few books, so I can only conclude that sex does indeed sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathaniel G. Moore &lt;/strong&gt;read from &lt;em&gt;Wrong Bar&lt;/em&gt;, and B&lt;strong&gt;asil Papademos&lt;/strong&gt; read as well. We are all Tightrope Books authors. Halli Villegas, Tightrope’s publisher, and Shirarose Wilensky, Tightrope’s main editor, also joined us. Heather Wood hosted with panache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met some writers I only knew by name: &lt;strong&gt;Lisa Foad&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tom Walmsley,&lt;/strong&gt; and Basil Papademos, who organized the evening. Everyone was very friendly, the night was an unexpected pleasure. Unexpected because I didn’t expect such a good turnout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a week and a half I’m off to Vancouver, to read with &lt;strong&gt;Leanne Averbach&lt;/strong&gt; (Come Closer’s launch) on the 21st at The Cellar. &lt;strong&gt;Dennis E. Bolen&lt;/strong&gt; is hosting the evening and Leanne’s band is performing as well. Should be a fun time. Free admission!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been nearly 5 months of promotion on this book: online interviews, print interviews, and so far two reviews. One is with Broken Pencil, so grab a copy and check that out. Both reviews have been good so far, thank the literary gods, and the reviewers: &lt;strong&gt;Eric Schmaltz &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Sue Bowness&lt;/strong&gt;. Sue’s review appears in Literary Lollipop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more reviews are coming that I’ve heard of, but I don’t want to jinx anything by mentioning them before they appear. I’m trying to get back into the swing of writing, but promotion and writing seem incompatible to me at this point. I need to cloister myself away to get some writing done! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all. Do grab a copy of my book at a Chapters, Type Books, or your local library! I went into one small library that had a six-person waiting list! If you have any requests for interviews or you’d like to do a review, just let me know.
