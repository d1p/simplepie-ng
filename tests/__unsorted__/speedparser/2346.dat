<p>Vendors suck.  Free law sucks. Publishing sucks. Bloggers suck. AALL sucks. ALA sucks. The ABA sucks. Libraries suck. Librarians suck.  Google sucks. Facebook sucks.  Conferences suck.   Law firms suck. Lawyers suck. Clients suck. Outsourcing sucks.  LegalZoom sucks. The court system sucks. Technology sucks. Software sucks. Hardware sucks. Users suck. Computer nerds suck.  THE ENTIRETY OF LEGAL EDUCATION SUCKS.  The curriculum? Sucks.  The administrations? Suck.  The professors? Suck.  (Both the ones that go with the flow and the ones that try to bring attention to the so-called &#8220;law school scam.&#8221;) Law students suck. The job market sucks. Student loans suck. Suck. Suck. Suck.  EVERYTHING SUCKS.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re like me and are professionally connected to the legal industry in whatever capacity (as I have been in a couple of different ways at this point) and you mention your profession while making polite conversation on a plane or at a party, some asshole always has to be all witty and remind you, &#8220;Well, you know&#8230;Shakespeare said, &#8216;First thing we must do is kill all the lawyers.&#8217; &#8220;  Then they give a self-satisfied laugh and everyone else laughs and I have to resist the urge to smack them upside the head and yell, &#8216;CONTEXT, MOTHERFUCKER!  Listen, I&#8217;m sure you thought that was a really funny quote when you saw it printed on that totebag you got for donating to your local NPR station, but if you actually read the play it comes from, you&#8217;ll see that the characters want to kill the lawyers because lawyers are learned individuals that will stand in the way of their rebellion.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Personally, I am the opposite of cynical when it comes to the legal profession.  I do believe that the law is a noble profession and that attorneys and legal scholars are some of the best and brightest minds in the country.  So it&#8217;s absolutely mystifying to me how almost everything to do with with it &#8211; starting with law schools and ending with the court system and everything in between -  has gotten so screwed up.   Law schools are churning out way too many students that aren&#8217;t prepared for the modern practice of law.  Millions of people that need legal assistance can&#8217;t afford it.  The very foundation of the legal system &#8211; our laws &#8211; are inaccessible to many, if not most, of the people that need it.   From soup to nuts, the legal system needs an overhaul.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t even have time to begin listing all the ways libraries and the information industry have lost their way.</p>
<p>But you know what doesn&#8217;t suck?  My life. MY LIFE IS AWESOME.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a little over a month since I left libraryland and academia, moved to the unfamiliar big city of Chicago and starting working for <a href="http://www.cali.org/" target="_blank">CALI</a>.   In retrospect, it was kind of a crazy thing to do and now that I think about it, I finally understand all the weird looks I got from people when I told them about my plans over the summer.  (But honestly, I get strange looks from people all the time so the craziness of this scheme didn&#8217;t really sink in until about a week ago.)  Fortunately, it&#8217;s all worked out very well!  I love everything about where I live and what I do and other aspects of my life and I&#8217;m very happy.  So yay.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve been not blogging (and otherwise been not very active on social media)&#8230;.I mean, a lot of it has to do with being very busy and learning the ropes of my new city and job, but honestly?  I&#8217;ve been pretty content with my lot in life and haven&#8217;t wanted to harsh my buzz by thinking about all the problems in my professional corners of the world.  Also, I didn&#8217;t want to be the jerk that always talks about how awesome their life is and how happy they are&#8230;.although it is and and I am. *giggle*</p>
<p>However, I think I&#8217;ve had enough time in la-la land and I&#8217;m pretty well settled in.  It&#8217;s time to start writing (here and other places) and otherwise being more engaged again.  And let people know that I&#8217;m alive and well.   And you know, I don&#8217;t really think that everything sucks&#8230;.but I have some suggestions for the things that I think do.</p>
<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;m back, I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Yes, I am aware that there are other interpretations of that famous Shakespeare line that indicate that Shakespeare thought that lawyers, well, suck.   I cherry picked the one that I like the best and that suited my blog post.  Sue me.  This is not a point that I feel like debating. I admit the other interpretations are equally valid.  There. You win.</p>

<p>Hi. I&#8217;m Sarah. I&#8217;m am not supposed to be here today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite filmakers is a man named Kevin Smith.  He was part of the big indie filmaking wave of the 1990s and his first film was a low budget movie called “Clerks.” It took place in a convenience store, not unlike 7/11s that Mr. Malamud suggested law libraries might turn into to <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/futurelawlib/Main_Page" target="_blank">last month at Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve not seen it, it’s a comedy. The main character &#8211; Dante &#8211; gets called into work on his day off and you know, hijinks ensue. Through it all, he has a catch phrase&#8230;”I’m not supposed to be here today.” I sympathize. I really am not supposed to be here today. I’m a last minute sub for this presentation and I could never fill Erika Wayne’s shoes, but I’ll try.</p>
<p>But that’s actually not why I bring up Clerks and the whole “I am not supposed to be here today” thing. I get the feeling that &#8211; when I talk to some other librarians about law.gov (and perhaps this is a feeling shared by some of you here today) that they think “I am not supposed to be here today.” This is not my job. Why are we even talking about this at AALL?</p>
<p>Some actual comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s pointless to even worry about it until the state and federal governments step up</li>
<li>I can barely get my day job done. I don’t have time or money to work on law.gov</li>
<li>law.gov will never be able to compete with Lexis and Westlaw (so again, why bother)</li>
<li>will firms even need librarians/research specialists any more if law.gov becomes a reality</li>
<li>The next time Malaumd tells me to scan something, I’m scanning a picture of my butt and faxing it to public.resource.org</li>
</ul>
<p>(Okay, that last one might have been me.)</p>
<p>(I was having a bad day.)</p>
<p>(I really do respect Carl Malamud and all the work he has done and continues to do.)</p>
<p>(Really)</p>
<p>It’s absolutely true that library staff and budgets are stretched to the breaking point. And law.gov will never be a complete substitute for commecial providers. But before getting bogged down in the can’ts and won’ts and why things won’t work, I think it’s necessary to step back a moment and realize what law.gov is.</p>
<p>I think when I first heard the concept law.gov I thought it meant that the government would put up all the codes, cases, regs up online with a nice pretty interface that people could easily search. I maybe be moving to Chicago, but deep down I&#8217;ll always be a hillbilly from Southern Ohio and I have a strong feeling that this is the Godddman United States of America in the 21st century for god’s sake&#8230;there’s no reason that citizens should not be able to access the law via the Internet.</p>
<p>However, the more and more I got into it, I realized that it wasn’t that simple. law.gov isn’t just law.gov and the work that Mr. Malamud does at public.resource.org.  I actually like to refer to it as “Open Law” just so there’s no confusion. it’s authentication, and nccusl, and state surveys and preservation and digitizing collections..  It&#8217;s really about the government to release the raw data and information &#8211; which we already own, after all &#8211; so that others can make it into something useful.</p>
<p>So law.gov is actually a whole host of things and  it actually gets a little overwhelming. One starts to think that yes, this is an impossible task</p>
<p>I mean, don’t get me wrong..it’s going to happen. To deny this fact is to be a heliocentrist in the time of Galileo. It may take a little longer without the assistance of libraries adding to the corpus by digtizing their older holdings or might not be as stable because no one was able to convince a certain state legislature about the proper procedures to take when mounting their laws online. but rest assured, it is going to happen.</p>
<p>And this is a good thing. I’m into it because of the rah rah this is &#8216;murica goddammit reasons, but other people will tell you that by releasing this data non-profits and smaller information distributors can innovate and come up with exciting new projects and new ways to do research. And there may in fact be  an economic bonus to the legal industry and libraries if primary law is made more open.  Here&#8217;s the thing. I don&#8217;t care why you get involved, but please get involved.</p>
<p>Okay, so I don’t get all bogged down in language, as I tell my students, here’s the take home message from my opening statement.<br />
1) open law is coming<br />
2) librarians need to be involved because we care about the stuff that everyone else thinks we’re crazy to care about.<br />
3) and remember when I was saying how overwhelming the issues surrounding open law are? well that’s a good thing. Because that means that there are thousands of ways to be involved.. but there’s one thing to note: there’s no real leader. So if you’re waiting for AALL or SLA or the government or Harvard or someone like Carl to say “here’s the plan, gang. you do this and you do this and it will get done.” That’s not going to happen. You have to just sort of jump in.<br />
4) And yes, “just jumping in” is not an easy task.And it&#8217;ll be messy and probably not a perfect first (or second or third) attempt.  So if you’ve thought about it and decided that either this issue isn’t important to you for either personal or professional reasons or you really don&#8217;t have the time or resources&#8230;okay.  That’s fine. You know, I’d rather shoot myself in the face before spending any amount of time talking about RDA.  We all have different things that light our fire.  But nothing is gained and no one is helped by simply pointing out that something is not going to work. I think I saw a tweet saying something similar in an earlier session during this AALL&#8230;dont’ say “that’s stupid” but instead “here’s what would work.”</p>
<p>So, basically, I encourage (and beg) you to see where your talents can be applied in the open law movement and join in.  And if you can’t, well&#8230;stop your bitching about it.</p>
<p>An addendum about Kevin Smith, the film maker I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks.  He’s actually getting out of the movie business. He likes to make little 2-3 million dollar movies and once you roll in the marketing budgets that studios require the economics just became stupid.</p>
<p>He’s currently promoting what he declares to be his second to last film by travelling around the country in a bus and doing one off meet and greets and showing the movie in independent theaters. Not an easy task. And when he came to Chicago, I jumped at the chance to go see the movie and hear him speak.</p>
<p>He told a story about being at south by southwest in the mid to late 1990s and he was on a panel with Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Roderiquez and some other of the big indy directors. Tarantino asked the audience “how many of you want to be film directors?” and of course almost everyone raised their hand . And then he asked, “how many of you want to be film distributors?” and no one raised their hand. And Quentin said that people need to get into the distribution business because if film and film distribution is taken over by impersonal corporations instead of by the people that love it and respect it as an art form, then the art will be driven out of the industry..it’ll purely be about profits. And that is sort of what happened to Kevin Smith and why he’s no longer going to direct fillm but look into alternate ways of distributing film and other ways of expressing his creativity.</p>
<p>Now, it’s not a perfect parallel between the film industry of the 1990s and the current legal information landscape, but it’s close enough. And as you’ll see, I think we might have to start to get comfortable with the idea of “good enough” and so I bring it up as a way of suggesting that we need to brace ourselves..we (as librarians) may have to get into the content creation and distribution business whether we like it or not and whether or not we feel like it’s our job. There will be no more “I’m not supposed to be here todays.”</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever watched an awards ceremony and when someone is giving their winners speech they say, &#8220;Wow, it was really just an honor to be nominated!&#8221; and you say &#8220;Oh shut up, you lying liar that lies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I was really honored when I found out that I was nominated to be one of the Fastcase 50.</p>
<p>Then I found out that I won and was happy, humbled, surprised and a whole bunch of other adjectives.</p>
<p>Then, when they publicly announced <a href="http://www.fastcase.com/fastcase50-winners/" target="_blank">the full list of winners</a> today, I was like, &#8220;SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???&#8221; I mean, seriously. Go read that winners list. Go on. I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>Are you back?</p>
<p>&#8230;I KNOW, RIGHT?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t suffer from false modesty, but I sort of feel that I am not fit to carry some of those people&#8217;s luggage.</p>
<p>So, I would just like to take the opportunity to issue a heartfelt thanks to whoever it was that nominated me and the selection committee. I am really truly honored and thrilled. I am also very happy for my fellow award winners, some of whom I think are really unsung heroes in their particular areas.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fist.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-823 alignleft" title="fist" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fist-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Last year during the Westlaw iPod debacle, someone  made a comment on a blog to the effect that it was high time librarians started acting as consumer advocates.   I was really surprised by this&#8230;I never thought of myself or my actions in the consumer advocacy vein.  For me it was about pedagogy; I thought it was weird to be recommending a particular electronic research service to a student while sipping out of a coffee mug with that same electronic research service&#8217;s name splashed on it, so I didn&#8217;t accept vendor swag.</p>
<p>Flash forward a year.  I&#8217;ve educated myself more on the ins and outs of the business of information dispersal (although am still by no means an expert) and really see the need for more consumer advocacy.   Furthermore, I think that librarians are a perfect group of people to be doing this.  It&#8217;s why I joined and support the efforts of the proposed <a href="http://libraryconsumeradvocacy.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">consumer advocacy caucus forming in AALL</a>, do what I can to support groups like <a href="http://libraryrenewal.org/" target="_blank">Library Renewal</a> and otherwise make a pest of myself on this blog and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Through it all, I&#8217;ve been really wanting for AALL, SLA and other library organizations to step up and be a organizing force and leader in these efforts.  However, it seems like there&#8217;s been a reluctance on their parts to really get active and even make declarative statements one way or another.  I must say, I am not unsympathetic to their needs &#8211; large organizations have duties to protect their assets and have to be cautious.  When words like &#8220;anti-trust violations&#8221; start to get thrown around, the people organizations hire to be risk adverse get risk adverse and choose not to take action.</p>
<p>Well, I got my wish, in a way, and AALL has made a declarative statement on consumer advocacy.  I have to say, though, I am dismayed at the proposed AALL Antitrust Policy.  For links to the policy and an explanation from Consumer Advocacy Caucus, please see <a href="http://libraryconsumeradvocacy.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/proposed-aall-antitrust-compliance-policy-how-aall-executive-boards-vote-will-affect-our-caucus/" target="_blank">Consumer Advocacy Caucus Blog</a>.  In particular, I want to draw your attention to the list of examples on page five (5) of the document. It reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The followlng topics are some examples of the subjects which should not be discussed at<br />
Association meetings, either virtual or live:<br />
1. Do not discuss current or future prices (be very careful of discussions of past prices).<br />
2. Do not discuss what is a fair profit level.<br />
3. Do not discuss standardizing or stabilizing prices or pricing procedures.<br />
4. Do not discuss cash discounts or credit terms.<br />
5. Do not discuss controlling sales or production or allocating markets or customers. (This<br />
applies to services as well as products.)<br />
6. Do not complain to a competitor that its prices constitute unfair trade practices and do not<br />
refuse to dealwith a company or individual because of pricing or distribution practices.<br />
7. Do not discuss anticipated wage rates.</p>
<p> I mean, maybe I&#8217;m just a terrible dinner date, but this is pretty much the only thing I like to talk about during breaks at AALL meetings! (And the policy specifically mentions that these should not occur at formal or informal gathering of members, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m over-reading it.  If I am, perhaps the language should be tightened up so that people aren&#8217;t unnecessarily worried about violating the policy.)  If this proposed policy passes, I know I for one am going to have to seriously consider whether or not I can continue as an AALL member.  It&#8217;s not even a matter of opinions and what AALL should be doing&#8230;I am seriously not sure I can physically comply with it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love being a librarian.</p>
<p>Some of it is because of the big picture/honorable professional stuff that I frequently blog about here.  But honestly, I really love the day to day: staffing a ref desk, hunting down a hard to find piece of information, working with law students&#8230;Not only do I never wake up in the morning dreading going into work, but I often am really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>So it is with very mixed emotions that I announce that very soon I will no longer be a librarian.</p>
<p>At least not the kind that works in a library.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m timing this right, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnpmayer">John Mayer</a>, the executive director of the <a href="http://www.cali.org/">Center for Computer Assisted Legal Instruction (CALI)</a> has just announced that starting August 15, I will be the new Director of Content Development for CALI.  This is definitely an unexpected and unplanned development in my career, but one that I couldn&#8217;t be more excited and thrilled about.  It&#8217;s not every day that you&#8217;re offered a job that will give you the opportunity to change the world and, knowing some of the projects that CALI is working on and the possibilities of what it can do, well&#8230;.I really think we can make a difference.  Definitely in the way future lawyers are educated, but also in how regular citizens have access to justice and legal materials.</p>
<p>When John offered me the job, he was almost like a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_%28The_Matrix%29">Morpheus in The Matrix</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone">The Godfather</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_801" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/JohnMayer.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-801" title="JohnMayer" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/JohnMayer-300x248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="248" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My new boss, John Mayer, at CALIcon Vegas</p></div>
<p>I realized that I could continue on my safe library career path, enjoying my job and wishing some things in the legal information landscape would be different OR I could take a bit of a leap of faith, alter my plans and spend my time actually making the products I think are needed instead of waiting for them to happen.  As you&#8217;ve probably noticed, Gentle Reader, I really like quotes.  One of my all time favorites is from Ghandi: &#8220;Be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221;  I really think this position will allow me to do that.  And, in the end, that was an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>Although I am not going to be working in a library, I still will always consider myself to be a librarian.  I&#8217;m just literally putting my money where my mouth is when it comes to all of my talk about how libraries and librarians should work and collaborate with technologists and other related fields.  It&#8217;s definitely going to be a different environment and the new freedoms I&#8217;ll have to create and explore are a little breathtaking.  The CALI crew are also just a lot of fun to be around.  As I told John after I accepted the offer, I feel a little bit like I&#8217;m running away and joining the circus.</p>
<p>So, this is a big step.  It&#8217;s exciting and scary and, yes, even makes me just a little sad. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a German word that encapsulates all of these emotions. But you know, I have always believed that life is meant to be lived to fullest and that you should try new things and take big risks &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;re just taking up space and counting down the clock until you die.  And that&#8217;s such a sad waste of a life.   I dunno&#8230;maybe I was the only kid that was actually listening when they read <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html">that Robert Frost poem</a> at graduation.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a big professional step, but a personal one too.  I&#8217;ll be moving to Chicago, which is slightly different from Valparaiso, Indiana.  You know, just a little. So I&#8217;m also very excited about the opportunities for adventure that living there is going to provide.  I&#8217;m a bit of a country mouse, so I am a little nervous, but in my house hunting adventures I have already learned the secret to driving in Chicago: Don&#8217;t think about your insurance premiums and just gun it.   Which I guess is sort of the theme here.</p>
<p>So.  Lots of changes happening in the next month.  My last day at Valparaiso is going to be July 29 and I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t also include a big THANK YOU to all of my colleagues here who have been so much fun and valuable to work with. I am so sad about leaving them and this beautiful place.</p>
<p>But&#8230;now on to a new adventure.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/FoLL.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-792 alignleft" title="FoLL" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/FoLL-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>(Part One of this two part series appears <a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/?p=786">here</a>)</p>
<p>I recently attended &#8220;The Future of Law Libraries: The Future is Now?&#8221; workshop hosted by the Harvard Law School Library and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.  Even though it was only one day, there were too many things discussed for me to adequately cover in this post.  Fortunately, John Palfrey, host with the most and Henry N. Ess III Professor of Law and Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources at Harvard Law School live blogged the proceedings <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/2011/06/16/future-of-law-libraries-the-future-is-now/">here</a>.  The event was also video recorded and tweeted &#8211; you can find those media as well as other relevant materials on the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/futurelawlib/Main_Page">program’s website</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program was about “the future”, for me the day was almost a master class in the history of American law libraries.  So many greats of the profession were there, either on the program or in attendance &#8211; the names of which I’m not even going to attempt to list out of fear of missing someone, but you know who I mean.  Which brings me to theme one of the day, which I tried to emphasize in my portion of the program&#8230;</p>
<p>I like talking to more experienced librarians. Obviously, there’s the “not taught in books” skill sharing one can get &#8211; for example, the best way to wake up a suspicious looking patron that’s sleeping or possibly dead in your reading room.  But honestly, a lot of those you learn on the job from your more experienced co-workers. What I really enjoy is hearing the more social stories from them, when Great Names and Institutions have a more human face put on them.  And it’s not to say that these stories aren’t professionally valuable.  It’s usually within these stories that one learns about the previous issues and controversies that consumed librarians in the past.</p>
<p>One thing that I have found lacking in both my legal and library educations is the enculturalization that other academic disciplines get in their graduate education programs.  As I unfortunately phrased it to the traditional teaching faculty participants during my Cambridge retreat, “You guys are lucky &#8211; you’re taught to be academics.”  Um, that did not go over well. Score one for the famous Sarah Glassmeyer Charm.</p>
<p>Here’s what I mean:  for example, my sister holds a Ph.D. in environmental chemistry. (She works for the government, though, not in academia.)   During her graduate education, she worked closely with an advisor and a group of co-advisees.  Adorably, such relationships are often referred to as academic parents and academic siblings.  There’s also cousins and grandparents&#8230;.and chemists, at least, are able trace back their lineage from advisor to advisee several hundred years.  Every year at the big chemistry nerd conference, her advisor has a dinner for all of his current and former advisees.  The total effect of this is that when they enter professional life, they have a fully formed professional and social network (the original kind &#8211; not the poke/throw sheep at each other kind) waiting for them.  And it is also though this close advisor/advisee relationship that a newer graduate student can begin to learn the history of and behaviors appropriate to their specific discipline.</p>
<p>Contrast that to either law or library science.  The law school experience is not appreciably different for those going into academia, practice or an alternate career.  And MLS programs? They too have little delineation based on future careers and more often than not feel like a trial similar to getting a union card rather than an opportunity for the creation of professionals, let alone academic professionals..</p>
<p>So, what to do?  Of course there are programs such as University of Washington and Arizona which have MLS programs with law library concentrations and I assume cover some of this, but not everyone can go there and for some of us, that horse long ago left the barn.  It would be nice for there to be formal programs offered by professional organizations or libraries &#8211; such as the retreat I went to with my coworkers or this Harvard workshop day &#8211; to fill in some of these gaps. The newer librarian is also going to have to take some initiative to find these things out for themselves.  But, speaking as a newer librarian, it’s hard to know what you don’t know until you realize you don’t know it.</p>
<p>For example, mixed in with all the names I recognized at the Future of Law Libraries event were some names I didn’t quite recognize.  So I googled them.  The professional biography of one made me yell, “Oh SHIT.” at my computer. PROTIP: Not all of the Great Names and Pioneers have their name on a legal research casebook nor do they have a giant neon sign over their head that says, “I’ve been doing awesome things since before you were a twinkle in your father’s eye so listen up.”  I suppose I should have taken their presence at the workshop as a sign that they were someone important, but then again I was there and I’m, well&#8230;me.</p>
<p>I don’t know that I have a perfect solution, but I am now collaborating on a scheme that will hopefully alleviate some of the ignorance that younger librarians such as myself have about the history of our profession as well as preserve it before it’s too late.  <a href="http://thelifeofbooks.blogspot.com/">Rich Leiter</a> had the idea of creating a StoryCorps-like collection of law librarian tales and together we will hopefully make this happen.  We want to record short (~5 minute) stories about the people, places and events that have shaped the present and will shape the future of law libraries.  So stay tuned to hear more about that as details emerge.</p>
<p>There were two other strong themes through the day: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mak506/status/81411809638236160">(1)</a> Libraries can’t act alone, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ksmb1465/status/81383678927839232">(2)</a> in the future, we’re going to look back at many present controversies and wonder what the big deal was.  One of the things that I really appreciated about the day was that the speaker list wasn’t composed of all law librarians &#8211; there were technologists,  teaching faculty (both from law and other disciplines) and other types of library administrators.  (Although it was not as diverse as it could have been. See <a href="http://www.geeklawblog.com/2011/06/law-librarianships-missing-private.html">Greg Lambert’s critique &#8211; which I agree with &#8211; here</a>.)  The law library world cannot remain insular and hope to survive. There are projects that libraries can and should collaborate on and, frankly, some really great ideas to steal.</p>
<p>This is such an exciting time for legal information&#8230;the time is foreseeable that no longer will a limited number of companies control the publication legal materials.  I don’t just mean primary law.  A second front in the Free Law War is opening up with the open publication of secondary materials such as journals and casebooks.  Henry Ford once said, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they’d have said ‘faster horses.’”  The relative ease of electronic publishing means that there are people and organizations out there that are looking to find solutions beyond “faster horses” and creating something more sophisticated and creative than just an electronic copy of a traditional print resource. Libraries and librarians must choose to work with them and lend their expertise to these endeavors or be left behind.</p>
<p>So that’s really just a brief glimpse at what was such a personally and professionally rewarding day.  I’m very grateful to John Palfrey and the organizers for inviting me to attend and participate in the event.  I’m hopeful that some of the conversations that we started at Harvard will continue on into the future and I’m very excited to see what sorts of things the future will hold.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/4479446413_f2effbc5a0_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-788" title="4479446413_f2effbc5a0_o" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/4479446413_f2effbc5a0_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Gentle Reader, I have had an amazing few weeks.</p>
<p>The first part I’m almost embarrassed to write about because I am so ridiculously fortunate to have participated in it.  My employer sends all new faculty members (yes, including librarians!) to a week long retreat to spend time talking about our first year experiences and what it means to be a faculty member.  And I don’t mean that we talked about classroom management techniques or the daily grind of faculty life.  We talked about things like the purpose and history of higher education, shaping minds vs. shaping character, and whether we felt education was a vocation.  And oh yeah, and they sent us to Cambridge, England to do it.</p>
<p>I KNOW, RIGHT???</p>
<p>It wasn’t a total cakewalk&#8230;actually it was a pretty intense week.  I’ve taken graduate level courses that required less reading than what we had to do to prepare for this retreat.  As much work as it was, I finished the week feeling more energized and excited about the future.  There really was too much covered to go over it all point by point, but for my own personal memory at least, I am going to record one bit of it here.</p>
<p>We started off the week by all of us going around the room and answering three questions: (1) How did you end up in academic life? (2) What do you feel is the point of your work?, and (3) Do you think your job is a vocation?   The first part is easy enough to answer: my career is a total accident.  I really didn’t want to practice law, but I also didn’t want to waste the time I had spent in law school.  Fortunately, one afternoon I wandered into <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/Goheen/goheen.htm">Rick Goheen’s</a> office (at the time a librarian at University of Cincinnati College of Law, now director at the University of Toledo) &#8211; not to ask a question, but to get some candy that I knew he always kept on his desk &#8211; and noticed that he happened to have a law degree and a master of library science hanging on his wall.  I thought, “well, maybe I’ll do that.”</p>
<p>Office art and candy: It can change lives.</p>
<p>Accident though it may be, I think this life in legal information has worked out pretty well.  I mean, it’s only been five years, but so far so good.  I find it intellectually stimulating, I’m able to work on social justice issues (which were what drew me to law school in the first place, although I don’t work on the same ones or in the same way as I would as a practicing attorney obviously) and, I don’t know&#8230;.it just fits.  I also love working in education. There’s something very satisfying about taking complex subjects and making them accessible and easy (well, easier) to understand.</p>
<p>The third question is also easy for me to answer. I really and truly believe that librarians are going to save the world. The librarian is one of the great professions, up there with doctors and lawyers and clergy and politicians (stop laughing) &#8211; professions that classically have worked for the betterment of society and humankind.  We are uniquely poised in this time of information upheaval to guide others and navigate through unfamiliar territory, but do so with an appreciation for and knowledge of the past and can ensure nothing gets lost along the way.  I believe access to information is a fundamental human right and librarians (with assists from some new partners) are pretty much the only thing standing in the way of large corporations and even governments from infringing on those rights.  So, yes, I am proud and excited and even a little humbled to call myself a librarian and I do consider it to be a vocation.  That’s why I’m so obnoxious about so many issues related to information science and commerce.</p>
<p>The second question is where things start to get a little dicey. To be a librarian is to be pulled in a 1000 directions at once.  I’ve been struggling this past year with managing my interests and figuring out where to concentrate my energies.  I really hate to do things poorly and I was in definite danger of becoming a jack of all trades and master of none. Things are sorted now, but, ironically enough, this post is not the time to talk about *my* future.  There will be plenty of time for that later.</p>
<p><strong>So, for the tl;dr crowd:</strong> I went to England, thought deep thoughts and have a real excitement about the future because I now have an understanding and appreciation of the past.  Also, being a librarian rules.  All of which was a perfect set up for attending the Future of Law Libraries workshop held at Harvard the week after I got back.  You can read about it here, <a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/?p=791">in part two</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love Internet Memes.  No, I mean I *REALLY* love <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/" target="_blank">Internet Memes</a>.  I will pretty much find a way to fit them into any discussion. And why not? There&#8217;s one applicable to just about any situation.  Plus, there&#8217;s some pretty deep lessons to be learned from them if you just give them a chance&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>1. LOLcats</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lol_cat_icanhascheezburger.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-773" title="lol_cat_icanhascheezburger" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lol_cat_icanhascheezburger-205x300.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a>Let’s start with the grand-daddy of all Internet memes&#8230;<a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">the LOLcat</a>.  I could actually write this entire post on the various subgenres of LOLcats, but basically they are pictures of cats with nonsensical captions.  You either love them or you hate them and if you hate them, well&#8230;I sort of feel sorry for you.  You probably look at them and think, “It’s just pictures of cats with misspelled words on them!  That’s not funny! Or creative! Why is this so popular?! Why don’t people see through the facade?! What you mean Happy Cat got named an LJ Mover and Shaker?!”</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>*cough*</p>
<p>LOLcats are silly and easy to digest and require little creatively to create or understand.  THAT’S  WHY THEY’RE POPULAR.  You could create an image series requiring a detailed understanding of Proust, Sartre and computer programming and maybe 1% of the people who saw it would understand it and think it’s funny.  That’s okay.  LOLcats having 1000x more page views than you doesn’t make you LESS funny.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong> <em>Just because something is more popular than something you appreciate doesn’t mean it’s better.  It may just mean that it appeals to a lower common denominator. Also, don’t be such a snob.  Relax! It’s a talking cat! Enjoy the silliness.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. FAIL</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fail.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-775" title="fail" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fail-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a>Ah, <a href="http://failblog.org/" target="_blank">the FAIL</a>&#8230;probably second only to LOLcats in popularity on the Internet.  Because who doesn’t like pointing out the mistakes of others, AMIRITE? Schadenfreude, FTW!  And some of the FAILs are so big and so spectacular, you almost have to be impressed with how massive they are.  Go big or go home, I always say.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> <em>Find the humor in your mistakes, especially since there will always be someone there to point it out to others. Acknowledge them and move on.  Messing up is not the end of the world. Unless you work at the <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> and pushed the wrong button and then did actually end the world.</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Troll Face</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/I-Will-I-Kate.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-776" title="I Will I Kate" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/I-Will-I-Kate-155x300.jpg" alt="" width="155" height="300" /></a><a href="http://ohinternet.com/Troll_face" target="_blank">Ah, Troll Face</a>. In the meme world, he often appears in multi-panel comics. A person deliberately provokes someone else and then when they do finally explode, Troll Face reveals himself and often asks “U mad?” or “Problem?”  Believe it or not, there are people in the real world who seemingly only exist to annoy others.  And then enjoy acting surprised when people get bent out of shape.   <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> <em>Identify the who the trolls are around you and learn to ignore them.  Don’t give them the satisfaction of realizing they caused you drama and turned you into the <a href="http://ohinternet.com/Rage_guy" target="_blank">Rage Guy</a>. </em></p>
<p><strong>4. Y U No Guy</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/y_u_no_history_by_purplephoneixstar-d38e0p8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-778" title="y_u_no_history_by_purplephoneixstar-d38e0p8" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/y_u_no_history_by_purplephoneixstar-d38e0p8-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://ohinternet.com/Y_U_NO" target="_blank">The Y U No guy</a> is the perpetual critic.  Take any thing or person and he has some question and criticism about it.  People like this are especially problematic to those of us in libraries because we really do try to make everyone happy. “ Library! Y U No have enough copies of the book I want?  Library! Y U No tell me the exact answer I need? Library! Y U No open 24 hours a day?”  After enough of this even the most even keeled librarian wants to say, “You wanna know why? Screw you, that’s why.”</p>
<p>But, for long term career success, that’s not the most productive thing to say to say, a library board, or managing partner or a student. *cough* Hypothetically.   Even if it would feel really good.  REALLY good.  <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> <em>You can’t make everyone happy and some people are going to be unhappy with what you do no matter what. Do the best you can to please them and if that’s not enough, then it ceases to be your problem.  And don’t get worn down by Y U NO guys and start to think that all complaints are invalid.</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Haters Gonna Hate</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Pigboots-Haters-gonna-hate.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-779" title="Pigboots-Haters-gonna-hate" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Pigboots-Haters-gonna-hate-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a>I think <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/haters-gonna-hate" target="_blank">Haters Gonna Hate</a> is my absolute favorite meme. It often features a person or thing in a ridiculous situation looking okay with themselves (or even smug) with the caption “Haters gonna hate.”  Haters are similar to the Y U No guy in that they make you miserable.  However, the Y U No guy is generally just an unhappy sort that will never be satisfied while haters are people that see your happiness and try and tear it down.</p>
<p>Don’t let them.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> <em>There are always people out there who would rather tear down your success than try to create any of their own.  Constructive criticism is good and something that you should listen to.  Criticism for the sake of criticizing can be ignored.  And there’s nothing wrong with being a little proud of yourself.  Take a cue from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012490/" target="_blank">Tony Manero</a> and  allow yourself to strut just little every now and then.</em></p>
<p><strong>6. ????? Profit! </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/step1getall128611983216603118.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-780" title="step1getall128611983216603118" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/step1getall128611983216603118-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></a><a href="http://ohinternet.com/Profit" target="_blank">This meme</a> is more often seen in print form than images, but it usually goes “Step 1: Do something fun Step 2: ?????  Step 3: PROFIT!”   The ????? blithely skipping over all the hard work and creativity that magically transforms something fun into something worthwhile.  <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> <em>Of course you can’t forget the fact that success is made up of a lot of hard work.  But don’t let yourself get too wrapped up in that in the beginning.  Find something you love or are passionate about and dive in!  Worry about the practicalities later.  It’ll either work itself out or you have another entry for the FAIL pile.  Either way, it’s all good in the hood.</em></p>
<p><strong>7. Advice Dog</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/advice-dog-steal-candy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-781" title="advice-dog-steal-candy" src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/advice-dog-steal-candy-300x298.png" alt="" width="300" height="298" /></a><a href="http://ohinternet.com/Advice_dog" target="_blank">Advice dog</a> (and its many spin offs)  feature an adorable puppy giving you the worst possible advice possible.  But you sort of want to take it&#8230;because who can resist a cute puppy?  Not me, I’ll tell you what.  Save money and do a home bikini wax?  Okay, Advice Puppy, sounds like a plan!  <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> <em>I’ll never say that shouldn’t consult others for advice or help. But at the end of the day, you need to listen to your gut and do what you think is right. </em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2328879637_c0d2e376ff_z.jpg"><img src="http://sarahglassmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2328879637_c0d2e376ff_z-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="2328879637_c0d2e376ff_z" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-768" /></a>I heard the most wonderful idea recently: <em>Change happens in the gerund.</em></p>
<p>For the non-English majors out there, a gerund is basically a verb that ends in <em>-ing</em>.  It’s usually combined with a form of the verb “to be”, which makes it a present participle.  Present participles are used to indicate an action that is incomplete.</p>
<p>So to say that change happens in the gerund means that things don’t change, they are changing.  Have been changing.  Will be changing.  It’s not enough to say that, for example, “libraries have changed” or “patrons have changed” or even that  “libraries/patrons will change.”   It’s better to say that “libraries are changing” and while you’re at it, acknowledge the fact that this is a process with no beginning and no end.</p>
<p>Not everything changes, of course.  For example, dead things don’t change.  And, um&#8230;that’s about it, really.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the industries that I am most connected to &#8211; libraries, education, law and technology &#8211; are not dead.  As a matter of fact, all of them are currently in a period of massive change.  So much change, in fact, that it seems like maybe all this change is new and pretty soon things will settle down and we can all relax.</p>
<p>Nope. Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>When you accept the idea that change happens in the gerund, you realize that you should never see change as a problem because if you do, you are setting yourself up for a life of disappointment.  Why?  Problems can be solved.  Change as a problem can never be “solved” because there will always be more change happening.  However, if you think of change as merely “a difficulty” or “a challenge”, then you are mentally braced for the work ahead without deluding yourself into thinking that you will ever be finished.</p>
<p>The goal post will keep moving.  The issues you resolve will cease to be important and new issues &#8211; some of which you can’t even fathom at this point &#8211; will arise.   You will never be “done.”</p>
<p>Change happens in the gerund. </p>
