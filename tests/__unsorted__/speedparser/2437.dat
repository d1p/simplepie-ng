<p><b>Smokin` Hot</b> by Essie is a really nice dark purple color. It&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re ever sick and tired of wearing a harsh black nail polish, then this is the color you would turn to because it&#8217;s also dark, but softer. The quality is awesome as expected of Essie.</p>

<p><b>Afterhours by Urban Outfitters</b> is the equivalent of wearing disco balls on your fingernails. I actually discovered this color after seeing my neighbor/long-time-friend, Thelmany, wearing it. It&#8217;s a super pigmented glitter nail polish and it only took me two giant coats to achieve the glitter party in the above photos. It&#8217;s surprisingly not as holographic or as shiny as I would like, and it only looks super sparkly under light. When it dries (without top coat), it&#8217;s a rough texture because it&#8217;s basically like you glued glitter onto your nails. And yes, like all glitter polishes, it is a pain to remove.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ILMTF.jpg"><img src="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ILMTF.jpg" alt="" title="ILMTF" width="700" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1225" /></a></p>
<p>Saturday was my last day at work. They threw me a surprise pizza party, bought me cake, and sang me happy birthday. We took pictures with my Fuji Instax (they didn&#8217;t come out this blurry, my lens was just sucking at focusing). At the end of the night, they gave me three cocktails, two shots of Irish whiskey, and a beer. Haha, I had to end up staying until 5am before I could safely drive home.</p>
<p>I was so lucky to find that restaurant and get a job there. It is in one of the <b>top ten</b> most awesome things that have ever happened to me in my life.</p>
<p>I’m sad but also relieved. Sad because I’m leaving such an amazing family. Relieved because I won’t have stress to deal with anymore. Yeah, they are my family. Most of my life I’ve never found a group of people where I “belonged.&#8221; Most of the time, I just wander from group to group, but I never really “fit in.” At first, I didn&#8217;t think I really belonged here either, but they all adopted me as their little sister/daughter!</p>
<p>I almost never worked here.</p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t get my internship in the food section of a local magazine, I would have never found out of the local publications in Washington D.C. that <i>wrote about Toki</i>. If I never saw that article, I wouldn&#8217;t have encouraged Debbie to venture with me to D.C. to wait 45 minutes to eat ramen. If I wasn&#8217;t dating a cook at the time, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone back the next week and asked for a job. A lot of me was having second thoughts because it was so far away and seemed dangerous. However, I&#8217;m glad I stuck with the job and met such amazing people! Every family member at work is so fun, nice, real, awesome, (alcoholics, not really, but lulz), and I just love all of them! These are the kind of people who, ten years down the road, you&#8217;ll probably still be in contact and still be friends.</p>
<p>So dear family, thank you so much for having me, training me, putting up with my constant questions, whining, me repeating myself, me bumping into people, me screwing up, my crying, and for believing in me.</p>
<p><big>Love,<br />
Baby Bird</big></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys! It&#8217;s Thursday, you know what that means: <strike>Thrifted Things I Love Thursdays</strike>. Just kidding! I woke up really late when I was supposed to record this video and hadn&#8217;t thought of what pieces/outfit I wanted to feature so I decided to do a small haul video instead. Hopefully you guys won&#8217;t mind~ My sister came home for the weekend last week from college so we went shopping! (I normally won&#8217;t go to the mall unless it&#8217;s with my sister.) So I&#8217;m starting to get the hang out recording outfits with my webcam, so I think this may have turned out a little better than my last video. I hope you guys enjoy ♥<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the other thing that a lot of you guys really liked were shopping hauls, I decided to post this mini haul. (And when I mean mini, I mean <i>mini</i>.)<br />
<center><big>UNIQLO ユニクロ</big><br />
<a href="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110916-010924.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110916-010924.jpg" alt="20110916-010924.jpg" width="700" height="522" /></a></center></p>
<p>I bought this last month when I went with Trang to New York for the day. I wanted to buy more, but we were running short on time and didn&#8217;t want to miss the last bus back to D.C. I bought this really nice boat neck sweater and <u>tons, and tons</u> of socks. I think Uniqlo has a really good marketing strategy because every time I go, I always end up buying 1000000x socks, tights, and leggings. Anyways, the longer socks are part of their &#8220;HEATTECH&#8221; line, and I&#8217;m a sucker for gimmicky stuff (I say gimmicky because one wear I bought their &#8220;heattech&#8221; tights and it didn&#8217;t really work so well&#8230;), so hopefully it&#8217;ll keep me warm! Now I need some boots to go with these chunky socks.</p>
<p><center><big>SEARS</big><br />
<a href="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110916-010935.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://superbunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110916-010935.jpg" alt="20110916-010935.jpg" width="700" height="522" /></a></center></p>
<p>I got these two items from Sears the other day. Phana told me they were having an extra 40% off of clearance, so we went rummaging together. I ended up getting this tan boat neck shirt ($3!) and this candy cane open cardigan ($4).</p>
<p>I really haven&#8217;t been to the mall as often as I used to (when Trang was home we&#8217;d go 1-2x a week!), and even when I do go, I look at the clothes, then the price, and then am not able to justify it. I feel like everything in stores are so trendy (too lacy, too many zippers, too cropped, too many ugly florals, dresses and skirts are too short, etc). And I&#8217;m as much of a trend follower as I used to be (too old now, haha not really). Plus, every time I do find something I really like, I know it won&#8217;t last more than a couple wears and washes. To be honest, if some of these fast-fashion stores charged a little bit more for a better quality version of some of their designs, I&#8217;d be happy to drop more $$$.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve been craving some new make up lately so I can&#8217;t wait for Sephora&#8217;s F&#038;F event in November!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys! Thanks for taking the time to answer the <a href="http://superbunny.net/?p=1150" target="_blank">poll</a> (you can still fill it out if you haven&#8217;t)! Being inspired by thrifty fashion bloggers &#038; vloggers such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/clothesencounters" target="_blank">Clothes Encounters</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefashioncitizen" target="_blank">The Fashion Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://sammydvintage.com/" target="_blank">Sammy D Vintage</a>, I&#8217;ve always wanted to make videos displaying some of the nifty things I find. So after seeing that thifting hauls were one of the things that you guys liked best, I decided to start a new segment called <b>Thrifted Things I Love Thursdays</b>. So from now on, every Thursday I will post a video and pictures of some thing or things that I found at the thrift store. Anyways, I hope you guys like it and if you guys have any comments or suggestions, please let me know!<br />

<p>I actually haven&#8217;t had the chance to wear these shoes out yet, so they&#8217;re clean (or else I wouldn&#8217;t be prancing around my mom&#8217;s room with them on). The video is a little shoddy, but I gotta get creative since I have no one to help me record.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I bought a few nail polishes a bit ago and thought I&#8217;d blog about them. Although I <i>literally</i> come from a family of nail technicians (my mom, and all of the uncles on my mom&#8217;s side [there are four of them] are nail technicians, and half of the relatives on my dad&#8217;s side are nail technicians), I am <b>terrible</b> at painting nails. Heck, even my brother knows how to do nails (and airbrush designs!) and my sister can do nails and a super nice french manicure. But me? No siree. I don&#8217;t have the patience or steady hand for nails. So this would explain my messy and poorly painted nails. Anyways! Let&#8217;s move onto the pictures!<br />
<center><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6147046491/" title="essie's eternal optimist by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6147046491_8cea46c405_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="essie's eternal optimist"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6147594088/" title="essie's eternal optimist by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6147594088_c2389868a7_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="essie's eternal optimist"></a></center></p>
<p><b>Eternal Optimist by Essie</b> This is a rose pink and it&#8217;s a bit romantic and very feminine color. I&#8217;ll probably be wearing this color a lot for the fall. And like all Essie nail polishes, the quality of the polish is awesome! Call me an Essie fan, but I own more Essie nail polishes than OPI or China Glaze because I really like Essie&#8217;s range of colors. They&#8217;re not too flashy and completely wearable for casual or formal wear.<br />
<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6147046579/" title="barstool from urban outfitters by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6147046579_876976b516_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="barstool from urban outfitters"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6147046639/" title="UO's barstool by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6147046639_6a3541dd6e_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="UO's barstool"></a></center></p>
<p><b>Barstool by Urban Outfitters</b> I&#8217;m not sure why the nail polish looks so bright in all of my pictures, but I found a more accurate swatch <a href="http://polishorperish.blogspot.com/2011/08/urban-outfitters-barstool.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I bought this along with another color so it was two nail polishes for $8. I&#8217;m kinda in a love/hate relationship with this particular polish. I really love the color, but the quality <strong>sucks</strong>. It&#8217;s really sheer and in the picture above, I put on two heavy globby coats. Normally, I have to do four normal coats for it to be somewhat opaque. But then again, I do suck at painting nails, so what do I know. Anyways, for $4, I found it to be a little pricy since I can get OPI at my local nail store for $4 (and it&#8217;s of better quality) and Essie or China Glaze for $3. So if I manage to find a dupe of this color by a better brand, I will never ever repurchase this polish from Urban Outfitters ever again.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoy blogging, but what makes me even happier is knowing that people enjoy reading what I write. I plan to put a lot more effort into my blog posts and try harder to blog more often. However, as my audience (many of you guys are probably silent readers), which types posts do <b>you</b> enjoy the most? Is my blog missing something that you would like to see on here? If the category/type of blog post isn&#8217;t listed, please feel free to add it into the comments section. Thank you for taking the time to fill out this small poll, and thank you so much for reading my humble little blog!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wore this outfit <a href="http://superbunny.net/?p=1090" target="_blank">last week to the Newseum</a> since our professor wanted us to dress up in business professional attire. (I just took it recently since I found my remote.) This trench coat basically saved my life because it was <i>pouring</i> and I had to walk from the metro station to the museum (a good couple of large blocks).<br />

<p>So I asked my friends, Colin and Emily, what they did in their free time just as a curious question. So they asked me back. I guess what I do in my free time is go thrifting (haha, I think it&#8217;s gotten to a point where it&#8217;s an addictive problem), read blogs, work on my blog, and play with Toki. I guess I want to do more with my life, but I&#8217;m a terrible <hi>creature of habit</hi> and I just can&#8217;t seem to get motivated to do anything else. I guess I should start using my free time to sew more, cook/bake more, or <strong>finally</strong> learn how to play guitar, although seems unlikely. But we&#8217;ll see! Hopefully I&#8217;ll become a more interesting person soon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend during my moody slump, <a href="http://twitter.com/technokiss" target="_blank">Phana</a> came over and we baked cakes. I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s something kinda calming about baking. It makes me super focused, and forget about everything else (maybe it&#8217;s because after baking a cake, you get to eat it and sad people love eating fatty foods). I&#8217;ve been wanting to bake a cake for a <u>really</u> long time, so I was glad that I got this chance, especially in the company of an awesome friend. I decided to make a fresh cream cake using this recipe <a href="http://www.honeyandbutter.com/asian/korean-cream-cake-seeang-cream-cake" target="_blank">here</a>. All of the measurements are in grams, so luckily Phana had an electric scale (I need to go buy one myself).<br />
<center><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6140671638/" title="fresh cream cake by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6185/6140671638_9b6e76b07c_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="fresh cream cake"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xupermai/6140116935/" title="mmm, strawberries by xuperbunny, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6140116935_2b17f7f92d_b.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="mmm, strawberries"></a><br />
</center></p>
<p>I did a terrible job documenting the process (thus the lack of photos), and it took me <i>three hours</i> to make it (not including the frosting). I don&#8217;t know why it took me so long since the directions and ingredients are limited, but oh well.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not sure if it came out the way it was supposed to but <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nerdymusicazn" target="_blank">Colin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/emilyfoot" target="_blank">Emily</a> seemed to like it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry it&#8217;s been so long since an outfit post. I was cleaning up my room and finally found the remote for my camera (self-timing is way too difficult), yay!</p>
<p>I dislike the majority of safari prints, but leopard has definitely grown on me. I also found this cardigan at a thrift store for a mere $4. What&#8217;s up with people hating on their leopard printed clothing articles? Either way, their trash is most definitely my treasure (especially since this cardigan is super soft).<br />

<p>I wore this out last week when I went shopping with my long-time friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/technokiss" target="_blank">Phana</a> (pronounced, <i>pawn-na</i>, <strong>not</strong> fan-na). She notified me that Sears was having an amazing clearance sale where I got a boat neck tee and a cardigan for $3 and $4, respectively.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe I give Phana enough credit that she deserves. She has been my absolutely most faithful friend since freshman year of high school. She&#8217;s a great listener, gives great advice, and completely understands me. She is probably the most awesome person I have ever met in my life and I don&#8217;t know why she sticks around because I am probably the worst friend a person could ever have the misfortune to meet. Anyway, she&#8217;s been keeping me company for the past few days because of life drama, so I am lucky and grateful to have her.</p>
