It is absolutely ridiculous that were I located in quite a few countries around the globe, this act would cause me to be sentenced to death. That’s made even funnier by the fact that no where in the Qu’ran does it say the Muhammed may not be depicted; it was created by Islamic scholars who feared the worship of Muhammed over Allah.

For just the third time in our history, humanity has found an exoplanet that exists in the habitable zone of its star. The previous two, Gliese 581g and Gliese 581d, I have covered previously. I calculated the surface gravity of Gliese 581g &lt;a href="http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/1235093984/the-possibility-of-life-of-gliese-581g"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For both Gliese 581d and Gliese 581g I calculated the size its star would look in the sky. You can view those posts &lt;a href="http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/5909136490/gazing-up-at-the-skies-of-gliese-581d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/2543661428/gazing-up-at-the-sky-on-gliese-581g"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. But enough about these old planets; time to talk about the newest one discovered just yesterday! Named by most as HD 85512 b, it orbits (predictably) the star HD 85512 b right in the habitable zone where liquid water could theoretically exist. I like to call this planet Gliese 370 b, however, for it’s easier to remember and still technically correct. (HD 85512 and Gliese 370 are the same star, just under different classification systems) And of course, if this planet has water, I’d like to imagine that humans will eventually get there. Once we arrive on Gliese 370 b, what will the gravity be like? Will it crush us, or will it be too light? Time to find out! (NOTE: This is a post only about the surface gravity of Gliese 370 b. If you want a post about how its star will look in its sky, stay tuned; that post will come in a few days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this calculation, I will be using Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation, as it applies to the surface gravity of planets. The equation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g=G(m/r^2) where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;g is the surface gravity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;G is the Newtonian Gravitational Constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;m is the mass of Gliese 370 b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;r is the radius of Gliese 370 b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is where we run into a problem, however. We measured and know the mass of Gliese 370 b (3.6 Earth masses), but don’t know the radius. There are ways of finding it, however. To do so, I’m going to use the equation for the volume of a sphere, which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V=4/3*r^3*π&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we don’t know the volume of Gliese 370b. There is another equation for volume to help us figure it out, however. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V=m/d where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;m is mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d is density&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is starting to get a bit repetitive, but we don’t know the density of Gliese 370 b, either. However, we can take a reasonable guess. In relation to the size of the star, Gliese 370 b is about the same distance away as Venus is from our own star. If Gliese 370 b is capable of supporting life as we know it (which, for the purpose of this exercise, we assume is), it has to be a terrestrial planet like Venus, Earth, and Mars. As I’ve already stated, it’s in the same position as Venus so it is more than likely a rocky, terrestrial planet. Terrestrial planets have mostly the same composition, so we can assume that Gliese 370 b’s density is virtually the same as Venus’. Therefore, the density of Gliese 370b is 5.24 grams/cubic centimetre. We know the mass of Gliese 370 b is 3.6 Earth masses, or 2.149991496*10^25 kilograms. Therefore, its volume is 4.103*10^27 cubic centimetres. Working backwards in the previous volume equation, we can find the radius, which turns out to be 9.931258873*10^6 metres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the radius, we can plug it into the original surface gravity equation and finally solve it. With all the values plugged in, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g=G(2.149991496*10^25 kilograms/(9.931258873*10^6 metres)^2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result comes out to be 14.55 metres/seconds squared. In comparison, it’s 9.81 m/s^2 and on Gliese 581g it’s (probably) 17.98 m/s^2. Therefore, it’s heavier than Earth but lighter than Gliese 581g. The surface gravity of Gliese 370 b is around 1.5 times heavier than it is here on Earth. Whilst that change in gravity is noticeable, it’s nowhere near enough to kill us; in fact, our bodies would naturally adapt to the heavier G environment within months. It is very possible for humans to settle Gliese 370 b, at least as far as gravity is concerned. Now, the only challenge is figuring out how to get there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/KWshfIWbKjs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/KWshfIWbKjs/10176363969</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10176363969</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2011 17:45:41 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10176363969</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A beautiful tone poem, entitled “If I Told You,” by...</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="231"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-Q9i8FjR7QQ&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-Q9i8FjR7QQ&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="231" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful tone poem, entitled “If I Told You,” by Anthony Anaxagorou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/YsXfUQ34uzc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/YsXfUQ34uzc/10171151970</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10171151970</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2011 15:20:06 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10171151970</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The other 9/11</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On this day 10 years ago, terrorists from the Muslim extremist group al Qaeda launched a coordinated and planned strike on America soil, killing 2,996 civilians. This is a story virtually everybody on the face of the Earth is familiar with. Today, there will be a myriad of posts commemorating its anniversary, so I thought that me throwing another one into the mix would contribute virtually nothing. There is another, however, that most do not know about. This 9/11 took place in the South American country of Chile, and ironically saw the United States act as the terrorists, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 1973. The world was embroiled in an ideological battle between capitalism and communism. Chile had chosen her side in 1970, when the country democratically elected Salvador Allende of the Marxist party. Needless to say, the United States did not take so kindly the idea that a country would legally and democratically elect a communist leader. For three years Allende ruled Chile with the support of the Chilean people, increasing the size of healthcare, education, and welfare for the lower classes. He increased employment of people like miners and nationalized institutions such as banks. All the while, the United States was using the CIA to cause political and economic imbalance in the country. The fact that Allende was communist superseded the fact that he was elected by his people; the US cared more about stopping communism than helping democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973, the CIA’s moment of opportunity came. Discontent with Allende’s treatment of them, the military was showing signs of opposition. The CIA seized upon this and helped foster a military coup d’état. On September 11, the coup began. Allende, surrounded in his Presidential palace on all sides with nobody to turn to, decided to kill himself rather than surrender. After the coup, Augusto Pinochet set up a military junta to take control of the country. He later became the sole dictator of the country, all with the United States’ blessing. Upon taking control of the country, Pinochet immediately set out to oppress all opposition, disbanding and killing many leftist parties and declaring all other parties in “recess.” In all, Pinochet was estimated to have killed over 2,000 Chileans, exiled over 1,000, and tortured over 30,000 citizens, including women and children. All of this because the United State could not accept a democratically elected Marxist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as we commemorate the loss of life that happened on 9/11 in the United States, do not forget what the United States did in Chile on the same day. Do not forget that the United States, the so called “land of the free,” choose fascism and capitalism over democracy and communism. Do not forget that Chile suffered for 17 years because of the actions of the CIA. Do not forget the other 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/KmMr_6FFiZI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/KmMr_6FFiZI/10086960045</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10086960045</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2011 13:05:56 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/10086960045</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>"Listening to GOP Presidential candidates talk about science is like listening to children talk about..."</title><description>“Listening to GOP Presidential candidates talk about science is like listening to children talk about sex: They know it exists, they have strong opinions about what it might mean, but they don’t have a clue what it’s actually about.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Spencer Windes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/Wm-XER_Rwpo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/Wm-XER_Rwpo/9975195029</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9975195029</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2011 20:00:16 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9975195029</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A simply delightful video about the wonders of travel. </title><description>&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/28294159" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simply delightful video about the wonders of travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/PR7J1TPhuaI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/PR7J1TPhuaI/9967352992</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9967352992</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2011 16:49:05 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9967352992</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A complete history of the Soviet Union, arranged to the melody...</title><description>&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22368232" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complete history of the Soviet Union, arranged to the melody of Tetris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/1aOmO9Ff8YE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/1aOmO9Ff8YE/9883407798</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9883407798</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2011 14:25:06 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9883407798</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>What our legal drugs tell us about our society</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you already know, I am for the legalization of all recreational drugs, for it is not a government’s place to regulate what one can and cannot do with their own bodies. Conversely, I am opposed to anybody taking them. Of course, I cannot legally forbid them for it would contradict my first point, and I respect everybody’s right to choose whether or not they want to do drugs, both illegal and legal, but I personally like to keep my mind as sharp and fresh as possible. Therefore, I do not partake in taking both illegal drugs, such as cannabis, opiates, and the like, or legal drugs, such as caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol. But enough about illegal drugs; let’s talk about the legal ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people say that to understand a society one must look at the drugs that are both legal and socially acceptable. Our society has just three: tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol. I will examine each drug’s impact on our society, and then try and come up with some possible explanation for what light the legal status of the drug in question can shed on our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is tobacco. Most commonly obtained through smoking a cigarette, tobacco is a worldwide problem that is very prevalent here in the United States. In the US alone, 46 million people smoke cigarettes regularly. That’s 20.6% of the entire population of the country. Scarier still is that 17.2% of high school students smoke cigarettes regularly. The health problems that come along with smoking should come as no surprise to anybody; every one in five deaths in the United States is a smoking related issue. Worldwide, smoking accounts for over 5 million deaths each year. But of course, the tobacco companies pay no mind to these deaths, for they make so much money that they could care less wether some people happen to die from using their product. And they want more and more people to use it. In 2006 alone, over $12 billion dollars were spent on advertising for cigarettes. That’s $34 million spent on advertising &lt;em&gt;every day.&lt;/em&gt; Sadly, it works, for in 2006 $83.6 billion dollars were spent on cigarettes alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvious that tobacco is a serious problem in our society that causes a myriad of issues, including lung cancer, throat cancer, respiratory issues, and a whole slew of other deadly health problem. But what does the act of smoking tell us about our society? Primarily, it shows that we are a society that is greedy beyond belief. The tobacco barons who make obscene amounts of money off of other people’s deaths care not for said people, they only care about the money they’re making. And for some strange reason, we accept that. People are not outraged that this is happening. Perhaps because it has been going on for so long people just don’t give thought to it. Perhaps other issues in society, such as an assorted celebrities death or another’s pregnancy or maybe a new song came out or the like. Whatever the cause, it still shows that our society not only accepts but rewards greedy bastards who care more about their profit margin than they do about human life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does tobacco show about the people who smoke, however? Tobacco has no discernable “high” like most other drugs. The nicotine in cigarettes can cause a sort of lightheadedness, but that lasts for a few minutes at best and is nowhere near as intense as the highs of things such as cannabis. There can be a high in certain cigarettes that last for a bit longer, but it still doesn’t reach the level that things such as cannabis highs do. So why do people start smoking if there is seemingly no benefit? Societal pressures; people want to be accepted, and if their friends are smoking, they’ll start as well. People are malleable, and many cannot stand peer pressure. And so tobacco companies thrive on people having cigarettes to fit in. Regardless of how they start, they stay smoking because it is made to be addictive. It is made to keep you coming back and buying more and more cigarettes, giving your disposable income to the tobacco companies for as long as you live, until you keel over and die from your excessive tobacco use. So tobacco shows us two things about our society; greed is acceptable and praised regardless of the cost on human life, and that people are malleable and will do obscene and outright dangerous things to be accepted by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we turn to the drug that many people deny is a drug at all: caffeine. Caffeine is so prevalent and socially acceptable in our society that many consider it taboo to call it a drug at all. I do not care what dream world they reside in, for caffeine is most certainly a drug. Like tobacco with cigarettes, the main form of caffeine consumption worldwide is the coffe industry. Whilst only a little over 20% of American adults reported regular cigarette use, the disturbingly high number of 90% of adults in the United States reported using coffee on a regular basis. The average adult consumes around three and a half cups of coffee daily. Equally as terrifying, 75% of children from the ages of 8 to 12 years old reported daily coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst coffee has no immediate health risks that result in death, their effects are much more subtle and less noticeable than the likes of tobacco and alcohol. And it’s not so much the health effects that coffee cause as it is the societal effects. For instance, caffeine, when consumed moderately, has been shown to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, and Parkinson’s disease as well as improving endurance. However, it has also been shown to increase one’s heart rate, blood pressure, and may even cause irregular heartbeats. Also, coffee is an addictive stimulant, for it changes the structure of your brain and makes it more alert and hyperactive. Therefore, if one were to try and stop consuming coffee, their brain and their whole body would feel very lethargic, slow, and less active. They could even experience coffee withdrawal. The coffee companies don’t mind, and as long as people are willing to drink coffee they are happy to oblige their addiction. The global coffee industry amasses around $60 billion a year. However, less than 10% of that money ends up in the hands of the farmers in third-world countries who actually grow the crop; most goes to the international conglomerates who distribute and sell coffee to the consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does coffee reveal about our society? Obviously it shows that executives once again care about profit more than humanity, and have no qualms selling an addictive stimulant to adults and children alike. However, because the health risks are less obvious, it is harder to make such a conclusion. No, I think the real insight coffee gives us is with the typical consumer. Caffeine is a drug that stimulates one’s mind into working faster and keeps them from sleeping. This shows that our society values a productive and fast individual who can contribute to a company daily. At the pace our economy works the typical employee, without coffee many of them would fizzle out and not be able to take the work load. Coffee is a supplement that allows people to work extremely long hours completing extraordinarily large amount of tasks. Coffee is a vital component of our modern economy, and without it many businesses cannot and would not thrive. Coffee is essential in keeping the typical worker working day after day, even though they are not getting enough sleep. Coffee allows us as a society to work for longer than we normally could work. That shows that we value productivity, regardless of the health risk and the fact that it is an addictive stimulant that allows us to be so productive. It appears that society is willing to sell its mind for a little more productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally that brings us to the end of our journey: alcohol. Like caffeine, alcohol is extremely prevalent in our society. Over 75% of all adults consume alcohol regularly in the United States. 41.8% of all high school students regularly drink alcohol. Of these 41.8%, over 60% engage in binge drinking. Among adults, over 20% of drinkers engage in binge drinking. Alcohol, like tobacco, has enormous health risks, both physical and mental. Each year, around 79,000 people die from alcohol poisoning alone. That number is significantly higher if one adds the number killed from drunk driving and alcohol induced homicide. Alcohol can cause liver cancer, as well as alcoholism. Alcoholics, or those who have an excessive addiction to the drug, can ruin families, ruin their own lives, and even take the lives of others. Whilst caffeine is a stimulant, alcohol is a depressant; that is, caffeine makes you more alert and awake, and alcohol dulls your senses and slows things down. The two make a nice mix; drink coffee to keep the worker productive, but once they’re down make them drink alcohol so they forget the whole experience of working and dumb themselves down to ever question why they’re drinking both coffee and alcohol. Once again, it seems companies care not for the societal ills that their product inflict upon society, for the alcohol industry made over $80 billion last year alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve thrown a bunch of facts at you about alcohol, what does it say about our society? First and foremost, it shows that we as a people need an escape mechanism to run away from everyday life. As caffeine makes us more productive, we want to forget about work and “just have a good time,” so we turn to alcohol. Alcohol makes us more confident, more relaxed, more outgoing; it makes us what we wish we were. So we go out, make ourselves dumber and do stupid things to try and escape from the society that we live in. A society so focused on greed and profits and productivity that the only way to escape is through a drug that impaires your ability to think. And so we consume alcohol, not because we want to, but because we &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to. To avoid going crazy from all the mayhem, we need to drink alcohol and forget all our troubles, even if it’s just for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the three legal drugs create a triangle that controls society. Tobacco keeps people addicted, helpless, and constantly spending their disposable income on something they don’t really want nor do they need. Caffeine keeps people productive and constantly working so they can’t think about the work they’re really doing. And alcohol is used to make people forget all their troubles and leave the real world for a bit. As Bill Hicks so eloquently said, “Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in.” The legal drugs do indeed create a prison that we must break out of, and only through understand their effects on our everyday life can we possibly hope to begin the process of escaping. &lt;/p&gt;

These mammoth beasts have brought down entire civilizations, and have been feared for millennia. The Chinese called them the “Great Wind.” When the Spanish arrived in the Caribbean during the 16th century, hurricanes were a new phanomenon for them. Therefore, they took the natives’ word, huracan. Huracan in the Taino language (a language indigenous to the Caribbean region) meant “Storm God,” for these storms were so powerful that they could only be the work of some divine being. Worldwide, they are referred to as tropical cyclones. Regardless of the name, hurricanes are a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are hurricanes, exactly? Put simply, hurricanes are low pressure systems that contain a warm core and an eye of calm in the middle, with thunderstorms and extremely fast wind speeds orbiting the eye. Hurricanes can also spawn tornadoes, and may boast huge storm surges of water that can flood entire regions. They typically develop over large, warm bodies of water, and gain strength the longer they are over warm water. Over land, they gradually lose strength until they fade into nothingness. Tropical cyclones form all over the world, and impact millions upon millions of lives each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have made huge strives in understanding, and thereby predicting the path of, hurricanes. We send planes inside the storm to monitor its progress. We train satellites on the storm to view it from space. We look at atmospheric pressure, weather fronts, water temperature, and computer models to try and predict the path of the storm. But we can never be quite sure. Hurricanes still emit a sense of mystery about them. We still can’t be absolutely positive where a hurricane is headed. And while we do understand them, that doesn’t mean we don’t fear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a hurricane forms, we send out experts to try and classify the storm. Category 1, Category 2, and so on. As humans, we like to put things in little boxes and be done with it. So we give the hurricane a category, and hope it doesn’t change. We name the little fellows, as if they were our friends. We try and personify the hurricane, for it seems almost alive. It moves, it reacts, and it destroys. Just like us. But a hurricane destroys indiscriminately. It cares not for human life. And so our petty attempts at making a hurricane seem playful and unimposing fails, for you can classify and you can name, but you certainly can’t control a hurricane. At least, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, humanity reamins at the mercy of the Great Wind. We cannot stop a hurricane; we can only run from it. And so, a hurricane garners a certain sort of respect. It commands respect, and by the gods does it deserve it. A hurricane can tear every single thing you hold dear to shreds in a matter of seconds. Power like that certainly deserves respect. So as you hunker down inside your home and Irene swirls around you, be scared, sure, but also respect the storm that threatens you so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a hurricane makes landfall, it is a sad event. Not just for the humans inhabiting the area, but for the hurricane itself. For once a hurricane hits land, it knows that it’s on its last legs. It will lose strength gradually, and then fade away into nothingness. So the hurricane goes out with a bang. It destroys. It kills. It terrorizes. And then it dies. More hurricanes will come, but never one just like it. When a hurricane dies, never again will the Earth witness another hurricane like it. Each hurricane has its own quirks, its own size, its own wind speed and storms and path and countless other things that separate it from the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irene will hit, and when it does, she’ll destroy some property. But if she had the choice, she wouldn’t. She’d stay out in the open sea forever, living on for all eternity. But the choice is out of her hands in the same way it is out of our’s. Irene must die so that other hurricanes may live. She must die, like all other life. And when she does, her memory will be forgotten by nature. Plants will regrow, animals will return, and all will return to normal. But not us. We shall remember. In that way, hurricanes and humans are connected. For once a hurricane ceases to exist, it is humanity that carries its exploits with them. The storm may die, but the impact of a hurricane never will, so long as there are humans around to witness them. And that is almost beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/gpWGvMZsnnE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/gpWGvMZsnnE/9486423006</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9486423006</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2011 23:34:11 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9486423006</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The story of a man with a map that houses a new world.

It will take you on a journey to another world, make you care for characters that don’t exist, and get you involved in a story that could never happen. Recently, that game was Bastion. Bastion is a indie action-RPG, developed as the debut game of a new studio, Supergiant Games. And it’s fantastic. The art style, narration, gameplay, and story all draw you in to create an unforgettable experience. And at the end, I did in fact cry my eyes out. Why, you may ask? Well, to see what Bastion did right, we must examine what most other games (and all other story-telling mediums, for that matter) do wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I play video games for the same reason that I watch movies or read books; I want to experience a story. Each of these three mediums have different ways of conveying stories to the adventurous soul who decides to embark on the journey. Books let its readers’ imaginations run wild, and the reader creates the world the book is set in. Movies (and television shows) show the viewer the story, and hope that the viewer can connect due to the use of real life imagery. But video games, at least for me, evoke the most potent emotional connection and response. Unlike movies and books, video games don’t feed the player a story. In video games, the player &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the story. He participates in it, and moves the plot forward. Characters help him and hamper him, interacting with the player. Because of this deep personal connection one feels with the characters in a video game as opposed to a book or movie, emotions seem a bit heightened whilst playing. I can confidently say that I’ve cried more during video games than I have during books and movies combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all video games have deep, engrossing stories in the same way that not all movies try to tell a story. Some movies just want the viewer to watch as explosions tear apart the screen and dead bodies litter the ground. Likewise, some video games just want the player to experience thrill after thrill, leaving virtually no room to tell a story. But when a game gets it right, and focuses on a character driven story where the player drives the plot forward, it’s a pretty damn beautiful experience. Bastion is one of these games. So even if you’re not a gamer, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life, I implore you to play Bastion. It’s a game that will make you cry, and it’s a game that will make you think about your own life. Bastion poses some big questions about what it means to be human, and like any good game, it’s up to you, the player, to answer them. So yes, I cried when Bastion ended, and I’m sure you will too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/qBr04XFy1j0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/qBr04XFy1j0/9379844488</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9379844488</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 13:31:10 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9379844488</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A speech by Steve Jobs on life and death.</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="304"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/D1R-jKKp3NA&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D1R-jKKp3NA&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="304" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A speech by Steve Jobs on life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~4/JC0f0wYt43w" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HistoricallyIrrelevant/~3/JC0f0wYt43w/9377670680</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9377670680</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 12:19:00 -0400</pubDate><feedburner:origLink>http://historicallyirrelevant.com/post/9377670680</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
