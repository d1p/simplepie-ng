		<title>Over</title>
		<description><![CDATA[You had me into it, now I&#8217;m over it. I believed that you were worth it. You had my tortured heart closed in a vise that longed to breathe new meaning into both you and me. Months and years pass, shielded from connection, the silence between our best intentions. And soon, and predictably, I grew [...]]]></description>

The feelings that you get Late, in the night keeps you wanted You&#8217;re a thief in the break That I could never afford to have. So who am I to judge when [...]]]></description>

		<title>Erie</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Cleveland, you were the summer That I never thought I&#8217;d get over. The winds off Lake Erie whipping at me Without a care in the world. Walking down Coventry With the whole of my curiosity, The smokestacks would expel The promise of your Rust Belt romance. Circling about the crown of the shore, Like a [...]]]></description>

		<title>13</title>
		<description><![CDATA[This is probably the only time that I&#8217;ll be writing in a very direct fashion here, because when I started Agendacide 13 years ago, it served an entirely different purpose for me. Obviously a lot has changed over many years. I&#8217;ve changed repeatedly and in many a different direction. I&#8217;ve made many a mistake, and [...]]]></description>

		<title>Close, Closer</title>
		<description><![CDATA[You tried to tell me the other night. But regardless of whether or not it&#8217;s said aloud, and how it&#8217;s articulated, I already know what you mean. So you don&#8217;t have to say a thing. There are few I keep within the walls of this heart of mine. And to tell you quite honestly, I&#8217;m [...]]]></description>

		<title>Katonah</title>
		<description><![CDATA[We were driving with no destination, trying to catch up on things. It was some days before your birthday and it couldn&#8217;t have mattered how much time had passed between. And instantly, I&#8217;m fifteen again, listening to Clapton in the Royal Albert Hall, while I am left to navigate the corners of my universe with [...]]]></description>

		<title>It&#8217;s there because he meant something</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Why does he leave me here, lost within the silence and the prison of my head? I am left to pick up the pieces of all the things in the world that I thought he might have valued and desired? Of the void within my chest, left to fill? The story of who he was [...]]]></description>

		<title>Rest in peace, my dear father.</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Today, because of you, I am stronger than I&#8217;ve ever been. You always pushed me to come out a champion, and never had me settle for second best. I am tougher, more resilient, and every bit the Daddy&#8217;s girl knowing that I am your legacy in this world. I love you, and miss you, and [...]]]></description>

		<title>Thelxiepeia&#8217;s Sworn Duty</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Here, in the solitude, alone, within my thoughts and memories, awake They can&#8217;t touch you. You said, while we were standing there, in the enormity, I was supposed to promise you Promise you that no matter what, I protect that memory Preserve, keep, like a guardian, keep safe that moment that we flirted dangerously with [...]]]></description>

		<title>The Stars &amp; The Time Thereafter</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Selfishly, I have often chosen to remember you as you were in that doorway, rid of all of the trivial details of our lives as we knew it to be. It all seems to clear to me: How cold your hands were when they touched my face. How you had traced my lips with your [...]]]></description>
