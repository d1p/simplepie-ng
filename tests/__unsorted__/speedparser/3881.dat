<p><strong>Finding and searching for homes</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/MLS-Search.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-280" title="MLS-Search-with-iPad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/MLS-Search.jpg" alt="MLS-Search-with-iPad" width="120" height="50" /></a>MLS -- by using the 3G service built into many ipads, the agents are able to search the mls online live with clients anywhere they go. The agents love providing clients with more information about homes while hosting open houses or showing homes.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/4af143cd9ce05897b1430127bd91491b.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-281" title="zillow app for iPad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/4af143cd9ce05897b1430127bd91491b.png" alt="zillow app for iPad" width="75" height="75" /></a><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Trulia-app-for-iPad.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-282" title="Trulia-app-for-iPad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Trulia-app-for-iPad.png" alt="Trulia-app-for-iPad" width="75" height="75" /></a>Zillow &amp; Trulia -- Both of these apps can identify your current location and show you details about homes in the nearby area. You can easily pan around the map to find other homes with features your client is looking for. The mapping system on both these aps also let you turn the satelitte view on for easier viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Document and Contract Managment</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/dropbox-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-283" title="dropbox-app-for-ipad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/dropbox-icon-150x150.png" alt="dropbox-app-for-ipad" width="75" height="75" /></a>Dropbox -- If you don&#8217;t have Dropbox yet, this is a must have app. It allows you to share documents between your home computer, your laptop, your iPad and your smartphone. Simply put your documents, pdfs, photos, music files, etc. into the Dropbox folder on your computer and these documents are now easily accessible on your iPad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66aU-4pePpk"><span class="youtube">
<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/66aU-4pePpk?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;loop=&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</span><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66aU-4pePpk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=66aU-4pePpk</a></p></a></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/quick-office-pro.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-284" title="quick office pro app for ipad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/quick-office-pro.jpg" alt="quick office pro app for ipad" width="75" height="75" /></a>Quick Office Pro -- This app allows you to open and modify your Microsoft Office documents right on your iPad.  Apple and Microsoft don&#8217;t work together easily, but this app make it possible to view and edit your existing real estate documents.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/PDFEXpertIcon_thumb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-285" title="PDF Expert app for ipad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/PDFEXpertIcon_thumb-150x150.jpg" alt="PDF Expert app for ipad" width="75" height="75" /></a>PDF Expert -- After some experiementing with a few PDF apps, this was our favorite. This app allows you to open files from your Dropbox or Google Docs accounts, or directly from your email in to the program, Once open you can add text directly to the document, write on with the pen tool, complete fillable PDF&#8217;s, and even add your signature, or have your clients initial or sign the documents right on the iPad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsK2Yy9bWI"><span class="youtube">
<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yPsK2Yy9bWI?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;loop=&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</span><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsK2Yy9bWI">www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsK2Yy9bWI</a></p></a></p>
<p><em>TIP -</em> Our office has prepared our contract as a PDF with fillable blanks and the agents can easily fill in all the blanks when writing a contract, then have the clients intial and sign. The agent can then immediately email the contract directly to the co-op agent plus a copy to the client at the same time.</p>
<p><em>TIP -</em> Some of our agents are reducing the paper clutter when showing homes. They are saving the property information sheets for their showings as a PDF then placing the PDF in their Dropbox account. Once there they can open the property info sheets in PDF Expert to share the details of the property with the client while touring the properties, make notes for the clients on each sheet, then email the clients the property sheets with notes included when the showings are complete.</p>
<p><strong>Printing with the iPad</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/printnshare.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-286" title="print n share app for Ipad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/printnshare.jpg" alt="print n share app for Ipad" width="75" height="75" /></a>Print N Share -- Once this app is added to your iPad, you can easily print to any printer on your network. It does require a small program to be installed and running on a computer on the network which acts as the print server. Your iPad will find be able to print to any printer the computer would be able to print to.</p>

This was specialy designed for iPad and iPhones for easy printing from these iOS devices. The HP printer I bought was under $140 and required no setup or special apps on my iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellanous apps and accessories</strong></p>

This is the app for you. You must have a Google Voice account already setup, but once setup, it works very similar to iPhone&#8217;s phone system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiCHaYVX3fk"><span class="youtube">

It has a few more features than the standard iPad email app.  We enjoy using this over the standard Mail app because it allows the mark unread option as well as a few other features you can do in GMail that the other doesn&#8217;t offer.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-290" title="easy download photos to ipad" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-150x150.png" alt="easy download photos to ipad" width="75" height="75" /></a>My wife loves taking photos with her camera, but was having difficulty getting the photos to her iPad without going through the whole iTunes syncning process. She found this great accessory which allows you to take your photos directly from your SD card or camera to your iPad.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-271" title="images" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="241" /></a>A friend of mine emailed me this morning with a question that has inspired this quick post.</p>
<p>Q. John, Can you help me?  I have posted messages to my company Facebook page, but I don&#8217;t think it is going to my fan&#8217;s walls.  Why don&#8217;t they get my posts?</p>
<p>A. My understanding is this is caused by a Facebook algorithm called EdgeRank.</p>
<p>When you (or your friends or fans) login to Facebook, the middle section of the page contains your News Feed.  This is where you can see the information and news that your friend took the time to post to Facebook in hopes that you care enough to read it.  BUT&#8230; did you know, that this news feed does not contain EVERYTHING your friends post to Facebook?  If you look at the very top of your news feed, you will see two options, one says &#8220;Top News&#8221; and the other says &#8220;Most Recent.&#8221;  Facebook, by default, loads the &#8220;Top News&#8221; from your friends when you first login to Facebook.</p>
<p>Your &#8220;Top News&#8221; is where EdgeRank comes in.  EdgeRank rates your friends&#8217; posts and will only post the most popular stories, photos, videos and links to your &#8220;Top News&#8221; news feed.  How it ranks these is not black and white, but it does give more credit to photos and videos and to status updates that generated lots of interaction.  This interaction is defined by the number of &#8220;Likes&#8221; and the number of Comments the post has generated.</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder why stories from yesterday or even a few days ago are showing up on your newsfeed?  That is EdgeRank, those stories are ranking high and if you look, I&#8217;ll bet those stories had good interaction.</p>
<p>If you want to ensure your post is read by more people, make sure you encourage comments and likes in your status updates!  Ask open ended questions, tell people to Like your status, tell your friends and family to like your stuff when they see you post.  The more interaction you get, the more eyes will see it.</p>
<p>If you want to get more out of Facebook and read all the posts from your friends, you simply have to click the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; button at the top!  And  as a bonus, by clicking on the arrow next to the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; button, you can pick and choose which group of friends posts you want to read through.  That is, if you have your friends separated into groups. <img src='http://tipsandtech.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> may be the answer to finally keep you organized!</p>
<p>If you ever visited my office pre-2011 you know that I was addicted to sticky note.   I would write on them when listening to my phone messages,  when I got an email I needed to take action on, if made a commitment to help someone with something in the future, or if I just had an awesome idea (like creating TichsandTech.com.)  I had sticky notes all over my desk.  When I had to pull a new stack out of my drawer and I started using a different color, that was my cue to finish all the things on the notes of the previous color.</p>
<p>Not a great system!</p>
<p>In 2011 I have been making every effort to work as paperless as possible and you can definitely tell it is working.  If you saw my desk today compared to only a few months ago, there are no sticky notes anywhere!  One of the tools I have been using that is helping me keep my notes organized is Evernote.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc" target="_blank">Google Chrome Extension </a>to save webclips and pages directly to Evernote, plus I have been making notes on my phone and on my desktop and every note syncs on every device. <img src='http://tipsandtech.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Check out this great blog post, <a href="http://p1fran.com/2011/01/forever-evernote/" target="_blank">Forever Evernote</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ProfessionalOne" target="_blank">@ProfessionalOne</a> for more about Evernote and some specific examples of how a REALTOR® uses Evernote is his business daily.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Ever wonder how you can send a status update, post a link or post a photo in Facebook, but only have it display to a specific set of friends?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is possible and today you are going to learn just how easy this awesome feature is to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I commonly want post a joke or a funny video to Facebook, but only want my REALTOR® friends to see it.  The first step is sorting your friends into lists.  <a href="http://tipsandtech.com/managing-facebook-with-friend-lists/" target="_blank">We talked about this earlier in the month.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hopefully you know how to post to Facebook!  at the top of your newsfeed you know that you simply enter your status update, upload your photo or ad your link.  What you may not have ever noticed, but has always been there is the little &#8220;padlock&#8221; icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-255 aligncenter" title="1-27-2011 9-11-13 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-11-13-PM1.png" alt="" width="509" height="138" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This padlock holds the secret we are looking for today.  When you click on it, you have a few options fro who will receive your update.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-17-56-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-256" title="1-27-2011 9-17-56 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-17-56-PM.png" alt="" width="196" height="125" /></a>&#8220;Customize&#8221; is the choice you are looking for.  When you click this option a new window appears that allows you to choose specific people to make this particular post visible to. <em>Note: At this point you could also choose who to HIDE this post from, but we&#8217;re not talking about that today!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-20-51-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257" title="1-27-2011 9-20-51 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-20-51-PM.png" alt="" width="528" height="263" /></a>Once you choose the &#8220;Specific People&#8221; option, you can start typing any of your friends by name to specifically choose individuals who will only be able to see the post.  My favorite option here is to enter the name of one of my FRIEND LISTS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-27-15-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-258" title="1-27-2011 9-27-15 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-27-2011-9-27-15-PM.png" alt="" width="326" height="133" /></a>This will only post this particular message to this group of friends, it won&#8217;t show up on anyone else&#8217;s newsfeed!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Untitled-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-226" title="Facebook friend lists" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="201" height="229" /></a>Do you use Facebook everyday and find it difficult to find the information that is most important to you?  Or do you find yourself not using it everyday because you&#8217;re getting information overload?  I have an easy way to manage all your friends so you can easily navigate to the posts and pictures from the people most important to you.</p>
<p>We can easily manage your friends and their information with friends lists.</p>
<p>When you login to Facebook each time, you are automatically shown your newsfeed.  This does NOT include all the posts and pictures your friends have posted to Facebook.  I personally have over 500 Facebook friends and am not always interested in what all 500 of my friends are doing on a daily basis.  I just want to see what my top 100 or so friends are up to, so we will create a friends list.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-227" title="1-9-2011 4-42-07 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-42-07-PM.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="235" height="250" /></p>
<p>To create a friend list, start by going to your menu at the top right of your Facebook page and click &#8220;Account,&#8221; the &#8220;Edit Friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>You should now have a list of all your friends.  at the top right of this page, you will see a button titled &#8221; Create List&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-45-28-PM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-228" title="1-9-2011 4-45-28 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-45-28-PM.jpg" alt="" width="113" height="36" /></a></p>
<p>By clicking this button, a window will popup with all of your friends in the window.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-47-39-PM.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-229 alignleft" title="1-9-2011 4-47-39 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-47-39-PM.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="354" height="338" /></a>Here you need to give your list a name and choose all the friends you would like to be in this particular list.</p>
<p>When you have all your friends chosen for the list, click the  &#8221;Create List&#8221; button at the bottom of the popup window.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-232" title="1-9-2011 4-58-47 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-4-58-47-PM-300x145.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="300" height="145" /></p>
<p>You can create as many lists as you want and even add each friend to more than one list.  For example, I have 6 different lists.  Some people are on two or three lists so I can pull up a list and they would show up in each group.  Back on the &#8220;Edit Friends&#8221; page you can see which list each friend is on, by moving your mouse to right side of each friends box to find the invisible &#8220;Edit List&#8221; button.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-235 alignright" title="1-9-2011 5-02-02 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-5-02-02-PM.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="139" height="167" /></p>
<p>Once your lists are created, you can edit which lists your friends are associated with right here by click on this once invisible button.</p>
<p><strong>NOW&#8230;. How does this make your daily Facebook experience easier?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238" title="1-9-2011 5-07-41 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-5-07-41-PM-230x300.jpg" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="230" height="300" /></p>
<p>When I login to Facebook I immediately go to the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; link above your Newsfeed.  This will bring a list of all your friends lists up so you can pick and choose whose information you want to read through right now.</p>
<p><strong>This even works on my Iphone!  Let me show you how.</strong></p>
<p>When I open Facebook on my phone, I immediately click on the button at to top right.  This button will be labeled either &#8220;Live Feed&#8221; or it will be the Friend List you are currently viewing.</p>
<div id="attachment_240" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 229px">
	<a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-5-16-49-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-240  " title="1-9-2011 5-16-49 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-9-2011-5-16-49-PM-229x300.png" alt="managing facebook with lists" width="229" height="300" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Facebook Lists on the Iphone</p>
</div>
<p>When you click on this button, you will have the opportunity to change the list you are currently viewing.</p>
<p>This save me time everyday, because I use my phone for Facebook probably 80% of my total Facebook time.   I can easily change to the list I want to read.  I made a list called &#8220;My Favorites&#8221; and have included all my favorite friends to this list so I can find the posts from the friends and family that are most important to me.</p>
<p>If I decide I want to see another list, simply change lists, and you can see what a completely different group of people is up to in their daily lives.</p>
<p>My next post will be about how you can send pictures, links or status updates to specific people, or even to a specific Friends List!</p>
<p>Do you have a Facebook specific topic you&#8217;d like me to write about?</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-211 alignright" title="1-4-2011 7-57-13 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-4-2011-7-57-13-PM.png" alt="" width="198" height="166" /></p>
<p>Once you complete the easy registration process, completing your first newsletter is as simple as the image to the right.</p>
<p>But first, before you write your first newsletter, you need to add some contacts.  Adding contacts is not difficult.  You can either, manually enter your contacts, or if you export them form your contact manager as a Comma Delimited file, you can copy and paste the entire list right in without too much effort.  One of the cool features in your newsletter is an automatic UNSUBSCRIBE link.  When a contact who wishes to unsubscribe, they simply click the link and the system will remove them.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-4-2011-7-34-50-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-213" title="1-4-2011 7-34-50 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-4-2011-7-34-50-PM.png" alt="" width="202" height="184" /></a>Another nice feature is that you can easily get the HTML code that you can embed on to your current website that allows visitors to signup for your newsletter on their own.</p>
<p>The menu options are fairly straight forward and not to complex.  Here is the menu;<img class="size-full wp-image-212 alignright" title="1-4-2011 7-56-38 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1-4-2011-7-56-38-PM.png" alt="" width="305" height="250" /></p>
<p>Another cool feature was that is one of your reader &#8220;replies&#8221; to your email newsletter, you get an email notifying you of their response and keeps all of the replies in the TinyLetter system.</p>
<p>TinyLetter did have a few features I was looking for and didn&#8217;t find.  It would be great if they offered nice looking visual templates for your newsletters.  It does allow you to add a custom background, but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work during my testing.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a simple way for your website visitors to signup for regular contact from you by asking to receive your newsletter, and to easily keep in touch with your current contacts, TinyLetter might be a good solution for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-203" title="facebook cow" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images-1.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="175" /></a>Are you tired of your Facebook friends asking for or offering you cows, chickens and guns?  One of the biggest reasons I hear from my business associates is that they don&#8217;t use Facebook because of all the clutter.</p>
<p>Game developers have created many online games that let you play with and interact with your online Facebook friends. MafiaWars and Farmville are two of the most popular games out, and the bad thing is that they seem to take over your friend&#8217;s Facebook news feeds. Did you know that these notifications can easily be turned off?  Today, I&#8217;m going to show you how to turn these annoying notices off for good.</p>
<p>This is a fairly easy process.  It is so easy, I&#8217;m going to show you how to remove these notifications in 3 easy steps.</p>
<p>1.  Open your Facebook (that was easy!)</p>
<p>2. Read through your news feed until you find one of these notifications.  It could be Cafe World, Farmville, Cityville, QuizWhiz, Mafia Wars, or a number of other things that you see coming up on a regular basis.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Picture1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204" title="farmlist" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Picture1.png" alt="" width="531" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>3.  When you find one, move your mouse to the top right of the notification.  You will notice that a &#8220;X&#8221; appears.  Click on the &#8220;X&#8221; and you are give a few options.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-20-2010-2-42-10-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205" title="12-20-2010 2-42-10 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-20-2010-2-42-10-PM.png" alt="" width="510" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, click &#8220;Hide all by &lt;name of the game&gt;,&#8221; and notifications from that game will never be seen again!</p>
<p><em>Note:  If you click &#8220;Hide all by &lt;your friends name&gt;, you will never see any posts by this person ever again, so be careful you click the correct selection!</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-188" title="fb" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="224" /></a>I had two agents ask me today, how do I stop getting all these emails from Facebook? I decided it must be the subject of a TipsAndTech.com article, because many people must have the same questions.</p>
<p>By default, Facebook wants to email you a notification every time something happen in Facebook that relates to your account.  The initial idea was to prompt you to go back into Facebook to see what someone wrote on your wall, commented about, see the photo they tagged you in, etc. Nowadays, visiting Facebook and checking your updates is about as common as checking your email account.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m going to show you how to turn those annoying email notifications off for good.  I will suggest that you keep just a few turned on, but we&#8217;ll save that for later.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-191 alignleft" title="12-15-2010 3-39-36 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-15-2010-3-39-36-PM.png" alt="" width="281" height="265" />Once you login to your Facebook, you should click the Account button at the top right of your Facebook page.  Then click on Account Settings.</p>
<p>You settings page will then be displayed.  From here you need to click the Notifications tab at the top.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-15-2010-3-42-27-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-192 alignnone" title="12-15-2010 3-42-27 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-15-2010-3-42-27-PM.png" alt="" width="272" height="121" /></a>Below, you will see two columns with checkbox options where you can select when you want to be notified and by which method, by email, or by text message.  <em>If the text message boxes are grayed out and not selectable, You can click on the Mobile tab at the top to set that option up.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-15-2010-3-46-56-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-194 alignright" title="12-15-2010 3-46-56 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-15-2010-3-46-56-PM.png" alt="" width="320" height="223" /></a>If you are frustrated by the number of emails you get from Facebook I suggest you uncheck all the boxes in the email column except for a select few.  I suggest you leave these few on for sure, and any others that you think are important.</p>
<ul>
<li>sends you a message</li>
<li>posts on your wall</li>
<li>tags me on their profile</li>
<li>tags you in a post</li>
<li>tags you in a photo</li>
<li>comments on a story on your wall</li>
<li>tags you at a place</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you should leave these options on, either as an email or a text message because these are your friends trying to engage with you directly.  Remember Facebook is about engaging with people.</p>
<p><strong>Once you have the checkboxes set, be sure to hit the Save button at the bottom of the page. </strong></p>
<p>Hopefully these tips help you control the amount of email you are receiving from Facebook.  If you think this was useful, please let me know in the comments  below!</p>
<ul>
<li>tags you in a video</li>
</ul>

<p>Google Docs is a free online service that provides an online alternative to Microsoft Office.  It includes a word processor, a spreadsheet builder, a presentation builder, an online storage location, and a form builder.  Today we are going to talk about the form builder.</p>
<p>If you have a website, then hopefully you know that just having a website is not going to typically make you money.  Most agent websites out there today, are static brochure type websites that don&#8217;t encourage any interaction.  Call-to-action is the name of the game.  You must give them an excuse to engage with you by actually giving you their contact information for something in return.  An online form is the simplest way for them to share their information with you.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-14-2010-3-16-01-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-182 alignleft" title="12-14-2010 3-16-01 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-14-2010-3-16-01-PM.png" alt="" width="168" height="159" /></a>You&#8217;ve seen them and most likely filled an online form out to get some information a website promised you.  Now you will be able to create your own online form to generate potential clients.</p>
<p>The first step is how are you going to get people to actually fill the form out.  You must give them something compelling that they can&#8217;t get anywhere else more easily.  How about offer them a free report about a hot topic in your field?  How about offer them a free evaluation or estimate?  The ideas are endless.  Look at your business and ask yourself, what do people want that I can provide.  For my REALTOR® friends here are a few ideas&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a free report titled &#8220;10 Mistakes home buyers make and how to avoid them!&#8221;</li>
<li>Offer a free list of foreclosed properties in your area.</li>
<li>Offer a free home evaluation or market study to potential sellers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What other things could you offer to your clients to encourage them to give you, &#8220;a salesperson&#8221;, their contact information?</p>
<p><em>Note: If you promise to give them a report or some kind of service, send them the information they asked for!</em></p>
<p>So now you just need to know how to create the form and get it out to the masses!  Well I don&#8217;t want to reinvent the wheel here.  <a href="http://210consulting.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Blanton at 210 Consulting</a> has already written a great article and created a nice video on the process. You get the rest of the information here.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dropittome.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164" title="dropittome" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dropittome.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="32" /></a>Yesterday <a href="http://tipsandtech.com/store-files-online-and-access-them-from-any-computer-with-dropbox/" target="_blank">we talked about DropBox</a> and how you can store files in one centralized location and access or share the files from anywhere.  Today we are going to check out another tool that integrates with Dropbox called <a href="http://dropitto.me" target="_blank">DropItTo.Me</a>.</p>
<p>When you first visit, you will be required to create a new login and password by clicking the &#8220;Resister&#8221; button.  When you register, you will have to create an &#8220;upload&#8221; password.  We&#8217;ll get to this in a minute, first let talk about what this cool tool can do for you.</p>
<p>Have you ever had someone try to email you a file that never was delivered.  Some email services put limits on the file sizes they will allow to be delivered.  If a file that is too large tries to come through, your email service will reject it and sometimes not even tell the sender the email bounced and why.  This is where DropItTo.Me comes in.  It gives you your very own upload link on the internet for you to share with the person sending you the large file(s).  Mine is <a href="http://dropitto.me/jringo" target="_blank">DropItTo.Me/jringo</a> and looks like the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-12-24-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-166 alignnone" title="12-9-2010 4-12-24 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-12-24-PM.png" alt="" width="591" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>This is where the &#8220;upload&#8221; password comes in.  First you share your personal DropItTo.Me url with them and then give them your &#8220;upload&#8221; password.  they simple visit the url, enter the password.  They then see a screen like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-17-20-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-167" title="12-9-2010 4-17-20 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-17-20-PM.png" alt="" width="582" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>Your sender can then upload files to you one at a time.</p>
<p>But where do the files go you may ask?  This is where Dropbox comes in. <img src='http://tipsandtech.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>When you register for your DropItTo.Me account, it integrates with your Dropbox account and automatically creates a folder called DropItToMe <a href="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-18-55-PM.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-168" title="12-9-2010 4-18-55 PM" src="http://tipsandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-9-2010-4-18-55-PM.png" alt="" width="92" height="125" /></a> in your Dropbox folder.  You can then access the files from any of your Dropbox locations.</p>
<p>Sharing big files has never been easier and this is just plain cool right?  Let me know in the comments below if you have used this and how it has worked for you.</p>
<p><em>On a side note: I want to warn you to be aware who you share your url and upload password with.  These files do go directly to your computer, so don&#8217;t share this info with anyone you don&#8217;t trust.  An evildoer could easily upload a virus that could destroy all the data on your hard drive.</em></p>
