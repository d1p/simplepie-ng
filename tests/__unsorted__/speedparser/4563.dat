<p><em>If you&#8217;ve ever found your articles reprinted without your permission &#8212; and I&#8217;m talking more than what&#8217;s considered fair use &#8212; then you&#8217;ll love today&#8217;s article.

Please welcome Angela as this week&#8217;s guest blogger and feel free to leave a comment about your thoughts or experiences with content theft. ~ Melanie</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">**********</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the blogging world there is one thing we&#8217;ll all have to deal with sooner or later &#8212; content scraping. This is when someone steals a post or article you wrote and publishes it on their own site.</p>
<p>While this used to have some serious SEO implications, these have been recently minimized by Google in new algorithms that help determine which post was the original and which is the duplicate. However, this content scraping is, quite simply, theft. Theft of your work. Theft of potential readers. And a sign of incredible laziness (or ignorance) on the part of the thief.</p>
<p>Perhaps you discovered the theft in a <a href="http://www.angengland.com/how-to-find-plagiarized-content-using-google-alerts/"  target="_blank">Google Alert you set up</a> (and you should definitely be doing that), when a friend DM&#8217;d or emailed you to say &#8220;Hey &#8212; isn&#8217;t this your post you wrote last month?&#8221;, or just by pure happenstance. Whatever the method of discovery, I have some tried-and-true ways of dealing with content thieves you might find useful.</p>
<h3>Stay Calm and Be Polite When Dealing with Content Thieves</h3>
<p>My initial knee-jerk reaction is usually, &#8220;How dare they!?&#8221; but this is rarely a useful response. If this is a live human being, it&#8217;s probably better to try emailing them or using their website contact form if possible to inform them that you are the copyright holder of the post in question (Be sure to link to which post you are talking about). My initial email or comment usually goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi! My name is Angela England and I&#8217;m glad you found my article about lavender essential oil useful, however this article is protected by copyright and cannot be republished without permission. You can remit a one-time reprint fee of $XXX via paypal to &lt;my paypal address&gt;. Alternatively, I am available to create an original piece on this topic specifically geared towards your audience for $XX. Otherwise this article needs to be removed within 24 business hours. Thanks so much! &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>There are a couple of important things to notice in my sample email above:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I used a statement rather than a question</strong>. A question can be answered negatively and legally can be ignored. Had I asked, &#8220;Would you mind taking it down?&#8221; They could have replied, &#8220;Yes I mind&#8221;. You must say &#8220;This article needs to be removed&#8230;.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>I invited the content scraper to hire me or pay me.</strong> Obviously you can only offer a reprint fee option if that option is available for that particular post. However, I generally charge about $50 more for a reprint fee than I offer for creating an original article for that person. I would rather them hire me to create a new piece than to have duplicate content floating about all over the web. Besides, lots of people don&#8217;t realize that blog posts and websites aren&#8217;t a free-for-all. Educate them by offering to hire yourself out. This not only creates a potential win/win situation, but also makes it very clear that your words have VALUE and aren&#8217;t up for grabs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Filing a DMCA Complaint Against Content Thieves</h3>
<p>One time out of 10 I get a new job when I send that email. One time out of 10 I get a reprint fee paid to me. Five times out of 10 the articles disappear &#8212; usually without a single word of acknowledgement to me at all. So what happens the other three times when there is no response, no reply, and most importantly, my article is STILL up there?</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially if it looks like a legitimate website, I will actually just send an invoice via Paypal. In the invoice I price it higher than my initially stated reprint fee (call it a pain-in-the-butt tax), and will include a notice that payment needs to be remitted with 48 business hours or else the stolen article at http://yourthievingwebsite.com/mystolenpost/ needs to be removed. Sometimes this will work, but sometimes it won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, you move to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py?contact_type=lr_dmca&amp;product=blogger"  target="_blank">filing a DMCA complaint</a>. I usually will do a WHOIS search and find a contact email address and resend my request to that email. I will also contact the host of the site with an official DMCA complaint. And I will contact Google, Yahoo, and other search engines. It&#8217;s not hard to fill out the form and it is, in my opinion, important for bloggers and writers to protect their work. The more often content scrapers &#8220;get away with it&#8221;, the more the problem will continue.</p>
<p>Depending on how much time I have and my feistiness level, I will contact any advertisers on the website as well. All ad networks have rules in place about the type of content that is permissible, and illegally obtained content isn&#8217;t usually approved content. Sometimes the ad networks will remove ads before Google gets to the DMCA complaint &#8212; either way, mission accomplished. (Usually I only contact a website&#8217;s sponsors if someone responds to me with an ignorant email saying something like &#8220;But it was on the internet and everyone knows if it&#8217;s on Google it&#8217;s free to use&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I hope this helps you as you battle content thieves and scrapers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to contact them and tell them your posts need to be removed. Your words have value and deserve to be respected.</p>

That, along with the explanations from f8&#8242;s keynote on Thursday, made everything fit together for me. And my friends, I AM EXCITED.</p>
<h3>Why I&#8217;m Excited About Facebook Timeline, Apps, and Open Graph</h3>
<p>In 1995 I was making websites by coding HTML in Notepad. And I was geeked about how things were emerging and new. I had a job that hadn&#8217;t even been INVENTED when I was growing up. AMAZING.</p>
<p>Fast forward 16 years. I&#8217;ve enjoyed blogging. I&#8217;ve enjoyed <a href="http://twitter.com/chilihead"  target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I&#8217;ve enjoyed Tumblr and Facebook and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/MelanieMontheiNelson"  target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Those were all natural progressions of the path we were on. What Facebook outlined at the 2011 F8 Conference is the first time I&#8217;ve seen a new idea that no one was expecting. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been EXCITED about potential in a long while. What we&#8217;ve been doing up to this point has been a shadow of our social potential. What Facebook is doing is *really* social.</p>
<p>I recognize there are potential problems. People will definitely have to re-think how they share their information and take more ownership of their privacy. They&#8217;ll have to pay closer attention to who they&#8217;re sharing specific content with. I&#8217;m ready to do that (and have been doing it, but I realize I&#8217;m not a &#8220;regular&#8221; user). I think the bigger issue is that people don&#8217;t own their page on Facebook and it shouldn&#8217;t be the only place you&#8217;re keeping these important life moments. I&#8217;m afraid less savvy users &#8212; like our parents, for example &#8212; won&#8217;t understand that. They&#8217;ll assume that if they put it on Facebook, it will be there indefinitely for their use. And that may be true, but I&#8217;ve been in the space long enough that I know we&#8217;re breaking new ground, but you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to be here (or gone) in five years.</p>
<p>But still . . . I&#8217;m excited about the potential.</p>
<p>The issues I point out for less savvy users haven&#8217;t really changed. Those issues have been the same issues since Facebook started &#8212; you don&#8217;t own your content and you shouldn&#8217;t use it as your only means of recording photos/video/anything special. The interface has changed and people may be thrown initially, but I think they will adapt fairly quickly.</p>
<p>As for clients, if FB chooses to install this update to pages as well (which they must), I think this allows a much broader picture of the company and can be much more useful with marketing options. Consider that you can create an entire campaign to share with your fans right on the Wall. You&#8217;d be able to have video, testimonials, and a soundtrack grouped together for a much more interactive update.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen many tweets and Facebook status updates complaining that it&#8217;s too much. The new elements are too hard to navigate. I&#8217;m not negating the fact that there will be a learning curve, but I don&#8217;t think a learning curve is reason enough to hold the process back. We&#8217;re finally moving forward and I can&#8217;t help but be really excited about it.</p>
<h3>Find Out About the New Facebook Timeline, Apps, and OpenGraph</h3>
<p>Knowledge is power. You&#8217;ll probably feel more comfortable with the changes if you understand what they are and how they fit together. At least I felt better after hearing an explanation and reading more about it &#8212; and I hope you will too. To that end, here are some links to help you see what&#8217;s coming and why.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/f8?sk=app_283743208319386" >Replay of the f8 Keynote</a>. If you didn&#8217;t watch the unveiling in real time (or you just want to see it again), you can watch it via the recorded Livestream video on the f8 Facebook page. I&#8217;m not a big Andy Samberg fan, but I admit he made me laugh with his intro bit. But what&#8217;s interesting about the keynote is how Mark Zuckerberg explains how the new rollouts fit together and will change the way we market, buy, and share products. We&#8217;ve been saying &#8220;social media&#8221; for a few years, but we&#8217;re really just now seeing what social can be. Until now, we&#8217;ve been treading water. We&#8217;re finally moving forward with something innovative.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/pQuLhT"  target="_blank">F8&#8242;s Big Facebook Changes: Timeline, Ticker, News Feed, Apps</a>. Can&#8217;t quite bring yourself to sit through a few hours of the keynote? OK. This article highlights the main points. It, along with the other links I&#8217;m providing, should give you enough to see what the rest of us are geeked out about.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=2203694005397"  target="_blank">Video of How Timeline Works</a>. Timeline is going to keep track of your updates and content sharing, but instead of just showing the last few days, it will show <em>everything</em>. You can go back to the first day you joined Facebook. Then you can add more information all the way back to when you were born. This is a new way to share the important milestones of your life. I think I heard someone at F8 call it the year-end report of your life. Or, for those of you who love the crafty, it&#8217;s like an online scrapbook. YOU get to choose what the focus is. Facebook has an algorithm that will try to choose the important information, but you ultimately have control and can decide what&#8217;s featured and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline"  target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s Overview of Timeline</a>. Here you can see each element of the new Timeline and see an explanation of how it will work.</p>
<p><a href="http://tcrn.ch/q5fMUc"  target="_blank">How to Enable the Facebook Timeline Right This Second</a>. If you have the developer app installed on your account, you can see Timeline in action right away when you follow the instructions in this Tech Crunch article. If you don&#8217;t have the app, click over anyway and you can download it and get started. Quick note: Your App Display name can be anything and your App Namespace can also be anything, but it has a character limitation (I think it&#8217;s 13-15 chars max, but I&#8217;m not completely sure). Just pointing that out because I originally assigned a namespace that was too long and it took me a minute to figure out why it didn&#8217;t work immediately.</p>
<h3>How do the New Facebook Changes Affect Privacy?</h3>
<p>You are always in charge of your privacy &#8212; online and offline. Although it&#8217;s not popular to say, it is never the tool&#8217;s responsibility to protect you, it&#8217;s your responsibility to protect you. Would it be easier if the tool, in this case Facebook, started out with your privacy set to the highest level instead of the most open level? Perhaps. But consider two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook&#8217;s mission isn&#8217;t to provide a personal space for you. They want to create a community that is open and whose members constantly share their lives and milestones with others. It makes sense that they would encourage that by setting default privacy to be more open rather than closed.</li>
<li>No matter what the default settings for privacy are, you will most likely have to visit your dashboard and tweak those settings for your own needs. Whether Facebook sets those privacy setting high or low, you still have to go in.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new apps and sharing that are coming to Facebook allow you to have full control over what you share. If you don&#8217;t want to share with people, then don&#8217;t install the application. If you don&#8217;t want everyone to see your Timeline or profile, then change your settings to Friends Only. If you want to share your updates with select people, you can customize your updates by click the Public button below your status update text box and choosing who can and can&#8217;t see your update. Your privacy lies with you as much as it ever did. These new changes are not taking it away. There may or may not be instances where you will need to think twice about what you share and with whom, but you should be doing that anyway.</p>
<p>When you do a tour of the new Timeline, you&#8217;ll see this message about your new &#8220;View Activity&#8221; button on your profile: &#8220;View all your activity. Your activity log lists all your posts and activity, from today back to the beginning. Go here to change the privacy for individual stories, delete posts and more. This is your private resource — no one else can see your activity log.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: Do you use the free wi-fi at your local coffee shop or library or <em>anywhere</em>? Are you concerned that whoever is supplying the wi-fi isn&#8217;t covering your privacy? Why not? I know that when I&#8217;m on public wi-fi, someone could easily hi-jack my passwords and make purchases on sites that I&#8217;ve logged into, so I change my working habits or where I browse when I&#8217;m not using my own secure wi-fi at home. That&#8217;s my responsibility.</p>
<p>The bright side to us moving ahead and taking control of our own privacy is that we have the opportunity to teach our kids how to be even more vigilant than we are about weighing what&#8217;s public and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<h3>How Do the New Facebook Changes Affect Facebook Marketing?</h3>
<p>The recent changes haven&#8217;t really focused on fan pages, but pages <em>are</em> affected. A few things you may have noticed about pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is no longer sharing Likes from within Facebook in the News Feed. What that means is that, if I Like a picture or status update or link on your fan page, my friends don&#8217;t see that any more. However, if Like a blog post or article on an external site (e.g., BloggingBasics101.com), then that Like *does* show up in my stream.</li>
<li>Your fan page has a new link in the left nav called Friends&#8217; Activity. If you click on that, you&#8217;ll see the people who you&#8217;re connected with (i.e., your FB friends) and how they are specifically interacting with your page.</li>
<li>The FB News Feed is no longer making fan pages a priority in the feed. They are favoring personal relationships over business relationships. That means your status updates aren&#8217;t showing up as much in the News Feed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/owcbHP"  target="_blank">Will Timeline, Ticker, GraphRank Break Facebook Marketing?</a> If you&#8217;re concerned about the changes I mentioned above, this article will help explain what your options are.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/p01OOb"  target="_blank">What Should Facebook Page Administrators Do After f8?</a> I stated privately in a few Facebook groups I&#8217;m part of that Timeline and apps associated with it will be rolled out to the masses first. Then, when people are comfortable with the layout, it will be rolled out to pages as well. The impact of Timeline on pages will be big. Businesses will be able to curate how their customers see them; highlight specific campaigns and interactions; and create new campaigns that include interactive apps, soundtracks, testimonials, images, and video. It will change the social media marketing landscape completely. This article backs me up.</p>
<h3>What Do YOU Think About the Facebook Changes?</h3>
<p>And before you answer that, please stop and think about it. Read through the information I&#8217;ve linked to. Consider where we&#8217;ve been and where we&#8217;re going. Look at the bigger picture. This isn&#8217;t just about a new interface, it&#8217;s about how we&#8217;re going to interact with each other without boundaries. It&#8217;s about how business will grow over the net ten years. If you get bogged down in the fact that your interface changed, you&#8217;re going to miss the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Let me tell you this: I am the last person who thought I&#8217;d be swayed by Mark Zuckerberg. I like Facebook a lot and I love social media, but I&#8217;ve had a healthy concern about how Facebook operates. I still do. I think about my privacy, I think about what I&#8217;m sharing and how, I think about the fact that I do not own my content at Facebook. And I think about the fact that I don&#8217;t like a lot of change in general, because I want to know how pieces fit together rather than jumping in blindly. I feel like Facebook did a fairly good job explaining how the pieces fit together. I&#8217;m excited about where we&#8217;re headed and that we&#8217;re no longer on the same, slow path &#8212; we&#8217;re about to really get social.</p>

They are important questions, too, because bloggers, especially new ones, need to be aware that just because something is on the internet doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s up for grabs and free to use. Today&#8217;s question about <strong>whether couponing blogs can legally use logos</strong> is a good one. I asked <a href="http://www.rajeanblomquist.com/blog"  target="_blank">Rajean Blomquist</a> to research and write the answer to this common conundrum. She spoke with industry expert Lucretia Pruitt, founder of <a href="http://www.TheSocialJoint.com" >Social Media Matters</a>, to get to the bottom of the issue. Please welcome Rajean as this week&#8217;s guest blogger. ~ Melanie</p>
<h3>The Question: Can I legally use company logos on my couponing blog?</h3>
<blockquote><p>Dear BB101, I started a couponing blog and I am unsure about the use of images. I don&#8217;t really understand what is legal and what isn&#8217;t (besides using my own photos). Since it&#8217;s a couponing blog I&#8217;ll be discussing many companies and products. Can I use their logos legally? It seems like all the couponing blogs do, but I am not sure they should be. What&#8217;s the answer?</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Answer: Yes, you can legally use company logos on your couponing blog.</h3>
<p>This is such a great question! Coupon sites are making it easier for consumers to save money and try new products, mostly from the comfort of their homes before ever hitting the stores &#8212; or from the convenience of their smart phones while in the stores. How brilliant is that? The fact is, we live in a multibillion-dollar coupon industry. Consumers are spending billions while also saving a ton of money. Just last year, 3.3 billion coupons were redeemed according to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.coupons.com/"  target="_blank">Coupons.com</a>.</p>
<p>When I started researching the answer to this question, it seemed appropriate to seek the knowledge of someone who counsels others about all things online, so I asked Lucretia Pruitt, Founder <a href="http://www.thesocialjoint.com/"  target="_blank">Social Media Matters</a>, for her take on this blogger&#8217;s question. She explains the reader is really asking two questions: one is about photo copyright, and the other is about trademark use.</p>
<p>Photos and images on the Internet are subject to copyright laws in the US and other countries, making them somewhat different than logos, brand names, and catchphrases that are registered as trademarks.</p>
<p>According to Pruitt, there are three main types of photos/images you find on the Internet:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Copyrighted images</strong> have either all or some rights reserved. You must have the copyright holder&#8217;s permission to use these images.</li>
<li><strong>Public domain images</strong> are those that no longer have copyright protection either because they aged out of it (max. 120 years) or for some other reason. Anyone can use these images.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Commons (CC) licensed images</strong> are copyrighted pictures that the creator has marked using a specific <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/"  target="_blank">Creative Commons license</a>. The type of license determines how you can use the image. Pruitt boils it down even further explaining that the three elements of a CC license are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>attribution</li>
<li>whether or not you can make derivatives (i.e., change or modify the image), and</li>
<li>whether or not you can use the image for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a minimum, you have to attribute the creator (i.e., Photo by Bob Smith) and include a link. You&#8217;ll notice this article has an image at the top of the article. That image was found via the <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/wordpress-plugin/"  target="_blank">PhotoDropper plug-in for WordPress</a>. That plug-in takes keywords you type in, then searches Flickr for Creative Commons images that match. You can then insert the image into your post and the plug-in creates an auto-attribute (you&#8217;ll see the one for the copyright image down at the bottom of this article &#8212; it looks like this: <small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" title="Attribution License"  target="_blank"><img src="http://www.bloggingbasics101.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/"  target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40936156@N00/2869453426/" title="gabrieldeurioste"  target="_blank">gabrieldeurioste</a></small>).</p>
<p>Pruitt notes, &#8220;If you are making money off of [your blog], you will also need to have the work approved for commercial use.&#8221; This is important to bloggers because<strong> a hobby blogger can use a Creative Commons image that has non-commercial conditions, but bloggers who make money from their blogs cannot.</strong></p>
<p>Sites like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://flickr.com/"  target="_blank">Flickr.com</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi"  target="_blank">Google&#8217;s image search</a> have options to search for Creative Commons licensed &amp; public domain images. Just make sure that you go to the &#8220;advanced&#8221; search options.</p>
<p>Now back to logos and trademarks. Wikipedia gives a succinct <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use_(U.S._trademark_law)"  target="_blank">definition of a trademark</a>: &#8220;A trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image or a combination of these elements.&#8221; Any company (large or small) investing time and money into trademarking their logo will be protective of how their logos are used. <strong>As a blogger, when you&#8217;re writing about a brand, you will be using their name and other trademarks like their logo under the &#8220;Fair Use&#8221; doctrine.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, Pruitt says fair use of a logo or other trademark (not to be confused with copyright) may be asserted on two grounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of your own product, or</li>
<li>You are using the mark to identify the actual mark owner.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s the second one that really applies here. &#8220;If you are using say, the logo for &#8216;Campbell&#8217;s ® Chunky ™ Soup&#8217; you&#8217;d probably be using it to refer to their actual soup. So what you are doing is covered under Fair Use of a Trademark,&#8221; according to Pruitt.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll note the phrase in quotations above has an ® and a ™ in it. Yes, those two words are trademarks of that company. So when you write about that brand, you should make sure to do it the way that it&#8217;s written above. If you&#8217;re not sure, it&#8217;s better to err on the side of caution and go check the brand&#8217;s website. That&#8217;s probably where you are getting the logo from in the first place, so it&#8217;s just a quick check to see how they refer to the product or brand name.</p>
<p>Trademark and logo use violations are unintentional in most cases. But you don&#8217;t want to invite legal action by blatant misuse of a logo or image. A majority of deal or coupon websites seek permission to use a company logo as part of the deal contract.</p>
<p>Any time you are not sure about using a company&#8217;s logo or image, ask or consider that perhaps you don&#8217;t really need the logo anyway. You can promote a discount or coupon offered by simply using the company name.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <a href="http://about.me/lucretia"  target="_blank">Lucretia</a> and I are not lawyers, but this is our understanding of how it all works. If you need specific legal advice, you should contact an attorney. Better to protect you now than defend you later &#8212; or all that money you save using coupons and taking advantage of daily deals could be spent on legal fees.</p>

<blockquote><em>Please welcome today&#8217;s guest blogger, Melissa from <a href="http://www.momcomm.com"  target="_blank">Momcomm</a> as she shares tips on critiquing your own blog. I&#8217;ve gotten to know Melissa over the past year or so because of  Facebook group we belong to. She is a wealth of marketing information and she rocks socks at making blogs better. Today she&#8217;s sharing some tips from her new e-book <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=135308&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=95792"  target="ejejcsingle">DIY Blog Critique</a>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you love when people tell you how awesome your blog is. But deep down, you&#8217;re probably itching to be bigger and better&#8230; to sell more products, to work with more companies in social media or maybe to just make people laugh harder.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been editing and reviewing websites and marketing materials for over a decade now. So when I launched my blog <a href="http://www.momcomm.com"  target="_blank">Momcomm</a>, it seemed like a natural fit to start critiquing blogs each week using that past experience. After a crazy-long queue of bloggers wanting critiques, I knew I could do more to help. So, I created the <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=135308&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=95792"  target="ejejcsingle">DIY Blog Critique</a> so that bloggers could tackle improving their blogs with a virtual &#8220;fresh set of eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>While my eBook covers 43 points in detail, here are five ways to critique your blog right this instant (hooray for instant gratification!):</p>
<h3>1. What&#8217;s your blog about?</h3>
<p>I love how Darren from <a href="http://problogger.net" >Problogger</a> puts it: &#8220;If you’re fuzzy on what your blog is about it’s unlikely that anyone else will have much of an idea either.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what IS your blog about? Can you sum it up in a sentence? Defining precisely what your blog is about will not only benefit your readers, it&#8217;ll benefit you too. When you can sum this up, your goals, content, design (okay, EVERYTHING) will become that much clearer.</p>
<p>If you worry that you don&#8217;t have a niche, then think of it this way: Are you blogging to inspire? Educate? Inform? Entertain? Don&#8217;t be afraid to define your blog that way either.</p>
<h3>2. Do your colors match what your blog is about?</h3>
<p>Colors visually set the tone for your blog. Overpowering colors may scare people away while sparse color may bore them to death.</p>
<p>Choose colors that compliment what your blog is about. For example, if you write a humor blog then subdued colors aren&#8217;t really the way to go. Learn what colors mean (like red can indicate strength) and build a palette that reinforces your message.</p>
<h3>3. Are your social media profile buttons easy to find?</h3>
<p>Do you have a Twitter account, Facebook page, LinkedIn profile or other important social media profile? Well, make sure your readers know it!</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t enough just to have a widget of your latest tweets or a box showing off your Facebook fans. Use social media icons that link to each account and put them at the top of your sidebar or in your header. Make sure they&#8217;re all in the same place as well instead of scattered throughout your sidebars.</p>
<p>If you want to put them in your footer, then that&#8217;s great as it reminds people who may have scrolled through all your awesome posts that they should follow you. BUT they should still be at the top too.</p>
<h3>4. Is your About page doing its job?</h3>
<p>Your About page should be a reflection of three things: you, your expertise and your blog. As you write (or re-write) your page, tell your readers a bit about who you are.</p>
<p>Then give them a bit about why you know your stuff. Even for a lifestyle blog, this is important. For example, if you write about food but aren&#8217;t a chef, then maybe you grew up in the kitchen. Or you started creating your own recipes because you&#8217;re on a limited diet. Whatever it is, that&#8217;s your expertise.</p>
<p>Finally, tell your readers what your blog is about. Limit the use of &#8220;I&#8221; in this section; it should focus on what the reader will get out of reading your blog (tips, laughs, recipes, fun stories, etc).</p>
<p>While it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be in this order, these are the magical elements to a stellar About page.</p>
<h3>5. Do you write compelling content?</h3>
<p>What does compelling mean? To me, it means your content causes people to take action in some way: comment on your post, share your post with others, buy your product, donate to your cause, etc.</p>
<p>Writing great content that drives action may come naturally for some but not for most of us. But there are a few things you can ask yourself before you hit &#8220;publish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does your content flow or do you randomly bounce around from one idea to another? Do you use photos in your posts? Can readers relate to the topic you&#8217;re writing about or can you spin it in a more interesting way? For example, a post running through what you did each day on your vacation may not be as interesting as a post about one particularly funny or sweet story from your trip.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft" src="http://bloggingbasics101.com/images/melhomepage.png" alt="" width="187" height="187" />Hello, awesome!</h3>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have loved idea of social networking since I first started building websites from code I created in Notepad. As websites evolved into blogs and blogs evolved into networking sites like Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr, and of course Facebook, I embraced each iteration as an opportunity to learn and grow my skill set. I love social media so much that I practice it, read about it, and play with it even when I don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard social media called a fad in quite some time. Most businesses acknowledge the importance of social media as a key component to their marketing strategy. Most individuals use at least one social network to keep up with friends or family. Social media and the networks that make them up are fully integrated in our every day lives. We can use them as a tool or as a timesuck (both are equally important in my opinion). (And yet, my mother refuses to use her computer unless she&#8217;s watching Netflix or sending an e-mail, but that&#8217;s another story.)</p>
<p>The following infographic shares fascinating statistics about the growth of social networks worldwide. Some of the more interesting information for me included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Facebook were a country, it would be twice the size of the United States and it would be the third largest country in the world.</li>
<li>Social media may have an impact on whether you&#8217;re hired or not.</li>
<li>Facebook users share <strong>seven billion </strong>pieces of content every month.</li>
<li>Although most people refer to the main social networks as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, they aren&#8217;t ranked as high as you&#8217;d think. Facebook rules them all, yes, but Twitter is fifth and LinkedIn is ninth. Are you signed up with Orkut? Apparently it&#8217;s big in Brazil and India.</li>
</ul>

<p>Running a Facebook contest or giveaway is a great way to promote your Facebook business page and possibly garner more Likes for your page. However, I&#8217;ve seen enough businesses and bloggers running Facebook promotions incorrectly, that I thought it may be time to discuss how to run one the right way. What I&#8217;ve found is that many times, these businesses and bloggers don&#8217;t know that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/promotions_guidelines.php" >Facebook has specific guidelines regarding how you can (and can&#8217;t) administer giveaways and contests</a>.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Facebook Promotions Guidelines</h3>
<p>For the most part, the guidelines are pretty self-explanatory, but there are a few parts that can be confusing. The result is that even if you think you understand the guidelines, you may not. To help clarify the guidelines and ensure your Facebook promotions are on the up-and-up, I&#8217;m going to go through the rules line by line and explain what you need to know. If you&#8217;d like to bookmark the <a href="http://fb.com/promotions_guidelines.php" >Facebook Promotions Guidelines</a>, you can do so at <a href="http://fb.com/promotions_guidelines.php" >http://fb.com/promotions_guidelines.php</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Promotions on Facebook must be administered within Apps on Facebook.com, either on a Canvas Page or an app on a Page Tab.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> You can&#8217;t run a giveaway or contest on your Wall. You must use a third-party application to build and administer your promotion. Not sure where to start? Check out <a href="http://shortstack.com" >Shortstack</a> or <a href="http://wildfireapp.com/" >Wildfire</a>. Or, if you&#8217;re comfortable with iFrames, you can build your own app.</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Promotions on Facebook must include the following:<br />
a. A complete release of Facebook by each entrant or participant.<br />
b. Acknowledgment that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Facebook.<br />
c. Disclosure that the participant is providing information to [<em>disclose recipient(s) of information</em>] and not to Facebook.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> Facebook wants it to be clear to you and your entrants that they are in no way part of your promotion. If you use Shortstack to create your promotion, they have some nice verbiage you can include in your giveaway that adheres to this rule.</p>
<blockquote><p>3. You must not use Facebook features or functionality as a promotion’s registration or entry mechanism.  For example, the act of liking a Page or checking in to a Place cannot automatically register or enter a promotion participant.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> Just because someone Likes your page or uses Facebook Places to check in to your venue, doesn&#8217;t mean that you can use their information automatically. You must use the third-party application to provide an entry form. This ensures that the entrant actually <em>wants</em> to enter your promotion. It also means <strong>you cannot ask people to Like your page, comment on your Wall, write a status update, or check-in to a Place as an entry to your promotion.</strong> These can&#8217;t be primary <em>or</em> additional entries. I&#8217;ve had some people ask if it&#8217;s OK to host a giveaway on their blog and ask people to Like a Facebook page as an additional entry. The logic is that if the giveaway isn&#8217;t hosted on Facebook, they should be able to do as they please. Unfortunately, the minute you bring Facebook into the equation, Facebook&#8217;s rules apply. It may not be the popular answer, but that&#8217;s the answer.</p>
<blockquote><p>4. You must not condition registration or entry upon the user taking any action using any Facebook features or functionality other than liking a Page, checking in to a Place, or connecting to your app.  For example, you must not condition registration or entry upon the user liking a Wall post, or commenting or uploading a photo on a Wall.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> This is where some people get confused. This rule is referring to the act of <em>Like-gating content</em>. When you create a custom Facebook tab, it&#8217;s possible to &#8220;hide&#8221; specific content from non-fans until they click Like. Upon clicking Like, the new fan can then access the hidden content. For promotions, this means that you can hide your entry form until a user clicks Like. After they click Like, they can then complete the entry form to be part of the promotion. It&#8217;s important to note that the initial Like of the page did not enter them into your promotion. They only entered the promotion when they completed your form. <strong>Rule #4 is stating that this Like-gating of your promotional content is completely acceptable as long as you don&#8217;t make the Like an entry.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>5. You must not use Facebook features or functionality, such as the Like button, as a voting mechanism for a promotion.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> If you want to invite people to post images or video or ideas, then have people vote on them, you have to do it via a third-party app (see rule #1). You can&#8217;t ask people to Like a comment or status update in order to win a promotion or help decide who will win a promotion. Many of the third-party apps have options for voting promotions and they are fairly easy to implement.</p>
<blockquote><p>6. You must not notify winners through Facebook, such as through Facebook messages, chat, or posts on profiles or Pages.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> You must notify your winners via private e-mail (not Facebook messsaging) or via your blog or Twitter or however you want, so long as it&#8217;s not on Facebook.</p>
<blockquote><p>7. You may not use Facebook’s name, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, or any other intellectual property in connection with a promotion or mention Facebook in the rules or materials relating to the promotion, except as needed to fulfill your obligations under Section 2.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> Make it clear that this is your promotion and yours alone. Don&#8217;t imply that Facebook has anything whatsoever to do with your promotion.</p>
<blockquote><p>8. Definitions:<br />
a. <a name="admin"></a>By “administration” we mean the operation of any element of the promotion, such as collecting entries, conducting a drawing, judging entries, or notifying winners.<br />
b. <a name="communication"></a>By “communication” we mean promoting, advertising or referencing a promotion in any way on Facebook, e.g., in ads, on a Page, or in a Wall post.<br />
c. <a name="contest"></a>By “contest” or “competition” we mean a promotion that includes a prize of monetary value and a winner determined on the basis of skill (i.e., through judging based on specific criteria).<br />
d. <a name="sweeps"></a>By “sweepstakes” we mean a promotion that includes a prize of monetary value and a winner selected on the basis of chance.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> These definitions are self-explanatory, but it&#8217;s important to note them. The first, <em>administration</em>, is particularly important. See how it refers to &#8220;collecting entries&#8221;? When you host a giveaway on your blog and ask people to Like your Facebook giveaway as an additional entry, you&#8217;re essentially collecting entries via Facebook and you can&#8217;t do that unless you&#8217;re using a third-party app on Facebook.</p>
<h3>What Happens If I Don&#8217;t Follow the Facebook Promotions Guidelines?</h3>
<p>So what happens if you don&#8217;t follow the rules? <strong>You could lose your page.</strong> Think about that. You lose your content (images, video, notes, status updates&#8230;<em>everything</em>), your community (how many fans do you have? Are you willing to rebuild that?), and your credibility (trust is what social media is built on). It doesn&#8217;t make sense to risk losing your hard-earned Facebook community when it&#8217;s so easy to create a promotion that adheres to the <a href="http://fb.com/promotions_guidelines.php" >Facebook Promotions Guidelines</a>. If you do lose your page, you can head over to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=page_disabled"  target="_blank">My Facebook Page was Disabled</a> and complete that form to try to reinstate your page.</p>
<h3>Update with Information Directly from Facebook</h3>
<p>As you can see from the comments to this post, there is still some debate about whether I&#8217;m interpreting the Facebook Promotions Guidelines correctly. I decided to contact Facebook directly and see if they could help clarify the guidelines. I wrote in part:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve written a post outlining my own interpretation of the guidelines (http://www.bloggingbasics101.com/2011/07/running-a-successful-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/). In a nutshell, my understanding is that <strong>you cannot ask people to Like a fan page as an entry into a promotion &#8212; not as a main entry, nor as an extra entry.</strong> I understand, though, that <strong>you can Like-gate</strong> your entry form on Facebook via a third-party app (<strong>but that Like isn&#8217;t an entry</strong>, it&#8217;s a means to get to the entry form).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m receiving questions from those who suggest that a blog or blog application like rafflecopter (http://www.rafflecopter.com/) are basically third-party apps and, because they are asking for Likes via those options (blog or rafflecopter), the Likes are legitimate entries. That&#8217;s not how I read the guidelines, but I&#8217;d like to be sure rather than give inaccurate advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I received a reply from Trace Przybylowicz, an account manager at Facebook, that said simply:<br />
&#8220;Hi Melanie &#8211; You are correct….&#8221;</p>
<p>There you go. Confirmation from Facebook that this article is interpreting the Facebook Promotions Guidelines correctly. I appreciate the lively discussion and questions. And I appreciate that Facebook was able to respond to my query since I know their entire team must be incredibly busy.</p>

<p><a href="http://on.fb.me/oSwJ7c"  target="_blank">Win a copy of iPad All-In-One for Dummies</a> by Nancy Muir from Blogging Basics 101 on Facebook!</p>
<p>One of the things my friends and I have discussed before buying our iPads was whether we could justify the purchase and hit the ground running with our productivity. With this full-color book you&#8217;ll be able to get up and running with your iPad in not time and use it as efficiently as possible. Even if you are pretty familiar with your iPad, I think you&#8217;ll likely find some tips and advice in this book.</p>
<p>The All-In-One books are about twice as large as a regular Dummies book and are like having six to eight resource books at your fingertips instead of just one. This particular book includes</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad Basics</li>
<li>Just for Fun</li>
<li>iPad on the Go</li>
<li>Getting Productive with iWork</li>
<li>Using iPad to Get Organized</li>
<li>Must-Have iPad Aps</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m trying out something different with this giveaway. I&#8217;m not holding here, I&#8217;m holding it at the <a href="http://on.fb.me/oSwJ7c"  target="_blank">Blogging Basics 101 Facebook page</a>. If you&#8217;re already a fan, you&#8217;ll go right to the entry form. If you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;ll be asked to Like the page before you can complete the entry form. To be clear, though, the Like is not an entry and you aren&#8217;t automatically entered if you already Like the Blogging Basics 101 Facebook page. So head over to Blogging Basics 101 on Facebook and enter <a href="http://on.fb.me/oSwJ7c"  target="_blank">win a copy of iPad All-In-One for Dummies</a>! Good luck!</p>
<p><em>I didn&#8217;t buy this book. Wiley Publishing accidentally sent me two copies of several books for another project I&#8217;m working on. Rather than send them back, they agreed to let me give them away to you.</em></p>

That means my posting here has been sparse. So when my friend Ang England asked if she could write a guest post to help promote her new ebook </em><a href="http://30dayebook.com/about-30-days-ebook/?ap_id=BB101"  target="_blank">30 Days to Make and Sell a Fabulous Ebook</a><em>, I was more than happy to oblige. I know you&#8217;ll love her tips and her ebook! </em></p>
<p>As the mother of four little ones, with one on the way, I am a huge fan of working smarter, not harder. One of the<a href="http://www.angengland.com/why-you-should-write-an-ebook-is-it-worth-the-time/"  target="_blank"> benefits of writing an ebook</a> is the ability to create an additional product from work and research you&#8217;ve already used elsewhere. I love re-purposing high-quality content and presenting it in more than one format. With that in mind, I want to give you some tips for planning blog posts with the goal of eventually creating an ebook.</p>
<h3>Brainstorm Article and Post Series</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of the brainstorming process. When I first began writing web content for a particular content site I took a 50 cent poster board from Wal-Mart and filled it with idea after idea after idea. Two years and three ebooks later, that brainstorm session was actually covering the mortgage payment when I took maternity leave with my third child.</p>
<p>Planning articles in series around a particular topic meant that when I wanted to write an ebook, I could tell what series my readers were responding to and help predict which specific topic would sell well. It also meant that I had a huge head start on research and writing when it came time to put the book together.</p>
<h3>Editorial Calendar</h3>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.angengland.com/how-to-use-editorial-calendars-effectively-in-blogging/"  target="_blank">having an editorial calendar</a> in place &#8211; even if just in general terms &#8211; so that I know where I&#8217;m heading with my writing goals. When I want to write about a particular topic, adding it to my calendar greatly increases the chances of that project actually coming to fruition! Otherwise, I&#8217;m too easily sidetracked by the immediate needs of my sites and jobs and family and&#8230;.you get the idea. You&#8217;re probably in the same boat. An editorial calendar can help.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Posts in Advance</h3>
<p><a href="ttp://30dayebook.com/about-30-days-ebook/?ap_id=BB101" ><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2405" title="30 days to make and sell ebook cover" src="http://www.angengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/30-days-to-make-and-sell-ebook-cover1-231x300.jpg" alt="30 days to make and sell ebook cover" width="231" height="300" /></a>When I launch a new ebook, I like to write a few posts on a related topic. Then you can schedule them out in advance and create a sustained buzz over your ebook. Alternatively, you can work on producing your ebook while your posts are still being posted to your blog. When I was working on the Making Money Blogging ebook, I had pre-written several blog posts in one day so that I could take awhile to put the book together and work on marketing it without abandoning my audience.</p>

<p>There  is nothing like losing your sense of security. Feeling violated and  vulnerable are two horrible feelings, but that’s exactly how you will  feel if you find your blog has been hacked! Often your site can be  hacked for quite a while before you even notice that something is amiss.  This article aims to give you advice and tips to recognize when you’ve  hacked and how to make your blog unattractive to would-be hackers.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How do I know if my blog or website has been hacked?</h3>
<p>Although  it’s usually obvious when a blog or website is hacked, there are times  when you may suspect you’ve been hacked but just aren’t sure. Here are a  few of the warning signs you’ve been hacked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Google Page Rank starts to drop for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>Your blog loads more and more slowly (and you haven’t added a ton of plugins).</li>
<li>You notice strange links on your website.</li>
<li>Your Google webmaster tools show strange keywords to describe your site.</li>
<li>You  perform a Google search for your site, the results show titles and  descriptions that do NOT describe your site, yet still have your URLs.</li>
<li>Your website or blog traffic starts decreasing for no logical reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren’t sure your site has been hacked (or just want to be sure), do a Google search for a spammy keyword like this keyword:yoursite.com. Try different spam keywords to make sure your site is clear.</p>
<p>If you have been hacked, contact a professional who specializes in WordPress<a href="http://www.tech4mommies.com/"  target="_blank"> blog help</a> to help you remove the infection and secure your site.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why do hackers attack a website or blog?</h3>
<p>One  reason hackers attack your website or blog is because they want to  hijack your Google ranking in order to promote (and increase) their own  Google ranking. And as you can imagine, there are many different types  of hacks. One of the most popular hacks is a Pharma hack where the  hackers insert spam content into your site that is related to different  types of medications. Other hacks are more obvious because they use  adult content and software sales.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How do hackers attack a website or blog?</h3>
<p>Usually,  a hacker will try to hack one of your passwords first (e.g., your  WordPress admin password, your database password, or your FTP password).  Once the hackers have one of your passwords, they can gain access to  the rest of your sites depending on which password they have discovered.  They can also exploit a vulnerability within a plug-in or the WordPress  installation itself. However, WordPress is pretty good about  discovering vulnerabilities and locking them down quickly.</p>
<p>Once  hackers have access to your site, they will either place new scripts in  your website to run their malware, inject malicious code straight into  your database, or change the files you currently have (which can make  cleanup a real pain sometimes!). Hackers may also insert spam into any  portion of your website, such as within your footer or in the META  information on your site. They also can create an administrator  WordPress account that will not appear in your admin page.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Best Practices for a Secure WordPress.org Blog Site</h3>
<p>You  can take specific steps to help ensure that your site isn’t infected  with malware or hacked in some other way. Heed the advice in the list  below for starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your administrator WordPress login, your database password, and your FTP password are all different and complicated.  Passwords that are 20 characters long with a variation of numerals,  upper and lower case, and special characters are your best bet.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guvwVIGqACw"  target="_blank">Delete the admin account in WordPress</a> and create an administrator login with a unique name (not the name of your blog or your name). Be  aware that you may run into a few snags. The gals at 5 Minutes for Mom  explain how they found out about (and fixed!) some issues that arose  when they <a href="http://www.5minutesformom.com/40097/wordpress-bug-deleting-admin-account/"  target="_blank">deleted a WordPress admin account</a>.</li>
<li>Always keep your WordPress installation and plug-ins updated. When you see a notification on your WordPress dashboard that an update is available for any plug-in(s), update immediately.</li>
<li>Restrict access from other locations to your wp-admin folder. You can do this by entering your home’s IP address in your .htaccess file within the wp-admin folder. For <a href="http://www.tech4mommies.com/" >computer help</a> on setting this up you can contact Sarah via her Twitter handle @Tech4Moms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hackers  continue to find ways around security measures. If you follow the tips  in this article, you may make your site less appealing to an attack.</p>
