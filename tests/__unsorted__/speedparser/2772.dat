<blockquote><p>TeleGeography’s free interactive submarine cable map is based on our authoritative Global Bandwidth research, and depicts 188 active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations. Selecting a cable route on the map provides access to data about the cable, including the cable’s name, ready-for-service (RFS) date, length, owners, website, and landing points. Selecting a landing point provides a list of all submarine cables landing at that station.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just imagining cables that stretch that far seems pretty amazing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of words to describe visualization and visualization-related things. It can be confusing. You just came across this thing with data and stuff, but what do you call it? Here I define what all those words mean. Keep in mind, I'm not so, uh, good with words and, uh, stuff, so yeah.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is how I perceive the words. They are not official dictionary or academic definitions. Don't use these in your next report or paper, unless you want to be laughed at.</p>
<p><strong>data visualization</strong> &mdash; Graph-like image or interactive, usually tied with data exploration and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>visualization</strong> &mdash; Similar to data visualization and often is, but can also be the later described information visualization.</p>
<p><strong>viz</strong> &mdash; A shorter version of visualization in both length of word and thoughtfulness in design and data.</p>
<p><strong>vizzes</strong> &mdash; Plural of viz and evokes an image of urinals.</p>
<p><strong>information visualization</strong> &mdash; Usually encapsulates what data visualization is about, but usually makes an effort to provide "actionable insights."</p>
<p><strong>InfoVis</strong> &mdash; An annual conference that most visualization researchers go to.</p>
<p><strong>infovis</strong> &mdash; Research of information visualization that people talk about at InfoVis</p>
<p><strong>infoviz</strong> &mdash; Often a crappier version of infovis and closer to what will follow shortly. However, it could just be an indicator of the person using the word, and the work might be good.</p>
<p><strong>information graphic</strong> &mdash; Serious work from journalist-type folks who provide a narrative with data.</p>
<p><strong>infographic</strong> &mdash; A toss-up between information graphic and [INFOGRAPHIC], but usually the latter and often unnecessarily big.</p>
<p><strong>[INFOGRAPHIC]</strong> &mdash; A gigantic graphic with lots of graphs, numbers, icons, and fancy-ish typefaces. Often used in blog post title. Always useless.</p>
<p><strong>infograph</strong> &mdash; No idea who started using this term, but it's dumb. Stop it. </p>
<p><strong>chart</strong> &mdash; Typically looks very statistical and close to a table.</p>
<p><strong>data chart</strong> &mdash; Even closer to a table of numbers. And kind of redundant.</p>
<p><strong>graph</strong> &mdash; It's like a chart, but it sounds more visual, because it's the root of "graphic."</p>
<p><strong>data graphic</strong> &mdash; It's an ambiguous term I like to use that doesn't upset people who like to argue what visualization is and what it's for, but clear enough that most people know what it is. Also implies that data comes first and is the driving force behind the graphic.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, this is about better information, tools, algorithms—but that’s not all. It’s about the deeply human quest to make the world more livable, safer, more efficient, more sustainable.</p>
<p>Over the past century, the women and men of IBM have played a part in this unfolding story of progress. Today, we feel more confident than ever in people’s capacity to see the world with greater clarity… to map what we see… to understand its dynamics. All of which builds shared belief… in a better future, and in the way each of us can act to make it so.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's open to the public through October 23. Here's a preview of what's there:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/09/28/the-fortune-500-1955-to-2010/"><img width="625" height="421" src="http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-Fortune-500-Profits-625x421.png" class="attachment-medium wp-post-image" alt="The Fortune 500 Profits" title="The Fortune 500 Profits" /></a></p><p>Since 1955, Fortune Magazine has published a list of America's 500 largest companies. What companies have risen to the top? Which ones have fallen? Ben Fry, of Fathom Information Design, <a href="http://fathom.info/fortune500/">visualizes the companies</a> of past and present and how their rankings, revenue, and profit have changed.</p>
<p>The interactive piece lets you select companies, which highlights an individual time series as well as provides a sense of distribution over time with the light gray marks. As you switch between measures and turn inflation adjustment on and off, smooth transitions let you keep track of what you're interested in. </p>
<p>Because this is more of a proof of concept that Fry sketched during a train ride, there are a few kinks. For example, it's hard to see the individual values for a single company, because the dots are too small for the time series. You just end up selecting another company. You're supposed to be able to press the left and right arrow keys to move back and forth, but it doesn't work for me. It's easy to see though how, with a bit more development, this could be useful for other data and how a bunch of numbers can be made easily digestible.</p>

People created pages and pages of blinking icons, brightly colored background, and everyone loved it. There was even MIDI music to set the mood. In 2009, Geocities was deleted, but the memories lived on thanks to the <a href="http://archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>. Information designer <a href="http://www.richardvijgen.nl/">Richard Vijgen</a> visualized these pages in an interactive piece called <a href="http://deletedcity.net/">The Deleted City</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Around the turn of the century, Geocities had tens of millions of "homesteaders" as the digital tennants were called and was bought by Yahoo! for three and a half billion dollars. Ten years later in 2009, as other metaphors of the internet (such as the social network) had taken over, and the homesteaders had left their properties vacant after migrating to Facebook, Geocities was shutdown and deleted. In an heroic effort to preserve 10 years of collaborative work by 35 million people, the Archive Team made a backup of the site just before it shut down. The resulting 650 Gigabyte bittorrent file is the digital Pompeii that is the subject of an interactive excavation that allows you to wander through an episode of recent online history.</p></blockquote>
<p>See it in action below:</p>

<p>Too bad you can't interact with it online. Maybe I'd be able to dig up my old site from freshman of year of college, complete with lots of HTML frames and tables.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I had the pleasure of <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/08/14/visiting-census/">spending</a> a week at the Census Bureau as a "visiting scholar." They're looking to boost their visualization efforts across all departments, and I put in my two cents on how to go about doing it. For being a place where there is so much data, the visual side of things is still in the early stages, generally speaking.</p>
<p>During all the meetings, there were recurring themes about what visualization is and what it is used for. Some people really got it, but others were new to the subject, and we ran into a few misconceptions that I think are worth repeating.</p>
<p>Here we go, in no particular order.</p>
<h3>Visualization is for making data flashy</h3>
<p>This is probably the most common one. It's easy to look at a lot of the best visualization projects and want your data to look and feel the same way. So people ask, "I have such and such data. Is there a visualization technique that I can use to make it look cooler?"</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Not if you only have five data points though. You can spend a lot of time with icons or fancy print, but the graphics are interesting because the data that the visuals represent is interesting.</p>
<p>For example, I mapped the <a href="http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/">growth of Walmart</a> a while back (It's amazing how much mileage I get out of this graphic.), and people seem to like it because of the organic growth pattern. It starts in one area and spreads outwards like a virus. </p>
<p>Okay, compared to Toby Segaran's <a href="http://blog.kiwitobes.com/?p=51">original</a>, I did add some interactive flourishes, but even without, the growth pattern is what makes the animation interesting.  </p>
<p>For example, here's <a href="http://projects.flowingdata.com/target/">a map</a> with the same style as my Walmart one, but it shows the spread of Target. It's not nearly as fun to watch, because Target took a more opportunistic approach of expansion. Locations pop up kind of randomly at times. It's mostly interesting as a contrast to the Walmart map.</p>
<p>It should always be data first. Certain graphics get eyeballs because they show something that wouldn't be seen in a table.</p>
<h3>Software does everything</h3>
<p>There are <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2008/10/20/40-essential-tools-and-resources-to-visualize-data/">a lot of options</a> for visualization, and the "best" one will change depending on who you ask. </p>
<p>Personally, I use a lot of R and have a lot of fun in Illustrator. More recently, I've been <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/09/20/how-do-americans-spend-their-days/" title="How do Americans spend their days?">working</a> <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/12/01/finding-global-agenda-councils-who-should-work-together/" title="Finding Global Agenda Councils who should work together">with</a> <a href="http://projects.flowingdata.com/health/" title="Health Disparities and Priority Populations">JavaScript</a>. Flexibility is a huge plus for me, and I like to have full control over how my graphics look and how the interactive ones work. Most of what I do though is to present data to a wider audience. If I were an analyst tasked with digging through a large dataset, I might take a different route before I make something custom.</p>
<p>My main point is that there is no one piece of software that will do everything for you.</p>
<p>Some software is good for analysis, some is good for specific types of analysis, and some is good for storytelling. </p>
<h3>The more information in a single graphic, the better</h3>
<p>A misstep a lot of people take when they're trying to advance "beyond Excel" is to layer too much information on top of their basic graphic. I'm all for providing context and highlighting interesting spots in your data, but at some point it's better to split your one chart into two or three charts.</p>
<p>Some people try to be clever by using multiple axes on a single plot or multiple visual cues in a single chart to save space. Again, this works sometimes. A lot of the time it doesn't. Oftentimes, simple and clear is better than clever and compact.</p>
<p>My favorite test is to show a graphic to someone who doesn't know the data and isn't a visualization expert and see what they take away from the visual.</p>
<h3>Visualization is too biased to be useful</h3>
<p>There's a certain amount of subjectivity that goes into any visualization as you choose what data to show and how to show it. By focusing on one part of the data, you might inadvertently obscure another. However, if you're careful, get to know the data that you're dealing with, and stay true to what's there, then it should be easier to overcome bias.</p>
<p>After all, statistics is somewhat subjective, too. You choose what you analyze, what methods to use, and pick what to point out in reports.</p>
<p>News organizations, for example, have to do this all the time. They get a dataset, decide what story they want to tell (or find what story the data has to tell). Browse through graphics by <em>The New York Times</em>, and you can see how you can add a layer of information that objectively describes what the data is about. </p>
<h3>It has to be exact</h3>
<p>If you're using visualization to show the exact value of every single data point, along with every standard error, you're probably using it wrong. Accuracy is important. Yes. But visualization is less about the individual values and more about the distribution of them over time and space. You're looking for (or showing) patterns. You're comparing and contrasting. </p>
<p>If all you care about are individual data points, you might as well put it in a table.</p>
<p>Are there other common misconceptions that you can think of?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/09/22/rectangular-subdivisions-of-the-world/"><img width="625" height="312" src="http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Binary-subdivision-by-Eric-Fischer-625x312.png" class="attachment-medium wp-post-image" alt="Binary subdivision by Eric Fischer" title="Binary subdivision by Eric Fischer" /></a></p><p>Eric Fischer, who continues his string of mapping fun and doesn't even do it for his day job, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/6159680639/in/photostream/">maps the world in binary subdivisions</a>. Each bounding box contains an equal number of geotagged tweets. </p>
<p>The best part is that Fischer is actually doing some problem-solving, trying to figure something out, so it's not just a pretty picture.</p>
<blockquote><p>The actual motivation behind it, by the way, was to figure out an approximately optimal set of bounding boxes to query for in APIs like Picasa's, where if you ask for the whole world, you only get a few, very recent, results, but if you query for small enough bounding boxes, you can see further back in time. The idea is to choose bounding boxes with equal frequency so you get approximately the same time period of results from each of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's the image zoomed in on the United States. As you'd expect, the concentration of boxes looks a lot like population density:</p>

<p>As does the view of Europe:</p>
