			<description>&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu-mpwedding-001.jpg" border="0" alt="Draping A Sari | ©2011 Seshu Photography" name="Draping A Sari | ©2011 Seshu Photography"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I work with a lot of South Asian clients - Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi. The wedding day is a busy one for most couples, but I think you will agree it is especially so for brides and bridesmaids when they have to get ready for the wedding ceremony and then reception. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;They have to do their hair. They have to do their makeup. Then they have to wear a lehenga or a traditional wedding sari. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This may very well be the first time that they are wearing an outfit that is part of their culture. And it isn't easy to drape the fabric around yourself in a way that is elegant or aesthetically pleasing. Yeah, the guys do have it easy, don't they?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Most brides and bridesmaids opt for a professional to do their hair and makeup but I haven't heard of a professional lehenga or sari draper. Usually the bride's aunt or mother steps in and helps out as they do have years of practice. As a &lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net"&gt;documentary wedding photographer&lt;/a&gt;, I love the interaction and the emotion between the bride and her mother, aunt, sister or even another bridesmaid. Visually, all of this makes for interesting images, but I can tell (yes, even as a guy) that it is a huge time suck and both brides and bridesmaids would rather be done with it quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu-mpwedding-002.jpg" border="0" alt="Creating Pleats For A Wedding Sari | ©2011 Seshu Photography" name="Creating Pleats For A Wedding Sari | ©2011 Seshu Photography"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://sarisaheli.com/"&gt;Sari Saheli&lt;/a&gt;'s Pleatmaker and thought the concept was pretty neat. Suniti Jain, who came up with &lt;a href="http://sarisaheli.com/"&gt;The Pleatmaker&lt;/a&gt;, says that one can "tie a flawless sari in 5 minutes by yourself."  With that kind of a guarantee, I am sure it's music to some ears. Be sure to &lt;a href="http://sarisaheli.com/demos"&gt;check out the videos&lt;/a&gt; on their site to see how other women use The Pleatmaker to tie their saris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/pleatmaker-sarisaheli-001.jpg" border="0" alt="The Pleatmaker By SariSaheli.com " name="The Pleatmaker By SariSaheli.com "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are planning your wedding or you are part of a bridal party that's going to be wearing a lehenga/dupatta or a traditional wedding sari, give The Pleatmaker by Sari Saheli a try. Suniti has set up a special &lt;a href="http://sarisaheli.com/buying_options"&gt;15% discount&lt;/a&gt; when you mention "SESHU" on checkout. Please note that I don't make a dime off of this. 
&lt;br&gt;

			<title>My Kind Of South Indian Wedding</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.seshu.net/blog.cfm/postID/209/My-Kind-Of-South-Indian-Wedding</guid>

			<description>I don't know the couple. But when photographer &lt;a href="http://www.anrbstudios.net"&gt;Amar Ramesh&lt;/a&gt; posted a link to this cross-cultural wedding experience on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/picseshu"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, I had to watch and share it here. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="700" height="428" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/36D27Sj6xGE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I assume the couple is French, only by the rolling credits at the end of the 12 minute video clip. Compared to the weddings that take place most of the time, it is a very modest celebration, yet it is filled with so much joy. What that highlights for me is this - &lt;strong&gt;the couple and their guests make a wedding happen more than the venue or other goodies&lt;/strong&gt;. You'll notice in the film that people's expressions and interactions with their guests are the most important. There was very little or no posing either. And did you see what troopers their guest were in sitting down on the floor to eat off of banana leaves? 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Yeah, my kind of wedding.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The movie was shot by Lokesh Moorthy. I am not sure if the couple worked with a professional photographer. When I learn more about this truly adventurous couple, I'll update you here. Thanks for watching and reading. Would you design your wedding in a similar - simple, yet wholly elegant - manner? Do post your comments below. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

			<title>Digital or Film For Wedding Photography?</title>

			<description>Let's get one thing wide out in the open so that we are all working off of the same page. Well-meaning people, after seeing my images, will often say this:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;"Wow, those are great images. Your camera must take great shots." [CRINGE]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Cameras, film and now memory cards are nothing more than tools for me. They are like a painter's brush or their canvas. Or, a chef's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UP2K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tiffinbox-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00005UP2K"&gt;KitchenAid mixer&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, having the latest and greatest may feel good, but a photographer still needs to know how to use them appropriately. And this is where friends and uncles who have graciously offered to photograph your wedding for free will fail. It's usually not an option for most of my clients because they value images, expect them to evoke pleasant memories and want to pass those on to the next generation through wedding albums. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu-chinese-wedding-reception-new-york.jpg" border="0" alt="Wedding, Reception, Chinese, Multicultural, New York, Film" name="Wedding, Reception, Chinese, Multicultural, New York, Film"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2003 image above was created by using film, is from a &lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net"&gt;Chinese-American wedding reception in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of toasts, lots of posed portraits through the event. It was among the first 10 weddings I ever photographed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Days Of Film&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Ok, now that I have that off of my chest, I wanted to tell you that I have been thinking a lot about my first days photographing weddings.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Kodak TriX, Fuji Neopan 800, Portra 160 and T-Max 3200.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Those were my film choices when I started in this business. No, I am not afraid that bit of information will date me. I feel those of us who have worked with film before have a better sense of the aesthetics behind those final images that make it into your wedding album. So, yes, I am one of those photographers who actually exposed black and white negatives, hand-processed them and printed images on RC or fibre-based archival papers. The color negatives were usually processed by a custom lab, which also created contact sheets for me.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If you were heavily into instant gratification back then, well, you could end up going a bit batty. Things simply took time. Lots of time. Clients understood that the process was long. And, they were willing to wait. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Then came digital. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Beginnings In Digital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;When my first son Rohan was born, I "graduated" to a Nikon 950. I was curious about this new tool. The lens swiveled gracefully up and down which I thought that was very cool. I recall that the images out of that camera were often very RED. A newborn baby, already quite pink, looked like he had had just been sunbathing for a week. I knew no way of adjusting the white balance on that camera; the first of three things that determines accurate skin tones (the others are correct exposure and managing the red channel). [Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.douglaslevyphotography.com/"&gt;Doug Levy&lt;/a&gt; for educating me about the red channel issue.]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Years later, I upgraded to a Nikon D70, Nikon D80 and then to the &lt;a href="&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENOZY4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tiffinbox-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ENOZY4"&gt;Nikon D90&lt;/a&gt;. But IGS, instant gratification syndrome, was in full play. I could see the images, move them into a folder and send them to my favorite custom printer after I had edited them. You would think that this process was easy, but it required buying more memory cards, batteries, local hard-drives, storage space in the cloud, a faster computer and software for processing all of these images. And to keep up with technology, there is the biennial purchase of a new professional digital camera body to replace that "older" version.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Back then as a newly minted dad, I'll be honest, I was frustrated by the learning curve and also the time it took away from my family. But my clients expected digital files on discs and so I opted in and started photographing weddings using digital cameras. The good news is before each wedding season (that is right now), I reevaluate my digital photography workflow, so that I can get my client's wedding albums into their hands faster. I am excited about the changes I have made for my clients, and subsequently for my family, in 2011. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I Give Film A Second Chance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But back to film. As my friend Jonathan Canlas, suggests in his widely acclaimed guidebook called &lt;a href="http://tiffinbox.org/nope-film-is-not-dead/"&gt;Film Is Not Dead&lt;/a&gt;, it is a lot easier to work in analog. A father of five kids, Canlas, has even more commitments to his family than I do. The way he sees it: You photograph a wedding, you send the film in to be processed and scanned and then the images arrive on a DVD. You are welcome to enhance the images further for final prints or wedding albums, or upload them to a gallery service like Pictage. You are literally done. Result: Happy clients.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The debate rages on whether the final scanned images from negatives do or do not look different than their digital counterparts. Canlas feels his images  do and my friend &lt;a href="http://www.fotowala.in/"&gt;Sephi Bergerson&lt;/a&gt; says "film-like" effects can be easily reproduced through the use of Photoshop actions or Lightroom presets and doesn't see any logic in going back to film. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Well, from my perspective, they are both right. In the end, then, it comes down to which workflow makes the most sense for your business and what your clients expect. If you read &lt;a href="http://tiffinbox.org/nope-film-is-not-dead/"&gt;Canlas' guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, he outlines his workflow very lucidly. Mine, which is all digital at the moment, follows the footsteps of &lt;a href="http://www.ineedre.com/INeedRE/Welcome.html"&gt;Richard Esposito&lt;/a&gt;, who helped me set up my system.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I believe I will give film a second chance if I can make it a natural part of my workflow like Jonathan Canlas,  &lt;a href="http://www.riccisvalladares.com/"&gt;Riccis Valladares&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.smogranch.com/"&gt;Dan Milnor&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do My Clients Want?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The most important question I ask, however is: what do my clients want? If you are getting married, how important is it for you to have a photographer who is experienced working in both film and digital mediums? Do you believe the final products - albums, canvas prints or folios - will look and feel different? Have you considered how your memories will be archived for generations? Does film have an advantage in that regard over digital files? What are your preferences? How will your wedding images be different? For you, is it the medium or the approach of a wedding photographer that's most important to you? In the comments section below, please tell me. I am eager to hear your opinion about all of this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If you are a potential client who is wondering if I can shoot a wedding with nothing more than a trusty analog camera, the answer is SURE. Will I? For the right clients, you betcha. What's more, I am more than happy to pull out my &lt;a href="&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043WKYAC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tiffinbox-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043WKYAC"&gt;4"x5" Wista Field Camera&lt;/a&gt; to create some very cool portraits of my couples too.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Or, if Rohan would have his way, he will want me using this &lt;a href="http://carynorton.com/legotron-mark-i"&gt;fun film camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

			<description>My friend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hari"&gt;Hari Srinivasan&lt;/a&gt; sent out this Tweet and I had to share the accompanying video:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;"Funny- Cultural Spelunking http://bit.ly/dRyz4v Wonder what he would say about a South Indian wedding"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="700" height="424" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A4T6zTlLmCI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For most desis the wedding experience is so ingrained in us that we take it for granted. However, this animation video shows how welcoming Indian weddings can be for those outside our culture. Indeed, it's this warm embrace that even I look forward to every time I am asked to photograph an Indian or Pakistani wedding. I have yet to go to one where I have not been asked whether I have had something to eat or drink. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;David's video above got it right and he put it together in a very clever and elegant manner. Now, as Hari asks, I wonder if I should invite David to a South Indian wedding. What would his experience there be like and what would his video show?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Sound off below in the comments section after you have seen the video. If you have been to a South Asian wedding, what did you experience? What did you take away from that celebration? How did it make you feel to be at an Indian or Pakistani wedding?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

			<title>The End Of A Sabbatical, Coming Back Full Circle</title>

			<description>&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu_buttnerolson_001.jpg" border="0" alt="Connecticut Wedding Couple Cuddling | © Seshu Photography" name="Connecticut Wedding Couple Cuddling | © Seshu Photography"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six months is a long enough sabbatical. What do you all think? The last time I blogged here was back in August 2010. It was on my birthday, to be exact. So, you are probably wondering, how or more likely why I fell off the map. The answer is a bit complicated but to simplify things, let me just say I temporarily lost track of my focus. I think we all do from time to time. But to come back full circle and to reconnect with my passion has been the greatest blessing of all. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Oh, sure, even though I was distracted, I continued to make images - photographed several beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net"&gt;Connecticut weddings&lt;/a&gt;, one in Dayton, Ohio, one in New Jersey, one in the Berkshires with my friend Parris Whittingham and second-shot one in Chicago with Tara Sharma. I even photographed a couple of awesome weddings with Carrie Draghi. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;It was a thrill to do so because other than helping the primary photographer out, I had carté blanche to do my own thing. I could flex my artistic muscles a little more each time I went out and I thank each and every one of those who took me on as their second photographer for the trust and patience they showered upon me. I'll never forget their generosity. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Through the 2010 wedding season, I racked up a lot of air and road miles photographing for other photographers. At the end of 2010, I felt as though all the work I had produced wasn't truly mine. In some instances, I couldn't mention the weddings publicly. In some others, the images were quarantined until the primary photographer had blogged her or his images first. All of these are valid reasons and are part and parcel of agreeing to work as a second photographer. I don't begrudge any of those protocols because I believe it does provide a certain quality standard that I see slipping in the industry. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the year, I became all too comfortable in the role of a second photographer and the extra time I had of course meant that I could spend more time &lt;strike&gt;goofing off&lt;/strike&gt; marketing myself on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/picseshu"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/seshuphotography"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. I also spent a great deal of time growing &lt;a href="http://www.tiffinbox.org"&gt;Tiffinbox&lt;/a&gt;, a blog I have been publishing for photographers since 2003. Photographers from around the world now look to it as a place to learn about photography, be inspired by other photographers and to impart their experiences in this business. It's an exciting space on the Internet and I invite you to subscribe to it if you are so inclined. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;There were a few crucial changes at home that guided me more towards doing more portraits locally, in my home studio. I started a one-page website called &lt;a href="http://www.connecticutheadshots.com"&gt;Connecticut Headshots&lt;/a&gt; and continue to photograph business executives, actors and models. The images from these sessions, I told myself, would feed into a new robust portrait business called &lt;a href="http://www.seshuportraits.com"&gt;Seshu Portraits&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Being a father of two children meant spending a good deal of time photographing them as well. You may remember that after my younger son had to be taken to the ER at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, I started &lt;a href="http://seshu.net/blog.cfm/postID/144/Phases-Faces-The-Kids-Of-Connecticut"&gt;Phases + Faces: The Kids Of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, a photo book project to raise money for the hospital. This project has kept me busy as well - allowing me to get to know a lot of Connecticut children and their parents. I do ask that you keep your eye on  &lt;a href="http://www.seshuportraits.com"&gt;Seshu Portraits&lt;/a&gt;, where I will showcase each of the children I have photographed so far.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Also in 2010, I was contacted by &lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net/darkroom/share/?n=Navneet_Mandeep"&gt;Navneet + Mandeep&lt;/a&gt;, whose wedding I photographed in 2008. Navneet wanted me to photograph their newborn son, Armaan, and I was of course thrilled to continue working with her and her beautiful family in Massachusetts. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Here he is almost 7 months old:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu_ah3_001.jpg" border="0" alt="Massachusetts Baby Photography | © Seshu Photography" name="Massachusetts Baby Photography | © Seshu Photography"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, if I have photographed your wedding in the past, I do invite you to give me a call when your new one(s) arrive. I will be honored to be considered your family photographer as well.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But back to that focus thing again. I guess things went blurry for a bit, but having great friends and business mentors does help. I credit people like &lt;a href="http://fromparriswithlove.com/"&gt;Parris Whittingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://startup-strategy.com/"&gt;Jeff Jochum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skipsphotonetwork.com/"&gt;Skip Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thejoyofmarketing.com/"&gt;Sarah Petty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kubotaworkshops.com/"&gt;Kevin Kubota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.davidanthonywilliams.com"&gt;David Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.anneruthmann.com/"&gt;Anne Ruthmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.storeywilkins.com/"&gt;Storey Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jeshderox.com/"&gt;Jesh de Rox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.paulfgero.com/"&gt;Paul Gero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.photographer-re.com/Photographer-RE/Photographer_Richard_Espostio.html"&gt;Richard Esposito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://fasttrackphotographer.com/"&gt;Dane Sanders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.buzzworthysuccess.com/"&gt;Jerry Deck &amp; Sondra Ayers&lt;/a&gt; for bringing me back, reigniting that pilot light under me and holding me accountable. Having goals, showing that action alone pays dividends and making me measure it all is what it took me to realize that I not only have the passion for wedding photography, I have something important to say and share with my cameras that my clients will truly enjoy for the rest of their lives.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, whose books I'm devouring now, says this about the value of work: "You have to specialize, take risks, create art, leave a positive impact and adopt generosity." 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;So, what's next you ask? Simple. &lt;strong&gt;I am looking forward to working with 25 incredible couples in 2011&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are a couple who is reading this blog (for the first time even) and are planning your wedding in Connecticut or beyond, in 2011 or later, &lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net/contact.cfm"&gt;contact me now&lt;/a&gt;. I invite you to have a conversation with me. Getting to know each other, I have found, just makes sense for everyone. I welcome you to look at some of my work on this site. My relaxed approach is fairly evident in the galleries you see and I am happy to share several more slideshows with you when you do connect with me.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For this blog and website, I am going to take on Scott Bourne's sound advice: &lt;a href="http://goingpro2010.com/2010/06/14/attention-emerging-photographers-shoot-and-show/"&gt;Shoot &amp; Show&lt;/a&gt;. You are going to see a marked increase in  quality posts here that will include:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;1) Images from weddings I haven't blogged yet (call that "catch up")
&lt;br&gt;2) Images from &lt;a href="http://seshu.net/engaged.cfm"&gt;engagement portrait sessions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;3) Images from my editorial and wedding image archive and descriptions of how they came about
&lt;br&gt;4) Images from my iPhone and the &lt;a href="http://instagr.am/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; app which I love
&lt;br&gt;5) Frequent teasers on what is and will be in &lt;a href="http://mim.io/2f0b4"&gt;MANTRA&lt;/a&gt;, my monthly newsletter to subscribers (so, &lt;a href="http://seshu.net/newsletter.cfm"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;!)
&lt;br&gt;6) And one very cool surprise that I hope to launch on August 23, 2011 (yeah, that's my birthday)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;There will be other goodies - things that you will more than likely want to share with your friends who are also planning their weddings. The short list above are my promises to you and I want you to hold me accountable. Will you? Cool! 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Jeff Jochum of &lt;a href="http://startup-strategy.com/"&gt;Startup-Strategy&lt;/a&gt; hit home with this recent Tweet:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Difference between your biz and your camera? Your camera has autofocus."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Could Jeff have been any more succinct? I think not. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Awesome ... focus, found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

			<description>Today happens to be my birthday. One of my goals was to have an electronic newsletter published for my friends, family, clients and fellow wedding vendors. Well, MANTRA, as I call it, is out.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If you have any suggestions, opinions or topic ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me at &lt;strong&gt;mantra@seshu.net&lt;/strong&gt;. So, I hope you will join me by subscribing to this e-newsletter and letting your friends and family know too! Thank you.

			<description>Since January 2010, I have had a slew of interviews. You probably recall this blog post about my work being featured in &lt;a href="http://seshu.net/blog.cfm/postID/199/The-Storyteller-An-Approach-To-Wedding-Photography"&gt;Better Photography magazine&lt;/a&gt;. I may not have mentioned all of them before, so I wanted to list them here to make it easy for you to find them and learn a little bit more about me and my approach to wedding photography. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Each image below is preceded by a link that you may click to the original interview or feature. Please post your comments on this site after you've had a chance to go through some or all of them. 
&lt;br&gt;

			<description>&lt;img style="margin-right:10px; border:3px solid #ffffff;" align="left" src="http://www.seshu.net/images/guests/richa_avatar.jpg" alt="Richa C. Johari, Avatar" title="Richa C. Johari" width="150" height="150" /&gt;This is a guest post by &lt;strong&gt;Richa Chandra Johari&lt;/strong&gt;, Marketing Director for &lt;a href="http://indianweddingsonline.com/"&gt;Indian Weddings Online&lt;/a&gt;. You can find her on Twitter as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/richacjohari"&gt;@RichaCJohari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/indianwedonline"&gt;@IndianWedOnline&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Selecting the ideal photographer to capture the most celebrated occasion in the South Asian family's life is one of the most important decisions you will make. Whether you make four or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saptapadi"&gt;seven pheras&lt;/a&gt; around the sacred fire, wear a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangal-sutra"&gt;Mangal Sutra&lt;/a&gt;, sign a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkah"&gt;Nikkah&lt;/a&gt; contract, or marry at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurudwara"&gt;Gurudwara&lt;/a&gt;, you and your photographers must have the perfect chemistry. As an event coordinator and former Desi bride, I realize that this decision is more involved than may appear on the surface.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;One of the questions you may face is whether you should choose an experienced or rookie photographer when it comes to Desi weddings. There are two sides to this dilemma. The experienced photographer will capture the emotional moment of the kanya daan (when the father gives away his daughter) or the kick off of your garba circle. On the other hand, the Desi wedding rookie will see beauty in the display of barfis and ladoos, the details of your chudis, and the height of the havan fire. You may feel an intangible sense of awe captured in their images. You will feel like you are looking through the eyes of a person who is attending a Desi wedding for the first time, which can be quite poetic! Regardless of the experience of the photographer, the most important criterion is that you like the style of your photographer's pictures and that their style &lt;strong&gt;matches your taste&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;To ensure the photographer's style is complementary to your own, you should try to meet or talk to the photographers or have your wedding coordinator meet to explain your overall vision. &lt;strong&gt;Study their portfolios&lt;/strong&gt;, ask for their creative input, and find out their shooting style. I recommend having an engagement and bridal portrait session with your photographer to also help &lt;strong&gt;establish chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;. By the time of your wedding day, you will feel at ease with your photographers, and they will be more like friends. Some photographers have a natural tack at making you smile and laugh whereas others may be non-interactive. This is an important quality to consider in terms of whether you prefer &lt;strong&gt;candid shots or more posed shots&lt;/strong&gt;. The type of photographer that works best for candid images is non-intrusive and will not need much guidance. The one who is great for posed shots will be interactive and skilled at directing and making everyone feel like a star. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;One of the most cumbersome moments during your wedding day for you and your photographers will be the "organized" portrait sessions. Whether you have an event coordinator or not, this is often chaotic because family and friends are often unaware of all the little behind-the-scenes details. &lt;strong&gt;Plan your portrait sessions&lt;/strong&gt; in advance. Make sure everyone who needs to stay for a portrait session after the ceremony is informed. Send out an email, or make a list to be distributed to your family and close friends.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Now, at your reception will you take pictures with all the guests? In my opinion, this always becomes a lose-lose situation. You may regret not having pictures with all your guests, but if you go through this strenuous undertaking, you may not have the energy to dance the night away. Consider the length of your wedding day and events and try to spread out pictures with family and friends over the nights of the mehendi, sangeet, and finally, ceremony and reception. This way you won't be overwhelmed with by "table shots" or "sweetheart table portraits" with groups.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;On another practical note, &lt;strong&gt;go over your contract&lt;/strong&gt;! Make sure the package you choose fits your needs. As our desi wedding events are numerous and long, you may have over a 1000 images from which to select, and it may take anywhere from two months to a year to choose pictures for your album and prints! Make sure you know what this process will be like with your photographers. You also need to make sure you know how many hours the photographer(s) will shoot and what their overtime charges are for your events. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Okay, so everything is clear as mud now, right? No worries, here is a summary for the overwhelmed dulha and dulhan-zilla:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;a) Make sure the photography matches your taste.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;b) Study their portfolios.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;c) Establish chemistry with your photographers through bridal and/or engagement portrait sessions, and decide whether you prefer posed or candid shots.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;d) Make a list of your needs: i.e. bridal session, engagement session, ceremony portrait session, all your events, number of prints, albums, and number of shooters needed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;e) Plan for portrait sessions!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;f) Go over your contract to make sure it fits all your needs or hire an event coordinator to make sure you are covering everything.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The photographic material of South Asian wedding ceremonies is diverse, and visually appealing with colors, jewels, and poignant moments galore. To ensure that your pictures transcend beyond the innate beauty of our wedding traditions, make sure you select your ideal photographer carefully. Unlike many of your wedding gifts, this will be the gift to yourself that keeps on giving. Get ready for the fun and exciting road of planning your big fat Indian wedding, and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!&lt;!--aaf70576f8694badb94e7ecd18ff19f2--&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

			<title>The Storyteller &#x96; An Approach To Wedding Photography</title>

			<description>I mentioned in earlier post about &lt;a href="http://seshu.net/blog.cfm/postID/197/Judging-Wedding-Photographer-Of-The-Year-In-India"&gt;judging a wedding photographer of the year contest&lt;/a&gt; how &lt;a href="http://betterphotography.in/"&gt;Better Photography&lt;/a&gt; in India had also chosen to feature me in their April 2010 issue. What a treat!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I waited with bated breath to see what the final layout and copy was going to look like. Neha Mutreja, the writer who interviewed me did a fabulous job as did the design folks at that fine magazine. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As I quipped to Madhavan Pillai, &lt;a href="http://betterphotography.in/"&gt;Better Photography&lt;/a&gt;'s editor-in-chief, the magazine he produces clearly rivals those I have found in the newsstands right here in America. No joke. Everything from the copy, to the design and even the printing and paper quality - all top class. I am truly honored to be included in this first Weddings Issue of &lt;a href="http://betterphotography.in/"&gt;Better Photography&lt;/a&gt; magazine.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Below is the opening sequence to a 6-page profile of my work and approach to wedding photography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seshu.net/images/content/seshu_betterphotography_feature.jpg" border="0" alt="Showcased In Better Photography Magazine, Mumbai, India" name="Showcased In Better Photography Magazine, Mumbai, India"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seshu.net/pdfs/seshu_betterphotography.pdf"&gt;Download the entire PDF&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
