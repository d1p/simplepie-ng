But I say that is precisely its significance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16417087@N02/6204589583/" title="occupywallstreet photo by jeffjarvis, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6204589583_8a5757539b.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="occupywallstreet photo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#OccupyWallStreet is a &lt;a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/2011/09/occupywallstreet-is-more-than-a-hashtag/"&gt;hashtag revolt&lt;/a&gt;. As I learned with my own little &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/07/24/fuckyouwashington/"&gt;#FuckYouWashington&lt;/a&gt; uprising, &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/07/27/no-one-owns-a-hashtag/"&gt;a hashtag has no owner&lt;/a&gt;, no heirarchy, no canon or credo. It is a blank slate onto which anyone may impose his or her frustrations, complaints, demands, wishes, or principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will impose mine. #OccupyWallStreet, to me, is about institutional failure. And so it is appropriate that #OccupyWallStreet itself is not run as an institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t trust institutions anymore. Name a bank or financial institution you can trust today. That industry was built entirely on trust — we entrusted our money to their cloud — and they failed us. Government? The other day, I heard a cabinet member from a prior administration call Washington “paralyzed and poisonous” — and he’s an insider. Media? Pew released a &lt;a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/147038/pew-75-of-americans-say-press-cant-get-their-facts-straight/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; last week saying that three-quarters of Americans don’t believe journalists get their facts straight (which is their only job). Education? Built for a prior, institutional era. Religion? Various of its outlets are abusing children or espousing bigotry or encouraging violence. The #OccupyWallStreet troops are &lt;a href="http://nycga.cc/2011/09/30/declaration-of-the-occupation-of-new-york-city/"&gt;demonizing&lt;/a&gt; practically all of corporate America and with it, capitalism. What institutions are left? I can’t name one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a  Foreign Affairs essay in 2008, Richard Haass argued that the world is moving from bi- and unipolarity (that is, the Cold War and its aftermath) to &lt;a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63397/richard-n-haass/the-age-of-nonpolarity"&gt;nonpolarity&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., no one’s in charge). “We now operate in an open marketplace of influence,” I wrote in my &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/what-would-google-do/"&gt;last book&lt;/a&gt;. “One need no longer control institutions to control agendas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one needs a network. #OccupyWallStreet is that network, the headless tail. Even it’s not sure what it is. Indeed, I think it would have been better off not issuing a &lt;a href="http://nycga.cc/2011/09/30/declaration-of-the-occupation-of-new-york-city/"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; written by a committee of the whole park, going after even animal rights and ending with its own &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"&gt;Ninth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;: “*These grievances are not all-inclusive.” Henry Blodget &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/occupy-wall-street-analyzing-their-list-of-demands-2011-10"&gt;mocks&lt;/a&gt; many of their demands. Feminisnt &lt;a href="http://www.feminisnt.com/2011/thoughts-on-occupy-wall-street-and-how-to-fail-at-activisting/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they aren’t specific enough. They can’t win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think they are already winning. #OccupyWallStreet is a start and it is growing, as Micah Sifry &lt;a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/occupywallstreet-theres-something-happening-here-mr-jones"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “There’s something happening here, Mr. Jones.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening is an attempt to define a new public, now that we can. &lt;a href="http://www.gov20.de/jonsdottir-rede-dokumentation/"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya are all countries being reimagined and remade: start-up nations. &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/CAZPCMtwY1Q"&gt;Hear&lt;/a&gt; Icelandic MP Birgitta Jonsdottir talk about building a new constitution, using Facebook, on the principles of “equality, transparency, accountability, and honesty” — &lt;em&gt;liberté, égalité, fraternité&lt;/em&gt;, updated for the networked age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, this is why I wrote &lt;a href="http://buzzmachine.com/publicparts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Parts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because we have the tools and thus the opportunity to rethink and reorganize our publics and decide what they stand for. The power and freedom that Gutenberg’s press brought to the early modern era, our networked tools now bring everyone in this, the early digital age. “They empower us. They grant us the ability to create, to connect, to organize, and to aggregate our knowledge…. They lower borders, even challenging our notion of nations.” That’s what the youth of these countries are doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media have mocked the denizens of #OccupyWallStreet as scruffy, young hippies. But you should have seen me — and more of media’s bosses than you can imagine — in ‘68. Scruffy, simplistic, bombastic, angry, determined, self-righteous, right, and high — that was us. Media dismissed us just as they dismiss the denizens of Zuccotti Park. Authorities thought they could round up all the ‘68ers in Grant Park, just as they do now on the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXXeV95Cpew"&gt;Brooklyn Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visited #OccupyWallStreet’s park Friday, I wore a sport coat. I had to because earlier that day, I had a meeting at a place where they wear them. But I’m glad I brought it, for it’s time to show that #OccupyWallStreet represents more than scruffy young leftists. I don’t say that for a moment to denigrate them and their spirit. They built #OccupyWallStreet. No, I say it’s time for more of us to follow their leadership and join them, to show that what they represent — the anger, the determination, and the inherent hope — speaks for more of us, even people in suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What #OccupyWallStreet has done with considerable success — as the best hashtags and publics do — is open a conversation, one we must have, about the shape of our nation and society and future. If you don’t like their manifesto and demands, fine: What are yours? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;Public Parts&lt;/em&gt;, I present mine, knowing they aren’t the right ones but urging people to enter a conversation not about complaints or demands but instead about the &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/12/10/bill-of-rights-in-cyberspace-amended-2/"&gt;principles of our new and open society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think #OccupyWallStreet is or should be about just venting anger or demonizing business or complaining or demanding. Indeed, of whom are we making these demands? The failed institutions? The ones our networks will disrupt if not displace? I say the message of #OccupyWallStreet should be more hopeful than that: building a new and open public based on the principles of a society that will replace the dying institutions and their ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever noticed how the remote for each new TV you check out seems to have more and more buttons? Or how that online game you used to enjoy is feeling less like fun as the options pile on? It’s not your fault. It’s a well-documented phenomenon, found in hardware, in software and on the Web: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep"&gt;feature creep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers, bless their hearts, want to give us access to all the exciting new functions they’ve come up with. But they’re not great at making them simple enough for the average user, or at removing the buttons we no longer need. When a company does have the courage and discipline to slash away at its engineers’ wish lists, and adhere to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"&gt;KISS principle of design&lt;/a&gt; (Keep It Simple, Stupid), it can rise head and shoulders above its rivals and delight its users. &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/follow/topics/apple/"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of that, as is &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/follow/topics/nintendo/"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/follow/topics/wii/"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt; being one of the most simple — and successful — game console designs of all time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for its 800 million users, &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/category/facebook/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; does not appear to be that kind of company. It used to be, and its inherent simplicity was part of the reason it was so successful. But now it is falling victim to feature creep — and a roster of settings that are becoming increasingly complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/20/facebook-news-feed-revamp/"&gt;Ticker&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that real-time stream of information which now crowds the right-side of your Facebook page with a lot of distracting noise. Or look at the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/27/facebook-like-button-takes-over-share-button-functionality/"&gt;Like button&lt;/a&gt;, which recently celebrated its &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/21/facebook-like-button-one/"&gt;first birthday&lt;/a&gt;. That was a very popular all-purpose tool that spread rapidly across the Web. Everyone knows what it means to Like something. But Facebook couldn’t leave well enough alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/facebook-f8-live-video/"&gt;this year’s f8 conference&lt;/a&gt;, Mark Zuckerberg announced &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/follow/topics/facebook-gestures/"&gt;Facebook Gestures&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow you to [any verb] a [any noun]. As Zuckerberg pointed out, this will allow you to “read” a book or “hike” a trail rather than like it. That’s great if you like a lot of granularity in your News Feed, but I fear that for the vast majority of us it means more confusion, more noise, and the decline of the social network’s single most iconic feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, you just friended people; now you have to decide if you want to &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/15/facebook-subscribe-users/"&gt;subscribe to their feed&lt;/a&gt; instead. A profile used to be a profile, plain and simple; now it can also be a Page (and &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/31/facebook-profile-to-page-migration/"&gt;converting one to the other&lt;/a&gt; can open up &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/31/facebook-profile-migration-warning/"&gt;a world of pain&lt;/a&gt;). And let’s not even get into the debate over &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/facebook-changes-roundup/"&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt;, the radical redesign of the user profile, which will start rolling out to all users in the next week or so and eventually be required for all of us. Got your all-important top-of-the-page picture picked out yet? Booked the hours that it’s going to take to fill in the story of your life, all the way back to birth? (The vast majority of respondents in &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/fill-your-facebook-timeline/"&gt;our poll&lt;/a&gt; said filling in their Timeline gaps would take too much time and effort.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Other 792 Million&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;The New Facebook Profile: Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27105The-New-Facebook-Profile-Timeline"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="The New Facebook Profile: Timeline" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Timeline is a radical departure from previous versions of the Facebook user profile. The most prominent feature is the addition of a cover photo at the top of the page. Users can change this to whatever they'd like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;1987&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#271071987"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="1987" src="http://6.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-facebook-profiles-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 1987, my sister was born.  Facebook knows these life events and includes them in your timeline.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Being Born&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27109Being-Born"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Being Born" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can even add a picture and context to your birth, which starts the Timeline.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Timeline Interface&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27111Timeline-Interface"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Timeline Interface" src="http://9.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Timeline is a two-column interface with top photos, status updates, friends and more.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Map&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27113Map"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Map" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Facebook has added a feature that lets you see where you have visited. This is powered by Facebook Places.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Photos in the Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27115Photos-in-the-Timeline"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Photos in the Timeline" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's how photos are displayed in the Timeline.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Friends in the New Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27117Friends-in-the-New-Timeline"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Friends in the New Timeline" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's what the Friends page looks like.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Changing Settings&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27119Changing-Settings"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Changing Settings" src="http://6.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some of the new Timeline's customization features.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;2009&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#271212009"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="2009" src="http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/new-profile-9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More of the new Timeline&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Getting Married&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/facebook-too-complicated/#27123Getting-Married"&gt;&lt;img width="400" style="border:none" title="Getting Married" src="http://6.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/facebook-timeline-in-depth/facebook-profiles-10.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can add life events, such as getting married, to your profile through the Publisher Bar.  You can also announce that you broke a bone, got a new job, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are, as a &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; reader, you’re on top of some of this stuff. Maybe you’ve even &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/how-to-facebook-timeline/"&gt;gone through the complex steps required to activate your Timeline&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time. Great; that puts you in the top 1% of Facebook users: the early adopters, the people who get excited about change rather than fear it. But spare a thought for the other 792 million users, most of whom don’t even know these changes are coming. There are millions of people who think the Ticker &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the new Facebook. They’re in for a nasty surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for those at the top of the pile, the complexities are growing. Many friends who cover Facebook for a living have their pet peeves about the site and the increasing number of roadblocks it throws in the path to doing something that should be very easy. Take Lists, for example. Facebook used to treat Lists as a way to prevent certain people from seeing certain information; you could exclude your boss and your parents from seeing all those girls’ night out pictures you were tagged in, say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now Facebook has &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/13/facebook-revamps-friend-lists-pics/"&gt;changed its mind&lt;/a&gt; and decided that Lists are more like &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/follow/topics/google-circles/"&gt;Circles on Google+&lt;/a&gt; — ways to &lt;em&gt;share with&lt;/em&gt; specific groups of friends rather than &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; specific groups of friends. In other words, there are now two kinds of Lists. It is possible to merge your old Lists together, but we’ve heard from users that this blasts your privacy settings. And who has the time to sort out this stuff? It’s getting so that managing your social network, and making sure nothing embarrassing slips out, is a full-time occupation in itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memo To Facebook: Chill Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impression we get of Facebook is that of a young company, both in its own age and in the average age of its employees. They’re excited. They want to change the world. They can’t sit still for long. The engineers — and it is a company top-heavy with engineers, starting with Zuckerberg himself — can’t wait to thrill you with their latest feature. And they’re constantly looking over their shoulders at what Google+ is developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all adds up to a dangerous mindset. It ignores the fact that most users just want to post a status update and read what their friends are up to. It treats casual visitors as if they were power users. I agree with my colleague Christina Warren that few people are likely to &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/27/you-wont-quit-facebook/"&gt;quit Facebook&lt;/a&gt; just yet, or not enough to matter. But that doesn’t mean they won’t get frustrated, confused, and less likely to visit. In less time than you might think, that will open up opportunities for rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Zuckerberg needs is the discipline and the vision of a Steve Jobs or a Jeff Bezos; the power to resist feature creep and focus on what matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree? Is Facebook becoming more complex and feature-laden than necessary? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Facebook’s new model, all users do is read articles as they normally do and the app shares each one with their friends. No liking or tweeting. It’s the same model that has Spotify listens appearing in so many folks Facebook feeds.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue that held back the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; was centrally about privacy. As Mr. Donohoe write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year when I was still at the Times we talked to Facebook about a news app. Facebook had a whole set of new features in the pipeline (presumably just launched) and this passive reading action was one of them and they were pushing hard for us to use it. It came up in conference calls and on-site meetings. I believe Facebook is very eager to catch-up or even displace Twitter as a go-to place for news, and this is how they think they can do that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To their credit the newsroom shelved the idea. The consensus was that this was intrusive and potentially an invasion of privacy. I think after that was repeatedly communicated that Facebook lost interest in doing anything at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, no one is forced to use the Social Reader app. People who simply show up to &lt;em&gt;WaPo’&lt;/em&gt;s website won’t have their reading habits exposed. As with Facebook itself, it’s a conscious choice to sacrifice privacy for a greater flow of information within your social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Donohoe’s point is that most users will start doing this, then forget about it, and that at some point it will create a terrible situation for a reader, and likely blowback for the newspaper involved. His hypothetical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if your friends saw a steady stream of articles that you were reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/finding-comedy-in-cancer/2011/09/20/gIQAIuHqqK_story.html"&gt;Finding comedy in cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, of course, hopes that we’ll soon live in a world where our every move on the internet is shared on Facebook. Literally, that’s what he talked about at the latest Facebook developer conference. It’s a vision of a web in which the things we do–read, watch, listen–become links around the web as powerful as the hyperlinks that power Google search. But as with all things Facebook, it’s also a world that pushes the boundaries of privacy to their outer limits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Popper</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.betabeat.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.betabeat.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Betabeat -- News, gossip and intel from Silicon Alley 2.0.</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.betabeat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1317348692907"><id gr:original-id="http://www.businessinsider.com/is-aols-seed-defunct-2011-9">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6c741289fecdf7e</id><title type="html">AOL's Seed Is 'Defunct'</title><published>2011-09-29T19:50:14Z</published><updated>2011-09-29T19:50:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~3/iB8pCPDbN00/is-aols-seed-defunct-2011-9" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.businessinsider.com/sai" type="html">&lt;a href="http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=fa417f69a575989fba6da87ad780d223&amp;amp;p=2"&gt;&lt;img alt="" style="border:0" border="0" src="http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=fa417f69a575989fba6da87ad780d223&amp;amp;p=2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was intended as a way for AOL to solicit content from freelancers. Editors would post stories, and writers would get them written. It was an efficient, seamless way to generate articles (and increase SEO-driven pageviews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the work already dried up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last we heard from Seed, its boss &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/former-timesman-saul-hansell-gets-a-new-gig-at-aol-2011-5"&gt;Saul Hansell was moving to the Huffington Post as "Big News editor."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we're hearing there's no more work from one freelancer who responded to a post about &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/s?q=patch&amp;amp;sort=date"&gt;our ongoing reporting on Patch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;I've seen this before with AOL. I also contributed to City's Best for a few months (mom content, four stories total). Pay was less than Patch. A few weeks after my last story was posted on City's Best, I inquired if the editor would like more ideas. Her response was that the site was no longer using freelancers and would only use staff stories. The staff for the [redacted] site consisted of two people. Now one freelancer contributes one story a week to City's Best [redacted]. &lt;strong&gt;I was paid through Seed, and, of course, I noticed that Seed is pretty much defunct. No stories to claim. Looks like Patch is going to follow the same path.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted AOL's PR department but have yet to hear back. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Murrow was a pioneer in television who has shaped the way we tell stories in that medium for over 60 years.  He has been immortalized in film and even has &lt;a href="http://communication.wsu.edu/"&gt;a J-school&lt;/a&gt; named in his honor. But Murrow’s career began not in TV, where he is most celebrated, but in radio, where he cut his teeth as a war correspondent, broadcasting live from the rooftops as the Blitz rained down on London. Throughout his years in television, Murrow applied the journalistic principles he’d honed through experience to the new medium of sound, pictures, and, eventually, color. You’ll see his legacy in any HD television newscast today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murrow found himself at a precipice, and chose to look back to find his way forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now at another precipice in journalism: The decisions we make about news’ direction in the digital world have the potential to shape how stories will be told for decades to come. So who will be our Murrow? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/murrow.jpg" alt="" title="murrow" width="250" height="188"&gt;The problem is that the answer may be more about “what” rather than “who.” In the digital world, the tools we use to tell the world’s stories — Twitter, Google, Facebook — control us as much as we control them. I am a digital journalist, and I’m enthusiastic about what our new platforms can provide us in terms of telling stories. But I also wonder whether we’re letting our tools define, rather than serve, the stories we tell. I wonder whether digital journalism’s Murrow won’t be a journalist, but rather a tool that journalists use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this age of crowdsourcing and participatory journalism — this age in which, to some degree, everyone can be a journalist — some would argue that those concerns are moot points: that we don’t need a Murrow anymore. They might say that “&lt;a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2009/07/19/transparency-is-the-new-objectivity/"&gt;transparency is the new objectivity&lt;/a&gt;” and that it’s perfectly justifiable for the editor of a technology news site to &lt;a href="http://www.techi.com/2011/09/michael-arrington-crunchfund/"&gt;also run a venture fund&lt;/a&gt;. But principles are principles only if they can withstand the changing of circumstances. And dismissing the links to our storytelling past can set digital journalism on a dangerous path.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://markcoatney.com/"&gt;Mark Coatney&lt;/a&gt;, the Tumblr evangelist who left &lt;a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/05/say-what-you-will-about-newsweek-but-dont-forget-about-their-tumblr/"&gt;his job at Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; to help bridge the gap between journalists and his new parent company, pointed out during the &lt;a href="http://ona11.journalists.org/"&gt;Online News Association conference&lt;/a&gt; last week that 105,000 jobs were lost in newspapers between 2001 and 2008. One upshot of that grim stat, as Coatney &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lalorek/status/117606551279243264"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt; in the talk: “We’re all our own best agents” now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be true for Coatney and for the handful of other journalists who’ve found ways to make names for themselves in this new age, but here’s the unfortunate reality: When those 105,000 reporters, producers, editors, and managers left the profession, they took with them 105,000 versions of professional experience: the experience that comes from covering news events in environments ranging from small towns to war zones. Those 105,000 reporters, producers, editors, and managers, in another time, could have acted as mentors for the new generation of reporters — the young people still predominantly employed by traditional media outlets — that will likely mature in the industry without obvious role models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the changing state of our craft, though, those trends aren’t irreversible. Here are some ideas to get us back on a course that would make Murrow proud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Put the “digital” back in digital journalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Google, and Facebook – to take the most prominent examples – are wonderful tools that open up a whole new universe of communication, interaction, and reporting. But that’s all that they are: tools. And they are tools, of course, that are provided by profit-driven companies whose interest lies as much in their own benefit as our own. Google News &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dabeard/status/117608546916499457"&gt;got applause&lt;/a&gt; at ONA this weekend when it announced Standout, &lt;a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/09/with-its-standout-tag-google-news-is-giving-publishers-new-incentive-to-credit-the-competition/"&gt;the new tag that will allow publishers the chance to get a better ranking in their news search results&lt;/a&gt;. The line between “journalism organization” and “technology company” has never been thinner. And that may be because we aren’t asking the right questions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War correspondents are experts in covering war. Health correspondents are experts in covering health. It seems fitting, then, that digital journalists should be experts in covering digital technology news. So the next time you’re at the “launch” of a new product, even one that could be beneficial to the news industry, don’t be afraid to ask questions not just about the product itself, but also about the company’s overall take on privacy, competition, and security. Or about the implications all these tools are having on journalism and on the First Amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If digital journalists – who understand the technology better than most reporters — won’t ask these questions, who will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Seek facts…but also seek verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now we’ve all heard that social media and the Internet in general are magnets for hoaxes, fake photos, and errant reports. It’s not that these things didn’t exist before the digital age, but that now, with social media, these reports can be spread rapidly and then be immediately amplified. It’s unrealistic to suggest that inaccuracies can be fully debunked during the initial germination phase, so the responsibility lies with social media editors and producers to fact-check and verify information before amplifying false reports.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their ONA panel, “&lt;a href="http://ona11.journalists.org/sessions/b-s-detection-for-digital-journalists/"&gt;B.S. Detection for Digital Journalists&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href="http://www.regrettheerror.com/author/craig/"&gt;Craig Silverman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mjenkins"&gt;Mandy Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mandyjenkins/bs-detection-for-journalists"&gt;a terrific slideshow&lt;/a&gt; with some tips on how you can detect incorrect information before reposting it online. And of course, the inimitable &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/acarvin"&gt;Andy Carvin&lt;/a&gt; is leading the verification charge via his consistent — and very public — attempts to fact-check the information he curates on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are good starts, but they’re also efforts that need more systematic adoption. As Murrow knew: No matter what the medium, nothing kills credibility faster than reporting false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Foster dynamic mentorships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional journalists often trot over to their (often newly-hired) social media editors and digital aggregators and ask those journalists for practical advice: how to use Twitter, how to navigate Facebook, how to mine data for stories. What once felt like a war between traditional and digital journalism has now settled into a somewhat uneasy truce – and into a (sometimes grudging) recognition that, increasingly, “digital” and “journalism” are inextricably connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re all in this together, of course. And the onus is on digital journalists to welcome veteran reporters into the future’s fold — to help them navigate the new tools that will inform, if not define, the shape journalism takes going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the onus is also on digital journalists to learn from the veterans – to learn reporting methods and narrative techniques and skills that have nothing to do with Google or Facebook or Twitter, and everything to do with journalism as it’s been practiced throughout its history. The veterans may not be able to show you how to create Fusion tables, but I can promise that, from them, you’ll learn something new that will help your reporting more than the latest tools ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;by 1960 it is estimated that 55% of photos were of babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the 20th century was the golden age of analog photography peaking at an amazing 85 billion physical photos in 2000 — an incredible 2,500 photos per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the first few hundred thousand digital cameras shipped in 1997 their memory was strictly limited (in fact cameras like the Sony Mavica took floppy disks!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might sound implausible but this year people will upload over 70 billion photos to Facebook, suggesting around 20% of all photos this year will end up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And They'll Pull Your Accreditation</title><published>2011-09-20T18:45:00Z</published><updated>2011-09-20T18:45:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110919/14221016016/criticize-better-business-bureau-theyll-pull-your-accreditation.shtml" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.techdirt.com/" type="html">For many consumers, the Better Business Bureau is considered the authoritative, objective source on whether or not a small business is trustworthy.  Most people think of the group as being quite trustworthy itself.  But who's the Better Business Bureau for the Better Business Bureau?  &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/profile.php?u=joshuamking"&gt;Josh King&lt;/a&gt; alerts us to the news of how an operation called FeeFighters wrote a rather scathing post, claiming that the BBB &lt;a href="http://feefighters.com/blog/the-bbb-is-a-scam/"&gt;was a scam&lt;/a&gt;, based on the story of one company who -- the article claims -- was able to bump its rating from an "F" to an "A" basically by paying the Better Business Bureau.  I have no idea how accurate the report is, but it certainly is damning.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So how does the BBB respond?  Does it explain to the FeeFighters how they got something wrong in the story?  No.  Does it admit to a problem in the process and promise to correct it?  No.  As far as I can tell, those seem like the only two reasonable responses.  But the BBB went in a different direction.  It told FeeFighters to take down the post or it would lose its own accreditation.  And when FeeFighters refused to do so, the BBB &lt;a href="http://feefighters.com/blog/bbb-accreditation/"&gt;pulled the company's accreditation&lt;/a&gt;, and flat out admits that it's because they don't like such criticism.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z5vqv.png" width="560"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
This seems really quite incredible considering what the Better Business Bureau does: collecting complaints and seeking to get companies to resolve them.  And when someone presents a complaint about the BBB itself, rather than trying to resolve the problem... it attacks the messenger and revokes his BBB accreditation.  On this one, it seems like the BBB deserves a big fat &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; until it apologizes and takes back the revocation.  Frankly, it's hard to trust BBB ratings at all after this experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110919/14221016016/criticize-better-business-bureau-theyll-pull-your-accreditation.shtml"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110919/14221016016/criticize-better-business-bureau-theyll-pull-your-accreditation.shtml#comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110919/14221016016/criticize-better-business-bureau-theyll-pull-your-accreditation.shtml?op=sharethis"&gt;Email This Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CAIRO &lt;/strong&gt;-- The historic revolution in Egypt this spring changed the country&amp;#39;s media landscape dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the uprising, a plethora of new online initiatives have sprung up. Several citizen journalists have become full-on celebrities. News agencies have started disseminating on Facebook. New TV channels are aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would seem then, that freedom of speech is blooming, too. But the red lines restricting Egyptian voices are still there, only pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;You can say whatever you want, but you will pay for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/salmaeldaly"&gt;Salma el Daly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;describes the extent of freedom of speech in Egypt at the moment. Even though there seems to be more freedom of speech than during ousted President Hosni Mubarak&amp;#39;s time, Egyptians still can&amp;#39;t freely express themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think about that for a second.  A professional social networking site has hired a content focused executive away from a traditional media company&amp;#39;s digital arm.  Isn&amp;#39;t LinkedIn doing terrifically well with it&amp;#39;s recruiting focused business?  Isn&amp;#39;t ad-supported content a tough place to be?  Why would LinkedIn &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110622/linkedin-connects-with-fortunes-dan-roth/"&gt;hire away Dan Roth&lt;/a&gt; from Fortune a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What LinkedIn is realizing is indicative of a recent trend--that the best use of online content as a business might be as a synergistic compliment to other activites.  Take &lt;a href="http://www.refinery29.com"&gt;Refinery29&lt;/a&gt;, for example.  The &amp;quot;HuffPo for Fashion&amp;quot; site has seemlessly integrated its &lt;a href="http://reserve.refinery29.com/new-york"&gt;Reserve&lt;/a&gt; deals with the same fashion brands it often writes about.  Conflict?  Please!  Picked up a fashion magazine lately?  For years and years fashion magazines have known for years that editorial and advertising is a blurry one at best--and it&amp;#39;s what the consumer wants anyway.  The consumer picks up a fashion magazine with the mindset of &amp;quot;Show me what to buy.&amp;quot;  That might mean a great branding initiative or deal from a sponsor or it could mean a story on a cutting edge trend.  Either way, quality and relevancy seem to ring more authentic to the consumer than the economics of how it got in front of my eyeballs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn realizes that it needs to be not just a place to get a job--but to be knowledgable enough to be on the cutting edge of your industry.  In a way, it has a responsibility to keep it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;--the professionals on the site--in the know.  In this case, content improves the offer.  Similarly, when I&amp;#39;m reading a piece of content, I may want to spread it across my professional network--and especially when I&amp;#39;m publishing one.  I can&amp;#39;t wait until I can write a post about startups and make sure it gets to every entrepreneur within two degrees of me on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal is getting into the community and content game as well with their soon to be released stealth GetSocial effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers like TechCrunch and Business Insider are active in the events business, just as O&amp;#39;Reilly has been for years.  There are a ton of synergies here.  Having an online audience enables you to sell an event to your community--lowering cost of customer acquisition--but it also allows you to create unique. exclusive content out of what happened at the conference.  Why cover news without any information advantage when you can setup a forum for news to break right in your lap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands and advertisers are getting into the fold, too.  Content brings communities of shared interests together, allowing brands to tell their message directly to their audience.  Agencies like &lt;a href="http://www.bynd.com/"&gt;Beyond&lt;/a&gt; are helping brands become little publishers themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a blurry little content world we&amp;#39;re creating.  Seems to me that anyone wanting to get into the pure content business or have a career in it needs to start thinking more creatively about what business goals of the stakeholders in their field are complimented by content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other publishers are looking at these new models and the tools needed to find synergies, pivot, and move forward, and thinking that innovative startups might be able to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take CNN/Money.  They&amp;#39;ve invited the startup community to come pitch them on what they can do to help CNN/Money innovate.  If you&amp;#39;re in the business of helping publishers transform, improve, and jumpstart their offering,&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/startupevent/"&gt; you absolutely need to apply to pitch (deadline is today)&lt;/a&gt;.  The winners will pitch their wares in front of a live audience and a panel of experts (VCs, executives at CNN/Money) for a chance at a real business offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time this nextNY event was done with the Daily News, one company, &lt;a href="http://www.olapic.com"&gt;Olapic&lt;/a&gt;, got a distribution deal (and revenue) that changed the nature of their business.  If you can use CNN/Money as a partner, there&amp;#39;s no excuse not to give it a shot.  If you just want to attend and see what startups are changing the future of publishing, &lt;a href="https://websvp.com/startup_event/"&gt;you can RSVP here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid much hoopla and skepticism about Patch, AOL’s group of 800-plus hyperlocal news sites, little has been said about the sites themselves. How much news do they produce? How do their users interact with them? To find out, I took a closer look at four Patch sites around the country for a month.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First of two parts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about &lt;a href="http://www.patch.com" title="Patch.com"&gt;Patch.com&lt;/a&gt;, AOL’s foray into hyperlocal news. At an expenditure of about $160 million to the company, it’s not hard to see why. &lt;b&gt;Will such a huge investment in an untested platform and business model yield results? &lt;/b&gt;While some have already rendered a &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/patch-is-a-huge-waste-of-money-and-it-has-us-worried-about-tim-armstrongs-ability-to-run-aol-2011-1" title="verdict"&gt;verdict&lt;/a&gt;, the jury is undoubtedly still out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At AOL at least, enthusiasm doesn’t seem dampened. Starting out with a mere three sites in February 2009, the network has grown to, as of this writing, &lt;b&gt;861 sites in 22 states and D.C. &lt;/b&gt;It continues to expand though that has slowed. The stated goal is now on improving existing sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprising for a new company, the coverage thus far has focused sharply on whether Patch will be successful in the long term. But the best anyone has been able to do is make an educated guess, especially given Patch’s unwillingness to share concrete traffic and advertising numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to foretell the future, I decided it might be instructive to look at what’s happening on the ground right now, on a fairly granular basis. Thus I picked four Patch sites for a month-long scan over the course of August. Each site was checked once a week for things like number of new posts, comments, etc. (See methology at the end of this post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the sites at random to represent diverse geographical areas of the U.S. -  A California site (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://hermosabeach.patch.com" title="Hermosa Beach"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hermosabeach.patch.com/" title="Hermosa Beach"&gt;Hermosa Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; launched 3/8/2010), a New York site (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rye.patch.com" title="Rye"&gt;Rye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; launched 12/22/2009), Florida site (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://brandon.patch.com/" title="Brandon"&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, launched 12/15/2010) and a Midwest site (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://northbrook.patch.com/" title="Northbrook"&gt;Northbrook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; launched 9/9/2010). (Note: I reside in Northbrook.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief summary of the daily ranges I found per site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*	&lt;b&gt;New stories&lt;/b&gt; posted: 1 to 15,&lt;br&gt;
*	&lt;b&gt;Comments&lt;/b&gt; on new posts: 1 to 25,&lt;br&gt;
*	&lt;b&gt;Blog posts&lt;/b&gt; by community members: 0 to 3&lt;br&gt;
*	&lt;b&gt;Comments on blog posts&lt;/b&gt;: none found&lt;br&gt;
*	&lt;b&gt;Announcements&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="http://brandon.patch.com/search/announcements" title="sample page"&gt;sample page&lt;/a&gt;): 0-4&lt;br&gt;
*	&lt;b&gt;Events&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="http://rye.patch.com/events" title="sample page"&gt;sample page&lt;/a&gt;): 1-11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information gathered is of course just a snapshot and probably can’t be used to generalize about other Patch sites or about the network as a whole. But it provides some insight nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the right amount of content? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every online publisher has probably tried to answer the question of how much new content is too little to keep readers coming back and how much is too much or superfluous. Patch has tried to answer this question too and so far they don’t have a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://streetfightmag.com/2011/05/18/memo-from-patch-eic-more-articles-more-uvs/" title="In the past"&gt;In the past&lt;/a&gt;, Patch site editors were required to produce a certain number of posts per day. However, when I spoke with Brian Farnham, Patch’s Editor in Chief, he stated that this was no longer the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farnham said that while 4-5 posts per day was the requirement at one point, &lt;b&gt;most editors were outstripping it anyway so the need for a hard target lessened&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farnham did stress the fact that number of posts and traffic are correlated and that Patch definitely looks carefully at those metrics, among many others. But since corporate obviously can’t oversee every site (and claims not to want to control things that tightly), it’s up to the site editors and their regional editors to determine what works best for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Patch must have some sort of traffic goals, right? If so, Patch officials generally loath to discuss them. No official numbers have been released save for this &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-internal-reports-reveal-the-truth-about-patch-traffic-2011-6" title="leaked report"&gt;leaked report&lt;/a&gt; which Patch has neither confirmed nor denied. The numbers that are &lt;a href="http://blog.patch.com/2011/08/03/something-to-celebrate/" title="openly shared"&gt;openly shared&lt;/a&gt; aren’t exactly illuminating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patch President Warren Webster said that when Patch launched, &lt;b&gt;the goal was to have 50% of each community using the local Patch site.&lt;/b&gt; Meaning, if a town had 20,000 residents, 10,000 of them would be Patch readers. According to Webster, that goal was hit in 2009 and has since been exceeded. He added that some of the “older” sites, the ones that launched earlier, are now attracting 80-90% of the community. To measure this, Webster says that Patch looks mainly at unique visitors and also what they are doing on the site: are they subscribing to newsletters, commenting, coming back more frequently, etc. Again, none of this can be verified since Patch has been unwilling to release any traffic stats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what about comments? Does Patch care if their stories get comments, does it track their number and are there any goals set here? As for the latter, Farnham joked that the goal is, “...to quote Carl Sagan, billions and billions; it’s never enough.” He said that &lt;b&gt;number of comments is definitely tracked and considered to be a valuable measure of audience engagement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He added that Patch hopes to continually grow that engagement by &lt;b&gt;making the site more conversational&lt;/b&gt; with the addition of things like the Q&amp;amp;A section (&lt;a href="http://hermosabeach.patch.com/questions" title="here&amp;#39;s an example"&gt;here’s an example&lt;/a&gt;) which was launched in November of this year. Farnham says that features like this are being explored for their potential to be “productized” more and for somehow becoming more prominently used on Patch sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed,&lt;b&gt; the sites obviously try to engender conversation and engagement at every turn.&lt;/b&gt; Many stories end with a question, a common tactic of bloggers, and an entreaty to answer it in the comments. Readers are encouraged to submit tips, photos and videos. Recent comments are featured in a sidebar on the homepage and new bloggers are solicited there as well. Links to social media sharing sites are rampant all throughout the site. Is it working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my tracking, all the sites added together got an average of five comments per day across all new stories and 0-1 comments on average per story. If we take into account &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/media/17local.html" title="estimates of Patch&amp;#39;s traffic from earlier this year"&gt;estimates of Patch’s traffic from earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, this number, while low, seems to be about right. If each post is being viewed 100 times, fewer than that may read the entire story and in the end perhaps one person will comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, always outliers as this&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/nyregion/muslims-criticize-police-over-playland-fight-about-hajibs.html" title=" story from Rye"&gt; story from Rye&lt;/a&gt; about criticism of excessive police force by Muslim visitors to a local park illustrates. Though they didn’t all come on one day, to date the post has racked up 137 comments. Considering the controversial topic, it’s not difficult to see why and conversely, to understand &lt;b&gt;why many Patch stories get zero comments. With a great deal of &lt;a href="http://northbrook.patch.com/articles/boys-soccer-simon-leads-spartans-to-second-straight-win" title="content being straightforward and informational"&gt;content being straightforward and informational&lt;/a&gt;, there isn’t necessarily a lot to say about it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Comments of course are not the sole measure of engagement. To get a truer picture, one would also have to measure the number of likes and shares on Facebook, tweets on Twitter, emails of stories sent to family or friends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What topics are covered?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patch editors are expected to cover certain beats consistently such as&lt;b&gt; crime, local government, schools, local business and sports&lt;/b&gt;. Farnham admitted that each of these categories is potentially huge and editors aren’t asked to cover them exhaustively, just regularly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what topics and types of stories get the most traffic or comments, Farnham said things that directly affect the community like &lt;b&gt;crime, development projects and political scandals are typically the most popular&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also posed the question to some of the editors of the sites I tracked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Fisher, editor of the &lt;a href="http://www.northbrookpatch.com" title="Northbrook Patch"&gt;Northbrook Patch&lt;/a&gt;, said stories on &lt;b&gt;regional politics tend to be the most well-read&lt;/b&gt; though other categories like crime and schools are also popular. Fisher says she keeps a fairly close eye on what readers like the most (for instance, the top five click getters) and that it does inform her future coverage. Overall, she said she takes readers’ comments, suggestions and criticisms very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Howard oversees the &lt;a href="http://www.hermosabeach.patch.com" title="Hermosa Beach Patch"&gt;Hermosa Beach Patch&lt;/a&gt; and she echoed Farnham’s comments in saying that the stories that get the most attention are those that impact residents’ lives the most. The topics she cited were &lt;b&gt;parking, schools, environment and taxes&lt;/b&gt; and recalled &lt;a href="http://hermosabeach.patch.com/articles/city-puts-halt-on-parking-permit-fee-changes" title="this story about parking fee increases"&gt;this story about parking fee increases&lt;/a&gt; as an example of a good traffic getter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for whether traffic plays into her decisions on what to cover, Howard was even more emphatic. She wrote in an email: “I track our traffic daily and it absolutely affects coverage—if a story does not directly affect the community and doesn’t attract readers then there’s no reason to publish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com" title="The Huffington Post"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; model comes to Patch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of having a lot to say (or rather hoping people have a lot to say), Patch ambitiously set out to &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/04/26/aols-patch-adding-8000-bloggers-in-full-on-course-correction/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2011/04/26/aols-patch-adding-8000-bloggers-in-full-on-course-correction/" title="recruit 8,000 bloggers"&gt;recruit 8,000 bloggers&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year to blog on Patch sites. How have they fared? Farnham says the goal of &lt;b&gt;recruiting 8,000 has been reached and in fact there is a new goal of 8,000 more&lt;/b&gt; that Patch hopes to hit by a date sometime in fall of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How active and effective these bloggers are once brought on board is, of course, another matter entirely. Farnham fully acknowledges the difficulties and says that among those 8,000 bloggers there are those that wrote one post and were never heard from again and also those that consistently produce posts every week. As a result, he said the r&lt;b&gt;ecruitment of bloggers is going to be a lifestyle for Patch site editors&lt;/b&gt;, an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course none of this will shock or surprise people who have tried to recruit and retain volunteer contributors to either report or blog on their sites. Having some experience with this myself, both professionally and on a volunteer basis, I can attest that it’s difficult and painstaking work. &lt;b&gt;Writing consistently and reliably is difficult to expect from those who may have other jobs and responsibilities&lt;/b&gt; and it often requires a lot of hand-holding and by all accounts, Patch editors don’t have that kind of time. Farnham says that editors briefly review bloggers’ posts before they go live, but they do not closely edit them. That may well be the extent of their involvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the two local editors I contacted seemed optimistic. Hermosa Beach’s Howard relayed that just this week she was meeting with a local middle school to discuss a possible partnership in which students in a journalism class there would use Patch’s blogging platform to publish some of their articles and reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northbrook’s Fisher admits that finding bloggers has been a challenge mainly because she can’t seem to find many existing bloggers in her town. She has met her goals so far though and continues to press on. She adds that the people she has talked to about blogging do seem excited about writing on the site and she’s hopeful more will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that will come in time, but right now the blogging numbers are decidedly un-Huffington Post-like, at least for the four sites I surveyed. Collectively, they saw an average of 0.67 posts per day which is to say less than one. &lt;b&gt;That means there were days with no blog posts&lt;/b&gt; and in fact one of the sites I looked at never had a post on any of the four days on which I checked it. &lt;b&gt;The highest number of posts seen on a given day was three which isn’t bad, but this was also not the norm for that site or for the others. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patch vs. the indies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this all stack up against what Patch’s competitors in the local news space are experiencing? To find out, I asked some independent local news site publishers what goals they had for number of stories per day, what sort of commenting activity they generally saw, if they used unpaid contributors, etc. While it’s not a direct apples to apples comparison, it’s still interesting to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the matter of how many posts they strive to have each day, the publishers I spoke with were pretty much in line with Patch’s aspirations. &lt;b&gt;They all cited anywhere from 3-6 posts per day as their goal and while some said they don’t always hit it, they feel that the two or three stories they do post are longer and more impactful&lt;/b&gt; than the quick-hit pieces that are faster and easier to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting activity seems to also be similar, at least in the case of the publishers I contacted. Their responses ranged from one or two comments per typical story to up to six and in one case, double digits were not uncommon. Like Patch editors, independent publishers also track other measures of engagement like Facebook likes and these often outpace the rate of comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the topics and types of stories that gain the most clicks and/or comments from readers were almost exactly the same ones that Patch editors said perform the best. Again and again, local issues like crime, development and politics i.e. those that have the most bearing on a community resident’s life, were the ones mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where there was perhaps the most divergence was on the matter of community contributors.&lt;/b&gt; While Patch has, by their own admission, had difficulty recruiting bloggers and keeping them active, indie news sites seem more committed to the task and more successful at it. Of course not all independent news sites utilize unpaid contributors, but those that do seem to put a great deal of emphasis and effort on getting a lot of content from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One publisher said their site has about 45 regular contributors from whom they see about four posts per day. What is impressive about that is of course not just the consistency of multiple posts per day, but that it comes from such a small group of contributors. Clearly these are &lt;b&gt;people whose level of commitment and motivation is extremely high. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another independent site reported having a cadre of over 150 citizen reporters and three interns, none of which are paid (there is a paid staff of four and freelancers receive payment as well). Many of them post on a regular basis and in fact the site is a platform for community voices. Going a step further, the nonprofit site seeks to help create a more media literate community and they facilitate and encourage the creation of a variety of different “news bureaus” where people can learn, share ideas and access tools and support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only thing that’s a constant in today’s media landscape is rapid change and it is this characteristic that may typify Patch’s operation the most. New features are being rolled out all the time and many others are doubtless in the works. On September 1, for instance, a new top-level category appeared on Patch sites called House &amp;amp; Home. It seems to have been mysteriously yanked for the moment (it was briefly in place of the Volunteer tab), but will surely make a comeback soon (though not currently visible to users, the pages seem to work; &lt;a href="http://northbrook.patch.com/topics/house-and-home" title="here&amp;#39;s an example"&gt;here’s an example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A statement from a Patch spokesperson described the new section thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The H&amp;amp;H guide is designed as a one-stop, consumer-friendly guide featuring helpful content ranging from how-to videos and articles about repairs, renovations and design, to gardening/landscaping advice, before/after renovation photos and other content to inspire home improvements and making the most of this key investment. We follow housing trends in each of our Patches, keep readers informed about interesting new developments, design inspirations, land deals, open houses and recently sold homes, and other local events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course is only the most recent example as &lt;b&gt;Patch sites have already evolved in myriad ways since their initial launches&lt;/b&gt;. Whether they are small changes or big, sweeping reforms, the mindset seems to be to constantly iterate, tweak and try new things. Many of the improvements are naturally designed to augment the bottom line which is perhaps crucial for Patch to ensure its existence. Will this approach help or hinder Patch as they &lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-armstrong-certain-patchs-will-be-profitable-by-end-of-2011/" title="strive for profitability"&gt;strive for profitability&lt;/a&gt;? Only time will tell.&lt;br&gt;

Is Patch meeting its stated advertising goals? What different revenue streams do they have?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Methodology of the site review:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I reviewed each of the four sites for one day a week over the course of August, counting:&lt;br&gt;
*	Number of new articles/pieces of content on that day&lt;br&gt;
*	Number of comments those articles garnered,&lt;br&gt;
*	Number of blog posts,&lt;br&gt;
*	Number of comments blog posts garnered,&lt;br&gt;
*	Classified listings, announcements and events,&lt;br&gt;
*	Ads (to be discussed in more detail next week).&lt;br&gt;
I also tried to take note of any new features, types of topics being covered and how active the sites seemed in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions or thoughts on my methods or my findings? Feel free to leave them in the comments.&lt;br&gt;

But Tumblr can also be used to &lt;strong&gt;power a news website&lt;/strong&gt;. That's exactly what &lt;a href="http://shortformblog.tumblr.com/"&gt;ShortFormBlog&lt;/a&gt; does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in January 2009 by Ernie Smith from Washington D.C., the site publishes about 30 news soundbites a day. ShortFormBlog is still a part-time project for Smith, who also works as a graphic designer at The Washington Post. He's hoping to turn the site into a full-time business. And I think he's onto something, certainly in terms of using a tool like Tumblr to &lt;strong&gt;change the way news is delivered and consumed.&lt;/strong&gt; I interviewed Smith to find out more about his Tumblr-powered news service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sponsor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/ck.php?n=28938&amp;amp;cb=28938"&gt;&lt;img src="http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/avw.php?zoneid=14&amp;amp;cb=28938&amp;amp;n=28938" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept behind ShortFormBlog is very simple: to publish really short posts throughout the day. Smith told us in an interview that the site aims &amp;quot;to tell stories using visual storytelling, inspired in part by newspaper design.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site publishes over 200 posts per week, an average of about 30 per day (higher on weekdays). There are currently four other contributors, other than Smith. The site can be consumed by following on Tumblr, or by RSS, Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/shortformblog2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience reaction and feedback - mostly via Tumblr, but also other social media such as Twitter - is a key part of the site. Catching the eyes of readers with visual design and enticing them to engage with the content  is what ShortFormBlog is all about. &amp;quot;I like to think of what we do as sort of a soft approach to more serious news,&amp;quot; remarked Smith. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s one that uses commentary as a tool, along with straight storytelling. A lot of what we do involves numbers, quotes, various types of blurbs, different sizes of photos and so on, anything to keep things interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tumblr community is especially important. &amp;quot;One thing that&amp;#39;s really helped us grow,&amp;quot; remarked Smith, &amp;quot;is that there&amp;#39;s a strong community around news on Tumblr. There are a number of great Tumblrs -- Pantsless Progressive, SoupSoup, BrooklynMutt, inothernews, kateoplis, The Political Notebook and NewsFlick, to name a few -- that really take the concept of news curation to heart.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/shortformblog3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Tumblr is Being Used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShortFormBlog uses a mix of Tumblr and Wordpress as its publishing platform. In particular, a plugin called Tumblrize. As Smith explained, Tumblrize &amp;quot;allowed me to take the WordPress backend (which I had invested a lot of work into customizing) and use it as a Tumblr backend.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why still use Wordpress, if Tumblr appears to offer a great publishing platform for short-form content already? According to Ernie Smith, it&amp;#39;s because the design tools they use are reliant on having a custom editing interface. &amp;quot;Through a bit of melding TinyMCE and some super-specialized CSS,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;we can pretty much do our number-based and burby posts without having to touch any HTML. I&amp;#39;ve also hacked the Tumblrize plugin to do a bunch of extra things -- effectively doubling Tumblr&amp;#39;s seven base styles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is what their posting interface looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/shortformblog_tool.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The site currently gets between 40,000 and 50,000 unique visitors a month, although Smith said that &amp;quot;with over 12,000 [Tumblr] followers and Tumblr&amp;#39;s viral nature, the true reach of our content is probably much further than that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Is There a Future in Curated News?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShortFormBlog is an excellent example of innovation in journalism. And it uses a consumer blogging service that wasn't designed to be a professional media tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure the bulk of its content is sourced from external media outlets, which is not dissimilar to the heavily criticized Huffington Post &amp;quot;aggregation&amp;quot; model. But let&amp;#39;s look at the bigger picture: the media ecosystem nowadays relies as much on good curation than on original writing. The curation needs  to done  selectively though, with a solid filter, in order to attract a regular readership. That is the opportunity for sites like ShortFormBlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think of Ernie's site and approach in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN)&lt;/strong&gt; -- The U.S. Postal Service appears to be the latest casualty in digital technology&amp;#39;s slow but steady replacement of working humans. Unless an external source of funding comes in, the post office will have to scale back its operations drastically, or simply shut down altogether. That&amp;#39;s 600,000 people who would be out of work, and another 480,000 pensioners facing an adjustment in terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can blame a right wing attempting to undermine labor, or a left wing trying to preserve unions in the face of government and corporate cutbacks. But the real culprit -- at least in this case -- is e-mail. People are sending 22% fewer pieces of mail than they did four years ago, opting for electronic bill payment and other net-enabled means of communication over envelopes and stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New technologies are wreaking havoc on employment figures -- from EZpasses ousting toll collectors to Google-controlled self-driving automobiles rendering taxicab drivers obsolete. Every new computer program is basically doing some task that a person used to do. But the computer usually does it faster, more accurately, for less money, and without any health insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to believe that the appropriate response is to train humans for higher level work. Instead of collecting tolls, the trained worker will fix and program toll-collecting robots. But it never really works out that way, since not as many people are needed to make the robots as the robots replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the president goes on television telling us that the big issue of our time is jobs, jobs, jobs -- as if the reason to build high-speed rails and fix bridges is to put people back to work. But it seems to me there's something backwards in that logic. I find myself wondering if we may be accepting a premise that deserves to be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid to even ask this, but since when is unemployment really a problem? I understand we all want paychecks -- or at least money. We want food, shelter, clothing, and all the things that money buys us. But do we all really want jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're living in an economy where productivity is no longer the goal, employment is. That's because, on a very fundamental level, we have pretty much everything we need. America is productive enough that it could probably shelter, feed, educate, and even provide health care for its entire population with just a fraction of us actually working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/dg/1999/millen-e.htm"&gt;U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt;, there is enough food produced to provide everyone in the world with 2,720 kilocalories per person per day. And that&amp;#39;s even after America disposes of thousands of tons of crop and dairy just to keep market prices high. Meanwhile, American banks overloaded with foreclosed properties are &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2009/05/05/nr.bank.demolishes.home.cnn?iref=allsearch"&gt;demolishing vacant dwellings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2009/05/05/nr.bank.demolishes.home.cnn?iref=allsearch"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/icons/video_icon.gif" border="0" alt="Video" width="16" height="10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get the empty houses off their books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem is not that we don't have enough stuff -- it's that we don't have enough ways for people to work and prove that they deserve this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs, as such, are a relatively new concept. People may have always worked, but until the advent of the corporation in the early Renaissance, most people just worked for themselves. They made shoes, plucked chickens, or created value in some way for other people, who then traded or paid for those goods and services. By the late Middle Ages, most of Europe was thriving under this arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only ones losing wealth were the aristocracy, who depended on their titles to extract money from those who worked. And so they invented the chartered monopoly. By law, small businesses in most major industries were shut down and people had to work for officially sanctioned corporations instead. From then on, for most of us, working came to mean getting a "job."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Age was largely about making those jobs as menial and unskilled as possible. Technologies such as the assembly line were less important for making production faster than for making it cheaper, and laborers more replaceable. Now that we're in the digital age, we're using technology the same way: to increase efficiency, lay off more people, and increase corporate profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is certainly bad for workers (an artificial construction, in my opinion, such as "slaves" "peasants" "aristocracy" "serfs" - that can be transcended as our relationship to work and consumption changes, and we no longer consider ourselves "consumers" or "workers" or "management", which are all artifacts of the Industrial Age. You are not a worker; you are a person.) and unions, I have to wonder just how truly bad is it for people. Isn't this what all this technology was for in the first place? The question we have to begin to ask ourselves is not how do we employ all the people who are rendered obsolete by technology, but how can we organize a society around something other than employment? Might the spirit of enterprise we currently associate with "career" be shifted to something entirely more collaborative, purposeful, and even meaningful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we are attempting to use the logic of a scarce marketplace to negotiate things that are actually in abundance. What we lack is not employment, but a way of fairly distributing the bounty we have generated through our technologies, and a way of creating meaning in a world that has already produced far too much stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communist answer to this question was just to distribute everything evenly. But that sapped motivation and never quite worked as advertised. The opposite, libertarian answer (and the way we seem to be going right now) would be to let those who can't capitalize on the bounty simply suffer. Cut social services along with their jobs, and hope they fade into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there might still be another possibility -- something we couldn&amp;#39;t really imagine for ourselves until the digital era. As a pioneer of virtual reality, Jaron Lanier, &lt;a href="http://edge.org/conversation/the-local-global-flip"&gt;recently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, we no longer need to make stuff in order to make money. We can instead exchange information-based products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by accepting that food and shelter are basic human rights. The work we do -- the value we create -- is for the rest of what we want: the stuff that makes life fun, meaningful, and purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of work isn't so much employment as it is creative activity. Unlike Industrial Age employment, digital production can be done from the home, independently, and even in a peer-to-peer fashion without going through big corporations. We can make games for each other, write books, solve problems, educate and inspire one another -- all through bits instead of stuff. And we can pay one another using the same money we use to buy real stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, as we contend with what appears to be a global economic slowdown by destroying food and demolishing homes, we might want to stop thinking about jobs as the main aspect of our lives that we want to save. They may be a means, but they are not the ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about how we have viewed the profession, Bell argued that journalism is becoming less defined by the businesses that support it than by the activities it involves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made the good point that arguing who is a journalist these days is futile. Instead she paraphrased Warhol saying in the future everyone will be a journalist for 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, she said journalism has many futures - as a business, as a profession, as a process – and we are only at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recapped how some of the previous arguments about journalism tended to frame the future negatively, such as a future dominated by the “hamster wheel” of live coverage and technologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell argued we tended to see disruption and technology as a bad thing. But in her view, these factors favour good journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It feels like journalism has been in defence mode for a long time and is now breaking out of its boundaries,” she said, suggesting journalism can learn from other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her, the future of journalism is about understanding technologies and the platforms that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about her journalism students who use technology in their reporting, Bell argued that how to tell stories best is no longer in the hands of technologists, but in the hands of journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She suggested that one emerging core skill is how to make the best of collaboration between journalists, technologists and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea she contested is that instant journalism is bad journalism. Instead she said the social, real-time web and proliferation of mobile devices had been one of the galvanising elements in journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Live journalism isn’t hamster journalism,” she insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live stream of journalism, the use of free tools and the involvement of people who are not journalists per se, is making journalism better, she argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her most controversial point was about the funding of journalism. In her view, revenues and profits did not equate with good journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, she said, the primary focus of those involved in journalism is sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quoted the example of the &lt;a href="http://www.journalregister.com/"&gt;Journal Register company&lt;/a&gt; with its focus on experimenting with digital, open approaches to journalism. But, she continued, there is uncertainty about whether the experimentation will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also cited ProPublica as an example of what can be done when we go beyond the way we have traditionally thought of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no clear answer to what a news organisation will look like in five year’s time,” said Bell. “The future of journalism is there to be defined, we have all the right conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded by insisting that we have a collective capacity to make this all work, but this can only be done by looking outwards and looking at other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alfred Hermida</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://reportr.net/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://reportr.net/feed/</id><title type="html">Reportr.net</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.reportr.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1315355528757"><id gr:original-id="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/09/infographic-explains-hackgate-news-of-the-world-scandal249.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/31f3c85b332f346d</id><category term="Culture" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Europe" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Global View" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Legal Drama" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="NewspaperShift" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="hackgate" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="james murdoch" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="news corp" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="news international" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="news of the world" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="rupert murdoch" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="united kingdom" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Infographic Explains Hackgate, News of the World Scandal</title><published>2011-09-07T00:02:21Z</published><updated>2011-09-07T00:02:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/pbs/mediashift-blog/~3/emrzjHBgPKM/infographic-explains-hackgate-news-of-the-world-scandal249.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you're still confused about the whole "hackgate" scandal in the United Kingdom, where the News of the World tabloid hacked cell phone voicemail messages to get inside information. Perhaps our &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/07/your-guide-to-the-uk-phone-hacking-scandal-or-hackgate207.html"&gt;guide to the scandal&lt;/a&gt; was just too dense. Well, here's an even simpler proposition: one simple infographic to explain the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infographic was created by security firm Veracode, in conjunction with Infographic World, and used here with permission. Veracode's Niru Raghavan explained why they created the infographic in an email to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question about why we created it, the answer is threefold. First, we are an application security company so stories with a data security angle are always of interest to us. Secondly, many reports on the News of the World scandal pointed to the fact that very often consumers don't bother to change their mobile voicemail passwords from the standard "0000." This leaves them vulnerable to unauthorized access to their private voice-mail messages. We think that's a fact worth getting out there and hopefully it will encourage consumers to change those passwords to something more secure. And lastly, we created the infographic because we feel telling this story in this pictorial style makes it more interesting for readers.  &lt;br&gt;

The  lights are in red/orange, blue and white, and they are showing Twitter  and Flickr activity. Pretty crazy, right? So you can easily see who is  the most active of the states in U.S. and the countries in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://planetoddity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/europe-at-night.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="europe at night" src="http://planetoddity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/europe-at-night.jpg" alt="europe at night" width="550" height="395"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;The  blue lights stand for tweets, the red/yellow ones for Flickr pictures,  and the white for locations that have been posted to on both Twitter and  Flickr, like an overall activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://planetoddity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/north-america-at-night.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="north america at night" src="http://planetoddity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/north-america-at-night.jpg" alt="north america at night" width="550" height="395"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;As you may see, there are some crazy  activity in London, which can be seen detailed in one of the photos.  While Twitter is going nuts in the United States. This is the work of  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/sets/72157627140310742/"&gt;Eric Fischer&lt;/a&gt; that has combined data from geotagged photos from Flickr  and geotagged posts on the network Twitter, and this is what you get. He  thought that it was best to show these two continents because the  Internet usage is most prolific. Fantastic idea and great photos, we  definitely like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bless the toolmakers… but I’m worried that everybody wants to be one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look at the celebration of Steve Jobs and his Apple Inc., and you see a celebration of tools. “One of the things that separates us from high primates,” Jobs &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXSfS1i4jU"&gt;said long ago&lt;/a&gt;, “is that we’re tool builders.” In the next breath he made his great analogy: a computer is “a bicycle for our minds.” Classic, and true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, you look at &lt;a href="http://yclist.com/"&gt;a sampling of startups&lt;/a&gt; and you see two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole lot of incredibly smart young men who want to be the next Steve Jobs, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a whole lot of tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reigning model for startups: make a tool and scale it up. The tool’s potential users can be rich (e.g. Salesforce) or they can be numerous (e.g. YouTube) or they can be rich &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; numerous (e.g. the iPhone) but any way you go, you are always a step removed from the object of attention. You are not the deal, you are not the Lil’ Wayne video, you are not the flirty text message. You are the facilitator, you are the mediator, you are the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hotiron/5055243335/sizes/l/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://snarkmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wrenches.jpg" alt="" title="wrenches" width="500" height="396"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;CC-licensed photo from &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hotiron/"&gt;whiteforge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the relationship between a toolmaker and a tool user? I wonder about this a lot. I mean, when I read about Steve Jobs’ illness, I think of him with care and gratitude, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dansinker/status/106499202091188224"&gt;I echo Dan Sinker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs had a hand in every tool that made me who I am. Forever indebted and in awe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… I don’t think about Steve Jobs when I’m using my MacBook. I don’t think about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Knoll"&gt;Thomas Knoll&lt;/a&gt; when I’m using Photoshop. I don’t think about the sublime inventor of the kitchen table (her name lost to history) when I sit here at mine. (I don’t think about the Ikea designer who made this particular model, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now switch from tools to media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anthologist-Novel-Nicholson-Baker/dp/B004TE7LZA/"&gt;The Anthologist&lt;/a&gt;, I am not really thinking about Nicholson Baker, either. Sure, I think about him when I read the book review and when I flip to the title page, but after that, I’m in the story. But!—I’m going to argue that Nicholson Baker is there with me, in my head, in a much fuller and more direct way than Thomas Knoll is with me when I’m using Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly with music, the case is even clearer: the artist’s presence (often literally her voice) is fully and directly felt. Music, especially pop music, imposes itself. It says: &lt;i&gt;I am here with you now!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, personally, that relationship is what I’m after. I imagine two scenarios—one where I write a story that 10,000 people read and another where I build a tool that 100,000 people use—and the first is infinitely more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want, frankly, to impose myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to toolmaking… I just don’t understand it. Of course, I understand that these markets exist—markets for sales CRM, markets for video-viewing, markets for personal communication and status-signaling gadgetry. I just can’t understand wanting to be the person who serves them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a great satisfaction in building good tools for other people to use,” &lt;a href="http://caterina.net/wp-archives/98"&gt;Freeman Dyson said&lt;/a&gt;. I’m supremely glad he feels that satisfaction, and I’m glad so many other toolmakers do, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, is there a chance… just a small one… that today, in the world of startups and internet technology, too many people are making too many tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as I type it, my fingers recoil, because it sounds like such heresy. The internet is nothing &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; tools, built and shared. Glory to &lt;a href="http://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;! We need more of this stuff, not less! … Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by… toolmaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/3323439406/sizes/o/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://snarkmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sea-of-tools-v2.jpg" alt="" title="sea-of-tools-v2" width="500" height="751"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;CC-licensed photo from &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/"&gt;Meanest Indian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually makes me think of the way that consulting used to be such a scourge on the undergraduate landscape, sucking up all of the ambitious, flexible minds because it was prestigious and remunerative and in a way &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe it’s absurd to think we lost novelists and musicians to McKinsey… but I think we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, if you’re a person with the toolmaking talent, you actually have a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of options, of which making a web platform or &lt;a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7320/comment-page-1#comment-40536"&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt; are just a couple. If you possess the skills to make powerful tools, you’ve got one up on Archimedes. “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the earth,” he said. You, the toolmaker, can make your own place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the electronic musician &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_(musician)"&gt;BT&lt;/a&gt;, who for years has enjoyed the advantage of a signature stuttering sound effect that he coded himself. This year, he finally decided to share his software, to put it up for sale—but you can bet he’s already working on the next great effect for his own music. It’s a competitive artistic advantage. (I mean, the dude knows &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound"&gt;Csound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Nobody&lt;/i&gt; knows Csound!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or think of Pixar, the Great Toolmaker’s side project. They sell movies, not tools, but the movies wouldn’t be possible without the tools that Pixar and Pixar alone possesses. Pixar is a place where brilliant toolmakers work for a tiny user-base: the artists across the hall. That partnership, and the feedback loop between tool and user that it permits, produces jaw-dropping results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, here’s what I think: the true &lt;a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/498648782/technology-liberal-arts"&gt;intersection of technology and the liberal arts&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/498648782/technology-liberal-arts"&gt;&lt;img src="http://snarkmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/intersection-tech-lib-arts.jpg" alt="" title="intersection-tech-lib-arts" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…isn’t actually Apple. It’s Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wish more people were making tools for a specific creative purpose rather than for general consumer adoption. I wish more people were making tools that very intentionally &lt;i&gt;do not scale&lt;/i&gt;—tools with &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html"&gt;users by the dozen&lt;/a&gt;. Tools you experience not through a web signup form, but through pathbreaking creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I want fewer aspirational Apples and more Pixar wannabes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless the toolmakers. I’m definitely not complaining here, just thinking out loud, and wondering about this kind of person, the way you might wonder about a world-class tennis player or a wandering ascetic: &lt;i&gt;How can you do that? What makes you want to get out of bed in the morning?&lt;/i&gt; It is honestly inscrutable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also wonder if there are some toolmakers out there right now who feel some of the same doubt. Carried along by the current of conventional (startup) wisdom and, of course, the promise of a great scalable payout, they are busy making a web-based tool for collaborative something-or-other. But in the back of their brains, something feels wrong. Some ambition is left unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I say: Come on over. Come join the side that makes books and music and movies. There are great rewards here, too, but not enough toolmakers. We need you.&lt;/p&gt;

And does it matter?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Michael &lt;strong&gt;Arrington&lt;/strong&gt; announced that he was starting an investment fund at Aol with capital from other VCs, Kara Swisher &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110902/crunchfund-unethical-ventures-pigpile-partners-no-matter-what-you-call-it-its-business-as-usual-in-silicon-valley/"&gt;went after him&lt;/a&gt; for violating canons of journalism. Just one thing: Arrington rejects the title of journalist. At his Disrupt conference, I &lt;a href="http://www.futureofmediaevents.com/2011/05/24/video-jeff-jarvis-talks-bias-transparency-with-michael-arrington/"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to get him to take on the mantle and alter it. But he sees nothing to aspire to there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Swisher’s case, one has to concede — as she does — the irony in riding the journalistic high horse from within News Corp., which is rapidly becoming journalism’s Death Valley. I asked her on Twitter what she had written about hackgate and she &lt;a href="http://storify.com/jeffjarvis/kara-swisher-thread-on-hackgate"&gt;responded at length with multiple links in this thread&lt;/a&gt;. She has written about it and has been, as she says, more vocal than other Journal journalists. That’s what troubles me. I would have hoped that WSJ reporters and editors as a group would have spoken out against not only hackgate but also their paper’s anemic coverage of it and its humiliating editorial justification of its owners. Where are their standards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the standards? Arrington, remember, started TechCrunch not as a journalistic venture but instead to gather and share information about startups and to promote himself as an investor. He is returning to his roots. Along the way, he created a media entity of value. I &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/105076678694475690385/posts/T8jGRJ5Hrof"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; on Google+ that The New York Times Company invests in startups (including one where I’m a partner, Daylife) and &lt;a href="http://www.news.me/"&gt;starts them&lt;/a&gt; and still covers them. It will say it maintains a wall. Arrington, not so much. Neither church nor state, he’s not trying to be a journalist. He’s trying to get information. He does it well. He has covered startups better than any big paper; that’s why WashingtonPost.com publishes TechCrunch posts. Given his links to startups and investment, can we trust him? That’s what Swisher’s trying to make us ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now look at Henry &lt;strong&gt;Bodget&lt;/strong&gt;, another businessperson who creates a media enterprise around gathering and sharing information — which we journalists define as journalism … if it’s done to our standards. Jay Rosen challenges Blodget for using confidential sources in &lt;a href="http://storify.com/jeffjarvis/jay-rosen-henry-blodget-felix-salmon-discuss-off-t"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;: “I hate the way @BusinessInsider uses anonymity.” But Blodget has an answer: “Sorry, Jay. Sometimes (often) it’s the only way to get the real info…. In business, anyone who goes on the record has agenda.” Felix Salmon counters: “Anyone who goes OFF record has an agenda. And those guys are more likely to lie. I trust on-the-record more.” Blodget: “Then you’ve clearly never worked in business. On record is only propaganda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note cultures clashing. The journalism tribe says that confidential sources and the journalists who use them are not to be trusted. I agree that journalists overuse them. That’s not reporting to our standards. But the deal-makers disagree. Blodget says, “My goal is to get to the truth.” Isn’t that journalists’ goal, too? How can he get there by a different route? Is that journalism? Who’s to say? The journalists? Perhaps not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now look at TV coverage of &lt;strong&gt;Irene&lt;/strong&gt;. Complaints about it have been miscast as “overhyping” the storm. The storm was severe. My problem was instead the over-exploitation and under-reporting of the storm. They had “reporters” as cast members standing thigh-deep in the surf or even being covered in sewage not to impart information, not to get to the truth, but to entertain. How much better it would have been if even a few of them had been dispatched north the center of their universe, New York, to report the devastation that would come there. My problem with the coverage is that all it did was take information already available to us all and repeat it endlessly and theatrically, adding no value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/strong&gt; saw, for a bit, the ability of journalism to add value to the flow of information. Julian Assange went to the Guardian, The Times, and Der Spiegel to get their help redacting leaks to make their revelation — in the view of these participants — responsible; to add context and facts; to promote the leaks and get them noticed. Now these journalistic organizations are disavowing Assange as he releases unredacted cables and Assange is disavowing the Guardian for publishing what it thought was a dead password to the files (though who was responsible for the entire file being available is another question). Assange has called himself a journalist; now the journalists are rejecting him. They say he’s violating their standards, though there is no rule I know of that would cover these eventualities, except perhaps the Hippocratic Oath: Do no harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is journalism, then?&lt;/strong&gt; I define it broadly — some would say too broadly, but I am always afraid my umbrella is not broad enough. I say that journalism helps a community organize its knowledge so it can better organize itself. I say that a community can now share its information without us, so we journalists must ask how we add value to that exchange. I use Andy Carvin as a model of adding value through vetting, questioning, challenging, and giving context and attention to the end-to-end, witness-to-world flow that already goes on without him. But he violates plenty of rules, passing on information before it is known to be true — so we can get closer to what is true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is journalism, really?&lt;/strong&gt; Does it matter? I’ve long said — ever since I rejected my own use of the term “citizen journalist” — that is a mistake to define journalism by who does it, as anyone can commit an act of journalism. Anyone can share information. By that definition, Arrington and certainly Blodget are committing acts of journalism as they gather and share information quite effectively. TV news is less effective. Wikileaks is perhaps &lt;a href="http://tomwatson.typepad.com/tom_watson/2011/09/the-end-of-wikileaks.html"&gt;too effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what the hell is journalism?&lt;/strong&gt; Dave Winer says it doesn’t matter. “Journalism itself is becoming obsolete,” he &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/02/mikeArringtonIsTheFutureOf.html"&gt;argues well&lt;/a&gt;. Mathew Ingram recasts what Winer says, &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/09/02/is-journalism-as-we-know-it-becoming-obsolete/"&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; whether journalism is obsolete because anyone can do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a wonderful email thread among the members of Journal Register’s advisory board (of which I am privileged to be a member), we debated about the &lt;a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/washington-post-needs-social-media-conversation-not-restrictions/"&gt;Washington Post’s new social rules.&lt;/a&gt; Jay Rosen said, in the kind of essential abstraction I try to learn from him, that “the subtext of all such rule sets: ‘We’re in charge. Really…We are!’” Is that what journalists are doing when they set social rules or claim that Arrington or Blodget or Wikileaks violate journalistic rules (or when I claim that TV news does)? The rule-setters would argue that rules define what they do. Rules try to protect one from the consequences of bad judgment. Those subject to rules — or those we journalists would like to subject to them — would say that rules are a way to exercise power and sometimes to exclude. In the thread, I recalled the worst and best of my time at Time Inc., when I was &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_02_27.html#009157"&gt;saved&lt;/a&gt; not by rules but by one editor’s integrity, by the principles she maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was trying to think through this post — a process obviously not over — I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/109676136438575104"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Information, more and more, comes from nonjournalists who’ve not signed the pledge.” To which Chris Tolles of Topix &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tolles/status/109689826151907328"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;: “This is key. Journalism no longer the gatekeeper. Journalists’ protests about this are guild protectionism.” There’s the peril of setting rules: They are, in so many senses of the word, limiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalism is not defined by who does it and who does it does not define journalism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is journalism, damnit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that people can exchange information and knowledge easier than ever. I believe there is a need for someone to add value to that exchange. I hope that “someone” can be journalists who will use precious resources only to bring value. I pray their efforts can be sustainable (that is, that they can eat; that’s why I do what I do in entrepreneurial journalism). But I think we need to question — not reject, but reconsider — every assumption: what journalism is, who does it, how they add value, how they build and maintain trust, their business models. I am coming to wonder whether we should even reconsider the word journalism, as it carries more baggage than a Dreamliner. These are the questions I see raised by Arrington, Blodget, et al. Do they matter? You tell me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;: YET MORE: Jay Rosen, as I’d hoped, abstracted the discussion including his abstraction. In the comments, he write: “The users don’t care about “journalism” all that much. That’s the name the producers of it have for what they do. News, information, “what’s happening,” accountability, staying in touch, alert system, “just tell me what I need to know…” Yes. The users care about those things. Journalism? Not so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. The question of what is and isn’t journalism is one that journalists ask. It has nothing to do with the questions the public asks. And the journalist’s job, supposedly, is to answer the public’s questions. Disconnect, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;: And in the also-lively discussion on this post &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/105076678694475690385/posts/fnhkuB6hUwP"&gt;at Google+&lt;/a&gt;, David Sass has an interesting perspective:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; I submit journalism was never more more than a academic concept – like Plato’s forms – that never really existed except as a vague concept in poly-sci textbooks. The reality is that I receive information from many sources – from direct observation, from friends, from entertainment, from politicians, from government, from media, from pundits/propagandist. Journalism is the naive belief that I should trust any one of these sources more or less than another. . . Information is not to be trusted from ANY source. To believe otherwise is to abdicate your individual responsibility to seek the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, plenty of people have written about the need for traditional media entities to embrace social media as a way to engage with their readers, or what journalism professor Jay Rosen has called &lt;a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html"&gt;“the people formerly known as the audience.”&lt;/a&gt; We’ve even written about it ourselves on a number of occasions, and &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/08/17/memo-to-newspapers-the-future-of-media-is-a-two-way-street/"&gt;how important it is&lt;/a&gt; for newspapers and other outlets to do this. But few have put the argument as well as a student journalist did in a recent column for &lt;em&gt;The Daily Californian&lt;/em&gt;, the student newspaper at the University of California at Berkeley. The bottom line, Mihir Zaveri says, is that the media itself is to blame for most of its problems, &lt;a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/31/its-not-you-its-me/"&gt;because it has failed to maintain the trust of its readers&lt;/a&gt; — and engaging with those readers in as many ways as possible is one of the only ways to try and reverse that state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own favorite demon when it comes to finding the blame for the decline of newspapers: some prefer to see Craigslist and other online classified sites as the enemy, for removing one of the core money-making services that papers used to offer. Others — such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the World Association of Newspapers — &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/07/rupert-murdoch-google-paywalls-ipad"&gt;like to lay the fault at the door of Google News&lt;/a&gt;, which they claim “steals” their content and thus their revenue. And some blame advertisers for chasing the lure of online eyeballs, something that continues to eat away at the money papers make from print advertising (&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110901-709989.html"&gt;print ad revenue fell in the latest quarter for the 20th quarter in a row&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, you could argue that newspapers were slow to recognize the value of online classifieds, particularly free ones like Craigslist pioneered (Craig Newmark initially offered to partner with a newspaper chain, but they passed). And they also haven’t made much of an attempt to think like Google News — in other words, to think like an aggregator, rather than a gatekeeper of information. But I think Zaveri is closer to the mark when he says in his column that &lt;a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/31/its-not-you-its-me/"&gt;there’s an attitude at the bottom of all of these issues&lt;/a&gt;, and that is the biggest problem with the traditional media. As he puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the truth: it’s not you, it’s me. It’s not Craigslist’s fault for taking classified advertisements away from the domain of print. It’s not the blogosphere’s fault for writing and spreading news for free. It’s not the market’s fault for turning journalism upside down… It’s not even the sales reps’ fault for not selling enough ads to keep newspapers afloat. All of that stuff is on us, the journalists. It’s our fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“We got complacent and stopped evolving”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/112082907_8c282f0761_z.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/112082907_8c282f0761_z.png?w=210&amp;amp;h=140" alt="" title="112082907_8c282f0761_z" width="210" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it the fault of journalists? In Zaveri’s view — one I happen to share — too many newspapers and other publications that initially grew to dominate a market based on their connection to specific community of readers have lost that connection. In many cases, they have grown too comfortable with their market position and their (former) control over the machinery of the news. And that machinery &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/08/25/the-twitter-effect-we-are-all-members-of-the-media-now/"&gt;has now been dispersed to the point where anyone can function as a journalist&lt;/a&gt; if they wish, and can even create their own newspaper. Says Zaveri:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our job was to report the news, and we did that. But we got complacent, and we stopped evolving, and soon the concept of a news article became far removed from what you, as a person, valued. Now we find ourselves in an awkward position where an indispensable component of democracy is slipping away, and we’re scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaveri also also offers some potential remedies for what he calls the loss of trust that has afflicted most of the mainstream press (and while he doesn’t mention it, this loss of trust was evident long before the Internet started eating away at the media’s earning power). What they boil down to, he says, is “transparency and accountability: the free flow of information required to keep democracy alive [so that] individuals can make active, smart decisions about the world they live in.” Among his prescriptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newspapers need to be transparent&lt;/strong&gt;: “You need to know as much as possible about how they get their money, where it goes and why… you need to know who the editors are, where they come from and what they value.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalists need to be out in the community&lt;/strong&gt;: “We need to hold public meetings where you can come and talk to us about what we do and tell us what you like and what you don’t so that we can be better. We need to better serve you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to help you take action&lt;/strong&gt;. “An article means nothing if it doesn’t help you make some sort of decision in your life, so every article needs to be coupled with instructions on how you… can make your life, your family’s life and your society’s life better.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how does a newspaper build trust?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s as good a list of recommendations as I could come up with, and not bad for a student editor whose entire journalistic career consists of a semester spent as an intern at the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; and a summer working at &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;. And what’s more, Zaveri didn’t mention Twitter or Facebook or blogs — although I think his message of getting to know readers and letting them get to know you implies the use of such tools. That’s why it’s such a shame that so many news organizations &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/07/01/newspapers-and-social-media-still-mostly-doing-it-wrong/"&gt;restrict their employees’ use of those tools to the point where they are unlikely to have much impact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, some newspapers are trying to do the kinds of things that Zaveri describes in his call to arms: the Journal-Register Corp. chain, for example, has &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/12/02/for-newspapers-the-future-is-now-digital-must-be-first/"&gt;not only embraced social media as a way of connecting with its readers&lt;/a&gt; but is also experimenting with a “community newsroom” at the Register-Citizen, where residents can come and have coffee, use the Internet and sit in on editorial meetings. And they aren’t the only ones doing this: the Winnipeg Free Press in Manitoba (&lt;del&gt;owned by Postmedia&lt;/del&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/09/chats-dont-have-to-be-online-a-newspaper-finds-success-with-its-downtown-news-cafe/"&gt;has also opened up a community newsroom in that city’s downtown core&lt;/a&gt;, where two members of the staff work and interact with readers in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts are more than just touchy-feely attempts to look more open, I think — or at least they should be. As Zaveri rightly notes in his piece, building trust with readers could be one of the few remaining competitive advantages that newspapers have left, so they had better start getting good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

However, being first on a story usually matters far more to journalists than it does to anyone else.&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scoops can be great, but prizing them blindly skews the priorities of a news organization badly—to the detriment of their audiences, communities, and their own credibility…&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Amy Gahran&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/comments/20110823_/"&gt;Last week I explored&lt;/a&gt; how news orgs can help build a healthy local news ecosystem (as well as their own reputation/credibility, and ultimately their long-term business model) by linking out to related coverage by other news organizations.
	
	&lt;p&gt;This practice contradicts ingrained newsroom culture, which typically eschews promoting or even acknowledging work by “the competition” wherever possible. 
	
	&lt;p&gt;The scoop is another scion of the competitive news mindset. There are two kinds of scoops:
	&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The exclusive.&lt;/b&gt; Uncovering a unique story through enterprise; something that probably would otherwise have gone unreported. These scoops are great for everyone. Exclusives broaden the universe of topics covered in the news, and so can enrich public discourse.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being first.&lt;/b&gt; Disseminating news of an issue or event before any other news outlet. The classic case is the frenzy among major news orgs to be the “first to call” a presidential election. But it can also mean being the first to report on a polluted site, or a lawsuit, or any definable newsworthy issue. This distinction, I’d argue, has not only ceased to be meaningful—most of the time it’s an outright red herring that damages the quality of news and ill-serves audiences. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direct risk of the scoop mentality is when news organizations rush to publish information that hasn’t been sufficiently vetted. For instance, several major news organizations &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/media-faces-scrutiny-inaccurate-gifffords-reports-20110109-070943-526.html"&gt;falsely reported the death of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords&lt;/a&gt; in the hours after she was shot. 

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a more insidious danger to the news ecosystem: The idea that being first to cover a story is sufficient “reward” which negates the need for additional “recognition.” This assumes that the purpose of linking to related coverage is to somehow reward or concede to those authors/publishers, rather than to better serve audiences and communities. That is, over-valuing the time-based scoop can be used to rationalize/justify negative behavior (not linking to related coverage from elsewhere).

&lt;p&gt;This perspective was expressed in a note I got from Nate Seltenrich, a reporter for California’s East Bay Express, and which I quoted in &lt;a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/comments/20110823_/"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; last week.

&lt;p&gt;Seltenrich wrote an August feature story for EBX about local urban farming on contaminated properties, which included information on a small brownfield remediation project in Oakland—the same project covered extensively in a June article by Oakland Local, a hyperlocal new startup I co-founded. I asked Seltenrich why his story did not note or link to our coverage or that of the New York Times (which in July also covered the same cleanup project in a story featured on its home page).

&lt;p&gt;He replied, in part: “My story would’ve been the same whether your story existed or not. And either way, you had the scoop, and that’s a feather in your cap.”

&lt;p&gt;The trouble with that logic is: One story, by one news outlet, is rarely enough to cover any topic well. More coverage, as long as it’s done well, is always better.

&lt;p&gt;News audiences have always known this—which is why nearly everyone regularly consults multiple sources of news and information. So when a news organization, by failing to link to related stories elsewhere, persists in conveying the fallacy that theirs is the only or best coverage of a topic, &lt;i&gt;their audience knows this is not true.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting caught in a lie, even one of omission, is pretty bad for journalism. It undermines trust.

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore: Unless you’re talking about a true news exclusive, whoever is first to cover a particular story probably doesn’t matter at all to the news audience. So why should that distinction be a “feather in the cap” of any news organization?

&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand it, the goal of a news organization is to serve its audience/community and to sustain itself in that endeavor. “Beating the competition” in terms of timing (rather than enterprise) does little to advance that goal—and in fact, overfocusing on being first can distract news orgs from their true goal.

&lt;p&gt;If the audience doesn’t care who’s first, nobody in the news business can truly win on that basis.

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, cooperation between news organizations (including cross-linking) does serve communities and can help sustain news venues, as a recent &lt;a href="http://www.cct.org/sites/cct.org/files/CNM_LinkingAudiences_0611.pdf"&gt;Chicago Community Trust report&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates. 

&lt;p&gt;News is an ecosystem, and news organizations that prize service-oriented cooperation above blind competition are more likely to thrive and adapt. This shift reinforces the core values of journalism—what we need to change is the benchmarks by which we gauge our success.

&lt;p&gt;The time-based scoop is so 20th century. We should let it go.

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Christoph Trappe, product developer and former newspaper journalist, also believes that time-based scoops don’t matter to news audiences. See his &lt;a href="http://www.christophsblog.com/2011/07/scoops-measuring-stick/"&gt;July blog post&lt;/a&gt;.
