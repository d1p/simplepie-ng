  <subtitle>This is my &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; documenting strange and disputed borders around the World. One might think the majority of borders would be stable by now. But in fact, there are long-standing disputes, new claims, and problems created by past colonizing forces that appear in the news almost everyday. Some of the most interesting are the result of simple mistakes or strange decisions.

Some of the maps focus on border disputes between two or more countries. These seem to be most frequently about claims to natural resources but are sometimes nothing more than an issue of national pride. More recently, the concept of &amp;quot;Google Wars&amp;quot; have started to surface where incorrect placement of international borders on Google's Maps product has resulted in countries practically declaring war on each other. Strange borders also come about from the creation of treaties where borders are described verbally first and then mapped later. This tends to work when there are natural borders such as rivers, oceans, or mountain ridges. Difficulties arise when the reality on the ground turns out to be different than what was described in the treaty. 

When I started the series, I wasn't sure how many examples I would find. I thought I might run out of examples. But I always have several examples in my backlog and I stumble on new ones all the time. As long as lines are drawn in the sand, there will be someone else disputing it.</subtitle>

    <title>A Map of the Fractal Border Between India &amp; Bangladesh Near Haldibari</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/6168075499/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Fractal Border Between India &amp;amp; Bangladesh Near Haldibari&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6168075499_c05aa2fd79_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Fractal Border Between India &amp;amp; Bangladesh Near Haldibari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had trouble finding background information about this strange section of border between India and Bangladesh. As you can partly tell from the lack of relationship between the rivers, the border here does not seem to be based on geographic features. As far as I can tell from the satellite images, the land here is fairly flat and mostly farm land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, the border here is the result of some strange decision making. It is hard to know from a glance which side is India and which side is Bangledesh. My original guess was that it was part of the difficult and tumultuous partition of India into Pakistan, India and Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). But apparently the complexity originates much earlier when the area was under the rule of two different kings. According to Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The enclaves were part of the high stake card or chess games centuries ago between two regional kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The specific reasons behind the border's strange path is possible to see in the places where the border creates almost a complete loop in it's already erratic course. When I zoom in on these spots, they seem to encircle a single estate or perhaps, a small village. I'd love to know the specifics of how the border-drawing process unfolded. If anyone knows some of the specifics, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>A Map of the Border Between the USA and Canada as it Passes Through the Town of Derby Line, Vermont</title>

    <content type="html">			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/people/amapple/&quot;&gt;amproehl&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/6065637719/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Border Between the USA and Canada as it Passes Through the Town of Derby Line, Vermont&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6085/6065637719_ebe4d6937e_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Border Between the USA and Canada as it Passes Through the Town of Derby Line, Vermont&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Derby Line Vermont begins with a mistake and ends with an intentional act inspired by the mistake. For most of it's 2000 mile length, the USA / Canada border follows the 45th parallel. I have already written about the exception at the Northwest Angle in Minnesota that was created due to an error about how far North the Mississippi River went. Here in Vermont, the surveyors were intending to follow the 45th parallel, they were just a bit sloppy in their work and unintentionally marked the line too far North. The Town developed along the line along with it's sister town, Stanstead Quebec on the Canadian side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometime in the latter part of the 1800s, Carlos Haskell an American met Martha Stewart (not that Martha Stewart) who had grown up on the Canadian side. They married and settled in Derby Line. Sometime around the turn of the century, they decided to honor the town's erratic border by building a library and opera house right on the border so that Americans and Canadians would both be able to use it. If I were erecting such a monument, I think I would have aligned the building so the border passed symbolically through the middle. Not so with the Haskell Free Library as it came to be known. The border passes diagonally through the building. The line is marked in the floor (you can see pictures of the interior at the CLUI link below). The line was requested by the insurance companies so they would pay only for damages to their part of the building.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the library, the reading room is on the US side while the stacks are on the Canadian side. In the upstairs opera house, most of the seats are on the US side while the stage is on the Canadian side. This has prompted locals to call it alternatively, &amp;quot;the only library in the USA with no books&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the only opera house in the USA with no stage&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having such a small town straddles an international border invites a different perspective on international relations. The Center for Land Use Interpretation has an essay about the town on their website. The author makes the comment that two kids having a game of catch across the border would be perfectly legal. However, each time someone caught the ball they would have to walk over to the customs office to declare the ball.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the Haskell's built the library, their intention was that people from both sides of the border would be able to use it. There are doors on the Canadian and USA side to enable this. The town also has several small roads that cross seamlessly across the border. All of this is threatened in the post-9/11 world because open, fuzzy borders make the US Department of Customs and Immigration nervous. There have been talks to tighten the links but, according to Wikipedia at least, the Haskell Free Library remains free and open to American and Canadian alike.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/6020083102/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Strange Borders Between Pakistan and India around the Siachen Glacier&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/6020083102_69a7ec6ca4_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Strange Borders Between Pakistan and India around the Siachen Glacier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Siachen Glacier is part of a larger territory dispute between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have had a significant military presence here (mostly along the Saltoro Ridge) since April 1984. The conflict has been called, The Highest Battleground in the World&amp;quot;. Pakistan and India spend upwards of $1 million dollars a day to keep troops amassed along such demanding  and inhospitable terrain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strangeness of the border is largely due to the history of the conflict with an important contributing role by the USA. The majority of the border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir is defined by what is known as the &amp;quot;Line of Control&amp;quot;... essentially the cease fire line that was negotiated and agreed to by both sides. The Line of Control is the dashed line in the lower left area of the map. In that agreement the border extended only to a point known as NJ9842 (shown on the map). The geography north of that point was considered too mountainous, cold and inhospitable to be of interest to either party. So the agreement  fixed the NJ9842 point and then added the clause, &amp;quot;and thence north to the glaciers&amp;quot;. This description actually worked for many years because the area was of little strategic interest. Sometime in the 1980s, the US military created a map of the area that continued the border all the way to the Karakoram Pass. This effectively gave the otherwise unclaimed territory to Pakistan. Around the same time, Pakistan had also started to grant climbing permits to K2, the Himilayan mountain known as the hardest mountain to climb. When the Indian Army learned of this, they immediately assembled a military expedition to the Siachen Glacier. The glacier and the surrounding mountains range from 19,000 to 22,000 feet above sea level. The whole area is extremely cold and heavily glaciated. It is sometimes called The Third Pole. Never-the-less both Pakistani and Indian troops have chosen to remain amassed along the Saltoro Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most conflicts seem to start when one party draws a border that another doesn't like. In this case, It was the absence of a clear border that started all the fuss. Both India and Pakistan realize that the standoff is an exercise in futility and hope to end it. There have been discussions between the two countries but none have proven successful.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5971939245/&quot; title=&quot;The Border Between Egypt &amp;amp; Sudan at the Wadi Halfa Salient&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6140/5971939245_de889af991_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;The Border Between Egypt &amp;amp; Sudan at the Wadi Halfa Salient&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the 52 villages in the map? No? That's because they were flooded by the damning of the Nile and the creation of Lake Nasser (known as Lake Nubia in Sudan). The strange bulge (known as a salient in cartography parlance) along this portion of the Egypt-Sudan border was originally surrounded the villages that dotted this section of the Nile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt and Sudan have 3 areas of land under dispute and a fourth that neither country claims. The original 1899 border between the two countries ran straight along the 22nd North Parallel line with no deviations. In 1902, Britain amended the border to account for some tribal and administrative issues. There were 52 villages where the Nile River crossed the 22nd Parallel. It was decided that these villages would be easier to maintain from the Sudanese side of the border so the border was changed to how it appears above. There appears to be a stretch of rough and desolate terrain North of this area that separates it from the next set of villages in current maps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt now claims this area along with the other two areas (Bir Tawil and the Hala'ib Triangle)  in dispute. They maintain a military presence in the other two but not here as there is little of interest to guard. My map of Bir Tawil and the Hala'ib Triangle is here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4038420915/in/set-72157616310862857&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4038420915/in/set-721576163...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've also made a map of the area showing the location of the former towns and ruins based on a 1953 British survey map. That map is here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5973317950/in/photostream&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5973317950/in/photostream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5909768470/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Border Between New York &amp;amp; New Jersey on Ellis Island&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5120/5909768470_004f5ef103_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Border Between New York &amp;amp; New Jersey on Ellis Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For so many immigrants, stepping off a ship onto Ellis Island was synonymous with arrival in New York City. Many years later, after the immigration station had closed and the buildings lie decaying, the US Supreme Court would decide that Ellis Island, with one small exception, was part of New Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original colonial land grant for New Jersey defined it's border as the waterline of New York Bay and the Hudson River, meaning that the water and all islands within it belonged to New York. Most treaties place borders in the middle of natural borders like lakes and rivers. New Jersey tried to fight the claim starting in the early 1800s. In 1834 a compact between New York and New Jersey and ratified by the US Congress set the border as the middle of the Hudson River. This put jurisdiction and bragging rights over the island completely in New Jersey which they were quick to assert and claim in a court filing. The case went all the way up to the Supreme Court. New York fought hard but in the end was awarded only the small 3.3 acre section of the original island. Since that border follows the island's original shoreline it appears quite random today and passes through the middle of numerous buildings. The majority of the current island (most of it created by landfill from the digging of New York City subway tunnels) is now officially part of the State of New Jersey. Payback for Jersey's actions and perhaps the best argument for custody came from then Mayor Rudy Giuliani who remarked that his Italian father &amp;quot;never intended to emigrate to New Jersey.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the pre-colonial days, Ellis Island was one of several, oyster-rich islands on the western tidal flats of Upper New York Bay. Other nearby islands included Liberty Island (originally Bedloe's Island and site of the Statue of Liberty) and Black Tom Island (named after an African-American that lived on the island according to local legend). Before becoming known as Ellis Island, it had been known as Dyre's Island, Bucking, Gibbet (Gibbet's being cages for displaying the dead bodies of convicted pirates), and lastly, Little Oyster Island. Samuel Ellis acquired the island during the American Revolution and first tried to sell it in 1785. New York State leased the island in 1794 until the Federal Government bought the island in 1808 and began expanding it before opening it as an immigration station in 1892.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5875576341/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the very strange border(s) between the Netherlands and Belgium at Baarle-Nassau&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5141/5875576341_09c453736b_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the very strange border(s) between the Netherlands and Belgium at Baarle-Nassau&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into excruciating detail about allegiances to dukes, lords and kings, it is hard to explain the origin if this rather unique set of international borders. Suffice it to say that the land was bought, sold, and loaned through many generations to the point where the current land owners felt allegiance to either the Dutch or Belgian side of the border. When it came time to make the border official as art of the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht, 5732 separate parcels of land had to have their nationality laid down separately. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately the borders are all friendly. In fact, there were several opportunities to clean things up in subsequent treaties and negotiations that the residents refused to act on. The residents of Baarle-Nassau seem to enjoy their quirky borders and the ramifications they present.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is at least one border line that passes directly through a building. With borders sometimes passing through the middle of properties, taxes were sometimes a challenge in the area. To clarify matters, the Dutch government set the rule that taxes would be paid to the country your front door opened up on. With taxes being higher on one side of the border than the other, the ruling was an invitation for creative renovations. If shop keepers didn't like the taxes they were paying, they were known to just move their front door so that it opened on the other country. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The primary border between the two countries lies about 5 kilometers south of Baarle-Nassau... just a short distance beyond the bottom of this map. What is truly unique about this set of borders is that it happens completely inside the Netherlands border. These are Belgian exclaves inside the Netherlands. But even more amazing is that there are Dutch exclaves completely inside the Belgian exclaves. The smallest plot, identified as H12 is just 28,331 square feet (a bit more than 1/2 an acre) in size. With all of the dysfunction between Israel and the Palestinians over land swaps, it is nice to see two countries getting along so well that there's no need to swap.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a map of Kashmir with all disputed borders tinted red to highlight them. I started the map with the intent to explore the border dispute between India and Pakistan but as I started to create the map, I realized the area included multiple areas of disputes. The Norther Areas is the largest area highlighted in red. These are considered by most international bodies to be part of Pakistan. Never the less, India claims the territory as its own while acknowledging that the area is administered by Pakistan. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the right is the territory of Aksai Chin. This area is largely an uninhabited salt desert but is still an ongoing dispute between India and China. As I started to work on the map, I learned that the dispute is actually five separate disputes wrapped up in one. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the most interesting story behind the various border disputes depicted here is the area known as the Siachen Glacier near the upper middle part of this map.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5748629678/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Strange Kentucky Border at the New Madrid Bend in the Mississippi River&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5748629678_9ae2a1c127_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Strange Kentucky Border at the New Madrid Bend in the Mississippi River&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The border of Kentucky at what is known as &amp;quot;The New Madrid Bend&amp;quot; owes it's strangeness to the serpentine path of the Mississippi River. The River was supposed to define the western edge of the state of Kentucky and the Southern edge of Missouri. The result is an exclave peninsula of land in Kentucky that is completely surrounded by Missouri and Tennessee. To drive here from the rest of Kentucky, you must leave the state, drive through Tennessee and come back into Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This spot along the Mississippi River is also the site of several historic events. Most notable is the &amp;quot;Battle of Island Ten&amp;quot; in the Civil War where Confederate Troops occupied Island Ten (now mostly part of the shoreline at the southern-most part of the bend in the map). The plan was to block and defeat the Union Troops coming down the Mississippi from the North at a slow point in the river. The plan didn't work so well. Although this was a potentially vulnerable spot in the river, Island Ten was also remote and could only be re-supplied by a single road through swamp and marsh land (the Union eventually succeeded in cutting off Confederate supply lines).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mark Twain wrote about the area in his book, &amp;quot;Life on the Mississippi&amp;quot; and in particular about the feud between the Darnell and Watson families. One family was from Kentucky, the other from Tennessee. According to Twain, the two families attended the same church at what is/was known as Compromise Landing. The Church straddled the border between Kentucky and Tennessee enabling the families to walk up the aisle on their side of the church and attend services without stepping into the other state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, New Madrid was the epicenter for several of the strongest Earthquakes ever felt in the United States in 1811 and 1812. According to Wikipedia, the earthquakes were so disruptive that they reportedly reversed the course of the Mississippi River around the area.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5608351005/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Strange Border Between Sweden and Finland on Märket Fyr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5608351005_8d842b5da6_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Strange Border Between Sweden and Finland on Märket Fyr&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I not hear about this border sooner. An island less than 1200 feet long with a border that takes more twists and turns than a Stieg Larsson novel. It is now possible to walk the length of this short island and cross an international border three times. However, despite the strangeness of the border, Sweden and Finland have always agreed on shared ownership of the skerry (a Norse word for rock in the sea) and the serpentine border results from an effort to correct Finland's accidental siting of the island's lighthouse on the Swedish side of the border. The island is otherwise a textbook example of international cooperation and agreement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Market Island or Reef (Market Fyr in Swedish) is part of the larger Aland Island chain that lies between Sweden and Finland. According to Wikipedia, ownership of the islands has been shared ever since the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809. Prior to the building of the lighthouse, the border between the two countries passed down the middle of the skerry so that half the island's land mass was in Sweden and half was in Finland. When it was discovered that Finland had accidentally built the lighthouse on Sweden's half of the island, a fix was necessary. The resulting zig-zag border allows the lighthouse to be in Finland while retaining the 50/50 split in land area and avoids any changes to the maritime border. Any alterations of that would have resulted in a change in fishing rights… Perhaps the one thing that might have caused strife between the two herring-loving nations. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5168933630/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of &amp;quot;The Northwest Angle&amp;quot; Border Between the USA and Canada&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/5168933630_394fb48e37_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of &amp;quot;The Northwest Angle&amp;quot; Border Between the USA and Canada&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no dispute over this one, it's just your garden variety error. It stems from a bad map and a negotiated treaty between England and the United States. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The error created several unique geographic situations including,&lt;br /&gt;
-- the fact that it is the only section of the Continental U.S. Border that extends above the 49th parallel, the latitude that marks the majority of the US border with Canada. Even Maine, which optically appears further North on some projections remains south of the 49th Parallel. &lt;br /&gt;
-- it creates a situation where driving from one spot in the Minnesota to another spot in Minnesota requires a 63 mile drive into Canada and then back into the U.S. even though the two spots are just 18 miles apart as the crow flies.&lt;br /&gt;
-- It is one of only four places in the continental U.S. where a section of a state (other than an island) is disconnected from the rest of the state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the Wikepedia entry,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Treaty of Paris, concluded between the United States and Great Britain at the end of the American Revolutionary War, stated that the boundary between U.S. territory and the British possessions to the north would run &amp;quot;...through the Lake of the Woods to the northwestern most point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That all sounds pretty simple and clear as far as border descriptions go. The only problem was that the line could extend West all the way to the Pacific Ocean and never run into the Mississippi River. The source of the Mississippi, Lake Itaska lies almost 150 miles south of where it was expected to be. The error started with the Mitchell Map, a map that was in widespread use at the time. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the problem was corrected by the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 it created a chunk of land that is part of Minnesota but cut off from the rest of the state. That land is called, The Northwest Angle, or simply, &amp;quot;The Angle&amp;quot; by locals. It is sparsely populated and most of the land is under the stewardship of a local Indian tribe. The immigration and customs office for The Angle is actually a phone booth with a video phone in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/5162963995/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Kuril Islands Border Dispute Between Japan and Russia&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1226/5162963995_9c4c250a75_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Kuril Islands Border Dispute Between Japan and Russia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispute between Japan and Russia is over the southern-most islands in the Kuril Island chain, specifically Iturup, Kunashir, and Shikotan Islands, and the Habomai Rocks. The current dispute dates from the aftermath of WWII when the Allies dictated terms to Germany and Japan. Treaties that reference ownership of the islands include the Yalta Agreement, The San Francisco Treaty, the Potsdam Declaration, and the Treaty of Portsmouth. None of these treaties however seem capable of resolving the dispute. They either fail to describe the specific border, which islands are included or, as is the case with the San Francisco Treaty, the treaty was not signed by both Russia and Japan. The San Francisco Treaty is also the source of the dispute over nearby Sakhalin Island. Reading snippets from some of these treaties and seeing all the problems they cause makes me think I could be a treaty writer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though not a new dispute, the Kuril Islands were in the news again on November 1st, 2010 when Russian President Medvedev visited Kunashir Island, the island closest to Japan's undisputed island of Hokkaido. The video I saw on CNN of Medvedev taking pictures of the coastline made him look more like a tourist than a global leader throwing salt in Japan's eyes. The message to Japan was quite clear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since Japan is an island nation, The Kuril Islands seem like a natural continuation of its other, undisputed islands. Of course Russia might say that they are the continuation of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Japan is not asking for all of them... only 3 plus some rocks. And since Japan is small and Russia is so big, the part of me that cheers for the underdog wants to say, &amp;quot;come on Russia, show some love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Border Dispute with a Sense of Humor - A Map of the Canada / Denmark Border at Hans Island</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4973328768/&quot; title=&quot;Border Dispute with a Sense of Humor - A Map of the Canada / Denmark Border at Hans Island&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/4973328768_d25efc03fb_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;Border Dispute with a Sense of Humor - A Map of the Canada / Denmark Border at Hans Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hans Island lies smack in the middle of the Kennedy Channel section of Nares Strait. This places it on the border between Canada's Ellesmere Island and the Kingdom of Denmark's Greenland Territory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1973, a treaty between the two nations plotted 127 points delimiting the agreed upon border. Although the treaty did not connect the dots, points 122 and 123 go right down the center of the island when connected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hans Island appears to be of little strategic or commercial interest but this has never stopped nations from starting a tug of war over sovereignty. Luckily, even though there are real emotions, the actions seem to be light hearted, if not satirical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1984, Denmark's Minister of Greenland planted a Danish Flag on the island along with a bottle of cognac.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Canada responded with newspaper headlines announcing, &amp;quot;Canada being invaded&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Denmark massing troops on Canadian Territory&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google War&lt;br /&gt;
In 2005, a &amp;quot;Google War&amp;quot; was started with individuals from both countries placing ads on Google declaring Hans Island as Canadian or Danish territory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ads are no longer live but a Google search today turned up links for, &amp;quot;The Hans Island Liberation Front&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hands off Hans Island&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Radio Free Hans Island&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;Free Hans Island from Canadian Oppression&amp;quot; website. The last link is a fun read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's nice to see a lingering border dispute happen with a sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4966042259/&quot; title=&quot;&amp;quot;Betweenity&amp;quot; - A Map of the Brazil / Uruguay Border Dispute over Brazilian Island&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4966042259_37f13f8153_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Betweenity&amp;quot; - A Map of the Brazil / Uruguay Border Dispute over Brazilian Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's strange that the island being disputed is called, Brazilian Island as the name makes it sound like there's no dispute at all. Information on the roots of the dispute are scarce. The island is at the confluence of the Quarai, Cuareim, and Invernada rivers. The rivers form a tripoint border with Argentina but the Argentinian border is not under dispute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an essay titled, &amp;quot;Islands in Between&amp;quot;, Godfrey Baldacchino offers the following observation, &amp;quot;We should not be surprised: borders, in spite of conventional wisdom and official intent, are often porous, permeable features: they are liminal spaces with osmotic properties, important tools in a contemporary game of economic prosperity, military strategy or national security. Even here, islands ‘in between’can play a key role.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The same article quotes the Former Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago as saying that his country operates in a state of &amp;quot;betweenity&amp;quot; having been claimed by more than one nation. I like that word. It would have been a good way to describe my career on more than one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4324691302/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Senkaku Islands Territory Dispute Between China and Japan&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2798/4324691302_b85b058a89_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Senkaku Islands Territory Dispute Between China and Japan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the discovery of fossil fuels would make two countries argue over what had previously been described as &amp;quot;terra nullius&amp;quot; (vacant territory), and &amp;quot;barron rocks&amp;quot;. The Senkaku Islands are made up of 8 land masses... five uninhabited islands and three rocks. What lies underneath is what makes them suddenly so interesting.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The islands lie 120 nautical miles west of Okinawa and North East of Taiwan. The dispute is primarily between Japan and China but China needs the proximity and history of Taiwan to bolster it's claim so Taiwan is part of the dispute by proxy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Japan claims the islands as it's own discovery and spoils from the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseky it signed with China after the Sino-Japanese War. This included the island of Taiwan which was returned to China after World War II. The United States continued to administer the Senkaku Islands until 1972 when it handed administrative control over to Japan along with Okinawa.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
China's (and Taiwan's) renewed interest in the islands started in 1970 (concidentally just two years after the potential for oil was discovered by Japan). Their claim centers around the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki which was declared void after World War II as one of several &amp;quot;unequal treaties&amp;quot;. That treaty does not mention the Senkaku Islands but did cover Taiwan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dispute continues to this day. The United Nation's &amp;quot;Law of the Sea&amp;quot; gives nations control over a 200 nautical mile &amp;quot;exclusive economic zone&amp;quot; (EEZ)  surrounding their territory. EEZ's include seabed and submarine resources like oil and natural gas. The border in the lower right is China's claim to it's exclusive economic zone and extends out from Taiwan's border to the south-west. The border in the top left is Japan's EEZ claim and extends out from it's undisputed islands including Okinawa. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not willing to wait till the matter is formally resolved, China built a natural gas drilling platform outside of Japan's claimed territory but which is capable of drilling into the disputed area to extract gas. Skirmishes and posturing continue. As recently as 2008, there have been altercations between Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese ships circling the islands to assert their claims.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4201799047/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of Aksai Chin and the Border Dispute Between China and India&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/4201799047_df865a76b6_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of Aksai Chin and the Border Dispute Between China and India&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aksai Chin is a high-altitude desert, virtually uninhabited, and has few natural resources and yet it remains one of two long-standing border disputes between China and India... the other being Arunachal Pradesh (see my other map covering this dispute). China remains in control of Aksai Chin while India controls Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In 1954, India noticed that China had built &amp;quot;Chinese National Highway 219&amp;quot; through Aksai Chin and was now claiming the region as its own.  Indian Maps prior to 1954 had been quite vague about borders and territory in this region. Never the less, concerns over the road and newly-claimed territory were a key factor leading up the 1962 Sino-Indian War.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ironically, although the dispute is between India and China, the source of the dispute has more to do with relations between Russia and Britain. The earliest maps detailing various proposed borders date from around 1865 and relate to a strategy by the British to establish defensible border states between its colonial pursuits and Russia's interests in expanding to the South. It later became known that China was showing interest in the area and the British felt that having an ally like China in the area was preferable to Russia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the maps I've used as reference, the dispute is actually five separate disputes... five border disputes for the price of one!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4108612740/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Border Dispute Between India and China over Arunachal Pradesh&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2687/4108612740_73dd01589b_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Border Dispute Between India and China over Arunachal Pradesh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arunachal Pradesh is the Eastern-most state in India and is bordered by China, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It has been in the news this week because of a controversial visit by the Dalai Lama to Tawang, a Buddhist outpost in the state near the border with Bhutan and China. Disputes over the land go back decades and are likely to continue. India recognizes the border drawn by the British in 1914 and included land that Tibet ceded to the then British-ruled India in a 1914 treaty. This border follows the &amp;quot;McMahon Line&amp;quot; shown on the map. China says that Tawang was once part of Tibet. Since China seized Tibet in 1951, it feels its territorial claims should extend to Tawang and the state of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to Wikipedia, Arunachal means, &amp;quot;land of the dawn lit mountains&amp;quot; in Sanskrit, a reference to its location in Eastern reaches of India. If China ever gains ownership of the territory it will have to consider a name change to something like, &amp;quot;land of the mountains lit near the end of the day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/4038420915/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Bir Tawil &amp;quot;Triangle&amp;quot; and Related Territory Dispute Between Egypt and the Sudan&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4038420915_01fdd8547a_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Bir Tawil &amp;quot;Triangle&amp;quot; and Related Territory Dispute Between Egypt and the Sudan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bir Tawil Triangle is likely the only unclaimed territory in the world. It is the result of a territorial dispute between Egypt and Sudan over the nearby Hala'ib Triangle. The original 1899 border between the two countries followed a straight line along the 22 degrees North latitude line. However the British drew up a new administrative border in 1902 that strays from the original border in several spots. The revised border gave an Egyptian tribe access to a well and grazing lands at Bir Tawil (Bir Tawil means water well). It also gave Sudan administrative control over the area marked Hala'ib Triangle because the dominant tribes in the region were Sudanese in origin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, both countries lay claim to the Hala'ib Triangle since it is a large territory and borders the Red Sea. The problem comes from the intersection of the two borders at the Bir Tawil Triangle (actually a trapezoid). By claiming the original 1899 border to get Hala'ib, Egypt makes no claim on Bir Tawil which lies south of this border. Sudan pursues Hala'ib by claiming the 1902 border which leaves Bir Tawil as Egyptian territory. So in their pursuit of larger gains, each country makes no claim on the secondary territory. No other country can claim it as it is landlocked between Egypt and Sudan. There was a third territory adjusted in the 1902 adjustment called the Wadi Halfa Salient. That adjustment was made to assign several villages to Sudan who were better able to manage them from the South. Although the border remains, there is no territorial interest here as the villages now lie under the waters of the (manmade) Lake Nassar.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/3583667471/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Georgia / Tennessee Border Dispute Over Water Rights&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3583667471_d393a5c521_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Georgia / Tennessee Border Dispute Over Water Rights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many historians and economists who say that the battles of the future will be fought over water not oil. Though so far only a battle of words, one is already brewing between Georgia and Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original border between the two states was supposed to be drawn along the 35th Parallel. The actual border that was staked out was about a mile south of the where it was supposed to be. There are different stories as to why this happened but one was that the terrain where the border should have been drawn was difficult. It could have also been a simple matter of instrument accuracy. Whatever the case, the border was staked out and  a map was drawn with the border more or less where it lies today. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The error was eventually caught but by then the wrong border had been around long enough that it had become the accepted state line by residents living on either side. Georgia has a water shortage. Atlanta is sometimes called, &amp;quot;The Las Vegas of the American Southeast&amp;quot; for its habit of living beyond its means when it comes to water. If the border had been drawn accurately, a small part of the Tennessee River would lie inside Georgia, giving it access to much more water than it has today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Georgia politicians have made serious proposals to correct the border in order to gain access to the Tennessee River. But such a change would require approval from Congress and Tennessee... something that's unlikely to happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the border was drawn, the work was a back-breaking slog. The surveyor had to fluidly move between an abstract representation on a drafting table and the literal placing of stakes in the ground through whatever terrain presented itself. Human error was to be expected. I'm not sure what is funnier, the 1.1 mile &amp;quot;oops&amp;quot; of the original survey or the efforts of today's &amp;quot;thirsty&amp;quot; Georgia politicians to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Order a few drinks at Restaurant Kalin in Slovenia and you are likely to end up needing to cross the border to go to the bathroom. That's because Restaurant Kalin lies directly on the border between Croatia and Slovenia. The tables lie in one country, the bathroom in the other. The restaurant has painted a yellow line down the middle of the restaurant to mark the border. The border originally followed a wandering stream.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amapple/3526970977/&quot; title=&quot;A Map of the Uganda / Kenya Border Dispute Over Migingo Island&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2055/3526970977_cc9a3bea37_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;A Map of the Uganda / Kenya Border Dispute Over Migingo Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect this map to change over the next few days as it is the best representation I could make after reading many stories and reviewing a bunch of maps on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uganda and Kenya have been arguing over who owns the small island, barely visible at the center of the map above. The dispute has been brewing over the last few years and has finally led to a joint survey that is being conducted this week by both countries with results expected as soon as this week (May 15th). As far as I can tell, the dispute comes down to whether the islands are East or West of the Western tip of Pyramid Island just to the South. Pyramid Island is referenced in the constitutions of both countries. From the Western shore of Pyramid Island, the border line continues North to another island. If the shores of Migingo Island are West of that line then the island is in Uganda, otherwise, they are in Kenya. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have drawn the islands as being just barely in Kenya as the most recent press and other descriptions seem to be leaning towards a situation where the island is in Kenya but the water just West of the Island is in Uganda. This would be ironic because the source of the dispute is fishing rights over the dwindling Nile Perch that are still in abundance around the island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The island was uninhabited until at least 1991 when two Kenyan fisherman say they set up residence. Uganda says that a Ugandan fisherman started living on the island in 2004 and had found the island abandoned. The island is about half the size of a football field and barely above water. It may have even been below water in previous years when the waters of Lake Victoria were higher. It is amazing to see the island itself because it is basically a large rock with a bunch of tin hacks that house the islands 1000 or so residents. There is barely any open space on the island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I plan to update the map once the surveyors complete theirs. Apologies in advance for any inaccuracies but I wanted to get the story out while it is still unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
