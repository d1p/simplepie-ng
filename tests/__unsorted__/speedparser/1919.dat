		<book_description><![CDATA[The story takes the form of a series of letters from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, a junior &quot;tempter&quot; named Wormwood, so as to advise him on methods of securing the damnation of a British man, known only as &quot;the Patient&quot;.<br/><br/>Screwtape holds an administrative post in the bureaucracy (&quot;Lowerarchy&quot;) of Hell, and acts as a mentor to Wormwood, the inexperienced tempter. In the body of the thirty-one letters which make up the book, Screwtape gives Wormwood detailed advice on various methods of undermining faith and promoting sin in the Patient, interspersed with observations on human nature and Christian doctrine. Wormwood and Screwtape live in a peculiarly morally reversed world, where individual benefit and greed are seen as the greatest good, and neither demon is capable of comprehending or acknowledging true human virtue when he sees it.]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[Douglas Gresham claims that Jack Lewis was the finest man and the best Christian he has ever known. Of course, Jack to Douglas is C. S. Lewis to the rest of the world. The informal address Gresham uses to refer to the great writer is indicative of the intimacy he shared with Lewis for a dozen years, living in England as Lewis's stepson.     <p>Jack's Life is an affectionate account of days now long gone. It is a personal memoir of a man who touched many in the classroom, even more with his pen, and made a significant, lasting, and eternal impression on one young man. Douglas Gresham is uniquely qualified to offer such an extraordinary portrait.</p>]]></book_description>

Soon Bilbo was drawn into their quest, facing evil orcs, savage wolves, giant spiders, and worse unknown dangers. Finally, it was Bilbo-alone and unaided-who had to confront the great dragon Smaug, the terror of an entire countryside . . .<br/><br/>This stirring adventure fantasy begins the tale of the hobbits that was continued by J.R.R. Tolkien in his bestselling epic <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[<p>THE MAGICIAN'S BOOK is the story of one reader's long, tumultuous relationship with C.S. Lewis'<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>. As a child, Laura Miller read and re-read <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> and its sequels countless times, and wanted nothing more that to find her own way to Narnia. In her skeptical teens, a casual reference to the Chronicles's Christian themes left her feeling betrayed and alienated from the stories she had come to know and trust. Years later, convinced that &quot;the first book we fall in love with shapes us every bit as much as the first person we fall in love with,&quot; Miller returns to Lewis's classic fantasies to see what mysteries Narnia still holds for adult eyes&#151;and is captured in an entirely new way. <p>In her search to uncover the source of these small books' mysterious power, Miller looks to their creator, Clive Staples Lewis. What she discovers is not the familiar, idealized image of the author, but a man who stands in stark contrast to his whimsical creation-scarred by a tragic and troubled childhood, Oxford educated, a staunch Christian, and a social conservative, armed with deep prejudices.<p>THE MAGICIAN'S BOOK is an intellectual adventure story, in which Miller travels to Lewis's childhood home in Ireland, the possible inspiration for Narnia's landscape; unfolds his intense friendship with J.R.R.Tolkien, a bond that led the two of them to create the greatest myth-worlds of modern times; and explores Lewis's influence on writers like Neil Gaiman, Jonathan Franzen, and Philip Pullman. Finally reclaiming Narnia &quot;for the rest of us,&quot; Miller casts the Chronicles as a profoundly literary creation, and the portal to a life-long adventure in books, art, and the imagination. Erudite, wide-ranging, and playful, THE MAGICIAN'S BOOK is for all who live in thrall to the magic of books.</p></p></p>]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[Why was Mrs. Olinski&#8217;s sixth grade academic bowl team so successful? And why had Mrs. Olinski chosen them in the first place?<p>Noah, Nadia, Ethan and Julian call themselves &#8220;The Souls.&#8221; Each has a story to tell, and within each of their stories is part of the answer. Listen to Noah&#8217;s tale of life in Century Village, Nadia&#8217;s story of turtle walks, Ethan&#8217;s accounts of high tea at the bed and breakfast inn, and Julian&#8217;s story about a dog that becomes a stage star. Taken together, their stories answer the first question, and when intertwined with the story of Mrs. Olinski and their astonishing academic bowl victories, they answer the second&#8211;and tell you much, much more.</p>]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[<p>Written during the dark hours immediately before and during the Second World War, C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em> is the first volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's <em>The Plague</em> and George Orwell's <em>1984</em> as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of the moral concerns. For the trilogy's central figure, C. S. Lewis created perhaps the most memorable character of his career, the brilliant, clear-eyed, and fiercely brave philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom. Appropriately, Lewis modeled Dr. Ransom after his dear friend J. R. R. Tolkien, for in the scope of its imaginative achievement and the totality of its vision of not one but two imaginary worlds, the Space Trilogy is rivaled in this century only by Tolkien's trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Readers who fall in love with Lewis's fantasy series The Chronicles of Namia as children unfailingly cherish his Space Trilogy as adults; it, too, brings to life strange and magical realms in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness. But in the many layers of its allegory, and the sophistication and piercing brilliance of its insights into the human condition, it occupies a place among the English language's most extraordinary works for any age, and for all time. <p> <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em> introduces Dr. Ransom and chronicles his abduction by a megalomaniacal physicist and his accomplice via space ship to the planet Malacandra. The two men are in need of a human sacrifice and Dr. Ransom would seem to fit the bill. Dr. Ransom escapes upon landing, though, and goes on the run, a stranger in a land that, like Jonathan Swift's Lilliput, is enchanting in its difference from Earth and instructive in its similarity.</p></p>]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[In 1943 Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, <em>Mere Christianity</em> never flinches as it sets out a rational basis for Christianity and builds an edifice of compassionate morality atop this foundation. As Mr. Lewis clearly demonstrates, Christianity is not a religion of flitting angels and blind faith, but of free will, an innate sense of justice and the grace of God.]]></book_description>

One night he overhears his &quot;father&quot; offering to sell him as a slave, so Shasta makes a break and sets out for the North. He meets Bree, a talking horse who becomes his companion. On their way they encounter Aravis, a high-born girl escaping an arranged marriage, and her talking horse.

		<book_description><![CDATA[The Chronicles of Narnia have long been mainstays of children's literature, but when reread as an adult, can deliver an entirely new experience. In the midst of these stories about adventures in a magical land are profound spiritual and ethical messages.<p>A Year with Aslan will select the most thought-provoking and poignant passages from all seven books in the series, and provide reflective questions that get the heart of what matters most.</p>]]></book_description>
