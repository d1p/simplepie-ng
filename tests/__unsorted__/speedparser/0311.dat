	US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Israel of increasing isolation in the Middle East and said &amp;quot;Israeli leaders must restart negotiations with the Palestinians and work to restore relations with Egypt and Turkey.&amp;quot; Before landing in Israel Monday, Oct. 3, he also said:&amp;ldquo;Real security can only be achieved by both a strong diplomatic effort as well as a strong effort to project your military strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;: Israel is paying the price for not striking Iran and for Washington&amp;#39;s evolving ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

	Turkey&amp;#39;s assertiveness has raised the concern of NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen and its fellow allies. Since Thursday, Sept. 29, Turkish warships have been harassing Israeli merchant vessels in waters off Cyprus, &lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s military sources report, ordering them to change course in a bid to assert Turkish mastery in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel has sent warplanes to fly over the areas of the incidents.&lt;br /&gt;
	Western naval sources say the situation is getting explosive enough to spark a major confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

	The tip-off which enabled two Hellfire missiles fired by US drones to locate and kill the US-born Anwar al-Awkali reached US intelligence as a result of a power struggle within Al Qaeda&amp;#39;s leadership in Yemen. Killed too was a second US-born al Qaeda operative. &lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s counter-terror sources disclose that the internal strife was sharpened by the recent arrival in Yemen of the new Al Qaeda leader Ayman Zuwahiri, who determined to purge AQAP ranks of its American element ahead of his next plans.&lt;/p&gt;

	To punish the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas for&amp;nbsp;submitting his application for UN membership in defiance of President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s strong objections, Washington leaned on Jordan&amp;#39;s King Abdullah II to allow a visit by Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal to discuss his political bureau&amp;#39;s transfer from Damascus to Amman. Saudi Arabia helped persuade him.&amp;nbsp;Obama was telling Abbas thereby that if Hamas should moderate its extremism, his role as sole Palestinian spokesman would face serious competition.&lt;/p&gt;

	A US and/or Israel strike against Iran suddenly looked tangible this week following a warning of its probability by a French diplomat and a large-scale Russian-Central Asian military exercise simulating Iranian retaliation for&amp;nbsp;a hypothetical strike on US-owned Caspian oil fields. A British diplomat ending his term in Pyongyang quoted North Korean officials who told him that NATO would not have attacked Libya if Muammar Qaddafi had not given up his nuclear weapons. Tehran appears to have reached the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

	Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the driving force behind Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program and most vocal of Israel&amp;#39;s enemies, is on his last legs as president. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has stripped him of most of his powers and shut the door against his allies running for the Majlis (parliament) in March 2012. &amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s Iranian sources: The coming men in the presidential stakes of 2013 are Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, a former nuclear negotiator with the West, and ex-foreign minister Ali Akhbar Veliyati. Both are hardliners.&lt;/p&gt;

	Helped by highly sophisticated contraband weapons smuggled out of Libya, Iran and Hizballah are getting the Palestinian Hamas equipped for another round of hostilities with Israel. &lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s military sources report that Sunday, Sept. 25, Egyptian security forces homed in near Ismailia on a large half-empty cache of advanced Libyan SA-24 anti-air infrared missiles (a version of the US Stinger). They grant Hamas high-, medium- and low-altitude capabilities. Many of the empty crates had also contained sea mines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	Friday, Sept. 23&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the day Mahmoud Abbas applied for UN recognition of a Palestinian state, an Israeli called Asher Palmer, 25, and his one-year old son Jonathan were killed by a novel Palestinian method of murder while driving home on the Hebron road:&amp;nbsp;They&amp;nbsp;waylaid his oncoming car in their own vehicle and hurled a rock the size of a football at his windscreen. The Israeli police then deceived&amp;nbsp;the public by calling the attack a road accident.&lt;/p&gt;

	Amid spiraling Pakistani-US tensions, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani Sunday, Sept. 25, recalled Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar from New York shortly after she warned the US against &amp;quot;hot pursuit&amp;quot; of terrorists on Pakistani soil. Pakistan&amp;#39;s army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani held a &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; meeting of top commanders &amp;quot;to review the security situation&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; exacerbating the sense of crisis. &lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;: Pakistan appears to be steeling itself for a possible military clash with US soldiers after being accused of harboring and running terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

	Muammar Qaddafi and his sons have raised a new army of 12,000 soldiers - all fighters of loyal Touareg tribes of the Sahara, &lt;span class="debka"&gt;debka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s military sources report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Saturday, Sept. 24, Libyan rebel troops reportedly clashed with his diehards after entering the town of Sirte from the west. Two thousand kilometers to the south, in Niger, the ousted Libyan ruler won a guarantee of protection and alliance from the Touareg tribal council and their declaration of war on his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
