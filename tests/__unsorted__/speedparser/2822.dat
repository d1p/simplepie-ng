<description><![CDATA[It's too late at night for me to muster the mental energy to write about anything of actual importance, so here's your daily dose of minutiae.<br /><br /><span class="emf">3 HARMLESS SITUATIONS THAT MAKE ME FEEL UNNECESSARILY AWKWARD:</span><br /><br />1. <b>Hugs.</b> Don't get me wrong, most of the hugs I give/receive are perfectly pleasant and I don't really have beef with hugging in general. But I often find myself caught in one of those classically awkward kinds of hugs: car hugs, over-the-table hugs, obligatory 'I don't really know you but I hugged everyone else here' hugs, hilariously mismatched height hugs... all guaranteed to make me feel pretty uncomfortable. I don't mean to sound like a cold and affectionless robot. I'm just more of a high-five kinda person.<br /><br />2. <b>Being on camera.</b> My go-to picture poses are 'just standing there while looking away from the camera' and 'thumbs up with creepy serial killer smile.' OR I'll just make some dumb or irrelevant comment while the picture is being taken to be more 'candid' and end up looking massively stoned and/or on the brink of vomiting. Whenever I actually attempt to pose for a photo, I start to feel like a tool once I've held the pose for more than 3 seconds and I give up on it, at which point the camera captures me in that 'fuck this' moment. My shittiness at being photographed tends to piss off my parents when we're on vacations or outings, which is probably why I so often insist on being <em>behind</em> the camera.<br /><br />3. <b>Not having anything to do with my hands.</b> Few things make me feel more awkward and self-conscious than walking around without a bag, beverage, or phone to fidget with. When I'm stripped of these things I become suddenly aware of how stupid my arms must look, just hanging there and being useless. I usually try to make them look busy by scratching the back of my neck or absentmindedly tugging my earlobe, which probably looks worse. When I finally become comfortable in my own skin I hope to be able to strut around as self-assuredly as this fellow:<br /><br /><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c9wxJ.gif"></center>]]></description>

Like the delicious celebratory meal I'm going to treat myself to the second I walk out of my last exam (gyros sound especially appealing right now), or how I'm going to cap off the school year with my wonderful friends at the end of this week, or which TV show I should adopt + Netflix the shit out of during my brief staycay before summer school starts. Turns out I actually have a decently busy summer lined up..<br /><br /><span class="emf">SUMMAHTIME '11 TO-DO LIST</span><br />• Make a website for an engineering firm<br />• Night class at UCI from 6-9PM. Lawd help me. Those are my eatin' hours.<br />• Make a website for a Sonoscape machine, whatever that is.<br />• Continue raping the replay button on the latest Fleet Foxes release<br />• Re-learn how to surf<br />• REVAMP MUSHABOOM, because I haven't touched that thing in years. I'm so stoked for this. I've learned some new code-trickery that I can't wait to use on the next incarnation of the site. The version in my head looks badass.<br />• Go to ASIA (???????)<br />• Design a bunch of event posters<br />• Move into a new apartment in July + frolic in LA<br />• Play with <a href="http://www.incredibox.fr/" target="_blank">this</a> forever.<br />• Start [to consider] the job-seeking process.

There are few things I love more than enjoying a good film, book, walk, or <a href="http://www.starz.com/originals/PartyDown" target="_blank">Party Down marathon</a> with just myself, but this week I've gotten present to how all of these things are infinitely better when kickass company is involved. I'm so fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful friends, roomies, e-pals, dinner dates, study buddies, cousins, lasertag teammates.. the list goes on. My goal for the indefinite future is to see more faces, old and new. I love my taste in people.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[At some point in the middle of watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvHXzP2SpLA" target="_blank">Ricky Gervais obliterate half of Hollywood</a> at the Golden Globes last night, I glanced outside my window and saw this: <br /><br /><center><a href="http://mushaboom.net/admin/data/upimages/beach1.jpg"><img border="0" align="none" alt="" src="http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/1568/beach1f.jpg" width="450"></a></center><br /><br />..then proceeded to turn off the TV, grab my camera and my dog and bolt across the street to sit in awe + snap some pics of the sun before it went away for another 12 hours. SoCal has been so good to me this past week, beauty/weather-wise. How could I ever leave her?<br /><br />In other news, I've found that staring at my wall for 10 minutes and contemplating all the shit that I have to do in the near/distant future causes terrible anxiety & harshedmellow-ness, so from now on I choose to only think about the future in terms of the next five minutes. (This should do wonders for my work ethic!)<br /><br />I see a cushy bed in my future. Good night.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Albums of 2010, According to My Ears]]></title>
<link>http://mushaboom.net/blog/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1292136037&amp;archive=</link>
<description><![CDATA[Oh, hello there. At this point I think my readership has diminished down to one (yours truly), but if you're here and you're wondering why I fell off the face of the blogosphere, it's because being an engineering student has reduced my spare time down to trips to the bathroom, lunch and dinner breaks, and the oh-so-precious occasional Modern Family episode. <br /><br />But winter break has arrived, I've enjoyed the glorious first 13 hours of sleep following finals week, and it's time to give this poor neglected weblog a much-needed update the only why I know how: by listing out shit that I like.<br /><br /><span class="emf">Allison's 10 Favorite Albums of TwentyTen</span><br />(Unranked, because compiling this list would cost me hours of internal conflict if it wasn't.)<br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Broken Bells - ST</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/7031/brokenbellst.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> Featuring the dynamite musical combo of James Mercer from the Shins and Danger Mouse from Gnarls Barkley, this album is an eargasmic collision of alt-rock and trip hop, and it basically raped my Top 25 Played Songs list on iTunes this year. <b>Standout Tracks:</b> The High Road, Vaporize, Mongrel Heart<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Cee Lo Green - The Lady Killer</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/249/ceelogreenladykilleroff.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" align="left" width="90"> This album is just so FUN. And it makes me wish I wasn't so embarrassingly inept at dancing, because it's made for groovin'. The sound is simultaneously old-school and fresh, and it's the ideal soundtrack for strolling 'round town and feeling like a BAMF. Dude knows how to write a catchy song. His cover of the Band of Horses' "No One's Gonna Love You" may also have upstaged the original version for me. <b>Standout tracks:</b> Bright Lights Bigger City, Satisfied, I Want You<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Junip - Fields</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/6199/junipcoverselect1.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> It bugs me when artists release double-disc albums that are 50 percent filler. Srsly, if you're going to make half of the songs on an album unmemorable and skippable (lookin' at you, Ben Harper & RHCP), then just cut it down to a short and sweet 10 tracks. Fortunately this isn't the case for Junip's debut album, which is just 2 hours of pure alt-folky awesomeness. Best enjoyed at max volume while staring at the ceiling. <b>Standout tracks:</b> In Every Direction, Chickens, Azaleadalen<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Local Natives - Gorilla Manor</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6626/gorillamanor200.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> For fans of: Fleet Foxes, Grizzly Bear, all those other hipster bands named after animals, stunning three-part harmonies, frantic drum beats, music that makes life feel more cinematic. <b>Standout tracks:</b> Who Knows Who Cares, Warning Sign, World News<br /><br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Janelle Monáe - The ArchAndroid</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/1681/39757822.gif" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> This girl does weird so well. The Great Lady Gaga may have the aesthetic weirdness down but she's got nothing on Janelle Monae when it comes to making truly unique pop music. This is probably the most eclectic and genre-bending release of the year and it's kind of impossible to succinctly describe, so just go listen to it. <b>Standout tracks:</b> Oh Maker, Faster, Cold War<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Owen Pallett - Heartland</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img814.imageshack.us/img814/7862/734581.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> Between him and Andrew Bird, I think I may have a thing for lanky violinists who write weirdass lyrics. Owen Pallett's music is like Andrew Bird on speed. This is the kind of album that takes you away to some other world for an hour - whimsical, musically dense and orchestral. <b>Standout tracks:</b> Lewis Takes off His Shirt, Tryst with Mephistopheles, Oh Heartland, Up Yours!<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Bushwalla - The Man Who Invented the Sky</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/2237/mzixtdvahwv170x17075.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> My favorite weirdo in the world. No one will ever sound like Bushwalla or match the spontaneity and hilarity of his live shows (I get another one next week, lucky me!). Most uplifting lyric of 2010: "I raise up, ain't nobody gonna get me down/the music keeps me moving and I celebrate the sound." <b>Standout Tracks:</b> I Raise Up, I'll Funk Your Brains Out (And I'll Never Ever Call You Again)<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Avett Brothers - I And Love And You</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/4822/iandloveandyouavettbrot.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" width="90" align="left"> The Avett bros = the Beatles with a lot of banjo. There IS such a thing as good country folk music! Granted, they also throw in bits of punk, pop, and blues into the mix and the result is perfect. Never change, Avett Brothers. <b>Standout Tracks:</b> Kick Drum Heart, Slight Figure of Speech, Head Full of Doubt Heart Full of Promise<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Sondre Lerche - Heartbeat Radio</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/8470/sondreheartbeatart1medi.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" align="left" width="90"> Sondre has probably released an album for every genre imaginable - smooth jazz, punk, chamber pop - and Heartbeat Radio is the culmination of all those years of musical ADD. Pop perfection that your parents will also enjoy - my mom tells me this album is reminiscent of Randy Newman and Burt Bacharach. <b>Standout Tracks:</b> I Cannot Let You Go, Almighty Moon, Words and Music<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size:14px;"><b>Black Keys - Brothers</b></font><br /><br /><img src="http://img547.imageshack.us/img547/8312/theblackkeysbrothers300.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px;" align="left" width="90"> Funky, bluesy, soulful, grungy, RAD. At the top of my must-see-live list. <b>Standout Tracks:</b> Too Afraid to Love You, Everlasting Light<br><br><br><br><br><br />Enjoy some tracks from the aforementioned kickass albums:<br /><br /><center><object width="250" height="299"> <param name="movie" value="http://listen.grooveshark.com/widget.swf" /> <param name="wmode" value="window" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /> <param name="flashvars" value="hostname=cowbell.grooveshark.com&widgetID=23310949&style=metal&bbg=FFFFFF&bfg=9A9A9A&bt=66415d&bth=FFFFFF&pbg=66415d&pbgh=9A9A9A&pfg=FFFFFF&pfgh=66415d&si=66415d&lbg=66415d&lbgh=9A9A9A&lfg=FFFFFF&lfgh=66415d&sb=66415d&sbh=9A9A9A&p=0" /> <embed src="http://listen.grooveshark.com/widget.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="250" height="299" flashvars="hostname=cowbell.grooveshark.com&widgetID=23310949&style=metal&bbg=FFFFFF&bfg=9A9A9A&bt=66415d&bth=FFFFFF&pbg=66415d&pbgh=9A9A9A&pfg=FFFFFF&pfgh=66415d&si=66415d&lbg=66415d&lbgh=9A9A9A&lfg=FFFFFF&lfgh=66415d&sb=66415d&sbh=9A9A9A&p=0" allowScriptAccess="always" wmode="window" /></object></center>]]></description>

My school system keeps getting poorer and taking it out on the students. Every day I log onto my news feeds and get less and less optimistic about the state of our nation. The frontrunner in the state's gubernatorial election is a Cheney-backed mogul who never votes, plans to spend a shit ton of taxpayer's money on the Mexican border, spreads blatant lies in her political ads, and is essentially <em>buying</em> the election by outspending her opponent 105-to-1 in campaigning. So I am just itching to fill out my ballot and I hope you share my excitement.<br /><br />It only takes 3 simple steps:<br />1. CRUCIAL: Make sure you're not ignorant. <br />2. If you haven't already, <a href="https://register.rockthevote.com/registrants/new?partner=1&source=rtv.com-topnavigation" target="_blank">get yo' ass registered</a>.<br />3.
