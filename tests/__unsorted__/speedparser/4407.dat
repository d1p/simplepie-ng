Reign celebrates the excitement and energy of relocating my life to London.  Showcasing all new music, this mix picks up where 2010’s Floored left off: a demanding, maddening, four-on-the-floor stomper that’s pulsing with electricity.  Clocking in at almost two hours, Reign is certain to get you moving and grooving.</description>

My future was uncertain and my life was full of change. Now in 2011,here I am relocating from Atlanta, GA to London, UK.  My life is yet again filled with extraordinary change and uncertainty.  To commemorate this, I bring you Breathe. An intensely emotional mix, Breathe was recorded in Dallas when my life was up in the air. I thought it would be a great way to symbolize my move to London, now ten years later.  Enjoy the mix.</description>

Probably one of my most “four-on-the-floor” mixes to date, this podcast will have you grooving in no time.  Make it a priority to get on the dance floor!</description>

Every song is filled with vocals, and it has total commercial appeal to please the widest of audiences.  The mix is great for a summer afternoon by the pool or to ensure your party is uplifting and fun.  So enjoy Radio, what I wish they’d play more of on the radio!</description>

Unlike my other “stomping” club music mixes, this one is definitely more jazz and tech-house influenced, ideal to play in the background at a party or to chill to while having wine with friends.  Listening to it brings a smile to my face every time I hear it, and I hope it has the same effect on you.</description>

Part one, featured on last month’s Remarkable podcast, received so much fantastic feedback! Thank you everyone for listening in and enjoying the amazing tunes!

After popular request, I’m showcasing my “Best of Remark” series this month and next.  This is the first part, 1991 through 1995.  These were the songs that “made me who I am” as a DJ--the high-energy vocal tracks from the 1990’s that created a foundation and DJ passion that would drive me until this day.  So enjoy these classic, nostalgic Remark tunes, they are some of my favorites for sure.</description>

The show also features an interview with the duo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepsky.net/&quot;&gt;Deepsky&lt;/a&gt;, who played in Atlanta that night.  Hope you guys enjoy the mix!</description>

Start is a feel-good mix, with plenty of vocals and bright energy. I planned it with the intention that one would listen to it when starting the day or starting the night--it’s perfect for playing on a bright sunny afternoon or for blasting in the car on your way out to a club. So download the mix, crank it up, and Start something!</description>

      <description>This month I decided to post one of my favorite mixes, entitled Artwork.  I’m very fond of it because I feel it truly represents my sound.  Every track has vocals, and it’s very stimulating and energetic.  The dynamic soundscape ventures from underground to pop, yet all of it retains intense “big club room” momentum.  It’s a tribute to DJing as an art form, and all the work that goes into it. Tune in and enjoy this month’s podcast, Artwork. </description>
