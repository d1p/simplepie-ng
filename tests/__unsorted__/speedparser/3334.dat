&lt;p&gt;This past Friday, almost 16 years to-the-day from our last time, we brought home a new puppy; a yellow English lab. We got her from Allison Hillius of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devonshirelabs.com/Devonshire_Labradors/Home.html&quot; title=&quot;Devonshire Labradors&quot;&gt;Devonshire Labradors&lt;/a&gt;. After spending a couple of days with her we have named her Ellie (after a landslide vote from friends and family). She just turned seven weeks old today so the next couple of weeks will be quite tiring as she will need constant supervision and let out to go potty every two to three hours. Pretty much like having another child I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;want-more&quot;&gt;Want more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random photos taken with my iPhone: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bbohling.com&quot; title=&quot;Brandon Bohling - yet another website&quot;&gt;http://bbohling.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/ebohling/ellie&quot; title=&quot;Ellie Versus - a video&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/09/18/Latest-Inspirations</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we all need a little bit of inspiration to motivate us to be productive. Recently I have leveraged two sources for finding some fantastic photography for inspiration: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/&quot; title=&quot;Google+&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com&quot; title=&quot;500px the home to amazing photography&quot;&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big two social networks have a very fine grain purpose for me…Twitter to keep tabs with technology and Facebook to communicate with a few friends and family members. The newest kid on the block, Google+&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-google&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-google&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, currently is my favorite place to find inspiring photos. Below are a few people that I have added to my photographers circle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/Thomas-Leuthard&quot; title=&quot;Thomas Leuthard&quot;&gt;Thomas Leuthard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/Ben-Canales&quot; title=&quot;Ben Canales&quot;&gt;Ben Canales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/Matt-Veldey&quot; title=&quot;Matt Veldey&quot;&gt;Matt Veldey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/Chris-McLennan&quot; title=&quot;Chris McLennan&quot;&gt;Chris McLennan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;px&quot;&gt;500px&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired of the crap on Flickr? Check out the amazing photos posted on 500px. Every night I try to spend a few minutes going through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/popular&quot; title=&quot;500px - current popular photos&quot;&gt;popular photos&lt;/a&gt;. Amazing and very inspirational. A few photographers that I follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/Summit42&quot; title=&quot;500px - William Church&quot;&gt;William Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/agne&quot; title=&quot;500px - Agne Bruziene&quot;&gt;Agne Bruziene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/CornelPufan&quot; title=&quot;500px - Cornel Pufan&quot;&gt;Cornel Pufan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/AaronReedPhotography&quot; title=&quot;500px - Aaron Reed&quot;&gt;Aaron Reed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspiration-outcome&quot;&gt;Inspiration Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Canales, that I mentioned above, has really inspired me to take some photos at night. Unfortunately, living in the Northwest, I am finding it particularly difficult to get a clear night at this time of year. After my first attempt though I captured the photo below. I have a LONG ways to go before I get to Ben’s level, but I can’t wait to see what my 99th attempt will look like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/20110916-IMG_5683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20110916-IMG_5683&quot; title=&quot;Night Shot Attempt 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Air</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/09/05/FCPX-MBA"/>
		<updated>2011-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/09/05/FCPX-MBA</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to video editing I am a complete novice. A few supporting facts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have been a Vimeo Plus member since November 2007 yet I have only posted 65 videos. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All have been posted with the simplest of tools: iMovie, iMovie for iOS, Vimeo for iOS, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I purchased Final Cut Pro X on July 2 and today was the first time I used it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Today I used about 0.0001% of the features included with Final Cut Pro X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way you slice it…video editing is not my forte. Why should that stop me though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I set aside a couple of hours and started playing with Final Cut Pro X…on my MacBook Air. Given my limited experience with video editing I was surprised&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-backlash&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-backlash&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; how easy it was to figure out the absolute basics (adding clips, titles, transitions, export). What &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; surprised me though was how well the MacBook Air was able to handle running Final Cut Pro X. I dropped in clips, transitions, made edits and never witnessed the beach ball. I even used the MacBook Air to process the video and upload directly to Vimeo&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-time&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-time&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;…not bad for such a portable device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that professional (and likely even amateur) users would never dream of using Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Air, but for now it works just fine for me. And to prove my inadequate video editing (and video &lt;strong&gt;taking&lt;/strong&gt;) skills the video I created…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/28639130?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quick tip…if you want to spin up on FCP X quickly? Israel Hyman (aka Izzy) freely provides the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.izzyvideo.com/final-cut-pro-x-tutorial/&quot; title=&quot;Izzy Video - Final Cut Pro X video tutorials&quot;&gt;best video tutorials&lt;/a&gt; I have found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-backlash&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I was only a little surprised given the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/final_cut_pro_x_backlash&quot; title=&quot;Final Cut Pro X Backlash by John Gruber on Daring Fireball&quot;&gt;backlash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-backlash&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-time&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I did not capture an exact time, but it was under 20 minutes for a nearly 4 minute video. Maybe four months from now when I do my next video I will remember to capture the time.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-time&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

		<title>Installing Jekyll on Mac OS X</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/08/27/Installing-Jekyll-on-Mac"/>
		<updated>2011-08-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/08/27/Installing-Jekyll-on-Mac</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In March this year I once again changed blog engines I was using. I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll - transform your text into a monster&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; after reviewing all the usual (and unusual) suspects. I describe most of my reasons&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-jekyll&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-jekyll&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in my post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/a&gt; so I won’t rehash again, however, I did want to write a little tutorial on how to get Jekyll up and running on your Mac&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-contact&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-contact&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite-xcode&quot;&gt;Pre-Requisite: XCode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get a hold of XCode is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12&quot; title=&quot;XCode&quot;&gt;download from the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite-git&quot;&gt;Pre-Requisite: Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is not absolutely necessary, as RVM (the next pre-req) is available as a tarball, but Git is so popular these days I thought I would provide the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/&quot; title=&quot;Git Installer&quot;&gt;Download Git&lt;/a&gt;. At the time that I wrote this I downloaded the package called, git-1.7.6-x86_64-snow-leopard.dmg, for my MacBook Air. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mount (double-click) the DMG file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double-click the PKG file to install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After installation is complete open Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to execute the file, setup git PATH for non-terminal programs.sh, in the DMG file. I find it easiest to do this in Terminal:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /Volumes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd G&lt;/code&gt; (then hit the tab key to autocomplete the volume)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hit enter&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;./s&lt;/code&gt; (then hit the tab key to autocomplete the shell script file name)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hit enter to run script&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restart terminal and you now have Git installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite-ruby-version-manager-rvm&quot;&gt;Pre-Requisite: Ruby Version Manager (RVM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, RVM is not absolutely required but RVM does ensure that you do not jack up your system by overwriting the OS version of Ruby with a newer version. RVM allows multiple versions of Ruby to be installed on a system (in your home directory, .rvm) and makes it super simple to change the &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Terminal and run the command below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash &amp;lt; &amp;lt;( curl https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note the message in the Terminal window after installation, it will be used below.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next use your favorite text editor and create a new text file that will be saved to your home directory as .profile. Below is what I did:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Open TextMate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Copied the text from the message in terminal message into TextMate: &lt;code&gt;[[ -s &quot;/Users/bbohling/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; ]] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; source &quot;/Users/bbohling/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Saved the doc in my home directory (/Users/bbohling/.profile)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now restart Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;rvm help&lt;/code&gt;. If installation was successful you will see help instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite-ruby&quot;&gt;Pre-Requisite: Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we will install Ruby version 1.9.2. At this time Ruby version 1.8.7 comes with OS X (Lion). Since we installed RVM, this step is easy-peasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lion users: You will need to open the .profile file and add the following line: &lt;code&gt;export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2&lt;/code&gt;. This sets the default compiler to gcc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rvm install 1.9.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that Ruby is installed you can type the following command to use the newer version of Ruby: &lt;code&gt;rvm use 1.92&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To verify type: &lt;code&gt;ruby -v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To make 1.9.2 the default: &lt;code&gt;rvm --default 1.9.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-jekyll&quot;&gt;Installing Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the star attraction, Jekyll…which surprisingly is the easiest part. I also use the Jekyll plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging&quot; title=&quot;jekyll-tagging - Jekyll plugin to automatically generate a tag cloud and tag pages&quot;&gt;jekyll-tagging&lt;/a&gt;, that provides a better solution (in my opinion) than the built-in categories feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install jekyll-tagging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is now installed and you are capable of creating your own static, text-based website. I will try to write a follow-up post that describes how I have set up my templates and configuration. In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll - documentation on GitHub&quot;&gt;check out the docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-jekyll&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I just came across a post by Stephen Ramsay today on the topic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lenz.unl.edu/2011/06/13/back-to-the-roots-web-with-jekyll.html&quot; title=&quot;Back to the Roots Web with Jekyll by Stephen Ramsay&quot;&gt;Back to the Roots Web with Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-jekyll&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-contact&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I performed all of these steps as I went through them myself so they should be accurate. If not, please let me know: brandon [at] bohling [dot] me.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-contact&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Apps on MacBook Air 30 Days Later</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/08/26/Apps-30-Days-Later"/>
		<updated>2011-08-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/08/26/Apps-30-Days-Later</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/07/26/Install-First/&quot; title=&quot;Apps I will install on New MacBook Air by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Apps I will install on New MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, I highlight the apps that I intended on installing on my new MacBook Air. It has now been 30 days since I first laid hands on the new system, so what better time to report what I REALLY installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Dropbox it could take a couple of days to get a new computer set up with all of your goodies. Dropbox shaved off at least a few hours of data migration time, but this is the first time I have set up a new comptuer after using the Mac App Store. Wow. That’s all I have to say, “Wow”! Within an hour I had my new system up and running with a good chunk of my apps. My guess is that next year when I replace our iMac that 80% of my apps will get installed with a click of a button. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of apps that I installed…in the order I installed them. In addition, I call out the apps I did not mention in my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Apps I will install on New MacBook Air</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/07/26/Install-First"/>
		<updated>2011-07-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/07/26/Install-First</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/05/04/buy-first/&quot; title=&quot;What Would You Buy First by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;What Would You Buy First?&lt;/a&gt;, I highlight the apps I would buy first if I had to start all over today. In this post I will outline the apps I will be installing on a new MacBook Air that arrives today. One data point to note: I am cutting my drive space in half (to 256GB), so this list may be slightly different if it were  a new iMac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-apps&quot;&gt;Critical Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following apps are the must-have apps. Apps so crucial to me that I can’t stand to use a system without them. All were on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/05/04/buy-first/&quot; title=&quot;What Would You Buy First by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;previous list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; - duh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword&quot; title=&quot;1Password&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; - manage all passwords, credit card info, and other super secret stuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/aperture/&quot; title=&quot;Aperture&quot;&gt;Aperture&lt;/a&gt; - photo management and editing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder&quot; title=&quot;Reeder&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; - RSS reader&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bohemiancoding.com/fontcase&quot; title=&quot;FontCase&quot;&gt;FontCase&lt;/a&gt; - manage my font fetish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/&quot; title=&quot;Acorn&quot;&gt;Acorn&lt;/a&gt; - cheap, lightweight image editor (I no longer use Adobe Photoshop even though I have CS5). I own Pixelmator too, but prefer the Acorn interface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Alfred&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; - launcher/productivity app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/&quot; title=&quot;TextExpander&quot;&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt; - excellent timesaver, just get it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html&quot; title=&quot;SuperDuper!&quot;&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt; - create full, bootable backups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panic.com/transmit/&quot; title=&quot;Transmit&quot;&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; - FTP client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot; title=&quot;TextMate&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; - robust text editor. However, if no updates to TextMate come out within a month or so I will switch back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot; title=&quot;BBEdit&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-to-the-list&quot;&gt;New to the list:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt&quot; title=&quot;nvALT - must have app for OS X&quot;&gt;nvALT&lt;/a&gt; - how did I forget this in my original post!? This is my virtual notebook/scratch paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;XCode - I doubt I do any heavy development on the MacBook Air, but I do need XCode to easily take advantage of some dev platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot; title=&quot;Keyboard Maestro - Work faster with macros&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt; - this app receives much praise from most of the tech bloggers I follow. I will admit though, I am not taking advantage of this app nearly enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bywordapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Byword - a simple text editor for mac&quot;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt; - I go back and forth between writing using Byword and iA Writer…currently I am using Byword more and is what I used to write this post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/&quot; title=&quot;FInal Cut Pro X - a revolution in creative editing&quot;&gt;Final Cut Pro X&lt;/a&gt; - because iMovie just doesn’t have enough features for my 1 video I create a year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getcloudapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Cloud App - Share Files Fast&quot;&gt;Cloud App&lt;/a&gt;: I switching from Droplr to Cloud app recently because Droplr didn’t work so well switching between my home and corporate networks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/file-management/cloudapp-vs-droplr-is-there-a-clear-winner/&quot; title=&quot;Cloud app vs. Droplr - Is there a clear winner&quot;&gt;AppStorm posted a comparison&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to decide for yourself. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://markedapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Marked - MultiMarkdown preview, everywhere&quot;&gt;Marked&lt;/a&gt; - I use markdown for all my writing, even my notes, so it’s great to get an HTML preview regardless of the software I am using to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-maybe-list&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; list:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use all of these apps today on a regular basis. However, in most cases they aren’t absolutely necessary so I will use the MacBook Air as long as I can without them…we’ll see how long I last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Sparrow&quot;&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; - Gmail client. I will once again try Mail.app (Lion version this time), but if I continue to not like it I will switch back to Sparrow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/&quot; title=&quot;OmniFocus&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; - manage my tasks. I currently use OmniFocus mainly for work and since the MacBook Air is a personal system I doubt I will install. Even if I start capturing personal tasks with OmniFocus I could use the iPhone or iPad version instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/&quot; title=&quot;OmniGraffle&quot;&gt;OmniGraffle&lt;/a&gt; - draw pretty pictures (I’m a software architect). Like OmniFocus, I use OmniGraffle mainly for work. I have OmniGraffle for the iPad too, so I doubt I install this on the MacBook Air…at least to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/&quot; title=&quot;LittleSnapper&quot;&gt;LittleSnapper&lt;/a&gt; - take/manage screenshots. I will see if I can live with the built-in screenshot capabilities plus Acorn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iawriter.com/&quot; title=&quot;iA Writer - No Settings, No Noise, No Mouse&quot;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; - Byword alternate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following items are mainly to support my blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/04/09/Jekyll-30-Days-Later/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll - 30 Days Later by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; - a text-base blogging engine that I use for this website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot; title=&quot;Ruby Programming Language&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; - pre-requisite for Jekyll. I have a draft post on this install process, but since I haven’t posted it yet Mike Clark has good instructions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac&quot; title=&quot;Installing Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3 on Mac OS X&quot;&gt;Installing Ruby 1.9 and Rails on Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/&quot; title=&quot;Pandoc - a universal document converter&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; - I have been meaning to write about this lovely piece of software for a long time. I use it A TON.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/&quot; title=&quot;Haskell Platform - an advanced purely-functional programming language.&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; - Pandoc was written using Haskell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time I get a new system I have the best intentions of keeping it clean. Within a month though I have dozens of apps that I installed, used maybe once, and has since collected test. Now that I think about it, maybe I need to start using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php&quot; title=&quot;Hazel - your digital maid&quot;&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt; again. It is the perfect tool to get rid of things that you are ignoring…kind of like having a maid for your computer. Regardless, I will track all my installs (which is getting easier with the Mac App Store) and provide an update in a month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Top 3 Tips for Your First DSLR</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/06/14/Top-3-Tips-DSLR"/>
		<updated>2011-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/06/14/Top-3-Tips-DSLR</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, based on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/06/13/Reading-Queue/&quot; title=&quot;Reading Queue by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I should be reading right now. Instead, I wanted to write this post since several friends have asked for my opinions on photography recently. I’ll start by saying I am simply an enthusiast when it comes to photography. I am not in a position to share techniques to make you a better photographer. However, I have purchased a fair share of gear so I’d like to share my tips to those looking into getting photography…specifically those wanting to upgrade to a DSLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buy-the-best-lens-you-can-afford-use-leftover-money-for-a-dslr-body&quot;&gt;1. Buy the best lens you can afford; use “leftover” money for a DSLR body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have purchased 4 DSLR bodies since getting into digital photography the first being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canond30/&quot; title=&quot;Canon EOS D30 Review&quot;&gt;Canon EOS D30&lt;/a&gt; and the latest being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos5dmarkii/&quot; title=&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II Review&quot;&gt;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&lt;/a&gt;. However, I have (for the most part) maintained the same set of high quality lenses. Technology for camera bodies improves much faster than it does for lenses, therefore it is wise to invest the bulk of your photography budget in lenses. In the Canon line, this means purchasing pro grade (designated with an “L” in the name, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/264304-USA/Canon_8014A002_Zoom_Wide_Angle_Telephoto_EF.html&quot; title=&quot;Canon EF 24-70&quot;&gt;Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L&lt;/a&gt;) lenses whenever possible. If the pro lenses give you sticker shock then buy a high quality prime such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/12140-USA/Canon_2515A003_50mm_f_1_4_USM_Autofocus.html&quot; title=&quot;Canon EF 50mm f/1.4&quot;&gt;Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional tip: buy lenses with large apertures. This means go after lenses with f/2.8 (or larger, which is to say…a smaller number). This will allow you to take photos in low light situations and/or have faster shutter speeds to stop any action you may be trying to capture. Similarly, I always avoid variable aperture lenses. Case in point. Back in 2005 I went to Alaska with a buddy. I had a 70-200mm f/2.8L and he took a 70-300mm f/3.5-5.6 (or similar). He thought the extra “reach” would be good for capturing all the wildlife. In reality, he got a lot of close-ups but the majority of them were blurry because he had to use a slower shutter speed. I, on the other hand, didn’t have quite the close-ups but my photos were sharp because the difference the light let in with an aperture of f/2.8 and f/3.5 (and f/5.6) is huge…I was able to use a faster shutter speed thus sharper photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REMEMBER: Not only will lenses outlast your camera body, but the single best way to improve the photos you capture (other than pure technique) is the quality of the glass you use. Which brings me to my next tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;always-buy-quality-high-quality-uv-filters-for-every-lens&quot;&gt;2. Always buy quality high quality UV filters for every lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do when unboxing a new lens is to put a UV filter on it. This is the aid in the protection of your expensive investment. However, it would be silly to spend a good chunk of money on a lens only to protect it with a sub-par filter, so don’t go cheap on the filter. Expect to pay $70-120 on a high quality UV filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;always-use-a-lens-hood&quot;&gt;3. Always use a lens hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to protect your lens is to alway, always use a lens hood. Even when I am indoors I use one. This may seem silly to those that think a lens hood is used only to protect from sun glare, but it could also protect your lens if you drop it or knock it into something. Trust me, I know from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-tip&quot;&gt;Bonus Tip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get caught up with Canon vs. Nikon vs. [insert your favorite manufacturer]. Most of the DSLRs available today are very high quality. If in doubt, check out the reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dpreview.com/&quot; title=&quot;Digital photography reviews, news, forums and FAQs&quot;&gt;dpreview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bhphotovideo.com/&quot; title=&quot;B&amp;amp;H Photo, Video, Digital Cameras&quot;&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. If you are still not sure which manufacturer to go with ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do any of my friends have a DSLR that they like?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I have any friends that I could swap lenses with?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I know anyone that I can chat with that could help me learn a particular DSLR?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear. The best way to become a better photographer is to practice, practice, practice. Tomorrow you could go out and buy top of the line gear and still take crappy &lt;em&gt;snapshots&lt;/em&gt;. There are many photographers that can take mind-blowing photos with throw away cameras. My point: shoot with whatever you got…with practice you’ll get a better eye and talent for capturing those photos you want to hang in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have triggered even more questions or you would like to discuss in more detail any of these tips feel free to ping me on Twitter: @ebohling.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Reading Queue</title>

		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/06/13/Reading-Queue</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today there is no shortage of content to read. Even though I read at least two hours every day I feel like I can’t keep up with my reading interests. Two hours is barely enough time to read my RSS feeds let alone any content I push off into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/&quot; title=&quot;Instapaper - A simple tool to save web pages for reading later&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading list (traditional books/ebooks):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy&quot; title=&quot;The Elements of Content Strategy by Erin Kissane&quot;&gt;The Elements of Content Strategy&lt;/a&gt; by Erin Kissane&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t get me started on my time dilemma with podcasts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the root cause to my time problem is focus. I have so many interests that it is far too easy to get bogged down, so I am going to try the following techniques in an attempt to carve out more time to read from my queue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go from reading 70 RSS feeds daily to just 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only look at my Instapaper queue once a week and timebox: 1 hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only sit down to watch any type of TV/movies twice a week: 4 hours max per week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t purchase any more reading material; only add to my wishlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try this new strategy for a month and see if I can make a dent in my reading queue. That will include a 10-day vacation so if I can’t make any headway than maybe I have much deeper issues I need to address!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The tech world has generated a ton of content about WWDC since the Monday. If you want to know what the really smart people are saying about the event I suggest you start by reading Ben Brook’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://brooksreview.net/2011/06/wwdc-big-stuff/&quot; title=&quot;WWDC - The Big Stuff by Ben Brooks&quot;&gt;WWDC: The Big Stuff&lt;/a&gt; or simply catch the video highlights of the 117-minute keynote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/06/apples-epic-117-minute-keynote-in-just-8-minutes/&quot; title=&quot;Apples Epic 117-Minute Keynote In Just 8 Minutes&quot;&gt;8 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to share my thoughts on iCloud and its implications in context of the evolution of the file system. John Gruber and Dan Benjamin share their thoughts on this topic starting around the 33 minute mark in the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/talkshow/46&quot; title=&quot;The Talk Show with John Gruber and Dan Benjamin&quot;&gt;The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Gruber: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not about security, it’s about simplicity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Where is your data for the app? It’s in the app.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It’s the logic way of thinking of doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Why does this seems like a novel concept in 2011?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the downside?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing this discussion between John and Dan reminded me about when Aperture first was released…all your photos were &lt;em&gt;in the app&lt;/em&gt;. Few embraced this new way of thinking. In fact, many people refused to use Aperture simply on the basis that they thought they were now locked into a product. They &lt;em&gt;feared&lt;/em&gt; losing control. They &lt;em&gt;feared&lt;/em&gt; change. As an enterprise architect, I too fear vendor lock-in. I think this is partly the reason text editors have recently been the buzz among tech people…using a text editor means that you completely control the data and are not at all tied to a single product. It was the driving factor behind my post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;The Text File Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Dan and John point out, for the masses the file system still is a bit of a mystery. How many of you receive calls or emails from frantic family members that can’t find files that they swear they just saved? My parents do this to me often and they both use computers every day. They certainly aren’t idiots, but at the same time it isn’t easy. Apple was aware of this years ago and I think that’s why they released Aperture in the way they did. Due to end user pressure though, in a follow-up release they provided the option to &lt;em&gt;reference files&lt;/em&gt; so people did not have to change their current way of thinking. Nonetheless it planted a seed. Maybe similar to the way the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton&quot; title=&quot;Apple Newton&quot;&gt;Apple Newton&lt;/a&gt; planted a seed for iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-point&quot;&gt;My Point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure someone will prove me wrong, but I believe that revolutionary changes rarely occur without at first someone attempting AND FAILING at the revolutionary change. In the case of the file system I think Aperture may have been that first attempt. Fortunately, Aperture did not fail. Nor did Apple stop coming up with revolutionary ideas to eliminate the need to understand the file system. I, like many others, am excited to see how iCloud will work in the real world. Since it’s Apple I’m betting it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Memorial Day Weekend in Hood River</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/HoodRiverMemorialDayWeekend.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hood River Oregon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent Memorial Day Weekend 2011 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_River,_Oregon&quot; title=&quot;Hood River Oregon&quot;&gt;Hood River&lt;/a&gt; area thanks to an invite from friends. Each day we enjoyed a fantastic view of the Columbia River and even caught a glimpse of Mt. Adams on Saturday (bottom-left photo). If you want a view and be just a few blocks from downtown Hood River I highly recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Riverdell&quot; title=&quot;Riverdell Vacation Rental&quot;&gt;Riverdell Vacation Rental&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day we walked from Riverdell to downtown whether to shop&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or feed ourselves (or both). What is so cool about Hood River is the perpetual outdoor activities going on. This time it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonsuperd.com&quot; title=&quot;Oregon Super D Series in Hood River&quot;&gt;Oregon Super D Series&lt;/a&gt;; an Enduro mountain bike series. Which meant there were some cool &lt;em&gt;obstacles&lt;/em&gt; set up in town that Bryce got to enjoy…watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/ebohling/biker&quot; title=&quot;Bryce Bohling - Biker in the Making&quot;&gt;Biker in the Making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday late afternoon we drove south to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lostlakeresort.org/&quot; title=&quot;Lost Lake&quot;&gt;Lost Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Amazingly there was still a ton of snow there…many of the campground roads still closed. We still were able to witness a phenomenal view of Lost Lake with Mt. Hood in the background as captured in the bottom-right photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday afternoon we took a drive on the Washington side of the Columbia River and were treated with some gorgeous views even though it was windy and a horrible day for photography. Like most people (I assume), we normally just zip along the Columbia River Gorge on Interstate 84, but if you have the time travel along the North side on Highway 14. Again we were rewarded with some gems: a view of a wind farm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; south of Maryhill on the Oregon side (top photo), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryhillmuseum.org/&quot; title=&quot;Maryhill Museum of Art in Washington&quot;&gt;Maryhill Museum of of Art&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perr.com/gosp.html&quot; title=&quot;Goldendale Observatory State Park&quot;&gt;Goldendale Observatory State Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all of our travels revolve around food, so I have recapped our sustenance intake: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/double-mountain-brewery-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;Double Mountain Brewery and Pizza&quot;&gt;Double Mountain Brewery&lt;/a&gt; - best pizza in town…and apparently if you are a single woman (according to my wife) the best spot in town to pick up a sexy, manly man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/ground-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;Ground&quot;&gt;Ground&lt;/a&gt; - had a delicious, dark roast americano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/hood-river-bagel-co-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;Hood River Bagel Company&quot;&gt;Hood River Bagel Company&lt;/a&gt; - had one of the best breakfast bagels (egg, pepperjack cheese, sausage, sesame seed bagel)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sixth-street-bistro-and-loft-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;The Sixth Street Bistro and Loft&quot;&gt;The Sixth Street Bistro&lt;/a&gt; - may be one of my new local favorites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/north-oak-street-north-brasserie-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;North Oak Street North Brasserie&quot;&gt;North Oak Brasserie&lt;/a&gt; - first time eating here in over 5 years; it was decent, but certainly not one of the top 5 restaurants in Hood River.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/10-speed-coffee-hood-river&quot; title=&quot;10-Speed Coffee Roasters&quot;&gt;10-Speed Coffee Roasters&lt;/a&gt; - grabbed a fantastic americano on the way out of town…along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bbohling.com/10-speed-coffee-roasters&quot; title=&quot;10-Speed Coffee Roasters whole bean&quot;&gt;2 pounds of whole bean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If interested, I posted a higher-res version of the above &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebohling/5789360524/sizes/l/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Hood River Memorial Day Weekend 2011 Photos by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;photo on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of our favorite Oregon towns to shop; overall it reminds us a lot of Flagstaff, Arizona.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I guess there is/was quite the controversy surrounding the wind farms. Just search on “wind farm columbia river gorge”.&lt;/li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/Coava.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coava - Superb Coffee from Portland&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a coffee snob. There I said it.  Yes, I am fortunate to live in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://extractocoffeehouse.com&quot; title=&quot;Extracto CoffeeHouse and Roastery - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;Northwest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://couriercoffeeroasters.com&quot; title=&quot;Courier Coffee Roasters - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartroasters.com/&quot; title=&quot;Heart Coffee Roasters - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ristrettoroasters.com/&quot; title=&quot;RISTRETTO ROASTERS - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;greatest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sterlingcoffeeroasters.com/&quot; title=&quot;Sterling Coffee Roasters - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;roasters&lt;/a&gt; were born. And as much as I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/&quot; title=&quot;Stumptown Coffee Roasters - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; I also get bored with the same thing over and over. That’s why I love exploring the many, many, many options I have nearby. 	This past weekend it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://coava.myshopify.com/&quot; title=&quot;Coava Coffee Roasters - Portland, OR&quot;&gt;Coava&lt;/a&gt;. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://coava.myshopify.com/pages/about&quot; title=&quot;All About Coava&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coava is a family of hard working people who love coffee.  What began as a dream in the heart of Matt Higgins and Keith Gehrke has grown into a coffee roastery and brew bar. We are committed to providing the best quality coffee by focusing on single origin beans and optimum brewing techniques.  We want to make customers into friends, and our goal is to provide our friends with the best coffee experience we can offer.  From quality coffee, to customer service, to putting our own unique twist on the brewing process, we are dedicated to coffee and its ability to bring people together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is wow! Not only was their space that they share with the company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamboorevolution.com/&quot; title=&quot;Bamboo Revolution&quot;&gt;Bamboo Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, fantastic but their espresso was so fantastically unique and awesome! One tip though…the little clipboards with the cards that look very similar to &lt;em&gt;wine tasting note cards&lt;/em&gt; are menus. Don’t write on them…they don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Everyday Things Project: Bikes</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/05/19/Bikes"/>
		<updated>2011-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/05/19/Bikes</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bikes have always played a large part in my life. I vividly remember each bike all the way back to my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Wheel&quot; title=&quot;Big Wheel&quot;&gt;Big Wheel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;…one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.originalbigwheel.com/&quot; title=&quot;Original Big Wheel&quot;&gt;originals&lt;/a&gt; in the early 70s. The first monumental bike purchase for me occurred in 1982. For a year I had been working on my parents and grandparents to buy me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/3wheeler&quot; title=&quot;Honda Three Wheeler&quot;&gt;Honda three wheeler&lt;/a&gt;. I was totally consumed with the idea of having my own three wheeler…my cousin had three Honda ATVs which I loved to ride anytime we went to his house. Just as everyone was about to break down and buy me an ATV the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/&quot; title=&quot;E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial&quot;&gt;E.T.&lt;/a&gt; came out. Remember how cool all the bike scenes were? Well, my tune changed…now I wanted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwahara_(bicycle_company)&quot; title=&quot;Kuwahara&quot;&gt;Kuwahara&lt;/a&gt; more than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I could get amnesia, forget the name of all my friends and family (even my own) and I would still remember this moment. My parents and grandparents asked me if I was sure I wanted a BMX…OR would I  rather have a three wheeler. Yes, they were actually (finally) prepared to buy me a three wheeler! Whoa. This should be an easy choice, right?  After all, I already had a BMX bike (though a 2 ton brick of a bike), so, logically it made more sense to get an ATV. Then again, when do 12 year olds act logically? Without any hesitation at all I whole heartily stated I wanted a Kuwahara BMX bike. My parents and grandparents were no fools when it came to figuring out the financial consequence of my choice so that very day I had a shiny, chrome Kuwahara with white and blue lettering. It was gorgeous. I rode that bike throughout my middle school and high school years. And I can honestly say that to this day I do not regret my decision. If for no other reason than I surely would have hospitalized myself (if not worse) if I had a three wheeler at age 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly my memories of the Kuwara do not end there. My most memorable moment with that bike was when my friend and I built a ramp from a sawhorse and sheet of plywood. What I quickly learned about our choice in materials, as I hit the plywood, was the &lt;em&gt;springiness&lt;/em&gt; of a sheet of plywood. I was launched halfway to the moon but fortunately landed upright without crashing (or hurting my man parts). However, I landed with such force that I blew out both tires. And while this is one of many similar stories I have with that bike, I never once ended up in the hospital. Well, at least not until I was an adult (a story for another post). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve had quite a few bike and while I love them all and could share many stories&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; it wasn’t until the end of 2010 that I had my next monumental bike purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/20110511-IMG_2380.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CycleOps 400 Pro Indoor Trainer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we moved from Arizona to Oregon in 2005 I transitioned from mountain bike rider to roadie&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which I thought I would never do. I mean us mountain bikers were laid back, flannel wearing, cool kids…unlike those uptight, outfit matching, snob roadies! All it took though was a single ride with a group of local cyclists, blazing around the beautiful country side in Forest Grove and I was hooked. The first road bike I got was quickly upgraded the very next year. Not wanting to continue that horribly expensive trend I looked at cheap (at least that was the original intent) alternatives. I started getting computers and gizmos for my bike to aid in improving my performance…I was getting tired of getting left behind. Well, like most &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/21/new-spro-gear-here/&quot; title=&quot;La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II espresso machine&quot;&gt;things I do&lt;/a&gt; I got carried away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little sidebar to explain how I function…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very competitive…especially when it comes to athletics. I was a cross country runner during my high school and college years. And while I do some competitive running and cycling today, I really like competing with myself on a day-to-day basis and my favorite way to do that is with data. Unfortunately, simply writing down my workouts is not good enough. I want technology involved. I want data collected automatically. This is why, when I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rei.com/product/769753/kinetic-road-machine-fluid-bike-trainer&quot; title=&quot;Kinetic Road Machine Fluid Bike Trainer&quot;&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; to train indoors I wasn’t satisfied for very long. Not only was I highly restricted on the data I could collect, it was completely manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And so…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing led to another and soon I was determined that I needed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/400pro&quot; title=&quot;CycleOps 400 Pro Indoor Cycle&quot;&gt;CycleOps 400 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of data the 400 Pro collects is insane. Totally for a pro, which I clearly am not. However, the geek in me won out in the end (read: miraculously convinced Denise) and I purchased the state-of-the-art machine. Months later I am still learning how to best leverage all the data. I also just recently spent another small fortunate on a setup that allows me to collect data from all my outdoor rides that I can now mimic indoors on the 400 Pro. In other words, any ride that I do on my outdoor road bike I can duplicate on the 400 Pro. You have to admit (geek/jock or not), that is so awesome, right!? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this WAY-TOO-LONG post on my history with bikes, I’d like to point out maybe the most important fact: my mom and dad still have my Kuwahara, which I intend on giving to Bryce in a year or two. Let the fun begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;True, not technically a bike, but definitely the &lt;em&gt;gateway drug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just to name a few: Crashing going down &lt;em&gt;The Waterfall&lt;/em&gt; on South Mountain (ER visit), getting hit by a car while riding my 3 day old bike, and falling off my bike into a bunch of cacti requiring Denise to pull &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles&quot; title=&quot;Cactus hurt...real bad&quot;&gt;spines&lt;/a&gt; out from &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; conceivable places. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who exclusively rides road bikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/05/12/Website-Update</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Instead of working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/04/14/My-Everyday-Things-Project/&quot; title=&quot;My Everyday Things Project by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;My Everyday Things project&lt;/a&gt; last night I spent over two hours captivated by slide decks from &lt;a href=&quot;http://noteandpoint.com/&quot; title=&quot;Note and Point - Killer Slide Decks&quot;&gt;Note &amp;amp; Point&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; diversion led me to rethink the font I was using on this site…and once I started thinking about fonts it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hours and hours (and hours) of dinking around I decided to try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts&quot; title=&quot;Google's web fonts&quot;&gt;Google’s web fonts&lt;/a&gt; versus me hosting them. We’ll see how that goes…it slightly goes against the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;simplicity&lt;/a&gt; that I am after with this site, but I still feel compelled to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/SiteFonts.png&quot; alt=&quot;SiteFonts&quot; /&gt;
######Before and After&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Metrophobic&amp;amp;subset=latin&quot; title=&quot;Metrophobic font&quot;&gt;Metrophobic&lt;/a&gt; for the main text, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Francois+One&amp;amp;subset=latin&quot; title=&quot;Francois One font&quot;&gt;Francois One&lt;/a&gt; for the headers, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Waiting+for+the+Sunrise&amp;amp;subset=latin&quot; title=&quot;Waiting for the Sunrise font&quot;&gt;Waiting for the Sunrise&lt;/a&gt; for the title (Brandon Bohling)…which coincidentally is nearly identical to how I write. I think it is a big improvement…hopefully you agree. Which brings me to another change. Instead of using a &lt;em&gt;Comment via Twitter&lt;/em&gt; link, which broke recently due to a Twitter change…I am now using their official button. This will only be displayed on single post pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and finally change I made was to now display the last five posts on the home page versus just one. I guess I’ve procrastinated enough now. This weekend I &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; post my first project post. Really. Seriously. &lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/04/14/My-Everyday-Things-Project</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is this…at least once a week I will post a photo of something I interact with on an every day basis. Along with the photo I will include what that &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; means to me and/or why it is important. I’m sure this isn’t a unique project but I think it will be a wonderful exercise to focus my photography and writing passions. It will also expose my life in new ways. While I regularly reflect on my life, I take far too many things for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the &lt;strong&gt;My Everyday Things&lt;/strong&gt; project. I kick it off next week. I welcome the one or two readers I have to bug me publicly on Twitter&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; if I go longer than seven days between posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or Facebook if you really want to hurt me.&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>The Power of Lazy Photo Editing</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/04/11/photo-edit-lazy"/>
		<updated>2011-04-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/04/11/photo-edit-lazy</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/IMG_1438-edit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brandon Bohling with his son Bryce&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all very, very busy these days. We fill our time with work, friends, and family. Any &lt;em&gt;spare&lt;/em&gt; time we fill with hobbies, TV, and of course the Internet. Many of these activities lead to consuming and generating copious amounts of digital content as I have mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;em&gt;generating&lt;/em&gt; of so much digital content that is overwhelming to me. It leads to more time to manage the content. Which leads to less time to actually DO anything with the content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point…I take photos nearly every day. And generally not a snapshot or two but rather 20+ photos. The photos are captured with either my DSLR or iPhone. I rarely sync my iPhone photos to my Aperture library even though I now have a slick app for that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photosync-app.com/&quot; title=&quot;PhotoSync - wirelessly transfer photos and videos&quot;&gt;PhotoSync&lt;/a&gt; and I probably only download photos from the DSLR into Aperture once or twice a week. This means I rarely have a current, centralized photo library. However, that’s not really my concern. My concern is that there is little point to all the photo capturing if I am not going to do anything with them, right? So I should (at least) once a week be processing (deleting, keywording, rating, and photo editing) and doing something with the photos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the photo management software available today also offer spectacular photo editing tools so unless you really need to fix up a photo there is little reason (for me) to use software like Adobe Photoshop any more. Remember those days? I would spend a minimum of 15 minutes per photo and that’s only because I had created a ton of Photoshop Actions that made editing fast. Now, I spend about 15 seconds editing each photo using Aperture (Adobe Lightroom is equally capable; I own both). Even when they are as bad as the original photo below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/IMG_1438-org.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brandon Bohling with his son Bryce - original&quot; /&gt;
###### Original photo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it possible to edit photos so fast? 90% of the time I simply use one of my favorite five presets&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so with a click of a button I’m done. What’s really sad…I still can’t seem to make the time to do anything with my photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My favorite collection of Aperture presets is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/simone&quot; title=&quot;Simone Vitale - Aperture Presets&quot;&gt;Simone Vitale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Jekyll 30 Days Later</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/04/09/Jekyll-30-Days-Later"/>
		<updated>2011-04-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/04/09/Jekyll-30-Days-Later</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has now been over a month since I started my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll - static website generator&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; as my vehicle. This will be my seventh post using Jekyll and my still evolving workflow. So why not share my experience so far?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jekyll-out-of-the-box&quot;&gt;Jekyll Out of the Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is not your normal blogging system where you can simply write your post in a browser or use a blogging tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/&quot; title=&quot;MarsEdit 3 - desktop blog editing for the Mac&quot;&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll does not store your posts in a database nor does it serve content dynamically. Jekyll simply generates static HTML files based on your posts (text files) using templates (similar to a theme) that you create. That’s it. The author is responsible for moving those static HTML files to where the site is hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-manual-workflow&quot;&gt;Current (Manual) Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still intend on writing a post on how to setup Jekyll from start to finish. I performed the required steps on three different systems taking notes along the way. For now though, I just want to share my current workflow and how I intend on improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/JekyllManualWorkflow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JekyllManualWorkflow&quot; /&gt;
###### Jekyll Workflow ######&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a new text file in my &lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt; directory (full path: &lt;code&gt;~/brandon/Dropbox/sites/brandonbohling.com/source/_posts&lt;/code&gt;) using the naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md. Example: &lt;code&gt;2011-04-09-Jekyll-30-Days-Later.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the new document type &lt;em&gt;.blog&lt;/em&gt; which triggers &lt;a href=&quot;http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/&quot; title=&quot;TextExpander - Mac Typing Shortcut Utility Saves You Time&quot;&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt; to create the post shell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write the post using &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot; title=&quot;Markdown - text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; (a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers). Save work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Terminal, navigate to the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; directory and execute the command &lt;code&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review and edit locally, &lt;code&gt;http://0.0.0.0:4000/&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;Not pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Transmit to sync local changes to the brandonbohling.com web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-improve-my-workflow&quot;&gt;Ways to Improve My Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have little issue sticking with the workflow above. However, I do understand that there are some inefficiencies and technical hurdles, so the geek inside is restless. The two main areas which I want to improve on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blog post setup (steps 1 and 2 above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;publishing posts (steps 4 and 6; somewhat step 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-blog-post-setup&quot;&gt;Improve: Blog Post Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much to this. I will likely combine steps 1 and 2 above using a script of some sort that I either execute via Terminal or some other trigger like TextExpander. It is only a minor inconvenience at this point and is not a roadblock to writing using an iOS device. Thus, I will not spend much effort on optimizing this until I first work on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-publishing-posts&quot;&gt;Improve: Publishing Posts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are several ways to implement the first improvement, there are many, many ways to implement the second one. And it is the second one where the most time can be saved as well as eliminate one of the primary downsides to using Jekyll…needing to manually run the Jekyll command to generate the site, which is not possible if I am using an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the easiest way to improve efficiency would be to write an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync&quot; title=&quot;rsync - synchronizes files and directories from one location to another&quot;&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; command. However, I would rather automate the entire publishing process so even if I was on an iOS device I could publish a blog post. This likely means I will need some folder watcher program which will monitors for updates, which would trigger a Jekyll build and then push the files to my ISP. Given that I am already using Dropbox I would think I could reuse some of its powers. Currently I am envisioning a workflow something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute command or double-click icon and blog post template is created with today’s date and a placeholder title for the file name, prefixed with the word DRAFT. Prefixing with DRAFT will keep the post from being automatically published.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write the post using Markdown as I do today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove DRAFT from the filename&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous step triggers a program to execute Jekyll command and then upload the files to my ISP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some sticking points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would require me to have a system that was always on to execute step 4. This is not a deal breaker as I do have a system on 95% of the time. The only time I purposely turn off our iMac is when we go on vacation, which would happen to coincide with when I would most likely write and want to post though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less of an issue would be the lack of truly reviewing my work in a web browser before publishing. This would only occur when using an iOS device to write and publish, so again not a deal breaker, but a consideration nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that absolutely love the ease of publishing with blogging software like WordPress (and similar) will likely be appalled at the Jekyll workflow. However, as I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/06/Text-File-Revolution/&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/a&gt; I wanted full control and ownership of my content, so I am willing to suffer slightly with its manual process. With a little extra work I think I can make it just as painless as WordPress though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is the sudden flood of posts and discussions around static (or baked) blogs. Brent Simmons may have started it with his &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs&quot; title=&quot;A Plea for Baked Weblogs by Brent Simmons&quot;&gt;A Plea for Baked Weblogs&lt;/a&gt; post, but other notable folks have discussed as well. Maybe most surprising is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/&quot; title=&quot;Marco Arment founder of Instapaper&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt; cofounder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot; title=&quot;Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://instapaper.com/&quot; title=&quot;Instapaper&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; talks about it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/people/dan-benjamin&quot; title=&quot;Dan Benjamin of 5by5 fame&quot;&gt;Dan Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; on Build &amp;amp; Analyze in &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18&quot; title=&quot;Build and Analyze Episode 18&quot;&gt;Episode 18&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/19&quot; title=&quot;Build and Analyze Episode 19&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Episode 19&lt;/a&gt;. Marco is writing his own static web site generator using PHP while Dan is trying at Jekyll. I am very curious to see if they talk about their experience more in Episode 20. For me, I am thrilled I have moved to Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Trip...Down Memory Lane</title>

		<updated>2011-04-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/20020427-CRW_7352.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Antelope Canyon by Brandon Bohling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I was in Aperture a bit tonight. I was migrating last month’s photos from my MacBook Pro to our iMac (probably time for another photo workflow post) when I randomly thought about a photo trip Denise and I took back in 2002. About 12-15 of us from the Intel Arizona Photography Club (or something like that) took a trip in Northern Arizona. In two days we shot at Painted Desert, Canyon de Chelly, Glen Canyon, Antelope Canyon, and Monument Valley. Antelope Canyon and Monument Valley were two guided tours that were absolutely stellar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent about 30 minutes picking out the top photo from each shoot and performed some minor tweaks on each (minor curve adjustments and sharpened a couple of shots). I also included a group shot. I’m the one with the black-n-white stocking hat; Denise is next to me. All photos were taken with my original DSLR, the Canon EOS D30, a whopping 3.1 megapixel camera. The Canyon de Chelly photo was taken with a Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens; all the rest were taken with a Sigma 14mm f/2.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/images/20020427-CRW_7268.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Arizona Photography Club at Antelope Canyon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday at 6:00 PM we decided to see if there were any rooms available at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surfsand.com/&quot; title=&quot;Surfsand Resort in Cannon Beach, Oregon&quot;&gt;Surfsand Resort&lt;/a&gt; in Cannon Beach. This was while we were still at Bryce’s swimming lessons. By 8:10 PM Denise was checking us into our room at the resort. Yeah, even with a 4 year old…we still got it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All photos and videos taken with an iPhone 4 or iPad 2. Video created with iMovie for the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Lessn and Comments</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/25/lessn-comments"/>
		<updated>2011-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/03/25/lessn-comments</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really like how &lt;a href=&quot;http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/truly-it-is-made-of-unicorns&quot; title=&quot;Hicksdesign&quot;&gt;Jon Hicks handles comments&lt;/a&gt; on Hicksdesign. Instead of allowing direct comments on his blog he provides a link that pre-populates a tweet. I’m not a fan of blog comments and many agree. &lt;a href=&quot;http://al3x.net/2009/02/24/why-no-comments-more-everything-buckets.html&quot; title=&quot;Alex Payne&quot;&gt;Alex Payne states why best&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For most sites, though, comments are worse than useless. The anonymity of the Internet inspires hit-and-run attacks, unintelligible ramblings, and truckloads of spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to implement a similar feature on this site. This lead me down a path of some additional work…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessn-and-lessn-more&quot;&gt;Lessn (and Lessn More)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn’t really want to force people to use a full URL like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/25/lessn-comments/&quot; title=&quot;Lessn and Comments - full URL&quot;&gt;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/25/lessn-comments/&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use a URL shortener. Of course, I could use one of the many URL shortener services out there like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/&quot; title=&quot;URL shortener - bit.ly&quot;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://droplr.com&quot; title=&quot;URL shortener - droplr&quot;&gt;droplr&lt;/a&gt;, which I have many times in the past…for my website though I wanted something more personal &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; in my control. Thus, I turned to Shaun Inman’s URL shortener, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n&quot; title=&quot;Lessn by Shaun Inman&quot;&gt;Lessn&lt;/a&gt;. It took only a few minutes to setup after I purchased a new domain, brndn.me. I soon realized though Shaun did not provide an easy way to track usage or even list out the URLs I had shortened. A quick Google search later I came across Alan Hogan’s Lessn fork, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alanhogan/lessnmore&quot; title=&quot;Lessn More a Lessn fork by Alan Hogan&quot;&gt;Lessn More&lt;/a&gt;. A couple minutes later I had the perfect solution. Now I had a shorter URL that people could use to reference my web site. So now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/25/lessn-comments/&quot; title=&quot;Lessn and Comments - full URL&quot;&gt;http://brandonbohling.com/2011/03/25/lessn-comments&lt;/a&gt; can be referenced using &lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/5&quot; title=&quot;Lessn and Comments - short URL&quot;&gt;http://brndn.me/5&lt;/a&gt;. If you own a domain and already have a hosting provider there’s few reasons why you shouldn’t setup Lessn More. Below are the 4 steps required directly from the README:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open /-/config.php in a plaintext editor and create a Lessn username and password then enter your database connection details. You may also choose other settings such as authentication salts and a default home page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the shortest URLs possible, upload the contents of this directory to your domain’s root public folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit http://doma.in/install.php to create the necessary database tables. (Watch for errors.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit http://doma.in/-/ to log in &amp;amp; start using Lessn More! Be sure to grab the bookmarklets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: doma.in above should be replaced with your domain name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments-via-twitter&quot;&gt;Comments via Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brndn.me/4&quot; title=&quot;Text File Revolution by Brandon Bohling&quot;&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/a&gt; I am now using Jekyll to generate this web site. By default, it does not have a commenting solution. Some have chosen to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com/&quot; title=&quot;disqus - discover your community&quot;&gt;disqus&lt;/a&gt;, but I have chosen to go down another path and use Twitter. Honestly, the reason for this site is simply to provide me a writing outlet for myself so I don’t want to clutter it with comments (or deal with the inevitable SPAM). However, I encourage others to comment via Twitter using a link at the bottom of each post&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, or better yet, create their own blog post providing their own point of view and referencing my post if appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At this time I do not intend on adding a &lt;em&gt;Comment via Twitter&lt;/em&gt; link on past posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time I will post a random photo. I chose this photo not only because I like it but also how surprised I was to capture it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just an average weekend afternoon hanging out at home. We were sitting down for lunch at our kitchen table and I took note of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaryllis&quot; title=&quot;Amaryllis aka naked lady&quot;&gt;amaryllis&lt;/a&gt; (aka naked lady) on our table. I liked how the light from the front door was in the background. And as luck would have it, my Canon 5D Mark II was sitting there with the macro lens, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_100mm_f_2_8l_macro_is_usm&quot; title=&quot;Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS lens&quot;&gt;100mm f/2.8L Macro IS&lt;/a&gt;, on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience was a reminder that great photos are everywhere…even in our normal, everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am like any other technologist (ok, geek) out there…I love tinkering with new stuff&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For the most part I wouldn’t change this about me; it generates intense passion in my daily life as well as serving me well in my career. However, there are certainly pitfalls I inevitably fall into time and time again. The most prevalent is my constant tinkering with my online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-my-online-life&quot;&gt;A Brief History of My Online Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995 I have had some sort of website. In those 16 years there were easily 40+ different websites I either hand-coded or used some sort of publishing/blogging software or framework. To name a few: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot; title=&quot;Wordpress - both free and priceless at the same time&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com&quot; title=&quot;Blogger&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typepad.com/&quot; title=&quot;TypePad - great blogs start here&quot;&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/&quot; title=&quot;Movable Type - a professional publishing platform&quot;&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/&quot; title=&quot;Drupal&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine - the choice of top designers and web professionals&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joomla.org/&quot; title=&quot;Joomla&quot;&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeigniter.com/&quot; title=&quot;CodeIgniter - Open source PHP web application framework&quot;&gt;CodeIgniter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cakephp.org/&quot; title=&quot;CakePHP - the rapid development PHP framework&quot;&gt;CakePHP&lt;/a&gt;. Just &lt;a href=&quot;http://bbohling.com/my-online-presence-revisited&quot; title=&quot;My Online Presence Revisited&quot;&gt;look at the complexity of my online life&lt;/a&gt; a year ago&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-the-point-is&quot;&gt;And the Point Is…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are consuming &lt;strong&gt;and generating&lt;/strong&gt; huge amounts of digital information. Some^3 have made careers from this fairly recent phenomenon. Yet when I went to look for ways to &lt;em&gt;optimize&lt;/em&gt; my online presence there still was no easy answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;StartRant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
I am tired of losing HUGE amounts of my digital content due to the information being in data stores I either had little or no control over. Patrick Rhone discusses this very topic on an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalmac.com/post/2925165892/enough-beware-of-information-silos&quot; title=&quot;Enough - Beware of Information Silos&quot;&gt;Enough: Beware of Information Silos&lt;/a&gt;. I admit I am to blame for exponentially making it worse for myself by changing software every 6-12 months. Those that stick with just WordPress or any other publishing software are not as bad off, but how boring is that!?&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/StartRant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started looking at alternatives to Wordpress, &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com&quot; title=&quot;Posterous&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot; title=&quot;Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and the likes. Don’t get me wrong, those solutions are fantastic for many uses cases, but they will not work for me on my main content: thoughtful writing and thoughtful photography. What does that exactly mean? Any content that I feel has a longer shelf life than a tweet or snapshot. This meaningful (at least to me) content I need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b2cy.com/social-media/who-needs-website-when-have-facebook&quot; title=&quot;Who Needs A Website When You Have Facebook?&quot;&gt;ensure I own&lt;/a&gt;. For all the other &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; I will continue to use Posterous (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bbohling.com&quot; title=&quot;Brandon Bohling on Posterous&quot;&gt;bbohling.com&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot; title=&quot;Twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ebohling&quot; title=&quot;Brandon Bohling on Twitter&quot;&gt;ebohling&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, my number one requirement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Full control over my content: a) capture content in a timeless format and b) display content in a lightweight and elegant fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-file-revolution&quot;&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter my &lt;em&gt;Text File Revolution&lt;/em&gt;. I decided to go old school: text files. What format is easier to track, backup, and view than text files? One of the best data stores in my opinion. Obviously I am not the only one with this opinion with the huge increase of text editors, especially on iOS devices. Looking at my iPad and iPhone I have the following text editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/plaintext&quot; title=&quot;PlainText - Dropbox text editing&quot;&gt;PlainText&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom&quot; title=&quot;WriteRoom - distraction free writing&quot;&gt;WriteRoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/&quot; title=&quot;Elements&quot;&gt;Elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/writer-for-ipad/&quot; title=&quot;iA Writer&quot;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nebulousapps.net/notes.html&quot; title=&quot;Nebulous Notes&quot;&gt;Nebulous Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://modelessdesign.com/draftpad/&quot; title=&quot;DraftPad - simple notepad which is like a single sheet of paper&quot;&gt;DraftPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codingrobots.com/markdownnote/&quot; title=&quot;MarkDownNote - Markdown editor for the iPad&quot;&gt;MarkDownNote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://notational.net/&quot; title=&quot;Notational Velocity&quot;&gt;Notational Velocity&lt;/a&gt; (specifically Brett Terpstra’s fork, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/&quot; title=&quot;nvALT - Brett Terpstra's Notational Velocity fork&quot;&gt;nvALT&lt;/a&gt;) I can sync all the text files between my iOS devices and all my Macs. &lt;strong&gt;Capture content in a timeless format: check.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the harder part, taking those text files and turning them into a lightweight and elegant web site. Honestly, I started with WordPress and after a full weekend of futzing with themes and plugins I had a (fragile) solution. Fortunately, I quickly learned how fragile when just a few days later WordPress 3.1 came out and I upgraded. Everything broke. True, the theme designer quickly released a fix, but it made me realize how little control I had with my solution. My tech friend, Josh Bancroft, realizes this as well if you one of his recent posts on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinyscreenfuls.com/2011/02/plugins-i-used-in-the-feb-2011-tinyscreenfuls-com-redesign/&quot; title=&quot;Plugins I Used in the Feb. 2011 TinyScreenfuls.com Redesign&quot;&gt;simplified WordPress installation&lt;/a&gt;. In my opinion WordPress is still overkill for a want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;html-for-men&quot;&gt;HTML for Men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more lightweight than pure HTML? There is certainly a reason that myself and other webheads stopped creating HTML web sites back in 1999…they are a complete pain to maintain. The largest site of pure HTML files I maintained was 400+ pages back in 2000 for a computer reseller…not fun. I remember in 1998 working with a buddy to create an engine that took content from text files and it generated a static, HTML web site. That’s what I want now! After some research sure enough there are a handful of static site generators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll - transform your text into a monster&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nanoc.stoneship.org/&quot; title=&quot;nanoc&quot;&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/&quot; title=&quot;StaticMatic - static websites, the modern way&quot;&gt;StaticMatic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webgen.rubyforge.org/&quot; title=&quot;webgen&quot;&gt;webgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.newqdev.com/&quot; title=&quot;static&quot;&gt;static&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webby.rubyforge.org/&quot; title=&quot;Webby&quot;&gt;Webby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ringce.com/hyde&quot; title=&quot;hyde&quot;&gt;hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to spend a ton of time researching all the possibilities I looked to the web authors I read (and who they read) and noticed a few used Jekyll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/&quot; title=&quot;Tom Preston-Werner&quot;&gt;Tom Preston-Werner&lt;/a&gt; (co-founder GitHub, creator Gravatar, creator Jekyll)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://al3x.net/&quot; title=&quot;Alex Payne&quot;&gt;Alex Payne&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter engineer, BankSimple co-founder)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://henrik.nyh.se/&quot; title=&quot;Henrik Nyh&quot;&gt;Henrik Nyh&lt;/a&gt; (The Pug Automatic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa, awesome…now we’re getting somewhere! &lt;strong&gt;Display content in a lightweight and elegant fashion: check.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jekyll-where-the-grass-is-green-mostly&quot;&gt;Jekyll: Where the grass is green (mostly)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been working with Jekyll for about 16 hours so far and while I am extremely excited about this new direction I am taking, I can’t recommend many people following me. I’ll have a future post on the extreme technical nature of Jekyll. It is definitely not for those that don’t like to get their hands dirty…extremely dirty. I haven’t spent this much time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Terminal&quot; title=&quot;Terminal an OSX command line interface&quot;&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. However, once I got everything setup and automated it is a snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a snippet of the text file that I used to create this blog post. The text file consists of a very simple syntax called &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot; title=&quot;John Gruber - markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; created by John Gruber. It is a wonderful syntax that is hugely supported, but even if Markdown disappeared tomorrow my content is in basic text files that I own and manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/TextFiles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Text File Revolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;sample-blog-post-text-file-using-markdown-syntax&quot;&gt;Sample Blog Post (Text File) using Markdown Syntax&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem silly to most, but I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I finally feel on the right path to not only simplifying my online presence but also controlling it. But I’m a tinkerer, so I’m sure I will have much more to say on the topic soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stuff = gadgets, programming languages, software, operating systems, and any other &lt;em&gt;butterfly&lt;/em&gt; that catches my eye.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Need I point out the irony that the link is to another one of my websites?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To name a few: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.becomingminimalist.com/&quot; title=&quot;Becoming Minimalist&quot;&gt;Becoming Minimalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/&quot; title=&quot;Zen Habits&quot;&gt;Zen Habits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalmac.com/&quot; title=&quot;Minimal Mac&quot;&gt;Minimal Mac&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/02/28/scenic-drive"/>
		<updated>2011-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/02/28/scenic-drive</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last weekend we took a little drive on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/&quot;&gt;Historic Columbia River Highway&lt;/a&gt; which is just east of Portland (about 50 minutes from Forest Grove). It had been several years since we had been on it, which is an absolute shame. In less than four hours we can drive, hike, eat, and take photos of dozens of falls, bridges, trails, and other breathtaking views. How easy it is to take those things for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20110220-IMG_1320 - Version 2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stellar View of Columbia River and Vista House&quot; /&gt;
######Chanticleer Point overlooking the Columbia River and Crown Point/Vista House&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chanticleer-point&quot;&gt;Chanticleer Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Point_(Oregon)&quot; title=&quot;Chanticleer Point&quot;&gt;Chanticleer Point&lt;/a&gt; which provides a a stellar view of the Columbia River Gorge. In addition, you can see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vistahouse.com/&quot; title=&quot;Vista House&quot;&gt;Vista House&lt;/a&gt; which is amazing though we didn’t stop at on this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20110220-IMG_1362.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latourell Falls&quot; /&gt;
######Latourell Falls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;latourell-falls&quot;&gt;Latourell Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did stop at Latourell Falls though to hike a bit and take photos. We have taken this easy, short hike to the falls a couple of times but never knew it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/hiking/latourell_falls.htm&quot; title=&quot;Latourell Falls Trail&quot;&gt;complete loop&lt;/a&gt; (2.1 miles). However, we did go past the falls so I could take a few photos of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/history/HABS_HAER/latourell_creek_bridge.htm&quot; title=&quot;Latourell Creek Bridge&quot;&gt;cool bridge&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20110220-IMG_1375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latourell Creek Bridge&quot; /&gt;
######Latourell Creek Bridge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I didn’t know much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/history/HABS_HAER/latourell_creek_bridge.htm&quot; title=&quot;Latourell Creek Bridge&quot;&gt;Latourell Creek Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, but in short order I found out it was constructed in 1914 and is 310 feet in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20110220-IMG_1415.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Path to Oneonta Tunnel&quot; /&gt;
###### Path to Oneonta Tunnel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oneonta-tunnel&quot;&gt;Oneonta Tunnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stop we made was at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/history/HABS_HAER/oneonta_tunnel.htm&quot; title=&quot;Oneonta Tunnel&quot;&gt;Oneonta Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, but my favorite photo from that stop wasn’t of the tunnel rather the path to it, which used to be the road that travelers used to go through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trip-conclusion&quot;&gt;Trip Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this trip reminded me how fortunate we are to live in such a beautiful (and diverse) part of the country. More importantly…wherever we live, there is beauty. I grew up in Iowa and it wasn’t until I moved away until I realized how beautiful it was in its own right. One of my college friends, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mveldey.posterous.com/&quot; title=&quot;Matt Veldey - brilliant photographer currently living in Iowa&quot;&gt;Matt Veldey&lt;/a&gt;, does a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mveldey.posterous.com/darkness-at-grays-lake&quot; title=&quot;Matt Veldey - Gray's Lake&quot;&gt;phenomenal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mveldey.posterous.com/38588920&quot; title=&quot;Matt Veldey - cyclone power&quot;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mveldey.posterous.com/sunset&quot; title=&quot;Matt Veldey - Sunset&quot;&gt;capturing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mveldey.posterous.com/another-stormy-night&quot; title=&quot;Iowa Stormy Night&quot;&gt;Iowa’s beauty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to Keep Your Husband Engaged in Furniture Decisions</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/02/21/how-to-keep-your-husband-engaged-in-furniture-decisions"/>
		<updated>2011-02-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2011/02/21/how-to-keep-your-husband-engaged-in-furniture-decisions</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20110221-IMG_1428.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Living Room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lived in our house for over five years now and yet we still do not have a proper living room. Of course, we have a living room, but not one that entices people to sit down and relax. This is horribly unfortunate since the room has a huge picture window that has a fabulous view of the Coast Range; one of the two main selling points of the house (huge kitchen was another one). We know that purchasing the right furniture is all this neglected room needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we took the first step in making this space inviting. I started by firing up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle-ipad/&quot; title=&quot;OmniGraffle on the iPad&quot;&gt;OmniGraffle on the iPad&lt;/a&gt;^1 and grabbing a tape measure. After some measurements and doodling in OmniGraffle I had a template with our living room dimensions and the furniture^2 we thought we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Living-Room-Template.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Living Room Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some of you think this may be a bit over the top, but the exercise allowed us to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with various configurations and options. True, it took me extra time to create the living room template to perfect scale, but once it was done, it was fantastic. In less than five minutes I created six different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/LivingRoom-Idea1Config1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LivingRoom Idea1Config1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration above is what we originally envisioned. While we were fairly confident that our vision would work in the room we now know without a doubt that it does indeed work. Which is fantastic to know before spending thousand of dollars and committing to furniture for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are Windows user than Microsoft Visio would be an equivalent tool. Or if you prefer free stuff, Google’s SketchUp would work as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.roomandboard.com/?search=jackson&quot; title=&quot;Jackson line from Room and Board&quot;&gt;Jackson line from Room &amp;amp; Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Is it best to leverage social networks</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/22/Best-Leverage-Social-Networks"/>
		<updated>2008-01-22T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2008/01/22/Best-Leverage-Social-Networks</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For years I have been developing my own web sites and hosting my own content (text, photos, and videos). I guess I took this approach mainly so I would have full control over everything…us developers can be a little power hungry at times. Sometimes I have different sites (URLs) with specific content for each and sometimes I cram everything together, but before I go into any further details, let’s look at some of the purposes of my
site(s). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of content I post to the world:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semi-pro photos (a gallery), that I share and potentially sell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daily photos of our son, Bryce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A blog that covers my interests: photography, food/wine/espresso (sustenance), and technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Videos of Bryce and my other interests (eventually some training on those interests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current site is back to cramming everything together (read: &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/01/02/how-we-got-here&quot; title=&quot;How we got here&quot;&gt;How We
Got Here&lt;/a&gt; for more background) though I have not yet really posted any
semi-pro photos, nor have I done a whole lot with videos yet. Someday I
will take the time to port over the years with of content that I have
posted previously. The one topic (and the point of this post) I have not
yet reconciled is where to host the content, specifically photos. Due to
the size of videos I am convinced that hosting them on a social network
site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot; title=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimeo.com&quot; title=&quot;Vimeo&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; is best…and for me that means
Vimeo due to its superior quality (I can post &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/ebohling&quot; title=&quot;vimeo.com - ebohling&quot;&gt;HD videos&lt;/a&gt;). In
addition, blog content makes sense to keep within your blog software
(Blogger, WordPress, etc.) or Content Management System (CMS),
again I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressionengine.com&quot; title=&quot;Expression Engine - the best CMS available&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt; for this site. However, those
pesky little photos are another story. Currently I am hosting all of our
photos within my own site (ExpressionEngine), again mainly for full
control. However, the idea of embedding them in my site from a social
network like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot; title=&quot;Flickr - photo sharing social network&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; does intrigue me a great deal. I hope this post
will generate some online discussion with folks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://kwc.org/&quot; title=&quot;KWC.org&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; who has
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kwc.org/blog/archives/2007/2007-12-29.migrating_off_flickr_partially.html&quot; title=&quot;kwc.org - to flickr or not&quot;&gt;tried both ways&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s take at my initial attempt at some pros and
cons. Hopefully this list will grow as some discussions occur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of Leveraging a Social Network site (like Flickr):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photos will get more exposure (though Ken states otherwise in his post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kwc.org/blog/archives/2007/2007-12-29.migrating_off_flickr_partially.html&quot; title=&quot;Migrating off Flickr - partially&quot;&gt;Migrating off Flickr (partially)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add metadata to photos only once in software (I use Aperture, but many similar products available)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to reuse same photos (and metadata) for multiple sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow people (in my case family and friends) to order prints themselves instead of printing myself and then sending to people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provides an additional backup if the multiple backups that I have at home get destroyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of Leveraging a Social Network site (like Flickr):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No control over photo sizes (I would have to slightly change the design of this site to allow for larger photos)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seems like photos on social network sites are more likely to be used without permission. I do not have scientific proof of this, but I read about more instances of photos being “stolen” from Flickr than personal web sites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When viewers want to see a larger version they are taken away from my own site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Viewers may choose to track my social network presence rather than my web site which sort of defeats the purpose of having a site in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I admit this is just a conversation starter. I really want to put
more time and thought into this, but between getting &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/01/21/new-spro-gear-here&quot; title=&quot;New Spro Gear is Here&quot;&gt;my new espresso
gear&lt;/a&gt; today, work, and dealing with a sick little boy this is all I
have time for at the moment. Please leave your thoughts and/or provide
me links to your blog posts on this topic. I’d love to start a virtual
conversation (among various blogs) about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have a few minutes before lunch is over, but had to share…my
new espresso machine and grinder finally arrived. After three weeks of
no spro at home, relief is finally here. I will post much more (first
impressions, videos, and more photos) in the next few days, but just had
to share my joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These photos aren’t great, but I’m racing to get everything setup over
lunch so I can have play time tonight! Again, will post more shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in the past, I have typically taken full control
over both web presence and content management (mainly photos). However,
I am exploring the notion of leveraging photo sharing sites mainly for
backups and video sites so I don’t have to take up a lot of hard drive
space. I will have a much more in-depth post soon on this topic, but I
came across this video from one of my favorite tutorial websites,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commoncraft.com/&quot; title=&quot;Common Craft&quot;&gt;Common Craft&lt;/a&gt;, that I just
had to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone that has been doing photography and an active participant of
the social web lately this will not be anything new, but it is so well
done I felt compelled to share.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Got ExpressionEngine? Need a sitemap index?</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/10/got-expressionengine-need-sitemap-index"/>
		<updated>2008-01-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2008/01/10/got-expressionengine-need-sitemap-index</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have been developing web sites for a while you already
undoubtedly know &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=40318&quot; title=&quot;Why should I have a sitemap&quot;&gt;the importance of sitemaps&lt;/a&gt;. Most blog software,
such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; title=&quot;WordPress&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, provide plugins to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/&quot; title=&quot;Google (XML) Sitemaps Generator for WordPress&quot;&gt;auto generate sitemaps&lt;/a&gt;,
but I could not find one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressionengine.com&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine - the best CMS available&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt; so I am here to
explain how to auto generate your own with ExpressionEngine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a simple sitemap for a SINGLE blog in ExpressionEngine you can
follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com/wiki/Google_Sitemaps/&quot; title=&quot;Create a Google Sitemap for EE&quot;&gt;instructions explained here&lt;/a&gt;. However, our site has
multiple blogs so I needed to use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php#index&quot; title=&quot;Sitemap Index format&quot;&gt;sitemap index&lt;/a&gt;, which required a
bit more effort. First, I will summarize the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a sitemap for each blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a sitemap-[blog-name].php (like sitemap-word.php) file for
each blog in web root&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a sitemap.php file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update your .htaccess file if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Validate with Google webmaster tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
### Step 1: Create a sitemap template for each blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step you need to create a template page for each blog. This page
generates a sitemap for a particular blog. The code I use is below.
Note: You will need to change the two variables to meet your
requirements. In addition, you need to change the loc tag to match the
URL to your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid error: No such file or directory - posix_spawnp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-create-a-php-sitemap-file-for-each-blog&quot;&gt;Step 2: Create a PHP sitemap file for each blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step you need to use an FTP client, web administration page, or
whatever you do to create files on your web server. In this case, you
will need to create some files in your site’s root directory (EE’s
installation directory). For me, that is public_html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use whatever naming convention you want, but I chose to use:
sitemap-[blog-name].php. So I created three files for my site:
sitemap-action.php, sitemap-word.php, sitemap-bryce.php. Each file will
contain code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php 
// Prevent content to be cached 
header(&quot;Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT&quot;); // Content was generated on past 
header(&quot;Last-Modified: &quot; . gmdate(&quot;D, d M Y H:i:s&quot;) . &quot; GMT&quot;); //Content is always modified 

// Inform user agent that content is XML and is UTF-8 encoded 
header('Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8'); 

// Read content from template and show it 
@readfile ('http://ebohling.com/word/sitemap/'); 
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you will need to change the readfile string to match the URL to
your sitemap in Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-create-a-sitemapphp-file&quot;&gt;Step 3: Create a sitemap.php file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, using the tool you used in Step 2, create a sitemap.php file and
use similar code as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php 
// Prevent content to be cached 
header(&quot;Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT&quot;); // Content was generated on past 
header(&quot;Last-Modified: &quot; . gmdate(&quot;D, d M Y H:i:s&quot;) . &quot; GMT&quot;); //Content is always modified 

// Inform user agent that content is XML and is UTF-8 encoded 
header(&amp;amp;apos;Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8&amp;amp;apos;); 

echo &quot;&amp;lt;sitemapindex xmlns=&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;sitemap&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;http://ebohling.com/sitemap-action.php&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;lastmod&amp;gt;&quot; . date(DATE_ATOM,mktime(0,0,0,10,3,1975)) . &quot;&amp;lt;/lastmod&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;/sitemap&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;sitemap&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;http://ebohling.com/sitemap-word.php&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;lastmod&amp;gt;&quot; . date(DATE_ATOM,mktime(0,0,0,10,3,1975)) . &quot;&amp;lt;/lastmod&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;/sitemap&amp;gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;&amp;lt;/sitemapindex&amp;gt;&quot;;
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you the loc tags to match the URLs to your PHP sitemap files
that you created in Step 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-update-your-htaccess-file-if-necessary&quot;&gt;Step 4: Update your .htaccess file if necessary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using an .htaccess file to remove index.php, then you will
need to update this file. There are many ways to implement this feature
as explained on &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com/wiki/Remove_index.php_From_URLs/&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine wiki - Remove index.php from URL&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine’s
wiki&lt;/a&gt;,
so my sample code may not work for you. But with a little effort,
hopefully you will be able to apply the idea to your particular
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid error: No such file or directory - posix_spawnp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: corelib equates to ExpressionEngine’s core library directory which
you should have renamed on installation, so make sure you tweak
accordingly. As well as your sitemap names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-validate-sitemaps&quot;&gt;Step 5: Validate Sitemaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you will need to validate each of your sitemaps. I use the
validation tool supplied by
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html&quot; title=&quot;XML-Sitemap Validator&quot;&gt;XML-Sitemaps&lt;/a&gt;.
The sitemaps you will need to validate are your sitemap-[blog-name].php
(or whatever naming convention you used). So for me:
http://ebohling.com/sitemap-action.php,
http://ebohling.com/sitemap-bryce.php, and
http://ebohling.com/sitemap-word.php. This will not only validate that
your sitemap is well-formed, but also that your code in your PHP file
and .htaccess file is up to snuff. If you simply want to validate the
sitemap you can first validate using your template URL. For me,
http://ebohling.com/word/sitemap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you CANNOT validate the sitemap index
(http://ebohling.com/sitemap.php) using this tool. You will need to use
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/&quot; title=&quot;Google Webmaster Tools&quot;&gt;Google’s
validtor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see this wasn’t exactly easy. Quite a few steps and a lot can
go wrong at each step. Hopefully this will provide you a starting point
though and save you some time. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>ExpressionEngine, AN Hosting, and Customer Support</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/09/expressionengine-an-hosting-customer-support"/>
		<updated>2008-01-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2008/01/09/expressionengine-an-hosting-customer-support</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most often I am willing to pay a premium for a product or service that has excellent customer support. This is one (of many) reasons I buy Apple products. On a couple of occasions I have had a small issue with one of their products, I walk into a store, and they have immediately replaced it with a brand new product…it doesn’t get any better than that does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last several months I have been working on this web site as well as switching hosting providers. As I mentioned in, &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/01/02/how-we-got-here&quot; title=&quot;How We Got Here&quot;&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressionengine.com/&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt; (EE) as the software that runs this site. Yes, there are plenty of free &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system&quot; title=&quot;Content Management Systems&quot;&gt;content management systems&lt;/a&gt; (CMS) out there and there is even a free version of EE, all which would have been capable of the task. However, I opted to pay the $99 for the personal license of EE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why in the world would I pay for something when I could get it for free? Well, I knew as easy as it was to use ExpressionEngine I would have the occasional question that I would rather ask someone about than to take the limited time I had to figure it out myself. This decision has most certainly paid for itself. I have already asked dozens of questions on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressionengine.com/forums&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine Support Forum&quot;&gt;EE’s support forum&lt;/a&gt; and have received prompt responses. Just yesterday one of the EE staff members took time out of his lunch break to log into my site and fix a problem because my hosting provider refused to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my rant about poor customer support. First a little background. I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=ebohling&quot; title=&quot;WebHost4Life&quot;&gt;WebHost4Life&lt;/a&gt; (WH4L) as my provider for years; first for all of my custom .NET web sites and then more recently a second (Linux) account for my PHP-based sites. My Microsoft account has always been top-notch: very little downtime, full control of my domains, and great customer support. However, my Linux account (which I believe they outsource) is absolutely horrible. Hours and hours and hours of downtime and urgent support tickets that go DAYS without being responded to…that is just inexcusable. Hence, the need for change. After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pearsonified.com/2007/11/three_web_hosting_tips.php&quot; title=&quot;3 Things You MUST Know Before Buying Web Hosting&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; and doing some quick research I chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midphase.com/newaff/redir.pl?a=0.0803669733732058&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;creative=Banners|ANHosting|TextLinks|TextLink&amp;redirURL;=&quot; title=&quot;AN Hosting&quot;&gt;AN Hosting&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, I didn’t do my normal, insane amount of research due to the fact that I wanted to get in on the Black Friday deal they had going. While AN Hosting is still light years ahead of WH4L’s Linux hosting, I still have a gripe. On day one of the transition I could not get my .htaccess rewrites to work…nothing complex, simply removing the unnecessary index.php from our URLs, which worked on WH4L. After many days of email exchanges they finally told me that their servers were configured differently than WH4L’s and that they were unable to assist customers with any software issues (including .htaccess). Even after explaining that THEY had the knowledge of their server configs and I did not, so how in the world was I suppose to fix the problem…they essentially said, tough. OK, maybe that is a bit harsh. There was one guy that did expend a BIT of effort, but got me no where. Again, it took someone from ExpressionEngine to say, “hey, I feel for you man…let me help you over my lunch hour”…and blam within minutes my nagging issue was solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellislab.com/&quot; title=&quot;EllisLab&quot;&gt;EllisLab&lt;/a&gt; (parent company of EE) provide a hosting service as well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://enginehosting.com/&quot; title=&quot;EngineHosting&quot;&gt;EngineHosting&lt;/a&gt;. I did look at it briefly before going with AN Hosting, but I decided NOT to pay the premium for their service…needless to say I won’t make that mistake again. After my contract is up with AN Hosting you can bet that I will be switching to EngineHosting. And why? &lt;strong&gt;SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: In full disclosure the links to WebHost4Life and AN Hosting are linked to my affiliate account as some less demanding people will probably find their services just find and why not get a little something in return? Is that wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Taming Rancilio Silvia (Miss Silvia)</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/07/taming-rancilio-silvia"/>
		<updated>2008-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2008/01/07/taming-rancilio-silvia</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no other consumer espresso machine that has a bigger customer base nor the cult following than the Rancilio Silvia (aka Miss Silvia). Just do a Google search on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Rancilio+Silvia&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&quot; title=&quot;Google Search for Rancilio Silvia&quot;&gt;Rancilio Silvia&lt;/a&gt; or the more common name &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Miss+Silvia&amp;amp;btnG=Search&quot; title=&quot;Google Search for Miss Silvia&quot;&gt;Miss Silvia&lt;/a&gt; and you will start to see what I mean. Arguably it is the best home espresso machine for the money. However, she can be a bit fussy at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pulling-the-shot&quot;&gt;Pulling the shot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/01/06/taming-rancilio-rocky/&quot; title=&quot;Taming Rancilio Rocky&quot;&gt;Taming Rancilio Rocky&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned how important the grinder is to making exceptional espressos. Another variable that is so very important is (consistent) brewing temperature…which Miss Silvia (out of the box) does not do very well on her own. Again, it’s possible to train Miss Silvia to behave so not all is lost. I have read dozens and dozens of in-depth tutorials on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeegeek.com/forums/espresso/machines/18247&quot; title=&quot;Temperature Surfing&quot;&gt;temperature surfing&lt;/a&gt; Miss Silvia, but I think most will be satisfied just following the simpler instructions in this video…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe title=”YouTube video player” width=”800” height=”630” src=”http://www.youtube.com/embed/QhxvDusY3jk?rel=0” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key (at least for me) was to quickly let out some hot (steaming) water before pulling the shot. Very simple, quick step, but until I watched the video had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frothing-milk&quot;&gt;Frothing Milk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everything else to do with espresso there is A TON of information out there on frothing milk. Again, I think most will be just fine if they following the tips in the video below. However, if you have time and really won’t to be a frothing master I highly recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide&quot; title=&quot;Frothing Guide&quot;&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What surprised me in this step (other than the video abruptly ending) was to NOT let the orange “not ready” light go out when frothing milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-material&quot;&gt;Bonus Material&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is not enough for you, below is some bonus material that you may or may not find useful, but since I found them, I will share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeekid.com/archived/rancilio/cheatsilvia&quot; title=&quot;Cheating Miss Silvia&quot;&gt;Cheating Miss Silvia&lt;/a&gt;: have her ready to go in 8 minutes instead of waiting the appropriate 20+ minutes for Miss Silvia to warm up. Or just buy a $10 heavy duty (3-pronged) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=productDetail&amp;amp;productId=72203-251-TN311CL&amp;amp;lpage=none&quot; title=&quot;Heavy Duty Timer&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/a&gt; and set it to turn on at least 30 minutes before you wake up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=mvoHeE6gcjo&quot; title=&quot;Rancilio 101 video&quot;&gt;Rancilio 101 video&lt;/a&gt;. This a great overview of MOST of the key tips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wholelattelove.com/articles.cfm&quot; title=&quot;Articles from Whole Latte Love&quot;&gt;articles from Whole Latte Love&lt;/a&gt;. Covering every aspect of espresso, plus some specifically for Rocky and Silvia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/forums&quot; title=&quot;Coffee Geek Forums&quot;&gt;Coffee Geek Forums&lt;/a&gt;. One of the best forums I have found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think that about covers it. If you’ve made it this far maybe you now realize (like I did) that few will ever truly be espresso experts, but it sure is a fun journey!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Taming Rancilio Rocky</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2008/01/06/taming-rancilio-rocky"/>
		<updated>2008-01-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2008/01/06/taming-rancilio-rocky</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I stated in my previous post, I no longer possess Miss Silvia and Rocky…however, I still have plenty of friends that do own the duo so I wanted to share the knowledge I have gained in the last few years with them. First, I have to admit that I have learned more in the last month than I had in the past few years all because of one phenomenon: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot; title=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. So I will pass on my knowledge by using both videos that I have found along with some color commentary. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like speakers to an audiophile, the grinder is to a barista…I never realized that the grinder was the most important component. I read many fantastic articles, discussion threads, and reviews, but if you want to just read one, read this one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/&quot; title=&quot;Home-Barista&quot;&gt;Home-Barista.com&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-grinder-reviews.html&quot; title=&quot;Feature Spotlight on Espresso Grinders&quot;&gt;Feature Spotlight on Espresso Grinders&lt;/a&gt;. One point I would like to share from the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…serious espresso fans emphatically agree on one point: The coffee grinder is a key factor separating ordinary espresso from the extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, this was a bit surprising. While I never wanted a cheap grinder, I didn’t realize it was more important than the espresso machine. The Rocky is a great grinder, not one of the top ones for the home barista, but not far away either. But fear not, with one simple trick you can give your Rocky a little help that will really improve your espressos…just watch this video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe title=”YouTube video player” width=”800” height=”630” src=”http://www.youtube.com/embed/vgEsWqG3Zqw?rel=0” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, try this trick. As you are getting coffee grounds into your portafilter, mix it up a bit with chopsticks (or similar) and you will notice a positive difference in your shots. I was completely amazed when I first did this.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How We Got Here</title>

&lt;p&gt;Much has changed on the Web since I created my first web site in 1995. If only I would have taken screenshots my first site (or any of the hundreds that came after). Oh the days of the simple HTML tags: H1, p, img, br, etc. No Javascript, no CSS, no tables that I remember. Now, over a decade later, there are so many technologies a web developer/designer can use! There are hundreds (thousands?) of sites available that provide a vehicle to get seen by the masses. Could you imagine posting a video as simple as &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=5P6UU6m3cqk&quot; title=&quot;Hahaha&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and getting millions of people to view it before &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot; title=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;? Millions of people are leveraging these social sites to get noticed by the masses. While I like the concept, there is no simple way to have a single identity. If I like to share photos on &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot; title=&quot;Flickr&quot;&gt;Flikr&lt;/a&gt;, videos on &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot; title=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and bookmarks on &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://delicious.com&quot; title=&quot; &amp;quot;Del.icio.us&quot;&gt;Del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;, for example, it’s easiest just to point people to each site. While that may be fine for the accidental consumer of your content, that is not very user-friendly for your loyal fan base. Nor does it give you that single brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take our situation…we love sharing daily photos of Bryce, training guides, random writing, photos (other than Bryce), and now video. In the past we had separate web sites that either I developed or were on some shared environment (again the social sites), but this meant we had to send friends and family to multiple web sites which was a huge pain. For several years now I had been looking for the holy grail to this dilemma. I wanted a single web site presence and a single administration tool. This of course led me down the CMS (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system&quot; title=&quot;Content Management System&quot;&gt;content management system&lt;/a&gt;) path, which generally handle non-blog data better than blog engines like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; title=&quot;Wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot; title=&quot;Blogger&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/&quot; title=&quot;MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt;, etc. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ojr.org/ojr/images/blog_software_comparison.cfm&quot; title=&quot;blog software comparison&quot;&gt;blog software comparison&lt;/a&gt;; I am not sure why &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt; (EE) was included in the comparison as it is a CMS solution. Of course there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensourcecms.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=388&amp;amp;Itemid=184&quot; title=&quot;Open Source CMS&quot;&gt;plenty of good freebies&lt;/a&gt; and many commercial products as well. I spent several months &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmsmatrix.org/&quot; title=&quot;CMS Matrix&quot;&gt;reviewing my options&lt;/a&gt; and eventually decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com&quot; title=&quot;ExpressionEngine&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt; (the paid personal version). It’s beyond the scope of this post to go into all the reasons, but the short answer is: fantastic, fast support and easy to create a your own theme (template).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point is…it has been a long journey, but I think I finally am happy to stay put in my current virtual identity. It will certainly evolve over the upcoming months as I &lt;a href=&quot;/2007/12/31/new-year-new-site-features&quot; title=&quot;New Year New Site Features&quot;&gt;still have plenty to do&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any suggestions please let us know…which would be a lot easier if we had a contact page, huh? I guess leaving a comment will have to do for now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>New Year, New Site Features</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2007/12/31/new-year-new-site-features"/>
		<updated>2007-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2007/12/31/new-year-new-site-features</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are still working on adding a bunch more features to our web site, but we accomplished enough over the last few days to release a set of changes to celebrate the new year! Yeah, while you were hooping it up last night we were working on the site, so if you feel sorry for us please send wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work was behind-the-scenes so you, the reader, will never know why in the world so many hours was spent on these tasks. However, for me, the developer, it has given me a foundation and framework to expand on. In other words, I will be able to add new features to the web site faster with less work…which is always good. A short list of new features you will see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally opened up our blog; The Word&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modified the bottom navigation (you figure out what). Still not updated throughout site, but soon will be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created placeholders for additional features like Search, About Us, Feeds and Subscriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New, improved The Action section&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add those helpful pages like About Us, Feeds and Subscriptions, and whatever else we come up with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Site Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will let you know as we roll out these new features. Plus I am sure we will think of many more cool things to add to our site, but for now I think we have enough to do.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digital Darkroom Tip: Clarify and Sharpen</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2006/01/13/Digital-Darkroom-Tip-Clarify-Sharpen"/>
		<updated>2006-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2006/01/13/Digital-Darkroom-Tip-Clarify-Sharpen</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several years ago one of my fellow photographers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cecilwalker.com/&quot; title=&quot;check out cecil walkers website&quot;&gt;CecilWalker&lt;/a&gt;, showed me an easy, but priceless photo editing tip. I wish one of us could take credit for this, but unfortunately we can’t—nonetheless I’m glad Cecil came across the article. I’m sorry I do not remember where, so apologies to the original “founder”. All photographers, on occasion (ha), take a flat photo…I know, shocking. With a quick 2–step tweak the flat photo can be reborn into the image you really witnessed. I use this tip so much that I created two Photoshop actions. And to be honest I don’t think I’ve processed a photo in the last 2+ years that I did not use this tip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Clarify&lt;/strong&gt; In a photo editor that supports Unsharp Mask (USM) use these values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amount: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Radius: 60 pixels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Threshold: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Sharpen&lt;/strong&gt; In a photo editor that supports Unsharp Mask (USM) use these values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amount: 500%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Radius: 0.2 pixels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Threshold: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Clarify/Sharpen&lt;/strong&gt; After you create an “action” for these two steps use them in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete all your photo editing (including image resizing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply Clarify one or more times (for this sample I applied it once,
but when I’m printing I may execute the action multiple times)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply Sharpen one or more time (again, depending on your output you
may need to apply more than once)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoshop Action&lt;/strong&gt; For those that use Photoshop you can download the following ZIP file and extract to your Photoshop directory Presets\Photoshop Actions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;example: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS2\Presets\Photoshop Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update 2011.02.27&lt;/strong&gt; unfortunately the samples and the Photoshop actions have been vaporized due to multiple website &lt;em&gt;moves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Japanese Maple</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2005/11/30/Japanese-Maple"/>
		<updated>2005-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2005/11/30/Japanese-Maple</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a Japanese Maple outside my (home)
office window. For about a week now I have noticed the morning sun
illuminating its beautiful limbs, buds, morning (more like all day) dew.
Each day I would say to myself, “I should capture that moment with my
camera (Canon EOS 20D).” I finally did or at least I finally &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt;
to, I’m hoping you will let me know what you think of the outcome. I
would love to capture a three to five photo series. I don’t think I’ve
got it yet, but thought I would see what you thought. Below are four
photos that I took relatively quickly. I know they are small images, but
not everyone has broadband access, so I try to be considerate to the
handicapped. No offense meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/200511_20d_12453.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese Maple Series 1&quot; /&gt;
######Japanese Maple Series Photo 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/200511_20d_12454.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese Maple Series 2&quot; /&gt;
######Japanese Maple Series Photo 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/200511_20d_12455.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese Maple Series 3&quot; /&gt;
######Japanese Maple Series Photo 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/200511_20d_12456.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese Maple Series 4&quot; /&gt;
######Japanese Maple Series Photo 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which ones (if any) do you like? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**[update] **While I respect the
comments I have received so far and I do agree that normally series are
not all the same (or very similar shots)…I’m daring to be different. Let
me try to explain…I’m striving for a three photo series that upon first
glance looks like identical (or nearly identical) photos. This should
intrigue the viewer to take a closer look—at least that’s my hope. And
when they do look closer they will start to notice differences…maybe
some obvious ones, but some slight ones as well. Remember the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suck.com/daily/2001/06/01/&quot;&gt;Hocus-Focus 2–panel cartoon in the
comics&lt;/a&gt;—that’s what I’m after.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Angel Sweet Gelato</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2005/10/26/Angel-Sweet-Gelato"/>

&lt;p&gt;Now that we will be leaving Arizona within four days we are hitting our favorite restaurants one last time. One of our favorite places to get dessert is Angel Sweet—we’ve been going there for a couple of years now and they are easily the best place to get gelato in the Phoenix area. Owned by an ASU grad, Hiro, I cannot remember the Italian company, but I do remember that it is the only one in the entire United States. If you are ever anywhere near Dobson and Chandler Blvd (Northeast corner)—you must stop in for some gelato…you won’t regret it. It will be one of the top ten restaurants we miss about Arizona!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>No Turning Back Now!</title>
		<link href="http://brandonbohling.com/2005/10/25/No-Turning-Back-Now"/>
		<updated>2005-10-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
		<id>http://brandonbohling/2005/10/25/No-Turning-Back-Now</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that have not heard, this week we say good-bye to Arizona—our home of nine years! While we will &lt;strong&gt;greatly miss&lt;/strong&gt; our friends here in Arizona and our many favorite destinations of the beautiful Southwest…we are extremely excite about our next chapter (or better yet, book) of the Northwest. To be honest, our decision to move out of state happened rather quickly (about two months) and is rather complex. Fortunately we work for Intel so our jobs will remain the same (there is a several Intel campuses within 30 minutes of our house in Forest Grove), but it was the need for personal changes that drove the decision. For those that know us, we love to explore our surroundings on weekends—going hiking, camping, photo expeditions, etc. And while the Southwest has years worth of exploration we felt we had seen the highlights—multiple times. Bottom line, we were getting a little stagnant, so we were looking for new experiences and what better place than the Great Northwest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/0620422427_200509_20D_11221.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Forest Grove Home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the climate will be a big change for us, but we plan on embracing our changes and start a new book in our lives. I’m sure there will be many tears shed this weekend when we leave our house (of seven years), but at the same time are excited about what is to come. Again, working at Intel, we have many friends in Oregon, so are looking forward to making new friends and reconnecting with friends that have migrated to Oregon as well. Stay tuned as we share our experiences from our latest adventures! &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Costa Rica</title>

I just returned from a six day trip to Costa Rica. Unfortunately it was for work so I did not have much free time. However, I did manage to set aside some time for photography. In the next week I will work on posting a gallery…though I should work on an Alaska gallery considering that trip was months ago. I did post several photos from Costa Rica on my photo blog though: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.digitalbohling.com/&quot;&gt;http://blog.digitalbohling.com&lt;/a&gt;, so make sure you visit that site. In the meantime, I did create a Costa Rica wallpaper (updated 2011.02.27 - cannot find wallpaper) if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
