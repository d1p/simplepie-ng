She's a big Doctor Who fan so i think she gets a kick out of me discovering all the aspects of the show fresh. I've heard a lot of the Weeping Angels, so when i saw the episode(s) I thought this would be a great image. Hopefully I can get the painting done sometime this week. I may end up doing a digital piece as well as a painting. Be great to have on your wall; just make sure you never Blink.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-2090990494808577365?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/2090990494808577365/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=2090990494808577365' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2090990494808577365'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2090990494808577365'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/05/painting-rough-weeping-angel.html' title='Painting Rough: Weeping Angel'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S_ohQHeNPAI/AAAAAAAAARw/-An31AtJa9s/s72-c/weeping_angels_3+copy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-342995139764613570</id><published>2010-05-20T22:44:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-20T22:44:28.389-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Art'/><title type='text'>Painting Rough</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S_YActtd0DI/AAAAAAAAARo/xweMnlB9dQI/s1600/delirium_rough.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S_YActtd0DI/AAAAAAAAARo/xweMnlB9dQI/s400/delirium_rough.jpg" width="266" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A digital rough of a painting i'm hoping to get done in the next week or so.

After I had found it wasn't a remake but a more Alice Returns to Wonderland. It's an good movie; not great, but like other Burton movies it's fun to watch. The characters are great; the actors and animators bring awesome subtle&amp;nbsp;nuances&amp;nbsp;to everything. Johnny Depp really brings a broken element to the Hatter. And the interaction with him and the Cheshire Cat is awesome. It's a movie I'll probably buy on DVD.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-1959146235683968475?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/1959146235683968475/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=1959146235683968475' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/1959146235683968475'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/1959146235683968475'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/03/sketches-cat-hat.html' title='Sketches: Cat &amp; a Hat.'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S6KNJrdOO3I/AAAAAAAAARI/qC-Qgo5sGP8/s72-c/sketch_cheshire.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-5724310954422922417</id><published>2010-03-12T09:23:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2010-03-12T09:23:00.547-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sketches'/><title type='text'>Sketches: The Kids are Alright</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5gek7VmA7I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/kHB7fCTKvus/s1600-h/sketches_03" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="302" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5gek7VmA7I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/kHB7fCTKvus/s400/sketches_03" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;[Image: ink on bristol; Canson&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.fanboypaper.com/products.php?id=3"&gt;Make Your Own Manga Book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Just another art piece.

The stores in Dallas are pretty overpriced in comparison. My thought is that the Denton shops have a&amp;nbsp;guaranteed&amp;nbsp;sale numbers with the art school; the Dallas ones not so much. Anyways, last time I was there i picked up two small Canson&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.fanboypaper.com/products.php?id=3"&gt;Make Your Own Manga Book&lt;/a&gt;; it's pretty neat. It's a bit more disposable than a nice moleskin and a notch above a regular sketchbook.&amp;nbsp;I try and sketch in it everyday to keep myself in practice. Plus i picked up some new inking tools; a nice pentel pen and a brush pen. I've been looking at more loose art styles (Sean Murphy, Rob Guillory, Skottie Young); so it's fun to experiment with these new toys. I may need to buy new ones soon though; I am TEARING through the ink. Which, by the way, is actually good ink. I usually hate the ink that comes in (brush) pens.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-7056046580286592286?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/7056046580286592286/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=7056046580286592286' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7056046580286592286'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7056046580286592286'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/03/sketches-scarecrow-and-slimer.html' title='Sketches: Scarecrow and Slimer'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5gcynuf-nI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/yKeTccZZl0o/s72-c/sketches_02' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-7909064074708019068</id><published>2010-03-09T13:01:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2010-03-22T11:44:13.170-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comic Conventions'/><title type='text'>STAPLE! 2010 (March 6) Recap</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5Vr6Cm8uyI/AAAAAAAAAQY/QFa5hLKucto/s1600-h/IMG_2369_b.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5Vr6Cm8uyI/AAAAAAAAAQY/QFa5hLKucto/s320/IMG_2369_b.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;[image: Ruby doing a commission at her table.]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We wrapped up another &lt;a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/"&gt;STAPLE!&lt;/a&gt; appearance this previous weekend. The show itself was pretty good. The surrounding events on the other hand was pretty hectic. First off, the hotel was all sorts of confusing. We booked at a&amp;nbsp;Radisson but the hotel had a Holiday Inn sign.&amp;nbsp;Apparently&amp;nbsp;we were there right in time for the conversion (Front desk: "As you can see, when you wake up, we'll be a Holiday Inn"; me: 0_o). Not something we can't mentally handle after an 8hr day and a 3hr drive driving around looking for a Radisson. Oddly enough, the hotel was awesome as a&amp;nbsp;Radisson and is terrible as a Holiday Inn. Funny how that works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, the con itself was pretty good with some odd hiccups. Some things couldn't be helped (like the venue was broken into the previous night and had some of its light controls stolen; i know, WTF); other things could have been handled better (tables didn't have numbers on them and the person helping with tables had the map upside down; thus confusing a lot of people). I won't hold these things against the con itself; but it does give me pause about what to expect at future shows and events. We had a weird vibe going into this one so I'm going to chalk it up to "shit happens". Granted, STAPLE! is the odd show; over the three years we've been there really hasn't been any&amp;nbsp;consistency&amp;nbsp;as to what sells and what people look at. This year was a mix of art collectors and book buyers; which was different from years previous (2008: We sold books, but no prints; 2009: I sold a lot of prints, but no books). Though the guys said they had people read their entire books, say "that was cool", then walk off without purchasing anything. That's new to us for STAPLE!, so I wonder if it's the economy or an influx of a "Borders is a library" demographic. We didn't bother going to the after-party; we drove past the venue and didn't see parking for about four blocks. We just decided to hang out at the hotel and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=reprebrenting2010%20"&gt;repreBrent&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it just better to chillax after a convention at the homebase and not bother with all the festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sold a few copies of the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=45&amp;amp;products_id=3335"&gt;pinup book&lt;/a&gt;; a few people had bought the first volume and actually came to find me to pick up volume 2, which is nice. We didn't do superwell at this show (Evan did though, but he deserves it after his last STAPLE! of making $6 and a whooping $2 take from the year previous that). But that's the ebb and flow of conventions.&amp;nbsp;Our streak of &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #674ea7;"&gt;[Awesome]&lt;/span&gt; shows didn't break, but floundered a bit.&amp;nbsp;This wasn't as bad as the &lt;a href="http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2008/09/baltimore-comic-con-total-perspective.html"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; convention; but not our best of conventions either. Either way, you can't let these shows beat you down too much or you'll just get depressed. Time to pick myself up and move on.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-7909064074708019068?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/7909064074708019068/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=7909064074708019068' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7909064074708019068'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7909064074708019068'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/03/staple-2010-march-6-recap.html' title='STAPLE! 2010 (March 6) Recap'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S5Vr6Cm8uyI/AAAAAAAAAQY/QFa5hLKucto/s72-c/IMG_2369_b.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-2734070096797055195</id><published>2010-03-03T06:43:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2010-03-03T06:43:00.096-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comic Conventions'/><title type='text'>STAPLE! 2010 (March 6)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S4wXE7bAjtI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/bLd1uLJjspU/s1600-h/FP_Auditorum2010.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5443751423021977298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S4wXE7bAjtI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/bLd1uLJjspU/s320/FP_Auditorum2010.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 320px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 242px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[image: table map for STAPLE! 2010]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://space-gun.com/"&gt;Space-Gun Studios&lt;/a&gt; is hitting the road again for this year &lt;a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/"&gt;STAPLE! the Independent Media Expo&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, TX. It is a great indy show with no dealers; it is all creators and publishers. There isn't a panel for the cast of Lost or a screening of The Ghost Whisperer; STAPLE! is about the love of comics. Space-Gun Studios will be sitting at tables 28-30 with our books from ICBW (if you haven't picked one up already). Sitting with us will be my girlfriend Ruby Caston, she'll have her sketchbook on hand for sale. I'll have copies of &lt;a href="http://www.indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3335"&gt;Gun Gals|Blade Babes: Vol 2&lt;/a&gt; on hand, not many for this particular print run though. Hopefully I'll be able to get some prints done for the show too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year's afterparty will be held at &lt;a href="http://do512.com/event/2010/03/06/staple-afterparty-live-art-show?utm_campaign=2010&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=share&amp;amp;utm_content=event"&gt;Shangri La&lt;/a&gt; off of 6th Street. The STAPLE! afterparties are always great with music and live art; and all the proceeds from the the show will be benefitting a local community radio station called &lt;a href="http://koop.org/index.php"&gt;KOOP! Radio&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately with the location right off of 6th Street on a Saturday night, finding a place to park will be an adventure. Remember to bring some cash for parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check out my photos from our previous trips: &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157614918135135/"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157604027643082/"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAPLE! &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Staple-Independent-Media-Expo/43382931012"&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAPLE! 2010 &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=185707397886&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;Facebook Event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-2734070096797055195?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/2734070096797055195/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=2734070096797055195' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2734070096797055195'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2734070096797055195'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/03/staple-2010-march-6.html' title='STAPLE! 2010 (March 6)'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S4wXE7bAjtI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/bLd1uLJjspU/s72-c/FP_Auditorum2010.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-1584393829866379975</id><published>2010-02-10T13:23:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2010-02-10T13:23:00.726-06:00</updated><title type='text'>California Trip / Blizzcon 2009</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S3MEOvxLnfI/AAAAAAAAAP4/Qp3t621RL4A/s1600-h/3867330470_e9823c20b1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S3MEOvxLnfI/AAAAAAAAAP4/Qp3t621RL4A/s320/3867330470_e9823c20b1.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5436693826553748978" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;[This is a mix of a recap of my trip to California and a convention report of sorts for Blizzcon 2009. Fall 09 was not a great time for me and I didn't get to finishing this post for awhile. If you are just looking for BlizzCon information, look for the bold "&lt;b&gt;Blizzcon&lt;/b&gt;"below. Pictures from my trip can be found on my Flickr: &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157622049810199/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157621999595941/"&gt;Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the middle of August of 2009, I was able to spend some time in California with my friends for Blizzcon 2009. It was a great trip and something really welcomed at that time. A lot had been falling apart one right after another; and so it turns out taking some time out to collect myself was something I really needed. Sometimes stepping away for just a bit to catch your breath is necessary. I wasn't going to go because I couldn't get a ticket for Ruby, but she insisted. She told me that I needed the fun and that I should go; this is why I have such an awesome girlfriend. So in exchange she got my swag bag from the con. I also owe the trip to Nam and Kim, who helped with my way there and the Blizzcon ticket. They are the reason why I had such a great time out there.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip was awesome. [&lt;i&gt;Funny Note&lt;/i&gt;: our plane to Cali was FULL of Blizzcon attendees. I saw dozens of WoW apparel, and even the senior couple in front of us were talking about their paladins. It was hilarious). Nam's cousin Kim let the group of us crash with her for the week. I hadn't seen her in years; back when she use to call me Looney Tunes (for reason I'll go into if you ask me, but the short of it is that people use to pronounce my name "Loon"). So being able to hang out with her was pretty sweet. Kim and our friend Nancy have been out in Cali for a while so it was great being having people who knew all the great places to eat around town. They took us to some of the best eateries I have ever been to; I want to go back just hang with Kim and Nancy and eat all day. It was that amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kim lead us on a tour of the Blizzard Campus. It was amazing; it is the ULTIMATE workplace. The environment was pretty casual but had a real sense of high, professional standards. Because we were with Kim, we got a slightly different tour of the buildings than the regular press people. It was really personal and we got a chance to really check out the place. The creative areas were exactly the environments I dream of working in. Being able to see these workplaces actually exists really helped my spirits and determination. It was a great month for seeing various workspaces and how they reflect the personalities that are involved (see &lt;a href="http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/08/helpful-gps.html"&gt;Atlanta Road Trip!&lt;/a&gt; post). You can tell that the company works really hard but also has a lot of fun. Kim later showed us the DVD of their company-wide Rock Band competition. It wasn't a little competition in a break room. I'm talking outdoor stage, lights, fog machines, and costumes of a competition. Even the president of the company was in one of the bands. Seriously an awesome company.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The real highlight of the tour was meeting Trent Kaniuga. Kim had gotten wind that I am a big Kaniuga fan and led us through the maze of the campus to find Trent. He has been a big influence on my art style. Anyone who seems me draw can see it. Several times someone would look at my art and ask "Have you ever heard of a comic called CreeD?"; it's that obvious. I had brought all my CreeD books with me just in case I had the chance to run into him. I hadn't expected Kim to take us by his desk. I'm naturally an introvert so it was really difficult to not have it become an episode of the Chris Farley Show. Trent was really nice though and put up with my fanboy-ism. He's seems to be a really humble guy; and was nice enough to give us some of his mini-comics (i say mini-comics because of the size, these were full color books on some really slick paperstock) and sign my small stack of books. He told us of his first convention at the age of 16 or so. If I remember correctly, the convention was at a mall (I KNOW!) and his publisher was dressed up as Spider-Man trying to get people to come over to their table. He said it was horrible but amusing to look upon. I hope I didn't come across as too much of a fanboy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S3MEWf7HKeI/AAAAAAAAAQA/1eYiC-VpHBM/s320/3849880819_4746e975b3.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5436693959739386338" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for the &lt;b&gt;Blizzcon&lt;/b&gt; itself, it was a freaking madhouse. I dubbed it LineCon as there was huge line for EVERYTHING. However I will give it to the Blizzard and the convention center that lines were really organized and everything really moved at a brisk pace. Example: to get your pass for the con, they had people checking paperwork throughout the line so when you get into the front it was all easy peasy, click, scan, boom! We never stood still for more than a minute. Except for opening day. The line to get in for Day One wrapped around the building. I heard people were there since pre-dawn (doors opened i think at 11). I'm so glad we got to crash with Kim in her hotel room. Finding a place to park would have been a nightmare.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The con was awesome and HUGE. The space was epic; which was needed to house the few thousand attendees, the booths, and the platoons of computers. Because of how the convention center is setup, everything was really easy to find. You really felt welcomed by Blizzard and they really showed their love for the fans. The panels were great for fans of any of the various franchises, the gaming areas were super sweet, and for the most part the attendees were pretty laid back. You can tell a lot of them were there as hardcore WoW players. But we were eagerly awaiting to get our hands on the Diablo demo. We went through the line several times, trying out all the classes. The Starcraft demo left me craving for more; and the WoW: Cataclysm demo reminded me why the game is so damn good. Our swag bag came with a little bottle of hand-sanitizer, which we used liberally after every demo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Security at the show was pretty annoying, but nothing like the airport. They just had to check you bag every time you entered; but it wasn't an involved search. Just a quick visual scan and off you went. Oddly enough they didn't allow you to bring in drinks; even bottles of soda that you bought INSIDE of the convention hall. You could see the soda machine from the security checkpoint. I asked one of the security guys about it; he just shrugged and said he knew it was silly but it's a rule of the convention center. Luckily they had cash bars all over the place, which incidentally were cheaper than the hotel bar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The concert was awesome and through the roof Crazy Train. People were already sitting down for the concert (which starts at 4PM) at noon. The Artists Formally Known as Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain (aka TAFKAL80ETC) were great. They're an in-house band made up of Blizzard employees; which includes senior art director Samwise Didier on vocals and company president Mike Morhaime on bass. I only tell you this because it was surprising how many people didn't know who these people are. I mean, c'MON, they only make the games you love so much and play EVERYDAY. And how awesome is it for a bunch of game designers with essentially their garage band open up for the Ozzy Ozborn himself? The Ozzy show was a pure bedlam. They tried to keep the fans out of the aisles but the power of the Prince of Darkness drove the crowd to rush to the stage. The security just gave up and it was on from there. I was able to get about 20 feet from the stage, but it was like trudging through mud: just wet and smelly. The wet wasn't just the fans, Ozzy was throwing buckets of water at the audience. I had to leave. We left to another hall to watch it on the massive projection screens there. Ozzy put on a great show, but I think he was a bit thrown off by the fans. I mean, gamers are great people, but they do not have the absolute rabid ferocity of pure metal heads. It was wonderful show though and Ozzy can still rock the mic. He completely owns the stage.&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  line-height: 19px; font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Overall it was an &lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#6600CC;"&gt;[Awesome Con]&lt;/span&gt;. It was very well organized and you can tell they are having as much fun as the fans. The con was also filled with company swag, not only from Blizzard but from all the vendors as well. I brought home a whole goodie bag of stuff. Unfortunately everyone else wanted the same swag so there were a lot of lines for swag that had to be won via some sort of carnival game. If you are a fan of any of the Blizzard franchises, you should find a way to get to this con when they have it again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-1584393829866379975?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/1584393829866379975/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=1584393829866379975' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/1584393829866379975'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/1584393829866379975'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/02/california-trip-blizzcon-2009.html' title='California Trip / Blizzcon 2009'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S3MEOvxLnfI/AAAAAAAAAP4/Qp3t621RL4A/s72-c/3867330470_e9823c20b1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-7238975786934355091</id><published>2010-02-08T17:09:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2010-02-08T17:09:00.330-06:00</updated><title type='text'>So you want to be a freelancer?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;Some of us freelance while in school, some of us freelance on the side of our main jobs, and some of us freelance full time. I freelanced full time for three and a half years; and I did it even longer if you count the side gigs I did during my college years. I’ve recently aquired a full-time position as a production artist so it looks like my corporate freelance days are over. So as I work through a whole other set of rules and proceedures, I wanted to write about some of my experiences as a freelancer and leave some tips that I've picked up over the years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the main difference so far between working full-time and freelancing is actually social. As a freelancer, people are fleeting. Names are forever temporary; more than likely you’ll only deal with a small number of people at any given time. For the most part, I was always assigned to a single designer or art director. Most of my contact with the company was through this one person. I do the work, hand it off, and it evaporates somewhere into the company. It’ll come back magically with red marks from various hands from clandestine meetings that I never saw. This means I never see much of the company past the creative department. That would change once you get into long term assignments; but for the most part, onsite gigs will fall between one day to a month.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Parking is always a fun adventure for a new gig. Sometimes it's fairly easy, just a big parking lot with some reserved spots. Other times they ask you park in one area and stay out of the "Visitor" spots. And the most fun times is when the gig is downtown, where finding a spot is all sorts of headaches. I try to take the DART rail when it was a downtown gig; most places are within walking distance from one of the stops. So on your first day, be sure to ask someone if you parked in the right area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dress codes will change from place to place. Some are very casual, some are a bit more business. For the most part you won't be needing a suit and tie as a freelancer. One of my agencies was fairly consistant with informing me of the dress code. However, if I don't have that information up front, I'd default to a polo and slacks both usually in black. I always wore my Vans instead of your usual business shoes. I just made sure they were always of a solid dark color. I never had anyone comment on them. I always kept myself fairly well groomed; nothing too outrageous. After the first day you can assess what the office policies are.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over the years I developed a “freelance bag”. It was a dedicated bag, separate from my art bag, that I took to all my gigs. I added and subtracted items over the years; but anything that I put into the bag stayed in the bag. It just became a hassle to try to remember to take stuff out or put stuff in constantly. &lt;b&gt;VERY IMPORTANT NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: You everything you bring into a gig, you have to take with you at the end of the day. There was one occasion where I got an email after I left the office that the gig is over. I never got a chance to get back to the office for my stuff. And honestly, offices have the gamut of different personalities. You never know who's going to be slim shady; so only leave behind stuff that you feel you can easily replace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouse&lt;/b&gt;: This is really important. You never know what sort of mouse you’ll be assigned when you come in. Sometimes the scroll button doesn’t work; or it will only scroll one way. For a while I kept getting mice with an actual ball instead of an optical. When you are on assignment for a single day, it’s much easier to just have one handy than try to find a spare one from the tech guy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notepad&lt;/b&gt;: You’ll be taking a lot of notes; and I mean &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of notes. UserIDs, PWs, server addresses, file locations, phone numbers, extensions, meeting rooms, etc. I use a small 6x9, top spiral bound lined notebook. Finding scrap paper for notes can be a real hassle. Best to have one ready.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Good Ballpoint Pen&lt;/b&gt;: Office pens are horrible and usually out of ink. The ones you find around the office are usually the scraps because the office manager is strict with handing out office supplies. I recommend a ballpoint because it can right on most surfaces and won't bleed through the paper. You’ll be filling out form for job spec and initialing proofs on all sorts of paper so it’s best to have something universal. Plus ballpoint ink will not bleed if it gets wet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlighter&lt;/b&gt;: At every place I’ve worked, changes were always marked up on a printout. So i would mark the changes I did as I went along. Highlighter are the best for this because you can still read any text after you marked it. I do not recommend getting a yellow one. Yellow highlighters don't stand out on white; pink or blue really pops on the page.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jump Drive/External HD&lt;/b&gt;: As a freelancer sometimes you don’t have access to email, some servers, etc. This is the best way to get your files around the office. You won’t always find a blank CD/DVD to burn to. Plus it’s a handy way for you to carry around your reference files and preferences. Though remember to double check with your AD about any stock photography/patterns that you would like to use. This include fonts; only use the fonts that they have loaded. Companies have a responsibility to show proof of purchase for any stock/font used in their designs. I only bring with me textures and patterns that I created myself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hand Sanitizer&lt;/b&gt;: The office is like kindergarten: it’s a freaking petri dish of germs. You’re in a small enclosed environment for hours at a time. Bathrooms, printer stations, etc. are used by everyone in the office. And as a freelancer you don’t get paid sick-days.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Headphones&lt;/b&gt;: My philosophy with headphones is the bigger the better. You’ll have audiophiles tell you that it’s about directional speakers or sound proofing or whatever. Putting on huge headphones is the office signal for “leave me alone”. There’s a lot going on in the office around you: meetings, office chatter, personal calls, TV talk, etc. As a freelancer, most of the time you are there to help out an understaffed department/team. So more than likely you’re going to be slammed with work. Being able to block out the world to rock and roll on InDesign files is probably in your best interest. Plus it’ll come in handy when you get stuck next to talkative co-worker. Ug.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash&lt;/b&gt;: I’m talking actual cash, dollah dollah bills, ya'll. I carry a small handful of change in my bag for the vending machines. Being able to grab a snack or a drink is always a good idea. A few $1 won’t hurt either.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traveler’s Mug&lt;/b&gt;: Most offices will have some coffee around for free. One gig even had a free soda fountain in their break room. At the very least, all offices will have a water fountain. But they won’t always have cups for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Badge Holder&lt;/b&gt;: I’m talking about the one with a clip, preferably one that is retractable. If you do get a badge, two things are pretty likely. &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt;: with security awareness on the rise, you’ll need to have it visible at all times. &lt;i&gt;Two&lt;/i&gt;: you’ll need to scan it to get in and around the building. Having it on a retractable clip is easier than having it in your pocket or around your neck.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tablet&lt;/b&gt;: If you can swing having one with you, I'd say do it. You'll never know when you'll be ask to do an illustration or a retouch on a photo. Having the tablet will make this much easier. You'll be able to grab the drivers from the website at any time. Whether or not you'll have access to install them is another story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;File Folder&lt;/b&gt;: Handy to keep all your freelance paperwork together like timesheets, NDAs, office policies, etc. &lt;i&gt;Anything&lt;/i&gt; you sign, ask for a copy. Your paperwork is your own business, and you'll have to look after yourself. One freelance agency that I used had their own timesheet/invoice so I kept a few copies in there. On the actual folder I wrote the agency's main number and fax. Every office has different internet security, I never know whether or not I'll be able to get into my personal email to get those numbers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Being able to handle yourself well and working at your best is really important as a freelancer. And the best way to do that is to be prepared. You performance on any given day will determine the likelihood of getting called back in the future. Plus the design community is actually very small. Having ADs and HR speak highly of you to industry friends will be a great help to your career and bank account.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-7238975786934355091?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/7238975786934355091/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=7238975786934355091' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7238975786934355091'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/7238975786934355091'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/02/so-you-want-to-be-freelancer.html' title='So you want to be a freelancer?'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-4604379695108476831</id><published>2010-02-05T10:10:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2010-02-05T10:10:00.737-06:00</updated><title type='text'>ICBW: The Inside Story</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S2w9DH4YFSI/AAAAAAAAAPw/A5MyqmFbUTo/s1600-h/4230968594_3ca0cf9d9e_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S2w9DH4YFSI/AAAAAAAAAPw/A5MyqmFbUTo/s320/4230968594_3ca0cf9d9e_o.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5434785974193755426" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[Photos can be found on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157622981869269/"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="www.facebook.com/pages/Breaking-Comics/131528365665"&gt;Breaking Comics Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page. Feel free to tag yourself and your book on the Fb photos. NOTE: this posting was created a while back, I thought I had posted it before. I guess not.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;My last post was the very beginning of &lt;a href="http://www.indycomicbookweek.com/"&gt;Indy Comic Book Week&lt;/a&gt; and I think it would be appropriate to pay it off with an insider's recap of sorts. ICBW started out with a flyer made by &lt;a href="http://www.pulpmessenger.com/?p=715"&gt;Kyle Latino&lt;/a&gt; and his concept of Deadline '09. It got passed from one creator to another before it reached us at &lt;a href="http://www.space-gun.com/"&gt;Space-Gun Studios&lt;/a&gt;. Matt really jumped on the idea and bought the ICBW domain; and I took it upon myself to write up a posting for it. Though hesitant because we were essentially swiping Kyle's idea for Diamond's Skip Week, we moved forward as fast and hard as we could due to the amount of time we had. (Thankfully we were able to contact Kyle and he was actually happy that we were doing something with his idea. So much thanks to Kyle for letting us run on our own with this event.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in California for &lt;a href="http://us.blizzard.com/blizzcon/?rhtml=y"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; at the time with friends including Nam and Kim, both of whom i give mighty and big thanks for helping me take the trip. And much thanks to Ruby who essentially made me go have fun. I'll try to get a recap for that trip at some point. Anyways, when the idea of ICBW was born, I was sitting on the floor at the coffee table with my laptop (given to me by my lovely girlfriend). The laptop isn't setup for work so I had nothing loaded on it in regards to graphics and fonts. I was lucky enough to remember that we had one of our projects still on the server; so then I had to wait for the 500MBs to download. While the zip file downloaded, I was trying to find the right words for the post, help Nam with dinner, play with the lovable dog, and come up with an idea for a graphic. I'm surprised it came out as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entry was posted and it was off to the races. The &lt;a href="http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/08/indy-comic-book-week.html"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; had a bigger reach than I had expected and the twitter hashtag started to spread. Paul was elected to come up with a logo, Matt worked up a website and found someone to do a proper press release for us, and Jake and I went to talk with Jeremy, the owner of &lt;a href="http://www.titancomics.com/"&gt;Titan Comics&lt;/a&gt; here in Dallas. We met up with him for a brunch of sorts and this is where we got tricked, TRICKED i say! We went into the brunch hoping for two things: contact information for the indie friendly DFW shops, and an idea of what the retailers would need from us (as ICBW and creators). What we left with as a massive list of stores across the nation and various contacts for distributors, sales reps, and retail sites to send our press release. In that one talk over breakfast foods, we suddenly had a LOT of people to contact and a much wider scope to contend with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point ICBW essentially turned into a tag-team match. During these four months we all had other projects to handle outside of running ICBW. I had just gotten the script for an educational comic that I was hired to illustrate; and I had a massive amount of pages to letter for Jake and Matt. Matt was doing side gigs to make the bills and he also had to finish up his ICBW book "&lt;a href="http://www.soulcore.net/artblog/?cat=77"&gt;Senryu&lt;/a&gt;". Jake wrapped up his educational comic, do ANOTHER book for them, and then immediately had to finish his script for "&lt;a href="http://jakeekiss.blogspot.com/2009/11/solomon-azua-full-preview.html"&gt;Solomon Azua&lt;/a&gt;" to begin production. As each of us tagged out to work, the others held down the fort as best as we could. It was pretty fast-paced and hectic four months with high levels of stress. There was a few moments were one of us played the role Ricky Morton, but we somehow got the hot tag and kept the momentum going. We all eventually finished our projects and were able to hit the triple dropkick on the final month of promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We broke up the time leading up to ICBW into three different segments; each segment had a different target market: creators, retailers, and fans. First we talked to creators who were interested in releasing their books for ICBW. This was mainly done through blog posts, twitters, and forum postings. Our goal here was to get everyone signed up for the blog and start posting stuff from their books. This created the momentum we needed to approach the second group: retailers. &lt;a href="http://snackhack.com/shenton/"&gt;Tony Shenton&lt;/a&gt; really helped us out by posting our press release to his list of retailers. The online activities on the blog and twitter gave retailers something to look at as a means of gauging interest. So when we contacted each shop directly, they had already heard of ICBW from somewhere. With both creators and shops signed up for ICBW, we had a louder voice to get the word out to the fans. At this point the various news sites and podcasts started their coverage of ICBW. We had sent out our press release much earlier. But we didn't see much movement in terms of news coverage; which was expected. We found that information going out to the fans really wouldn't be effective until about two weeks before the event. Trying to keep fans interested for three months would have been near impossible to maintain. So December got flooded with interviews, reviews, and podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like our experience with Synesthtic, we were dealing with a wide array of personalities, attention spans, and intentions. Most were pretty understanding of our focused goal for ICBW and were easy to communicate with. Others had their own agendas and were ignoring everything we were putting up on the web. The headaches were few but they were pretty loud. We did our best to keep these out of the public light as to not taint the positive vibe we were putting forth with the event. The independent market is already stereotyped with the jaded, elitist creator; and we didn't want to have that sort of image represent ICBW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think because of this professional and positive attitude we were able to really gain a lot of momentum. This is the outcome of a very important lesson: people will treat you with as much respect and professionalism as you put forward. And sometimes you can super pro about a situation but the other party will still come back at you with a foul attitude. With a project this big and wide in scope, there is a lot of diplomacy involved when dealing with difficult personalities. I find that if you never stoop to their level, they will have no legs to stand on in future arguments. This is especially true in today's email environment where any heated exchange can be recalled with a simple click. And with the nature of ICBW, nearly ALL of communications was done via email. It's a tough standard to hold sometimes, especially with ignorant and stubborn personalities. But I think it is worth it in the end. ICBW was fairly well received as an event and as a group. Hostilities were kept to a minimum, bridges were formed, and we all benefitted from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-4604379695108476831?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/4604379695108476831/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=4604379695108476831' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4604379695108476831'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4604379695108476831'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2010/02/icbw-inside-story.html' title='ICBW: The Inside Story'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/S2w9DH4YFSI/AAAAAAAAAPw/A5MyqmFbUTo/s72-c/4230968594_3ca0cf9d9e_o.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-5494824918239438795</id><published>2009-08-27T03:05:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-27T04:00:04.110-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Indy Comic Book Week</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SpZKb4I7b1I/AAAAAAAAAOg/Cc9KTTkQQPg/s1600-h/sgs_indy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SpZKb4I7b1I/AAAAAAAAAOg/Cc9KTTkQQPg/s400/sgs_indy.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5374565048100024146" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The other week &lt;span name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/public" target="_blank"&gt;Diamond Comic Distributors&lt;/a&gt; announced to comic shops that Diamond will not be shipping comics on the last week of December. That means on Wednesday, December 30th, there will not be any new comics on the shelf of your local comic shop. There has been some talk about Diamond's firm hold on the comic distribution industry, but I want to look past that and look at the opportunity this creates for small publishers and local comic book creators. This is a perfect storm that opens up those new release shelves for the independent community. We don't have to be set aside to the small publisher shelf for once and can stand tall in the spots that the big, national publishers usually take. Not only is this an opportunity for creators, it's a great opportunity for the reader as well. Instead of picking up their usual books, they can check out something new, different, and most likely something local.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I'm putting forth this idea to the comic book community. Let's turn "No Comic Book Week" into "Indy Comic Book Week". Creators, let's step up and put those books together. This is our chance to show the world that our books and creations can stand strong on those shelves as well as any major publication. It doesn't have to be a 22-page full color affair; it can be a small black-and-white ashcan. But it has to be new, it has to be a product of your own creation, and it has to be awesome. Then talk to your local comic shops about putting your book on those shelves for the week of December 30th. Comic book readers, go to your local comic shops and tell them you want to see "Indy Comic Book Week" on the new release shelves. Tell them you want to see something new and different on those shelves. Comic book retailers, show some support for your local creators by filling those new release shelves with great indy books and hopefully open up your patrons to something new that they would not have read otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get the news out there guys. For you twitters out there, use the hashtag #&lt;/span&gt;indycomicbookweek to show your comics, your progress shots, and your support for creators and comic shops. This is a great opportunity so let's step up and get it done!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-5494824918239438795?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/5494824918239438795/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=5494824918239438795' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5494824918239438795'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5494824918239438795'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/08/indy-comic-book-week.html' title='Indy Comic Book Week'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SpZKb4I7b1I/AAAAAAAAAOg/Cc9KTTkQQPg/s72-c/sgs_indy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-5665210992475902489</id><published>2009-08-20T04:37:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-20T05:14:54.873-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comic Conventions'/><title type='text'>Dallas Comic Con August 2009 Recap</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/So0ZrefsNoI/AAAAAAAAAOI/pphAdcaIRlo/s1600-h/3828245618_cf9e05e90a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/So0ZrefsNoI/AAAAAAAAAOI/pphAdcaIRlo/s320/3828245618_cf9e05e90a.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5371978165233923714" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[the Ruby enjoying her weekend working with &lt;a href="http://www.titancomics.com/"&gt;Titan Comics&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;more photos can be found on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157622058336756/"&gt;flickr account&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Mark and Ben really knocked this one out of the freaking part. The show was craaaaazy big for what it usually is. The crowd was seriously huge, especially for such a small venue. The J. Scott line wrapped around the civic center; which unfortunately cut us off from the main vein of traffic. Nothing against DCC, it's just how the venue is built. There's no real good way to handle a line that big there. Hopefully these bigger shows will keep up and they'll be able to move up to a bigger center. With CAPE on hiatus and WWTX getting canceled, the DFW shows were pretty limited this year. Though DCC really stepped up to the plate and delivered an awesome show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the show was pretty good to the studio. I was hopped up on no sleep and Red Bull the first day so I was up and about more than I should have been. Sorry to anyone if i seemed a bit spastic; there were a few things i wanted to accomplish at the show so i was running all over the place. I really should learn to stay at my table more; i'd probably make more money and have a more productive convention. Though honestly my summer was wrecked due to trying to juggle so many things at once and scrambling for work. I'm just not use to handling so many different aspects of my life. So I did not get as much as I had wanted to for the show. I couldn't replenish my pinup books and business cards so I rolled in pretty empty handed sadly. I did get three new prints done, but they didn't really raise any eyebrows. It's great being listed as "guests" but when you're not a big enough name to draw in the crowd to you, you have to put yourself out there to meet the crowd. Though I HATE doing the hard sell to any convention goer cause I hate it when it is done to me. It's that fine balance; and honestly it's easy to promote the studio as a whole, but when it comes to promoting myself, i freaking suck at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;DCC was in fact a good final show for the year, and it came at about the right time too. Once you start hitting the fall it's really time to wind down the traveling and wrap up the year. With that said, I am about to head out to &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; in California within the hour. Thankfully it's not a working convention so hopefully i can just relax for the weekend and come back a bit refreshed. And i'm helping out Ruby with her mom's retail table at &lt;a href="http://www.animefest.org/"&gt;AnimeFEST&lt;/a&gt;. So busy. As the mantra goes, next month will be less busy. Sadly, it's always &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;next &lt;/span&gt;month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-5665210992475902489?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/5665210992475902489/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=5665210992475902489' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5665210992475902489'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5665210992475902489'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/08/dallas-comic-con-august-2009-recap.html' title='Dallas Comic Con August 2009 Recap'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/So0ZrefsNoI/AAAAAAAAAOI/pphAdcaIRlo/s72-c/3828245618_cf9e05e90a.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-750947993649883988</id><published>2009-08-05T19:06:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-06T03:30:24.011-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Atlanta Road Trip!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SnqDjwdJvnI/AAAAAAAAAOA/TVGj4ZN5smE/s1600-h/3777258226_fded928a98.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SnqDjwdJvnI/AAAAAAAAAOA/TVGj4ZN5smE/s320/3777258226_fded928a98.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366746556291202674" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[The helpful GPS.

It was a looong drive, about twelve hours. Good to know that i can take a trip with the guys and not kill them during the trip. Luckily I was able to sleep for most of it as with how short i am, i can lay down in the backseat somewhat comfortably. Which worked out on the way east as i was able to wake up about mid-day and do a shift in driving. We were on the road from dark skies pre-sunrise to dark skies post-sunset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone at Gaijin gave us a warm welcome and let us putter around the studio for a few days. I hope we didn't get in the way too much as they all had a lot of work to be done. Just being around them was a good vibe though and it helped bring up my spirits a bit. It's been a rough few months and being around that sort of environment really gives me a good outlook on things. We also visited Sam at Radical Axis, where they do Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies. Getting to meet Sam in person is really awesome. I wish we had more time to hang out with him but his weekend was pretty booked. Tom and Casey gave us a quick look at Studio Revolver which is a pretty wicked work space. They're great guys, it was nice to finally meet them in person. Being able to put a face to a screen name really helps my later years memory. Tony and Sarena hosted an afternoon lunch at their place out in the sticks. It wasn't too far, but for me that 's a lot of hills and trees. Seeing Tony's home work space was great; he has an awesome yet simple setup. It was a great afternoon of food and friends. Getting to know Karl a bit more was hilarious; though his description of Fallout 3 and its expansions will lead me into finally getting the game. Which will also lead me to doing NO work. Anyways, we also got to see Little 5 Points with Dwight from the podcast Sidebar. We met up with Swain briefly but something came up last minute. They're great guys with a wonderfully insightful podcast. We ate at The Vortex which offers absolute monsters of a burger. I think I'm still digesting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did the figure drawing session that Gaijin hosts at their studio. It's a great thing to have done, especially with the guys there to give crits and input. For one the 20min poses, i didn't even bother drawing and watched Brian work. Just watching him work was educational, i just wish i was across the room to see Tony work too. If any of you are in the Atlanta area, you should be hitting this up every week. I am jealous that we don't have something like this in Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the trip was great. Seeing everyone's work space was awesome; but honestly what I found interesting was seeing a glimpse of their home life. All people talk about in this industry is the heavy work grind, deadlines, and editors. But what about the family, the kids, and the friends? Everyone i met this weekend i had already looked up to as a friend and professional, but now i have a newly gained respect for them for also being such wonderful and dedicated people. Having to work 14 hour days is grueling enough, but having to also be a husband and a father on top on this is an amazing feat. It's something that we rarely hear about and should really be aware of, especially for those of us trying to make it in this crazy industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone I met on this trip, you made it freaking awesome!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-750947993649883988?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/750947993649883988/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=750947993649883988' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/750947993649883988'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/750947993649883988'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/08/helpful-gps.html' title='Atlanta Road Trip!'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SnqDjwdJvnI/AAAAAAAAAOA/TVGj4ZN5smE/s72-c/3777258226_fded928a98.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-6216496222873766999</id><published>2009-05-06T00:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2010-03-04T09:49:29.225-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Art'/><title type='text'>Joker: Golden</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SgEc3dQKyzI/AAAAAAAAANg/dR7amtSXnmc/s1600-h/joker_painting_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 248px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SgEc3dQKyzI/AAAAAAAAANg/dR7amtSXnmc/s320/joker_painting_web.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5332575172854205234" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(44, 54, 53); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; "&gt;Something i worked on during some slow times during the recent Dallas Sci-Fi Expo.

It's an satellite store of &lt;a href="http://www.keithsneatstuff.com/index.shtml"&gt;Keith's comics&lt;/a&gt;; and use to be called Treasure Isle. I don't understand why they changed the name or didn't just call it Keith's Comics Denton, but whatevers. The shop is really cool though a bit small right now. They took over the spot on the square pretty fast so they only have the front half of the shop fully running. Which means we were pretty cramped in the back of the store. It's a good place for one or two people, but having the four of us was pushing it. Ah well, live and let learn i guess. It was a fun day; we spent it drawing up free head sketches for people and stayed dried as the skies opened up and freaking POURED down rain. We made some scrillah but not much. I didn't expect to anyways with the event being what it is.&lt;/span&gt; It was just a good excuse to get out of the house to do the comic thing that I love so much. Thanks to the guys at More Fun Comics for having us in store and thanks to everyone who dropped by.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Georgia;color:black;"  &gt;Anyways, photos are up on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157617554386973/"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;; most of them taken by the lovely Ruby who was hanging out with us that day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-2758833945090399545?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/2758833945090399545/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=2758833945090399545' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2758833945090399545'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/2758833945090399545'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/05/fcbd-2009-recap.html' title='FCBD 2009: Recap'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/Sf_uQ75kYwI/AAAAAAAAANY/_IMuwCTKs4s/s72-c/IMG_8655_web.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-8425620925884206441</id><published>2009-03-24T04:35:00.009-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-25T10:58:54.918-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Art Byte and H4H/ALM Recap</title><content type='html'>Well, the Art Bytes forum at the DMA was an interesting evening. It was essentially a convention panel format with people chatting about our craft and whatnot. I really like what they're trying to accomplish and really do like how they branch out from the traditional mediums of art. Sadly there is a huge deficiency of time for the evening, especially when there are more than two creators on the panel. By the time it was my turn on the slides, we were already about an hour over the allotted time. That unto itself isn't a big issue as the room schedule was free until closing (midnight). But because the forum started fairly late (9:30), at about 10:30 people are leaving for the evening. Luckily most of my presentation was about technique and form so i was able to rush through it real quick; sadly it was presented to just a small handful of people, most of whom were still there because they help run the event. The event itself is pretty cool though; Hopkins is a great presenter and Kristian showed some neat benefits to Manga Studio. It's a great way to spend an evening; they just have a few things to iron out before it run smoothly each and every time. Though I was introduced to a great bar/grill called Snookies; good place to grab a drink and it has really good bar food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/ScpPkxB8JzI/AAAAAAAAAM8/2EI5i3x0Jjc/s1600-h/IMG_8632_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/ScpPkxB8JzI/AAAAAAAAAM8/2EI5i3x0Jjc/s320/IMG_8632_web.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5317149803119650610" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[image: my painting from the Heroes4Heroes\ArtLoveMagic event; more pictures on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157615749401914/"&gt;my flickr account&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.heroes4heroes.org/"&gt;Heroes4Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\&lt;a href="http://www.artlovemagic.com/"&gt;ArtLoveMagic&lt;/a&gt; show was a good turnout for what it was; I honestly don't think it advertised as much as it could have been. I didn't see much outside of a few websites and the usual Space-Gun blasts; granted, I'm not on the Twitter so maybe that's how people did it. I was going into the show in a funny head-space due to a jacked up sleep schedule and other personal issues. I essentially woke up in the afternoon and had just enough time to do a quick posture layout on a board and pack art supplies before heading out the door. Things like that is really off putting and messes with the mojo. It's difficult to rev yourself up for these events sometimes. Yes, they're fun and it's about having a good time, but you don't want to completely phone them in. I want to bring my A-Game as much as I can as to represent myself as an artist and as a member of Space-Gun Studios. Typically I try to roll into these things with a very Jeff Bebe swagger and kick as much ass as I can. You can sometimes spot me before the event bouncing around trying to hype myself up for these things; as a natural introvert, i have to fight the urge to say "Fuck it" and go home. This is especially true for the more comic book related shows as the people there are more of my peer group; which makes it doubly more intimidating. However, once the show started up, I was able to rock on through the evening and produced a piece that I could actually be okay with. I'm hoping to do a second pass at my painting as I had forgotten my reference material at home and could not remember the 'pacifics of the costume. Highlight of the evening was getting nearly all the artists to jam out on a huge board that David from ALM brought. It was a blast; we even got Elizabeth Breitweiser (colorist for Skaar: Son of Hulk, Fallen Son: what if, and Captain America: Zero Point) to jump in on the board as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/ScpP03ExjfI/AAAAAAAAANE/pYhhQ5gqRUg/s1600-h/IMG_8628_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/ScpP03ExjfI/AAAAAAAAANE/pYhhQ5gqRUg/s320/IMG_8628_web.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5317150079620058610" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[image: the night's jam piece]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a good evening. Things started out slow for me, but I was able to ease into it eventually and was rocking by the end of the evening. I think this will be the last of the live art events that I'll be doing for a while. 2009 is looking to be an interesting year and honestly, i need to shift my focus on myself and my own work. I've been meaning to write something up about that; maybe next time.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-8425620925884206441?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/8425620925884206441/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=8425620925884206441' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/8425620925884206441'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/8425620925884206441'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/03/art-byte-and-h4halm-recap.html' title='Art Byte and H4H/ALM Recap'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/ScpPkxB8JzI/AAAAAAAAAM8/2EI5i3x0Jjc/s72-c/IMG_8632_web.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-2099739368848800953</id><published>2009-03-19T03:15:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-19T03:26:17.765-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dallas Museum of Art and Heroes4Heroes</title><content type='html'>Well, it never ends, folks.

We run into a lot of issues that the pros haven't had to deal with in a long time. It's something you really don't read a lot about in those "How to Do Comics" books. Some shows are great from the drive to the convention center to the face plant on the bed at the end of the long weekend. Others are three days of constant, wretched abuse that lingers on for weeks afterward, making you ask why you even bother trying. On average, conventions are a mix of both sides of that equation. Like most things, there is a bit of good mixed in with the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/"&gt;STAPLE!&lt;/a&gt; is great show for its size; and its size is part of why it's a great show. The show is big enough to bring in some really cool and creative people; but it is also small enough that you can actually get some time to talk to people. This is a great show for both fans and creators. Small-time guys can mix it up with the bigger names. STAPLE! especially does this well with its pre- and after- parties. The pre-party was a really relaxed and casual atmosphere. As an artist at a con, this is great because there is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;no way&lt;/span&gt; to talk to people at the actual convention. A comic convention is work, especially for those of us who pay to be there. With travel, table, and product costs, we can't afford to just stand around all day and talk to friends. And when i do talk to other creators, i try not to them too long because i know they're trying to do business as well. But the events before and after are really good at giving us a really relaxed atmosphere to just chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a great chance to talk to people, these events can really put things into a unique perspective. STAPLE! was not a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Total &lt;/span&gt;Perspective Vortox, but it did give me a decent view of things. What i saw was a real clear indication of where I stand in the grand scheme of this industry. Though i was able to make some money at this show and had a good time with people, i could not shake this feeling of being out of place. It was as if i was a high school freshman who somehow got mixed in with the career professionals. This was especially poignant during dinner. Granted, these guys probably felt as awkward towards me as i do towards them. However, that really doesn't negate the fact that i recognize who they are and have seen their work on a national level; whereas a lot of times i feel like a glorified tracer. It's a real disheartening and crushing feeling; one that really followed me throughout the night. Combine that with getting lost going to the venue, the music being just a bit too loud, and the heat, i just wasn't in the right mindset to hang out at the after party. So i would like to apologize to everyone at the live art show for my distracted attitude towards you. I was the the point where i just wanted to go home and talk to a friend. I was able to alleviate some of that by hanging out with my sister (it was her birthday as well). Sadly the bar didn't carry any Irish cream so we couldn't do car bombs, but i think the shots of tequila were a good substitute. And finally getting on an art board helped for some reason. I didn't bring my A or B game and i was really struggling with it, but it was an odd cleansing process anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, i feel that STAPLE! was a bit of a Pyrrhic victory. I had a good time with friends, i was able actually make some money, and i got to hang out with my sister for a bit. But what lingers around longer are the negatives. That sucks, but it's just how things roll in this industry. Conventions are weird beasts to handle. Sometimes they're great and do what you want them to do; sometimes they smell the fear on you and will go for the throat.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-4581978646475886181?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/4581978646475886181/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=4581978646475886181' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4581978646475886181'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4581978646475886181'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2009/03/staple-2009-aftermath.html' title='STAPLE! 2009: Aftermath'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SbYW51LpsTI/AAAAAAAAAMU/JclhGqdyezw/s72-c/IMG_8352.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-3525009945859573182</id><published>2009-03-04T20:46:00.011-06:00</published><updated>2009-08-27T03:03:22.658-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comic Conventions'/><title type='text'>STAPLE! 2009 (March 7)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/Sa9BMIxJWkI/AAAAAAAAAMM/DEPgAj-J1cs/s1600-h/map_staple.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 177px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/Sa9BMIxJWkI/AAAAAAAAAMM/DEPgAj-J1cs/s320/map_staple.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5309534162460957250" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[image: table map for STAPLE! 2009]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://space-gun.com/"&gt;The band&lt;/a&gt; is hitting the road this weekend (March 7) for our first out of city convention of the year in Austin, TX. &lt;a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/"&gt;STAPLE! the Independent Media Expo&lt;/a&gt; has been running strong for a few years now. Their main focus is the indy scene; so there will be a bunch of new and cool books you won't be able to find otherwise. I personally love this show because of the environment that it has going for it. It's a small show about the books and the creators. It's not about finding limited collectibles, seeing Hollywood stars, or standing in line for an hour for a Jim Lee autograph; STAPLE! is about the love of comics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this year they're hosting a live art auction at &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/redsevenaustin"&gt;Red7&lt;/a&gt; after the con featuring DJs and a performance by nerdcore hip-hop artist Terp2it; the show will be benefitting a local community radio station called &lt;a href="http://koop.org/index.php"&gt;KOOP!&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157604027643082/"&gt;show last year&lt;/a&gt; was freaking awesome; the music was great and the vibe was totally laid back and hip. So if you're in the area, come on out; plus it's my sister's birthday and apparently she's never had an Irish Car Bomb.

Watercolor, gouache, silver paint, and ink on 300 Lanaquarelle.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.wizardworld.com/home-tx.html"&gt;Wizard World&lt;/a&gt; tour retires this year with it's final stop in Texas, and what a stop it was. Conventions have been a real drain on the finances: table, travel, food, product. Product is going to take a while to cover, but for the first time ever i covered expenses (table, travel, food, small purchases). I'm typically the one that makes the least amount of money if i make money at all. This is partially due to the fact that i am a dog zodiac so i tend to wander off. But as Evan said "We know we did good because Luan was actually at the table for 95% of the time. Can you imagine what would happen if it was 98%? I don't even want to think about it." It was that good; and the show was pretty good to all of us. We've been doing shows together as a studio for little over a year now, and i think we've done a lot over that year. I think this next year will be a good indication as to where this will be progressing to; and it's been a really good haul so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wizard World Texas is one their newest additions to the tour and it wasn't bought from a previously successful convention (a la Chicago, Philly, LA). So they had to build this show from the ground up, trying to figure out what the market here wants. It's been an interesting evolution over the years, so there are always rumblings of them not having a show the next year. Their first year here they brought along the big booths and heavy names (Lee, Silvestri, Turner, etc), treating it like one of their big media shows like LA or Chicago. They had artist alley tucked away in another room, dimly lit and unadvertised. I think now they understand that people here in Texas don't want the big media glitz. There's a certain pride here of not being like LA or NYC: things here are bigger, stronger, and more easy-going. Over the years artist alley has grown immensely; and they have kept it to small press and independent artists. Gone are the models, small retailers (for the most part), and media people. It is truly an &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Artist &lt;/span&gt;Alley. The main reason i made the money that i did was because i had original paintings. Studio-mate Evan had the same experience and i think &lt;a href="http://www.tommycastillo.net/"&gt;Tommy Castillo&lt;/a&gt; did bang-bustah his originals as well. People are there to look for convention sketches and original art. I think that's why the live art scene here has been booming lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SRjDOlWesFI/AAAAAAAAALM/ilRcj2f-bD4/s1600-h/3017238197_c2eb153c9b_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SRjDOlWesFI/AAAAAAAAALM/ilRcj2f-bD4/s320/3017238197_c2eb153c9b_o.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267174419521777746" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[image: my live art painting for Heroes4Heroes Fundraiser. Watercolor, gouache, and ink on 300 Lanaquarelle.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heroes4heroes.org/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heroes4Heroes&lt;/a&gt; had their third annual live art fundraiser on Saturday, and i think it went awesome. It was pretty cool to work along side with such great talent; the Space-Gun Kru ran really strong and turned a few heads. I feel that I need to bring my "A++" game to these sorts of events, this one in particular. The audience for the most part not as local as the other shows that we do. I feel that i am not only representing myself but my studio and the Dallas art community as a whole. Over the course of the last few years, I have identified myself as a Space-Gunner and a proud Dallas artist. So at this annual show, I feel that I need to step up and show that Dallas isn’t just a city of cowboys and corporate offices. There is a real thriving art community here, and we rock it pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had more and a traditional English Open Auction this time, with a stage for the pieces and the bidders were seated in front of the stage. It went fairly well for the most part; though i think how the pieces go up for auction could be more streamlined as a few pieces were forgotten along the back wall for hours. Understandably, they want to get the headlining guests up first/early as their pieces would carry more weight; but a few great pieces got less love than they deserved as the night got late. Though this is their third show and it’s only once a year so there will be kinks here and there to iron out as they find a system that works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This con was a great way to end out the convention tour. The art show was awesome; the convention was really good to us overall. We all left with contacts and money in our pockets; there’s not much more you can ask for. It’s a great way to wrap up one year of shows. Thanks to the Wizard World staff, they were friendly in correspondence and in person as well. We’ve never had any issues with anyone at these shows. Special kicks out to &lt;a href="http://www.antiherocomics.com/"&gt;Dave Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://superleezard.deviantart.com/"&gt;Paul Milligan&lt;/a&gt; for being cool convention neighbors; to Tommy Castillo for throwing down some veteran advice on me; and to &lt;a href="http://darthterry.deviantart.com/"&gt;Terry Parr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/451676"&gt;Amber May&lt;/a&gt; for just being cool and even shelling my pinup book at their table. And a huge thanks goes out to &lt;a href="http://www.artlovemagic.com/"&gt;ArtLoveMagic&lt;/a&gt; for having the Space-Gun Kru be part of their setup at the live art show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now to find real work and replace all the art that I sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157608800456851/"&gt;Wizard World Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinh-luanluu/sets/72157608801409675/"&gt;Heroes4Heroes Live Art Fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-3196769725602448541?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/3196769725602448541/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=3196769725602448541' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/3196769725602448541'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/3196769725602448541'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2008/11/wizard-world-texas-aftermath.html' title='Wizard World Texas: Aftermath'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SRjDJ0Kc32I/AAAAAAAAALE/Eb5QmhxmOgg/s72-c/3017937682_195b53c683_o.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-3988342697996048642</id><published>2008-11-06T00:39:00.011-06:00</published><updated>2010-03-04T09:49:29.225-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Art'/><title type='text'>New Paintings</title><content type='html'>This blog has gone too long without art.

This weekend is the annual &lt;a href="http://www.wizardworld.com/home-tx.html"&gt;Wizard World Texas&lt;/a&gt; show in Arlington. This year they are co-promoting it with &lt;a href="http://www.txfearfest.com/"&gt;Texas Fearfest&lt;/a&gt;, so there is a fairly eclectic guest list. From Terry Moore to Corey Feldman to Dallas's own Vinnie Paul of Pantera. Weird, no? The dates for next year's show is TBA while all the other cities have their dates pretty solid; so it doesn't really bode well for the convention. I would be sad to see it go as it is THE biggest comic show here in Dallas. Co-promoting with FearFest is a pretty good move on their part. Texas has a pretty damn big horror scene for whatever reason. We'll see how it pans out for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://space-gun.com/"&gt;Space-Gun Kru&lt;/a&gt; will be set up at 2520 and 2530 a little off-center of the artist alley. We'll have a full spread of books and art for you guys; even with two tables between the four of us it's getting pretty packed really fast. I'll have my Gun Gals | Blade Babe pinup book and prints as well as the paintings that i have been doing recently. This is also an opportunity for you local folks to pick up a copy of Synesthetic for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday night, Novemeber 8th at 7PM &lt;a href="http://www.heroes4heroes.org/"&gt;Heroes4Heroes&lt;/a&gt;will be hosting a live art show at the &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=arlington,+tx+sheraton&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13927228245013082779&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=image"&gt;Sheraton Hotel Arlington&lt;/a&gt;. Along with a myriad of pros that will be arting live, the Space-Gun Kru will be getting our art on with ArtLoveMagic and other local artist. Heroes4Heroes is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works directly with members of the United States Military, corporations, and the general public to provide portable media to active troops in order to boost morale and keep our men and women in uniform culturally tuned-in. They gather, organize, and send entertainment material such as comic books, DVDs, CDs, books, magazines, MP3 players, and game systems to our Heroes. This is a great organization that is doing their part to support the troops without having a political agenda. The live art is a free event with cash bars; what more do you need? So come on out, support out troops, and watch some wicked art get done live!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fanboy Video Recap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/41R1Y52Bc8M&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/41R1Y52Bc8M&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slideshow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qJ9Mt4LwtZE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qJ9Mt4LwtZE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wizardworld.com/home-tx.html"&gt;Wizard World Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arlington Convention Center&lt;br /&gt;November 7-9, 2008&lt;br /&gt;Tables 2520 and 2530&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heroes4heroes.org/2008/11/3rd-annual-h4h-live-art-fundraiser-this-weekend/"&gt;Heroes4Heroes Live Art Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, November 8th&lt;br /&gt;7pm Free Admission&lt;br /&gt;Sheraton Hotel @ Arlington Ball Park&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-4135815576812562563?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/4135815576812562563/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=4135815576812562563' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4135815576812562563'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/4135815576812562563'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2008/11/wizard-world-texas-live-art-show.html' title='Wizard World Texas &amp; Live Art Show'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9TldJoEi0tc/SQ_cC0M5bJI/AAAAAAAAAIk/a_Fl0Y4znSQ/s72-c/wwtx_map+copy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8239953526504913841.post-5666066580036667309</id><published>2008-10-31T15:58:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-31T19:43:09.652-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Ending Sound</title><content type='html'>Well, it was a long and actually hellish month, but the Zuda competition was officially over today at noon. After twenty-five long days, we ended up in third place. We took some pretty hard hits from the community. Doug got his story-telling ripped on and Evan's style really rubbed some people the wrong way; and i was pretty much ignored for being a simple letterist. Though it wasn't all bad news bears all month. We also got some real support from the community and even some pros as well; people were willing to engage in actual discussions over the comic and we all also got some real praise on each of our parts. And we held on to first place for half of the competition; and we dropped to only third place. And I am soundly proud of that as we did very minimal advertising. It was mainly a grassroots campaign on our end. In total, we spent about thirty dollars in internet ads and about ten bucks in flyers. Our marketing was emails, facebook, myspace, and message boards. That is probably why we didn't win, but i'm okay with that. I knew that the marketing is a huge part of their competition model, but going through it gave me a real understanding on how it works. And I'm not entirely sure how comfortable i am with that fact. Their number system is also really interesting; I'm going to see if i can get how many actual votes we got. I'm interested in seeing how those numbers compare to our views/favorties and emails blasts. I may be going through this again with my other studio-mates so I want to be better informed on what worked and what didn't. Ideally, being able to see what each action did to our numbers would be the best; but i'll probably have to settle for what i get from Zuda/DC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a pretty damn stressful experience. I got a lot of love and a lot of hate as well. It was some harsh lessons about this industry. Nothing new per say, but a nice rehash of old lessons of life: a lot of hard work sometimes gets paid back with bupkis; and money talks. I grew up in a world of critiques; that's part of how i grow and learn. However, on this sort of platform, it's not critiques but reviews. Some reviews are very sound and in depth conducted by people who understand the craft and have valid points. Others are done by fans who only know what they like and will not understand anything outside of that. It's like dealing with an art director vs a client: one will tell you why something doesn't work and call you an idiot, the other will not like the shade of blue you're using and call you an idiot. Welcome to the internet I suppose. As Doug said, it's going to happen; especially when you're in the spotlight on such a large scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though for pluses, you can meet some real genuine people and you do get your name out there on a national/global scale. And to a certain degree, you can see who among your friends really support you and understand the crazy amount of hard work you put into these projects. But that's a whole other subject; one that i would be willing to discuss over beers if any of you would like. Also, make sure you fully read the contract (which they freely &lt;a href="http://www.zudacomics.com/node/117"&gt;posted on their website&lt;/a&gt;) so you know exactly what you're getting into. It is DC comics, so it's not a creative owned project as other webcomic deals. But they do have clauses for reversion of rights. Read over it, and if you're really serious about it, get a lawyer to read over it as well. It is a legally binding contract and it's always a good idea to have someone look over it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, serious thanks for all the support everyone showed. It's been along and turbulent journey; and i really do appreciate the words of encouragement and the faith you guys have in me in trying to make it in this industry. Thanks for believing in me and I will do my very best to make you guys proud. Special thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.titancomics.com/"&gt;Titan Comics&lt;/a&gt; for letting us leave flyers in the shop, and to &lt;a href="http://www.zeuscomics.com/"&gt;Zeus Comics&lt;/a&gt; who even bag-stuffed them for us. Both shops always show some real support for the local scene; so go show them some love.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8239953526504913841-5666066580036667309?l=vinhluanluu.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/feeds/5666066580036667309/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8239953526504913841&amp;postID=5666066580036667309' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5666066580036667309'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8239953526504913841/posts/default/5666066580036667309'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://vinhluanluu.blogspot.com/2008/10/ending-sound.html' title='The Ending Sound'/><author><name>Vinh-Luan Luu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07953306359116403285</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry></feed>
