<blockquote><p>Think about what you do for the majority of your day: you communicate  ideas and relay messages into text. Writing. Whether sketching code or  prose, you are a <strong>writer</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly spend the bulk of any given work day writing.  Between emails (several hundred a week), spec documents, new project proposals, copy for the company&#8217;s various web properties and products, etc. etc. etc. I spend a lot of time in front of the keyboard word processing as the kids (don&#8217;t) say.</p>
<p>I work every day on a nice iMac loaded with the full iLife Suite (including Pages), Office for Mac (including Word), and the Adobe CS4 suite.</p>
<p>But ask me what program I like the best and increasingly depend on, and I would tell you TextEdit.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, TextEdit: the simple minded runt of a program that most Mac users only open by accident.  I find it irreplaceable&#8230;it&#8217;s even on my dock right next to its better looking, smarter cousins.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;m a spoiled rotten ingrate with problems of privilege: I bitch and moan through the 60-90 seconds it takes to launch Word.  That&#8217;s mostly my fault, since I&#8217;m typically running 6-10 other applications, including resource hogs like XCode, Photoshop, or Firefox with 25 open tabs.  (My compulsive multi-tasking and inability to maintain a clean virtual desktop is the stuff of legend in my office).  Still, I&#8217;m a spoiled rotten ingrate and my minutes are precious (I think).  TextEdit launches instantly with a nice clean page and a cursor waiting for my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">brilliant prose</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">snappy copy</span> upbeat but sometimes lengthy debugging notes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I appreciate TextEdit for more than its reliably fast response in my time of need.  95% of what I write everyday requires a single font size and format, a bullet list or two, and <em>some</em> <strong>basic</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">formatting</span>. (See what I did right there?). For the 5% of my documents that require a fancier touch, I have plenty of great programs at my disposal. 37 Signals&#8217; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_is_more_is_bullshit.php" target="_blank">take on &#8220;Less is More&#8221;</a> speaks directly to the reason I find TextEdit so compelling:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Less is More” implies that more is better. It’s not. Less is less. Less is just right. Less is better.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve grown to expect so many things from products as basic and fundamental as word processors. Each additional feature packed into a Word or Pages brings along with it a thousand formatting nightmares and frustrated searches through the endless option menus. When my goal is to transfer thoughts from my head to the screen as quickly and efficiently as possible, I turn to TextEdit.  I raise my virtual glass to this champion of no-frills software perfection.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a <a href="http://tropophilia.com/write/">guest post</a> from the folks over at </em><a href="http://testfreaks.com"><em>Test Freaks</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IPH_iPadHabits.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1374 alignright" title="IPH_iPadHabits" src="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IPH_iPadHabits.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="224" /></a>The Apple iPad has been described most commonly as a consumption device. That is, many argue that its purpose is best suited for the consumption of varied content more so than productivity. While I don&#8217;t completely agree with that synopsis, the iPad is indeed great for leisure time use.</p>
<p>In fact, using the device has changed my leisure habits, and for the better. How has a simple device done this? Well, let&#8217;s look at the strengths of the iPad, and how that has helped an average person with their leisure time &#8211; me, to be exact.</p>
<p><span id="more-1373"></span><strong>The Beauty of Instant On Access</strong></p>
<p>The iPad, like most smart phones, offers an instant on capability for quick use. While most users now take this in stride, compare it with an average laptop. Instead of waiting for the laptop to wake up from standby (or worse, boot up), I can turn on the iPad, swipe, get info, and turn it off again in only a few seconds, all the while saving wear and tear on the laptop lid.</p>
<p>This makes it great to do simple things, such as checking for a specific email or even getting the time. I no longer need to decide if it is worth it to bring up the computer just to check the weather. I check it whenever the mood strikes me. And finally, having nearly immediate access to TitanTV on my terms, makes it practical to check what is coming on the TV without needing a computer.</p>
<p>As long as I have the iPad handy, I can float in and out of my computer usage during leisure time without giving a second thought to laptop mechanics, such as proper ventilation. For quick occasional use the iPad blows a laptop away &#8211; the laptop will spend a lot of its power (and your time) just coming up each time you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Big Screen for Tired Eyes </strong></p>
<p>Okay, so you would argue that you would use a smart phone for leisure time instead of a laptop, and that is quite possible. After all, you can get a TV schedule on a smart phone as easy as you can the iPad, and it shares the same quick power up and auto power off as the iPad offers. And I will agree with you on these points.</p>
<p>That is, I will agree with you if your eyesight is in great shape. But for a lot of people that have a few more years under their belt, using a smart phone requires reading glasses. And guess what &#8211; when I am relaxing and watching TV, I do not have them handy. Nor do I want to put them on to check what is on TV. But the iPad is big enough that I can read it fine. Sure, I have the font size cranked up in the browser, but it works great for me and my tired eyes. This is especially true after using a computer screen all day. With the iPad I have immediate information at my disposal during down time, and I can leave the glasses at the desk.</p>
<p>Now, this larger screen size is not just handy for quick information. I like to read on the iPad, and when I do, I have the fonts large and comfortable. In fact, I can read the display easier than I can a printed book, thanks to the larger text. I shudder to think how thick a printed book would have to be in order to have the same size fonts &#8211; a lot of good trees would have to die to make it possible.</p>
<p><strong>eBook Alternative Markets </strong></p>
<p>So, yes, I like to read eBooks thanks to a larger text display. In the past it has been hard to find the titles I wanted to read. But now, with the iPad, I have the largest market available to me. With the right app, the Ipad becomes a virtual Kindle, Nook, Kobo, iBook, and more. I can shop around with Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and more and find that elusive title. I can also compare prices, and even see what free eBooks are available from each (which is a great way to discover a new series that I may have overlooked in the past).</p>
<p>Beyond that, excellent apps such as Stanza allows me to tap into all of the other books that are available on the web and otherwise. I have built up a small collection of eBooks over the years, and the only problem is deciding which ones I want to put on the device. So far, eBook availability on the iPad is nothing if not wide.</p>
<p><strong>Magazine, Comics and PDFs </strong></p>
<p>Of course, not everything I read in my leisure time is an eBook, neatly formatted for a device. In fact, I like to read a good magazine every once in a while, and even partake in an occasional comic. These items are designed for the portrait oriented page, something that the widescreen laptop is simply not. What&#8217;s more, you really need to see the whole screen to take it all in. When you force it all to fit on the average laptop screen, it is not pretty.</p>
<p>But a tablet in general, and the iPad specifically, does portait orientation just fine. I can see, and read, an entire page without scrolling and without dead screen space to make it fit. I am free to flip through my favorite digital magazines, zooming in as desired, without chasing the screen around to see what the page offers. And by having all of my magazines (and occasional comic) in a truly digital form, they are not left sprawled out on the sofa, nor do I have to chase them down when I am in bed. If I have the iPad handy, I have them handy.</p>
<p>The same works great for a lot of PDFs that seem to multiply. I can see the entire PDF page at a glance, and I can easily read through them. For this I use one of the many available apps available to handle the storage and reading of PDFs, and the only problem is deciding how many I want to store on the device. It is all handy to me as long as I have the iPad within arm&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p><strong>Great Form Factor </strong></p>
<p>Finally, I have to bring up the great form factor that the iPad offers. With the iPad I can watch a movie on the larger screen, and if I fall asleep no big deal. It is not heavy enough to do any real harm, and it is durable enough to survive the ordeal. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for most laptops, especially when you consider the mechanics for the folding top, the keyboard, and the need for circulating air.</p>
<p>In fact, simply being lost in the covers could be a real problem for a hot running computer. More than once I&#8217;ve had to dig through the covers for the iPad after a restless night, something I would not like to do with my laptop. Even some of the <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/netbooks/">best netbooks</a> are not particulary well suited to under cover missions. While I would not suggest dropping an iPad onto a hard tile floor or sitting on one, so far it has done great for my uses and abuses.</p>
<p>As you can see, the iPad has changed my leisure habits for the better. Now I find it easier to use information services during casual time. In fact, I am more informed because of it, and it saves me from having to leave my state of leisure in order to do some tasks. And that to me is almost priceless after a particularly trying day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Battelle has famously described search engines and their collection of search queries as a <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2003/11/the_database_of_intentions">database of intentions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This information represents, in aggregate form, a place holder for the intentions of humankind &#8211; a massive database of desires, needs, wants, and likes that can be discovered, supoenaed, archived, tracked, and exploited to all sorts of ends. Such a beast has never before existed in the history of culture, but is almost guaranteed to grow exponentially from this day forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key to his description, of course, is intent.  Sally is interested in a new umbrella, so she goes on Bing to search for umbrellas.  Bob wants to know the score of the latest World Cup game, and he jumps on Google to find it.  Amanda wants to find a quick headache remedy, so she fires up her browser and tries a search on Yahoo.</p>
<p>People who work on search sometimes refer to this as the &#8220;lean forward&#8221; experience.  You have an objective  or an &#8220;intent&#8221; for your online journey, and you are using a search engine to achieve that objective or satisfy that intent.  As you search, you leave behind artifacts of your exploration for the search engine to analyze: the keywords you used, the results you clicked, your location, and even whether you came back to the search results quickly (a sign that the page you went to didn&#8217;t quite fit) or decided to stick with your chosen result.</p>
<p>The aggregation of these expressed intents provides useful insight into what the world finds interesting.  One way that Google exposes this information is through <a href="http://google.com/trends">Google Trends</a>, which shows the top search keywords and topics in real time.  <a href="http://google.org/flutrends">Google Flu Trends</a> takes the same approach but filters for flu-related queries only, which rivals other sources at predicting the outbreak of influenza.</p>
<p>But as modern life becomes increasingly digital, and more and more devices and everyday objects sprout a connection to the web, the idea of search as &#8220;intent&#8221; may start to give way to a different phenomenon: the &#8220;lean back&#8221; experience.  Or, what I would simply call &#8220;collateral search.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1339"></span>Larry Page <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html">defines</a> the perfect search engine as one that &#8220;understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.&#8221;  Note that he doesn&#8217;t say that it understands exactly what you <em>ask</em> it &#8212; it understands exactly what you <em>mean</em>.  Take the next logical step: the perfect search engine would be able to interpret your desire for information, and make that information available to you, before you&#8217;ve even affirmatively expressed that desire.</p>
<p>How might a search engine be able to capture your desire for information before you expressly invoke it?  Actually, Google has already built it and deployed it across millions of web pages.  It&#8217;s called AdSense.</p>
<p>Think about it: you go to a website.  In the sidebar is a Google AdSense box, like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1343" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Picture 2" src="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-2.png" alt="" width="435" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>How are those ads triggered?  Google scans the contents of the page (in this instance, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/technology/internet/14burger.html?ref=technology">story in the <em>New York Times</em> about the I Can Has Cheezburger? empire</a>) and then searches its inventory of ads for the best matches &#8212; and of course, the highest bids.  The user has not explicitly invoked this search, yet here we are with a set of search results (albeit paid) that relates to the user&#8217;s activity.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing some other early experiments in this space, as well.  Danny Sullivan points out that <a href="http://searchengineland.com/time-to-end-the-bullshit-search-engine-share-figures-44100">Bing and Yahoo are triggering collateral searches</a> when users click through slideshows and other links on their homepages (and he astutely argues that these sorts of &#8220;queries&#8221; should not be counted the same as intentional ones).</p>
<p>Prepare to see more of this &#8220;lean back&#8221; or collateral searching over the next few years.  As <a href="http://tropophilia.com/2008/02/20/augmented-reality-a-preflection/">augmented reality</a> takes off, you can bet that services offering &#8220;search as you look&#8221; capabilities will rise.  Geolocation is starting to mature; expect to see more products that will notify you of results based on where you are and what you&#8217;re doing.  The &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; &#8212; where everyday objects and appliances become connected to the web  &#8211;  is imminent.  Your house will search for the best light bulb prices when your lamp goes dark, and your car will search for the best gas prices in the area as you approach the quarter-tank line.</p>
<p>I want to end with a word about privacy in this new paradigm, and that word is education.  The common user&#8217;s understanding of his or her digital privacy is sorely trailing their exponentially increasing use of the Web.  As discussed above, we&#8217;re entering an age where the &#8220;crumbs&#8221; we leave behind are not just the result of eating our digital daily bread, but also a consequence of our normal quotidian routines &#8212; even those we exercise offline.  Driving a car, replacing a lightbulb, pulling our phones out in a shopping mall: these are all actions that will eventually invoke automatic online activity.  If we can&#8217;t manage the privacy of information we input directly, how will we ever manage the information that we input implicitly?  While search technology may be moving away from the idea of intention, it is precisely <em>with</em> intention that we must prepare ourselves &#8212; and the next generation &#8212;  for this new world.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/93/245562110_c74339c2fe.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="237" />I&#8217;ve been following Nicholas Carr&#8217;s thoughts and writing since I picked up <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393333949?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jarrtayldotco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393333949">The Big Switch</a></em> a couple of years ago (I analyzed one particular section of the book <a href="http://tropophilia.com/2009/01/14/does-the-personalized-web-filter-out-diversity/">here on Tropophilia</a>).  Shortly after that &#8212; right around when I was getting ready to move to California to join Google &#8212; Carr published  the very controversial piece <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">&#8220;Is Google Making Us Stupid?&#8221;</a> in <em>The Atlantic.</em> Since then, he has been developing and expanding his theory that the Internet is rewiring our brains for the worse.  He has just this month released the results in book form with <em><a href="http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/The_Shallows.html">The Shallows: What The Internet Is Doing To Our Brains</a>.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Carr&#8217;s central argument is that with the increased use of the Web comes a decreased ability to engage in long-form reading and deep thought.  Now, a while back, I <a href="http://tropophilia.com/2008/03/05/whoa-whoa-whoa-dunces/">blew up</a> at another author who made similar claims without providing much, if any, causal evidence.  I am happy to see from a few of Carr&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1">recent</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284981644790098.html">shorter</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060402030.html">pieces</a> that he at least relies on published research to back his arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Calls for &#8220;Delinkification&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, I&#8217;ve actually just committed what Carr deems to be one of the primary crimes perpetrated by the Web against deep reading and thinking: inline, contextual hyperlinking.  He explains in a <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2010/05/experiments_in.php">post</a> (oops, I did it again!) on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>The link is, in a way, a technologically advanced form of a footnote. It&#8217;s also, distraction-wise, a more violent form of a footnote. Where a footnote gives your brain a gentle nudge, the link gives it a yank. What&#8217;s good about a link &#8211; its propulsive force &#8211; is also what&#8217;s bad about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carr describes a multiplicity of reasons why the link distracts from long-form reading and comprehension:</p>
<ol>
<li>The link, by its very existence, makes us pause in our consideration and comprehension of the overlying and surrounding text to make a decision: do I click this, or do I ignore it?</li>
<li>If we choose to click it, we are taken to a different page completely.  Our brains must reset to prepare to capture and understand the new information.  We lose focus on what we were on before.</li>
<li>The problem can compound if the new page itself has links for us to decide on, and possibly follow further away from the original document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Carr concludes that &#8220;people who read hypertext comprehend and learn less, studies show, than those who read the same material in printed form. The more links in a piece of writing, the bigger the hit on comprehension.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his blog post, Carr cites a few experiments in &#8220;bottom linking&#8221; that seek to mitigate this allegedly attention-degrading practice.  It&#8217;s just what it sounds like: instead of linking within the text to other destinations on the web, one simply collects links at the bottom of the post.  I&#8217;ve seen this from time to time, and I don&#8217;t like it for a few reasons.</p>
<p><span id="more-1320"></span><strong>Why Delinkification Is Bad For Users and Bad For the Web</strong></p>
<p>First, consider the loss of context if, hypothetically, I had written the first two paragraphs of this post without links, and instead included this list at the bottom of the post:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393333949?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jarrtayldotco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393333949">The Big Switch</a></em> (Amazon)</li>

<li><em><a href="http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/The_Shallows.html">The Shallows</a></em> (official site)</li>
<li><a href="http://tropophilia.com/2008/03/05/whoa-whoa-whoa-dunces/">My take-down of Susan Jacoby</a> (Tropophilia)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1">Excerpt from </a><em><a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1">The Shallows</a></em> (Wired)</li>
<li><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284981644790098.html">&#8220;Does The Internet Make You Dumber?&#8221;</a> by Carr (Wall Street Journal)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060402030.html">&#8220;Are Google Maps and GPS Bad For Our Brains?&#8221;</a> by Carr (Washington Post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare that approach to what I actually constructed in the first two paragraphs of this post.  In the &#8220;bottom linked&#8221; version, you don&#8217;t know that the last three links are examples I am giving of how Carr makes science-backed arguments.  You also don&#8217;t know that those three are to be contrasted with my criticism of Susan Jacoby in the link preceding them.  Sure, I could explain all of these relationships in the bottom link area&#8230; but why go to all that trouble when I can simply link in the context of the post itself?</p>
<p>My second criticism is born from an observation <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a> made at an internal Google retreat I attended last year: hyperlinks were made into commodities by the growth of search engines (like Google) that turn connections into value, but contextual hyperlinking is also a skill, or even an artform.  The well-chosen link, when applied to the right word or phrase in a post, can say much more than is expressed on the surface.  Shifting links out of context and into a bottom list may save long-form reading and thought, but it removes an important and under-appreciated aspect of web literature and culture.</p>
<p>Third, and much more practically, removing links from context possibly hurts a lot of the value brought by search engines like Google.  Sure, Google will find the same links on the bottom-linked version of a page as well as it does on a inline-linked one.  But you can imagine that Google also takes into account the hyperlinked words themselves, the words around the link, the position of the link in the page, or maybe a dozen other attributes that depend on links being related to the content on top and around them (disclaimer: I am no more aware of the nitty gritty ingredients of Google Web Search&#8217;s secret sauce than you are).  In other words, stripping links out of context potentially degrades some of our ability to find webpages.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/#network">some</a> bloggers go so far as to put a footnote (hyperlinked even!) in the text that points you to the relevant link at the bottom.  What does that fix?  You get the &#8220;distracting&#8221; hyperlink without the immediate value that the link brings.  To me, this seems like an even bigger distraction than what currently exists.</p>
<p><strong>Have A Little Faith (And, A Call For Innovation)</strong></p>
<p>Though I haven&#8217;t read <em>The Shallows</em> and don&#8217;t know what his full reasoning and recommendations are, what has bothered me the most about Carr&#8217;s arguments on this topic are his lack of faith in the capacity of modern humans to adapt to new media and the challenges that they pose.</p>
<p>In his counterpoint to Carr&#8217;s Wall Street Journal piece, Clay Shirky <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284973472694334.html">reminds</a> us that every media revolution has brought fear, turmoil, and sometimes chaos &#8212; but they have sparked amazing cultural evolutions as well.  For example, the invention of the printing press &#8220;fueled the Protestant Revolution,&#8221; but it also paved the way for &#8220;novels, newspapers, scientific journals, the separation of fiction and non-fiction&#8221; and even the concept of scientific peer review.  The Internet may be rewiring our brains to work a different way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean all outcomes are disastrous.  History, so far, proves otherwise.</p>
<p>Look, I don&#8217;t disagree that links can be distracting.  I don&#8217;t deny that, when presented with a link, my mind momentarily pauses to decide whether to click it.  But when I decide to click a link in an article that I plan on finishing, I rarely just &#8220;click it.&#8221;  Instead, I use a simple shortcut (on Windows: Ctrl-click; on Mac: Cmd-click) to open the link in a new background tab.  I may do this a few times in the same article, opening the links up for later consideration (unless I feel I need to check the link out to better understand what I&#8217;m reading, in which case I navigate to that tab while keeping the original article open).  There is a subtle but important difference between this and bottom links; my mind is able to process the context of the links while still saving them for browsing after finishing the current document.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the Cmd-click solution isn&#8217;t an obvious one for the average browser user (indeed, the average browser user usually <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ">doesn&#8217;t know</a> what a browser is exactly).  I think what we need are lightweight, out-of-the-box browser capabilities to show what&#8217;s behind a link (before clicking) so that we can decide whether it&#8217;s worth it to leave the current page.  <a href="http://snap.com">Snap</a> and <a href="http://www.apture.com/editor/">Apture</a> (among others) offer some interesting solutions on the publisher side, but Snap is a slow, terrible user experience, and I haven&#8217;t seen Apture widely adopted.  To give you a sense of how Apture works, check out <a href="http://jarredtaylor.com/2010/05/13/the-two-schools/">this post</a> on my personal blog where I tried the service out (click the &#8220;video&#8221; link).</p>
<p>This capability is actually already built into the HTML language itself.  The &#8220;title&#8221; attribute lets publishers add text that will show up when you hover over a link.  You can see it in action by hovering your mouse <a title="This link takes you to Google.com." href="http://google.com">here</a>.  But again, far too people take the time to hover &#8212; it&#8217;s far faster and easier just to click away.  I really think then modern browser makers need to think about building in stronger capabilities for pre-click link evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>I welcome Nicholas Carr&#8217;s criticism.  I think it&#8217;s important.  I don&#8217;t doubt that the research he cites is well-founded and thorough.  Indeed, I agree that the Internet is rewiring our very impressionable brains.  I can feel it.  But I dispute his conclusion that it&#8217;s making us &#8220;stupid.&#8221;  I spend a whole lot of time online, but I still read books, often for hours at a time.  At the least, I think it&#8217;s way too early to tell, and I am optimistic that we&#8217;ll adapt for the better.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">I&#8217;m also glad that he&#8217;s proposing solutions, even small-scale experimental ones, to counter any potential fallout from this neural transition.  However, I think that any widespread changes we make to the way we publish and read online need to also preserve the pre-existing value of the Web.  We have an opportunity, after careful reflection, to seize on Carr&#8217;s observations and make the Internet &#8212; and the conversations that happen there &#8212; a better place.  Let&#8217;s do it with a spirit of progress, not regression.</span></p>

<p>Saturday was the unofficial 300 year anniversary of copyright, as first formalized in Britain&#8217;s Statute of Anne in 1710.  I took the opportunity to reflect a little bit on <a href="http://jarredtaylor.com">my personal blog</a> about my own interest in copyright law (part of a broader interest in technology and Internet law).</p>
<p><a href="http://jarredtaylor.com/2010/04/10/copyright-at-300/#reform">At the end of the post</a> in a section called &#8220;© needs reform,&#8221; I get to the real reason I am fascinated by copyright law: because it is in major disrepair, and failing to keep pace with the rate of innovation we&#8217;re seeing today.  In short, I&#8217;m interested in copyright because I want to help fix it.</p>
<p>I thought it would be appropriate to flag that section for you here on <em>Tropophilia</em>, since it is something I&#8217;d love to change.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The dream employee for a lot of companies is a twenty-something with as little of a life as possible outside of work&#8211;someone who&#8217;ll be fine working fourteen-hour days and sleeping under his desk.  But packing a room full of these burn-the-midnight-oil types isn&#8217;t as great as it seems. [. . .]  You don&#8217;t need more hours; you need <em>better</em> hours.  When people have something to do at home, they get down to business.  They get their work done because they have somewhere else to be.  They find ways to be more efficient because they have to.</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=taandoco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307463745">Rework</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=taandoco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307463745" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> (affiliate link)</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">37 Signals</a> team behind the project management software I and thousands of others use daily (<a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/?source=37signals+home" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>) published a new book laying out some of the principles behind their success.  They call <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=taandoco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307463745">Rework</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=taandoco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307463745" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> a &#8220;by product&#8221; of their business; the equivalent of a cookbook written by a chef confident enough that their mastery will still trump any upstart competitors armed with detailed instructions.  One of the ideas promoted in Rework, after all, is to strengthen and promote your business by teaching&#8211;customers, other business owners, even competitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>[E]mulate famous chefs.  They cook, so they write cookbooks.  What do you do?  What are your &#8220;recipes&#8221;?  What&#8217;s your &#8220;cookbook&#8221;?  What can you tell the world about how you operate that&#8217;s informative, educational, and promotional?  This book is our cookbook.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&#8217;s full of direct, combative, written-with-purpose recipes for running an un-apologetically small but thriving business.  The book is organized into a series of brief essays on a variety of work topics; read on for a few passages I found particularly compelling and a special video dialogue where Jarred and I discuss the book:</p>
<p><span id="more-1281"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something <em>you </em>want to use. [. . .] If you&#8217;re solving someone else&#8217;s problem, you&#8217;re constantly stabbing in the dark.  When you solve your own problem, the light comes on.  You know exactly what the right answer is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as there&#8217;s a danger in trying to solve someone else&#8217;s problem, there&#8217;s a danger in thinking that the answer to your problem is the answer to everyone&#8217;s problem.  This seems clearly, painfully true in the world of tech.  Friendfeed probably solved a problem for its creator, but it never caught on because most people don&#8217;t consume countless online channels like Robert Scoble.  The best products and services, it seems to me, address common pains that an innovator experiences personally.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever you can, swap &#8220;Let&#8217;s think about it&#8221; for &#8220;Let&#8217;s decide on it.&#8221;  Commit to making decisions.  Don&#8217;t wait for the perfect solution.  Decide and move forward. [. . . ] It doesn&#8217;t matter how much you plan, you&#8217;ll still get some stuff wrong anyway.  Don&#8217;t make things worse by overanalyzing and delaying before you ever get going.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t endorse this approach fervently enough.  As the authors point out elsewhere in the book, decisions delayed often translate into languishing projects and vanishing motivation.  In my experience, putting off a decision rarely leads to subsequent follow-through.  More often, two weeks later you&#8217;re back in a meeting with the same people facing the same dilemma&#8230;with no new information or additional wisdom.  Pull the trigger: decide, then change course if it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them.  Teaching probably isn&#8217;t something your competitors are even thinking about.  Most businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them. [. . .]  Teach and you&#8217;ll form a bond you just don&#8217;t get from traditional marketing tactics.  Buying people&#8217;s attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing.  Earning their loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection.  They&#8217;ll trust you more.  They&#8217;ll respect you more.  Even if they don&#8217;t use your product, they can still be you fans.</p></blockquote>
<p>I LOVE this notion, and it explains my affection toward 37 Signals and the authors of this book.  I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/" target="_blank">Signals vs. Noise</a>, the 37 Signals blog, for years.  Long before I started using Basecamp and Highrise.  Why?  Because it&#8217;s a corporate blog that&#8217;s interesting.  Imagine that.  They periodically post updates on 37 Signals products, which didn&#8217;t mean much to me before I became a customer, but they also offer&#8211;via the blog&#8211;a trusted perspective into the actions of other companies, developments in the tech industry, and content (quotes, photos, and the like) that&#8217;s just plain fascinating.  <a href="http://tayloransley.com/post/407085046/signals-vs-noise-haiti-earthquake-aftermath" target="_blank">Here</a>&#8216;s one of many pieces I&#8217;ve re-posted from Signals vs. Noise on my personal blog.</p>
<p>Teaching is underrated because it requires significant and genuine investment, often without an immediate return.  Putting the time into creating an ebook on trends in your industry or a &#8220;how to&#8221; guide that could be used by your competitors doesn&#8217;t directly pay off the way sales calls might.  But when done well, I think many consumers are eager to listen to a company willing to share expertise and teach.  We&#8217;re all bombarded by so many marketing pitches every day; what if you learned something every time a company pitched its product or services?  What if a company offered you valuable insights before you ever signed a contract or paid a dime?  I&#8217;m really excited to try this concept out in my own work, and I&#8217;ll share my efforts when they come together.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re all capable of bad, average, and great work.  The environment has a lot more to do with great work than most people realize. [. . .] [T]here&#8217;s a ton of untapped potential trapped under lame policies, poor direction, and stifling bureaucracies.  Cut the crap and you&#8217;ll find that people are waiting to do great work.  They just need to be given the chance. [. . .] Great environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>An environment where employees feel valued, respected, and trusted to take initiative really makes all the difference.  Without falling into the common trap of making everything a generational commentary, this seems to be a key shift.  Today&#8217;s younger workers are entering the workplace expecting to contribute ideas and find new ways to approach old problems.  Companies and organizations that recognize this desire&#8211;and refuse to worry endlessly about the (probably minor) consequences of not approving everything from the executive suite&#8211;will be rewarded by employees who take pride in their work and exceed expectations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Workaholics make the people who don&#8217;t stay late feel inadequate for &#8220;merely&#8221; working reasonable hours.  That leads to guilt and poor morale all around.  Plus, it leads to an ass-in-seat mentality&#8211;people stay late out of obligation, even if they aren&#8217;t really being productive. [. . .] Workaholics aren&#8217;t heroes.  They don&#8217;t save the day, they just use it up.  The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more toxic, in my mind, than the &#8220;ass-in-seat mentality.&#8221;  It not only demonstrates a lack of trust and respect toward your employees, it betrays more fundamental and serious issues in your workplace.  Employees who take the fate of their company or organization seriously deliver, even if it means working at 2 in the morning after spending an afternoon in the park.  Employees who know that they are valued simply for showing up during set hours will quickly lose motivation to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>I recommended Rework to Jarred, who devoured the book in less than 24 hours.  Here&#8217;s a short diavlog we recorded about a few themes in the book (note: early in the video I carelessly forget one of the authors&#8217; names.  Apologies to David Heinemeier Hansson, who co-authored the book with Jason Fried): <strong>[Ed. Note: Apparently Wetoku, the service we used to record the video, mangled it somehow and it no longer displays...we're hoping this is temporary]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="512" height="224" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="FlashVars" value="bgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;width=256&amp;height=192" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://wetoku.com/video/87duoeqr/player" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="flashvars" value="bgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;width=256&amp;height=192" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="512" height="224" src="http://wetoku.com/video/87duoeqr/player" quality="high" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" flashvars="bgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;width=256&amp;height=192"></embed></object></p>
<p>I would recommend Rework to nearly anyone.  It represents a worldview that is sure to seem anathema to many &#8220;experienced&#8221; (read: &#8220;older&#8221;) business owners and managers, but in staking out one extreme it&#8217;s sure to cause any reader to examine their own productivity, work culture, and business (or organizational) values.  We might not all want or need to function as 37 Signals clones, but I challenge anyone to read this book without discovering a nugget of wisdom or provocation to action that does not change some part of their approach to work.</p>
<p><em>In the video, Jarred and I obviously mention <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/taandoco-20/detail/0307463745" target="_blank">Rework</a>, but Jarred also mentions <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/taandoco-20/detail/0142000280" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen and I speak about <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/taandoco-20/detail/1591841496" target="_blank">Small Giants</a> by Bo Burlingham.  All three books are highly recommended.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://www.fitbit.com/design/2009-07/images/home/product/3fitbits_small.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="187" /></p>
<p>In September 2008, <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> held its second annual <a href="http://techcrunch50.com">TechCrunch50</a> event.  The multi-day conference brings together early-stage startups to give demos of their products in front of a panel of tech investors and consultants.  As I browsed through TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage of the event, one demo caught my eye in particular: the FitBit.  I put the $99 device on my Christmas 2008 wish list, but production and shipment was delayed by almost a year and a half because of design issues.  I just received my unit last month.</p>
<p>FitBit was a rare TechCrunch 50 demo in that it actually conceived a product made out  bits <em>and</em> atoms.  The company produces an extremely compact device called the FitBit Tracker.  About the length of a match and the thickness of a pack of gum, the Tracker is little more than an accelerometer coupled with a Bluetooth antenna, a bit of memory, and an LED display.  In other words, it&#8217;s a tricked out, wi-fi enabled pedometer.</p>
<p>But the value of FitBit lies not so much in the gadget itself as as in the data mining it enables.  The driving concept is unofficially called &#8220;the Prius effect,&#8221; the idea that people will behave differently (better, hopefully) when they have more granular visibility into their behavior.  For the Prius, it&#8217;s the in-dash monitor that shows how much gas is being saved by the hybrid system.  For <a href="http://www.google.org/powermeter/">Google Powermeter</a>, it&#8217;s the hour-by-hour online graph of home power consumption.  When you can track your pace and realize the stakes, the competition you hold with yourself to become better grows fiercer.</p>
<p><span id="more-1274"></span><img class="alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://www.fitbit.com/design/2009-07/images/home/product/fitbitAndCoin_small.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="187" />You clip the Tracker onto your belt or pocket, and it automatically logs your movement throughout the day.  When you come within range of the included USB base station, the Tracker offloads its data into the cloud-based FitBit Dashboard app.  That, in itself, is a lot of the value proposition: FitBit makes monitoring your fitness extremely easy.  No logging your daily steps in a spreadsheet, converting them into miles, or estimating the calories; FitBit does it all for you, automatically.  The onboard LED shows the raw data, as well as a little flower that grows and shrinks with your level of activity.</p>
<p>Using the web app, you can view your activity anywhere from minute-by-minute to day-by-day, including the approximate calories lost, miles traveled, etc.  If you need to enter activities not captured well by the Tracker (skiing and swimming for example) or if you forget to wear the gadget one day, Fitbit provides a deep database of activities that you can select from to approximate your exercise.</p>
<p><a href="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/fitbit1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1278" style="margin: 10px;" title="fitbit1" src="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/fitbit1-300x275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" /></a>To help put your exercise into perspective, the Dashboard also enables you to track the food you eat and the amount of sleep you get.  For food tracking, it has a robust database of thousands of generic and commercial foods that you can easily search, select portions, and assign to different meals.  The Dashboard totals the calories and other nutritional value, and shows the data on the same graph as your fitness level.  Thus, in a single view, you can see (however approximately) whether you&#8217;re burning more than you&#8217;re consuming.</p>
<p>As for sleep tracking, I&#8217;ve found this to be the least useful feature of the FitBit suite (but it&#8217;s still a neat trick).  Essentially, you enable &#8220;sleep mode&#8221; on your tracker (rendering it ultra-sensitive to movement) and place it in a provided wristband before hitting the sack.  The Tracker then logs how long it takes you to fall asleep, how many times you wake up in the middle of the night, and (assuming you remember to turn off sleep mode when you get up in the morning) how long you&#8217;ve slept total.  This information is also uploaded to the Dashboard and graphed separately.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found it really great to get a general measure of my fitness and nutrition data, and it has helped me make better choices of how/what to eat and how much to exercise.  I have a feeling that I&#8217;ll start being lazy and slack off on inputting my food data, but the activity level data is really the most important part of the package.</p>
<p>What would make the experience even better?  A mobile app that lets me enter my food and review my data on the go, as well as provide custom alerts (like a mid-afternoon warning that my calorie intake is on track to exceed my calorie burn).  I think the app could be more social too, perhaps letting me assign friends, family, or coaches as dedicated accountability agents to review my data and encourage me to keep at it.</p>
<p>In sum, I think the FitBit is a really nifty, useful gadget that over the long run will totally be worth the money.  The nice thing is that the gadget itself needs no upgrading, and any inadequacies in the web product can be updated regularly through the cloud.  It&#8217;s one of the best pairings of bits and atoms I&#8217;ve seen in a while.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Ezra Klein neatly summarizes in <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/11/tab_dump_101.html" target="_blank">his link</a> to <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132576/" target="_blank">this story</a> (an old link, but worth revisiting), &#8220;Opening a coffee shop is really hard.&#8221;  And yet, be honest: some part of you has imagined doing it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the types of businesses that are so romantically attractive to would-be entrepreneurs (yours truly), midlife crisis corporate types, and ambitious retirees&#8230;despite being nearly impossible to launch successfully.  From <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132576/" target="_blank">the Slate story</a> Ezra references about a nice couple who decided to chase their dream and open a coffee shop:<a href="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/barista.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1275" title="Barista" src="http://tropophilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/barista-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The dream of running a small cafe has nothing to do with the excitement of entrepreneurship or the joys of being one&#8217;s own boss—none of us would ever consider opening a Laundromat or a stationery store, and even the most delusional can see that an independent bookshop is a bad idea these days. The small cafe connects to the fantasy of throwing a perpetual dinner party, and it cuts deeper—all the way to Barbie tea sets—than any other capitalist urge. To a couple in the throes of the cafe dream, money is almost an afterthought. Which is good, because they&#8217;re going to lose a lot of it.</p>
<p>[...] Guess what, dear dreamers? The psychological gap between working in a cafe because it&#8217;s fun and romantic and doing the exact same thing because you have to is enormous. Within weeks, [my wife] and I—previously ensconced in an enviably stress-free marriage—were at each other&#8217;s throats. [...] Two highly educated professionals with artistic aspirations have just put themselves—or, as we saw it, <em>each other</em>—on $8-per-hour jobs slinging coffee.</p></blockquote>
<p>The restaurant business can be worse.  Here&#8217;s<a href="http://www.rimag.com/article/CA6699502.html" target="_blank"> one industry veteran&#8217;s warning to day-dreamers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>I had somebody approach me who had a very good job with a major company and an MBA from a prestigious university [and wanted to open a restaurant]. I looked at him and asked, “Is your career in danger?” He said, “No, but I’ve always loved food. I love to cook. I love to have parties.” I told him to invite 20 friends over, throw a great dinner party, and then take a stack of $100 bills and burn them one by one. It will be fun—and cheaper than opening a restaurant.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>It&#8217;s easy to confuse the types of establishments we like to frequent with the types of enterprises we&#8217;d like to <em>run</em>.  Coffee shops embody a tremendous mythology based on the notion that since it&#8217;s so relaxing and fun to be a coffee shop patron it must similarly be painless and joyous to create that space for others.  Unfortunately, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">customers</span> people can be unreasonable, stingy, fickle, and downright unpleasant when they&#8217;re low on caffeine or faced with a slightly-stale scone.</span></p>
<p>Almost any business can seem more glamorous and, frankly, easy to manage from the outside.  The trick is understanding enough about the good, the bad, and the ugly reality before jumping into a new industry or setting out on your own&#8230;while maintaining enough of that naivete and idealism to succeed, even in impossibly difficult endeavors.  No one dreams of owning a joyless moneypit that serves coffee or Italian food.  But the great coffee shops and Italian eateries are run by people who knew the risks and decided to give it a shot anyway.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite people that I follow on Twitter is Genevieve Spencer.  Her tweets are extremely brief, and she writes pretty much exclusively about her day to day life.  Sometimes she just comments on the weather (&#8220;Snowed a little bit today&#8221;), other times she talks about school (&#8220;Played &#8220;I Spy&#8221; at school to-day. Teacher was late. I was the first one there.).  She never comments on current events or responds to other people&#8217;s tweets.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because she&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1270"></span><a href="http://twitter.com/Genny_Spencer">@Genny_Spencer</a> is the daily diary of a female teenager between 1937 and 1941.  Her grand-nephew David Griner, a social media strategist and developer, found her diaries and decided to create an daily, auto-posting account of each entry.  When Griner first started the account on January 1, 2009, his great-aunt was still alive (although stricken with dementia).  She passed away about a month later.</p>
<p>As Griner <a href="http://www.thesocialpath.com/2009/01/twitter-from-1937.html">notes</a>, there&#8217;s really nothing personal in the diary &#8211; it&#8217;s more a daily accounting, and most posts focus on the temperature.  But in a time when we&#8217;re blasting and being blasted with updates about celebrities and start-ups, gaffes and gore, these mundane, anachronistic tweets offer a real breath of fresh air when they pop onto my screen.  What a different time, when it was sometimes literally too cold for children to go to school because they had to walk so far, or when the highlight of one&#8217;s day was having a parent&#8217;s friend over for dinner.</p>
<p>There are many exciting potential applications of this idea.  For example, last year on the anniversary of the first moon landing, a site called <a href="http://wechoosethemoon.org">We Choose The Moon</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/07/12/apollo-11-moon-landing/">created</a> Twitter accounts for <a href="http://twitter.com/ap11_capcom">Houston Command</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/ap11_spacecraft">Apollo 11 spacecraft</a>, and the <a href="http://twitter.com/ap11_eagle">Eagle lunar module</a>.  The radio transcripts were fed through the accounts in sync with the timing of the events 40 years ago, letting us experience the exciting pace of the event in real-time.  Scattered among other present day updates, it presents a really compelling reminder of how much excitement is happening all around us.</p>
<p>While these novelty accounts don&#8217;t justify the existence of Twitter or other real-time social services, they do make for interesting use cases.  They also help keep in perspective the times we live in, and the level to which events in our lives really qualify as &#8220;groundbreaking.&#8221;</p>
