<p>The journey down to KL was filled with traffic, but that didn’t stop us from catching up with one another.We had a good time just laughing and chatting away amidst the horning, long queue in traffic and crossing traffic lights after traffic lights, but in a blink of an eye, we reached Dorsett earlier than expected for the dinner.</p>
<p>Upon entering we found ourselves a nice table in front of the stage and got ourselves. We were soon overwhelmed by the smell of delicious roasted lamb, lamb satay, nasi dagang, beef rendang, fresh oysters and so much more. Let’s not forget the desserts, of which there was a variety to choose from such as mango puddings, cheese cakes, traditional kuih Melayu and so much more piled up next to a flowing mountain of chocolate, buckets of ice cream and D.I.Y ABC’s.</p>
<p>Since we were early, we grabbed our portion and waited patiently for Buka Puasa as a sign of respect for our Muslim friends but before we even knew it, it was BUKA PUASA TIME! The delicious meal did not disappoint and soon some of us were going back for seconds and thirds before hitting the desserts; you know what they say, “there’s always room for dessert!”</p>
<p>After all the fun, food, company and entertainment with each other, we took our leave from the Buka Puasa buffet dinner with stuffed bellies and a merry heart!</p>
<p>We at BPC Solutions would like to wish all of you &#8220;Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri!&#8221; and journey mercies on your travels this festive season.</p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>
<p>There’s more to an online campaign than just opening a Facebook page and hoping for the best. There’s also more to building a website than just hiring a freelancer with pretty designs. Because, what we’ll do is:</p>
<ul>
<li> Brainstorm effective online concepts and campaigns suited for you;</li>
<li>Recommend the right social media platforms;</li>
<li>Create the style of “voice” needed for your brand;</li>
<li>Website requirements analysis based on your needs;</li>
<li>Backend &amp; Technical planning to ensure your brand receives the fullest online advantage;</li>
<li>Analyse and present campaign and website analytics;</li>
<li>Scoping of project.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Development</h1>
<p>With the proper plans and strategies in place, a successful online presence can only be executed with careful development. This is to ensure that a strong foundation is in place for a long lasting and stable website. This means we work out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social communities</li>
<li>Website design integration;</li>
<li>Mobile friendly websites;</li>
<li>Database development;</li>
<li>eCommerce;</li>
<li>Application Development;</li>
<li>Content management;</li>
<li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM);</li>
<li>Online interactive games;</li>
<li>Web hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Creative</h1>
<p>Yes, we’ve got the codes and the expertise to build a website. But we put in more than just the ones and zeroes into your site. Over here, we’ve got an eye for the artistic angle in things that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art direction;</li>
<li>Website interface design;</li>
<li>Multimedia design;</li>
<li>Print production;</li>
<li>Copywriting;</li>
<li>Branding</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

It’s best in JB and Singapore and some even say Batam.</p>
<p>Okay, so the last line we kinda borrowed from another well known ‘Private Limited’.</p>
<p>But what is true is that BPC Solutions has expanded its reach to Singapore and will now be servicing our loyal clientele of the island and to gain even more regional exposure. Led by our dynamic Project Leader, Loh Chi Ming, we’re confident our Singapore office will exceed expectations especially with years of experience under his belt from his work with Ogilvy &amp; Mather and his passion for digital and social marketing. Aside from that, he has also executed projects for digital, direct, and events/activation that include the launch of Apple’s iPhone3G and the award winning Maxis SME’s <em>guanxi</em> campaign. With Chi Ming at the helm of this brand new ship we’re sure that BPC Solutions Singapore is in safe and capable hands.</p>
<p>If any of you are in the Lion city and are in need for digital services such as web marketing or social media, just give us a buzz!</p>
<p>You can also check us out on our <a title="BPC Solutions on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/bpcsolutions" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>

But it&#8217;s not about lacklustre battery life that has the internet savvy Malaysians all riled up, rather it&#8217;s all about the<a title="Energizer Night Race 2011" href="http://www.facebook.com/EnergizerNightRaceMalaysia" target="_blank"> <em>Energizer Night Race 2011</em></a>.</p>
<p>Post event hundreds began posting their thoughts and views on the official event page. Now, this is where the hell really began as not only were the organisers <em>ignoring</em> the complaints or even attempting to attend to the chaos, they did the <strong>ONE</strong> absolute cardinal sin of the Social Media world.</p>
<p>They began deleting comments and posts.</p>
<p>We’re not going to repeat what’s already been said multiple times on the internet, so we’re just going to link you over:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.tianchad.com/2011/04/worst-energizer-night-race-2011-ever-no.html">By tianchad.com: Worst Energizer Night Race 2011 Ever!!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a total nightmare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>So, What could have been done differently?</h3>
<p>1)       Social Media is a conversation. When someone says something to you, you acknowledge and respond. If you ignore the person, irritation and anger will only rise and eventually things will get out of hand which was what happened here. The deletion of comments was also the straw the broke the camel&#8217;s back as users took that as a sign that the organisers/brand did not give two hoots about what they thought.</p>
<p>Basically, whether the event were a success of a failure, brand representatives should&#8217;ve been ready to answer and attend to comments on their Facebook page and any and all Social Media channels that were setup for the run. Why? Because people would&#8217;ve been all fired up to talk about the event&#8211;like how you step out of a movie and would want to talk about the acting/plot/goofs and etc. Same thing applies here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bpcsolutions.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ENRM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-778" title="BPC Solutions: Energizer Night Race 2011" src="http://www.bpcsolutions.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ENRM.jpg" alt="BPC Solutions: Energizer Night Race 2011" width="500" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>2)      Ensure the users that their comments are being taken seriously irregardless of how ridiculous the comment may have sounded (emotions would&#8217;ve been running high). Answer them and not just paste one single post on the wall to answer EVERYTHING. People want personalisation especially in this day and age. A careless announcement of general apology would never have done it.</p>
<p>3)      Never delete comments/posts/notes. People will just hate you and yes, they will DEFINITELY notice. Ignorance is never always bliss.</p>
<p>4)      Your personal opinion may not be the brand&#8217;s official statement but when you yourself are the project leader, you&#8217;re also automatically linked to the brand&#8217;s image. Be careful what you say. Take a breather, go have a cup of tea, rant to your best friends, but never make it public especially as a Facebook note that can be screencapped and saved.</p>
<p>Sure, it wouldn&#8217;t have been a bed of roses even if the organisers had treated this whole incident differently, but it would&#8217;ve at least eased and calmed the masses slightly. And maybe, there wouldn&#8217;t have been such passionate witch hunt. However, <em>Energizer</em> has made an official statement of apology and promised to refund registration fees to each contestant.</p>
<p>To see the silver lining in this whole thing, the social media peeps are now able to take this very real case and present to clients showing them exactly <em>what shouldn&#8217;t be done</em>.</p>
<p>As we’ve said before, Social Media is a force to be reckoned with. After all, it gave us Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black didn’t it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
