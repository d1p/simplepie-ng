<h4>"This is a &lsquo;best of&rsquo; Fringe&rsquo; contender. Wren Handman&rsquo;s &lsquo;MUTE&rsquo; is an emotional portrayal of a young teenager who has been stricken dumb as a result of the traumatic witnessing of her parents&rsquo; deaths. Following the accident her brother eight years her senior becomes her legal guardian. He is protective &amp; cares for her deeply, but the arrival of a new case worker threatens to change the status quo.&nbsp;Caitlin Morris-Cornfield&nbsp;is the young girl and her portrayal reeks of reality.&nbsp;Andrew Soutter&rsquo;s&nbsp;Adam evoked&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">all&nbsp;</span>the big-brothers who adopted this only child as mentee&nbsp;during my formative years. The case worker with her unbending behavioral formulaic program is played by a convincing&nbsp;Rachelle Magil. This thespian trio brings such intensity to their individual characters that no audience member will fail to be personally touched by their powerful portrayals. There is one other character that never appears, but he&rsquo;s the catalyst of the situation &ndash; the missing originally assigned case worker.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Director Michael Bergmann MUST be familiar with &lsquo;special needs&rsquo; and &lsquo;non-verbal&rsquo;s&rsquo; to be so able to represent the frustrations such individuals&rsquo; experience. He utilizes freeze-frame imagery with voice broadcast to illustrate her powerful but unspoken thoughts. &lsquo;<strong>MUTE&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;is a MUST-SEE!&nbsp;<strong>DG<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">"</span></span></strong></h4>

I know you haven't heard from me in a while, but this year that is going to change, as a bunch of new things are happening.</p>
<p>First, you might notice the website looks different. A bit of a refresh, but by no means a final look. <em>(Attention CSS magicians, care to lend a helping hand?)</em></p>
<p>Second, new shows! As you can see on the right pane, we have two shows coming up that we are involved in: <em>Under Milk Wood</em> and <em>Mute</em>. As we get closer to them, I'll be posting much more information.</p>
<p>Finally, what I consider the most important new development. In keeping with the original mandate of BergARTS, to combine the worlds of art and technology, I will be launching a new tech blog. A tech blog focusing specifically on technology made for artists, or used by artists. It will be fairly broad in that definition, and I'm sure the direction of it will change over time. I have some longer term ideas that I may want to develop it into, but we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>So, finally, a question for you, my fellow artists:</h3>
<h3>What technology do you love? What do you use in your art (whatever form it may take)? Leave me some ideas in the comments, and let's start of list of these.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try to talk about something, whether it is a product or service or even tip, at least once a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this will be part of the main blog, but also reachable directly at <a href="http://www.bergarts.com/tech">BergARTS.com/tech</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, welcome to <strong>BergARTS: Tech</strong>. Help me start, post below, and share with others!</p>

Our video footage has been shot, and is in post production right now. We are in the last weeks of rehearsal, and I am very excited to get this project all together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, the last part is for you to come and see it! Show dates, times and location are available on the Leer page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show runs approximately one hour. Each show will be followed by a talkback, where I would love to hear your comments and questions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Can't make the show? Not to worry, as it will be streamed live as well. If you are watching live, I encourage you to take part in the chat and join in on the talkback; we'll be taking questions from our online audience as well.<br /><br />The show will air live at 8pm EST at the show dates at:<br /><br /><a onmousedown="UntrustedLink.bootstrap($(this), &quot;d3bd46de3e6a43a6291bccb67634a9db&quot;, event)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.BergARTS.com/live" target="_blank">http://www.BergARTS.com/live</a><br /><br />In person shows are PWYC ($5 recommended), online shows are of course free. That being said, I would highly encourage and implore you to come in person if you can. Not only does it make me happier, but you will get the much fuller experience.</p>
