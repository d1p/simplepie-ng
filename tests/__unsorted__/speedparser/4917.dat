<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><span><span style="font-family: garamond,serif;"> </span></span></span></span>Diana “SPAGHETTO” Manfredi is an Italian director who earned her B.F.A in Video Art at the Fine Art Academy of Milan and her M.F.A in Directing at the School of Cinema in Barcelona. She started her career really young with Spaghetto Child, a skateboarding brand through which she produced and directed various skateboarding videos and her first movie “Skaterz”, a portrait of five skaters from Milano and their friendship, which sold out theaters and won the “Paesaggi Umani” grant. From there she directed her own commercial for the MTV “I&#8217;m Different” campaign and the TV show “Spaghetto Child in da House”. She took part in the “Urban Edge Show”, the biggest street art exhibition ever organized in Europe, with her skateboarding photos and also directing a documentary on the exhibition.</p>

<p>A few documentaries later Diana is touring Europe and the US with “District Six”, a movie about a Muslim family who, like many, were forcibly removed from their home in Cape Town during Apartheid. After presenting her documentary to universities, non-profits, and festivals worldwide, including the NYC Diaspora Film Festival, LA Pan African Film Festival and SF Black Film Festival, she moved to the US. Diana has worked as a producer (<a href="http://www.spaghettoproductions.com" target="_blank">Spaghetto Productions</a>)<strong> </strong> and director in California and won the Audience Award at the 7 Day Film Festival for her narrative short film “Talking to Mr. Wall”.   She has directed over forty works comprised of music videos, documentaries, and commercials, and writing/producing two TV shows for the Italian channel Bonsai TV. She currently lives in LA where she is writing her first feature-length narrative movie “Websters”.</p>

<p>Spaghetto is more than just a filmmaker. Spaghetto is more than just a hardcore punk/hip-hop/singalong enthusiast. More than just a martial artist in the dojo of light and angles. What Spaghetto captures are the moments you smile to yourself about the night before. The inside jokes from last weekend. The times when you sing in the shower and dance in your kitchen and think that nobody is watching&#8230; and there&#8217;s Spaghetto. Spaghetto takes the everyday creative outburst and turns it into a gorgeous discovery of blue-collar genius. They say a performer needs his audience. Spaghetto likes to capture the performer in his rare moment without an audience, rather just himself and his craft. Spaghetto Productions: a genuine fly-on-the-wall making dreams come true everyday.</p>

<p>What woman, besides your mom or grandmother, do you find inspirational?</p>
<blockquote><p>I find inspirational any woman who doesn&#8217;t ask for shit. Who has her dreams and goals in life and just go for them without even thinking “Wait! But I&#8217;m a woman!”</p></blockquote>
<p>How did you get your start as a filmmaker and photographer? What came first for you?</p>
<blockquote><p>I started in Italy, when I was a teenager. My friend Camilla gave me a super old Hi8 video camera and I started filming my friends and hardcore/punk shows with that. The camera was so old that they stopped making tapes for it after a few months I had it! I think around that time I started taking pics. I had this all manual Yashica camera that I really loved. All my friends were skateboarders/graffiti writers/artists and most of them were in bands, so I was taking pictures and filming my reality and the things that were happening around me. After a couple of years I met my boyfriend, he was a pro skater and had a mini DV camera. We started a skate company together, SpaghettoChild, and I was making a bunch of videos for it. When I wasn&#8217;t filming I was editing. I always had to borrow a camera, I couldn&#8217;t afford one. But I had a computer&#8230;a super slow PC with a cracked version of Adobe Premiere installed. So I learned how to edit videos and I became addicted to it. That&#8217;s pretty much how I started, figuring stuff out by myself, with the worst equipment ever!</p></blockquote>
<p>How did the name Spaghetto come about? Do you just really love pasta?</p>
<blockquote><p>In Italian spaghetto is a singular piece of spaghetti. I had this skateboarding company called SpaghettoChild and that was also the name of our crew of friends and artists. When I moved to California and I started my own production company, I called it Spaghetto Productions. Cause my roots as a filmmaker are in the SpaghettoChild crew and Diana Spaghetto was always my nick name.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite piece photograph and film that you&#8217;ve taken?</p>
<blockquote><p>I have many&#8230;right now I really like some b/w photos I took of my sister in Sicily. Sicily is such an amazing and inspiring place, I love it. One of my fav videos is for sure a skateboarding video I directed for MTV years ago. The message was really hard for being on MTV, in a moment where everyone with a skate was considered “cool”. They were always putting skateboarding in random videos just cause it was trendy at the time, but since they didn&#8217;t know anything about it, they were hiring all these wannabes and all the videos were looking super fake. So when they finally asked me to make a commercial for the MTV “I&#8217;m different” campaign, we couldn&#8217;t miss the chance to talk hella shit about the posers! I remember I had to fight with the producer to keep the video how I wanted it to be, but it was fun. I was hella young, I didn&#8217;t give a fuck about anyone who was trying to tell me what to do and how to do it. I shouldn&#8217;t really blame on the age too much tho, I&#8217;m still really stubborn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your short film Face Off with Estevan Oriol is great, how did that project come about?</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you! I love his work and we have mutual friends. So when I moved to LA I asked him if he wanted to do a video with me and he accepted. He is a tough guy and his subjects are most of the times really tough too. So I wanted to underline that aspect and that&#8217;s how the idea of the western-style duel where both the photographer and his subject points of view are shown came to my mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who do you want to photograph? Who do you want to work with on a video?</p>
<blockquote><p>I like to photograph random situations I witness. My pics are never staged, so I can&#8217;t really tell you a name. But there are a lot of people I would love to work on a video. I&#8217;m really inspired by a lot of different bands and artists right now. Some hip hop artists I really like hit me up to direct music videos for them. But I don&#8217;t want to say the names yet, I wanna wait until I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s happening for real!</p></blockquote>
<p>What part of taking photos and shooting film is the most challenging and do you dislike the most?</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything that comes before the shoot is the most challenging for me&#8230;I hate to look for $$$, be in meetings, etc. Everything that is not creative I pretty much dislike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any advice for ladies who are just starting out in a career path similar to yours?</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t wait on people. Do as much as you can by yourself. Start 100 projects at the same time, at least one will happen and you can go from there. Don&#8217;t give up!!</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s next for Diana Manfredi?</p>
<blockquote><p>The movie “Websters” I am writing and my first photo book called “5 fucking years”. I am excited about them! Stay tuned! &lt;3</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Obsessing about the band Elbow and their performance at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_81035" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 658px"><a href="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/MyLatestObsession3.jpg" rel="shadowbox[post-81033];player=img;" title="My Latest Obsession - Elbow"><img class="size-full wp-image-81035" title="My Latest Obsession - Elbow" src="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/MyLatestObsession3.jpg" alt="My Latest Obsession - Elbow" width="648" height="777" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My Latest Obsession - Elbow</p></div>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been obsessed with Elbow for just about four years now, after one of my friends made me listen to &#8220;Grounds for Divorce.&#8221; One listen and I was hooked. The voice. The sound. The lyrics. </p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t heard of Elbow? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard the masterpiece I just mentioned. Still doesn&#8217;t sound familiar? Listen to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdmwHljfN4Q" rel="shadowbox[post-81033];player=swf;width=640;height=385;" target="_blank">clip with the BBC Orchestra</a>. It will bring tears to your eyes and make the hair stand up on your arms and the back of your neck (especially around the 3:13 mark). It&#8217;s that good.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IdmwHljfN4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier this year, when I was in London, I tried to go see Elbow for the  first time&#8230;in their native Manchester, no doubt. But, plans didn&#8217;t  work out, and my hope to see them live were foiled until a good friend of mine told me that they were going to be performing at the <a href="http://www.strictlybluegrass.com/" target="_blank">Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival</a> in Golden Gate Park. I used to live literally right across the street from GG Park and never once attended the HSB. Bluegrass really isn&#8217;t my thing, hardly strictly and free concert or not, but there was NO WAY that I was going to let this opportunity pass me by!</p>
<p>I was not disappointed. Although their set was only one hour long, it was a memorable one, and one that included two violins (LOVED that). They were pitch perfect and clear as a bell, a difficult feat when you&#8217;re outside and there are other stages around you. You could hear how each individual instrument was layered into each song, which is something that I really love about this band and it was incredible to hear this magic taking place on-stage. I&#8217;ve also developed a bit of a crush on Guy Garvey, as he knows how to work a crowd, in a very endearing way. He was constantly pointing people out, would tell the crowd to do things like &#8220;tickle the air (with their fingers)&#8221; and if you felt stupid doing that, it was ok. Do it anyways. How can you not love that?!</p>
<p>Their set featured music off their last two albums, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_a_Rocket_Boys!" target="_blank"><em>Build a Rocket Boys!</em></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldom_Seen_Kid" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Seldom Seen Kid</em></a>. Surprisingly, they played two of my favorites off <em>The Seldom Seen Kid,</em> &#8220;Bones of You&#8221; and &#8220;Grounds for Divorce&#8221; early in the set, but I rather liked that they didn&#8217;t go predictable by playing their most popular hit stateside (Grounds) as their closer. The selections off their new album, &#8220;The Birds&#8221;, &#8220;Lippy Kids&#8221; and &#8220;Open Arms&#8221;, which was especially beautiful with the string accompaniment. They closed the set with &#8220;One Day Like This&#8221; which was the absolute perfect choice to close the day, as the sun was going down behind Guy and the rest of Elbow.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor this week and give them a try if they are new to you, or spend some time rediscovering them if you already know who they are.</p>
<p>Until next week (and my next obsession)!</p>

<p>While I was in NY for Fashion Week, one of the things I did between shows at Lincoln Center was take <a href="http://lachanelphile.com/2011/09/22/fashion-in-the-streets-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2012-presentations/" target="_blank">Chanel street style photos for La Chanelphile</a>.  I have radar when it comes to anything that includes matelassé (quilting), pearls and the ubiquitous chain with woven leather.  I noticed a woman in line with a camera strap that was gold chain with black woven leather.  I kept walking by her trying to see what brand it was as I was only trying to shoot authentic Chanel product.  I concluded that it wasn&#8217;t Chanel &#8211; and that I needed that camera strap ASAP.</p>
<p>As soon as I got in front of a computer I did a Google search to try to find out more about this strap.  Was it DIY? Was it sold online? Where could I get one? I needed to find out because I needed it in my life.  Fortunately, it was pretty easy to find (thank you Google images) and I was able to find the genius behind the leather and chain camera strap &#8211; Sarah Frances Kuhn.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that before Ms. Kuhn was designing the coolest camera straps ever she was an Accessories Editor at <em>Teen Vogue</em>.  I&#8217;m happy that she&#8217;s moved on to camera straps because now I am a proud owner.  I went with black/gold (of course) but there are lots of color options.  The straps come in two lengths and different weights depending on the camera you&#8217;re using. I think I may have to get a wristlet as well for my G10.  Or, I may get a super-deluxe for my DSLR and put my classic chain on my G10.  Either way, apparently one is not enough for me.  You can get yours on <a href="http://sarahfranceskuhn.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Frances Kuhn&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a breakfast person. Well, really, I&#8217;m a food person. However, breakfast is not something I do everyday &#8211; usually it&#8217;s coffee and oatmeal or cereal on the go. So when I have the opportunity to sit down and have a good breakfast I want only the best.</p>
<p>When in the East Bay, Baldie&#8217;s in Union City off Decoto road is the place to be. I usually get waffles there but everything looks delish.  Service is warm, but not overbearing. Everyone working there has been there for years, and the owners are always there. This family-run business is a staple in the community.</p>
<p><a href="http://http://www.stfrancisfountainsf.com/">St. Francis Fountain</a> in S.F. is my choice when I find myself in the City in the mornings. They have something for everyone, from tofu scrambles to sourdough french toast (my pick). Located in the Mission on the corner of 24th &amp; York, it used to be an ice cream parlor where you would go get your soda pop with your sweetheart. Bought by its current owners in 2002, it got spruced up and revamped and has remade itself to its former glory.<a href="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BayToLa92911_02.jpg" rel="shadowbox[post-80831];player=img;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80886" src="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BayToLa92911_02.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="504" /></a></p>
<p>L.A. mornings don&#8217;t usually hold the soft warmth of being at home, but these next 2 spots make me forget all that mess.</p>
<p>L.A. Cafe is open 24 hours a day, which alone makes them awesome. The fact that their baked goods are ridiculously yummy makes them that much more awesome. Their chocolate muffin with a cup of coffee is my normal poison, but when I want to sit for a while, I will order a fresh orange-carrot juice and an Over the Border breakfast sandwich.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, is my hands-down favorite breakfast place: Heritage Family Pantry in Lakewood/Long Beach is ah-may-zing! They have everything you can dream of&#8230; well, that I can dream of. I love their cinnamon swirl french toast &#8211; they make their cinnamon rolls there so you can imagine the goodness of it all. They make most of their breads so you are guaranteed fresh, good food. If you go, try the L.A. Marathon (if you dare): two of everything &#8211; pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon&#8230;. Also tell them you want a muffin (chocolate chip is my fave) grilled, they will bring it out with butter and fresh whipped cream. Heaven.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie3.jpg" rel="shadowbox[post-80892];player=img;"><img class="size-full wp-image-80893 aligncenter" src="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie3.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="522" /></a></p>
<p>When M.I.S.S. girls have the sudden urge to <em>just do it</em>, we always stop and remember to… RELAX.  Oh yes, this week we’ll be taking a journey to the city where silver screen dreams are either made or broken with <em>Frankie Goes To Hollywood. </em></p>
<p>Coming out of the 70s punk scene in Liverpool, the group was formed with Holly Johnson on vocals, Paul Rutherford with the keyboard, Peter Gill on drums, Mark O’Toole hitting the bass and Brian Nash on guitar. On inquiry about the origin of the group’s name, Johnson has said that it came from a Frank Sinatra picture in <em>The New Yorker</em>. It was actually a Guy Peellart pop art poster that was the inspiration for the name.</p>
<p>Touring around Liverpool, the group began to garner a cult following. They even joined up with another group &#8211; <em>The Leatherpets. </em>Through their local popularity, FGTH was able to make their own promotional videos and record demos, despite having been turned down by majors like Arista and Phonogram. It was a lucky chance in October of 1982 that the group was able to record a session for the famous BBC Radio 1 with the John Peel Session. This session included FGTH classic <em>Two Tribes</em>, as well as <em>Disneyland, Krisco Kisses</em>, and <em>The World is My Oyster</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="480" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2575ttbSV7Q?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2575ttbSV7Q?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>The magic that Radio 1 is famous for creating did not spare FGTH. Soon after, the group was asked to record the video for <em>Relax</em>, their most famous single to date. Channel 4 asked the boys to make the video for their show <em>The Tube,</em> and the broadcast led to the previously-recorded session with John Peel to be played on the radio. The growing popularity of the group convinced Grammy Award-winning producer Trevor Horn to sign them to his newly formed ZZT Records.</p>
<p>Their debut single, <em>Relax, </em>did not have a massive entry onto the charts. Released in 1983, it steadily rose on the UK Top 40. It was a feature on the BBC’s <em>Top of the Pops</em> in the beginning of 1984 which rocketed it from number 35 to number 1 for six weeks straight.</p>
<p>It was a cold January day that began a controversy that has followed the group for their entire career. Radio 1 DJ Mike Read noticed the cover design of the single and became furious at what he said was obscene sexual content. He note  the Yvonne Gilbert-designed cover, as well as the lyrics. Live on air, he took the single off the air. This was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[post-80892];player=img;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80895" src="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie1.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="522" /></a></p>
<p>BBC decided to ban the single from all broadcasts, radio and television included. The only show it was allowed to remain on was its Top 40 show.  Speculation on the reason for the ban was the sexual matter and the uncomfortable feeling execs felt for the band’s gay message.</p>
<p>Even the original video had to be redone. In the first version, a gay S&amp;M den was the setting and leather-clad gentlemen and women were featured. The second video was directed by Brian de Palma to partner with the release of the <em>Body Double </em>film.</p>
<p>Finally, after almost a year of being banned, <em>Relax </em>was allowed to be performed in the Christmas special of <em>Top of the Pops</em>.</p>
<p>The groups next two singles, <em>The Power of Love </em>and<em> Two Tribes,</em> were both number ones in the UK, gaining the group the honor of being the only other group in UK history to have their first 3 singles be reach #1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie2.jpg" rel="shadowbox[post-80892];player=img;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80894" src="http://www.missomnimedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frankie2.jpg" alt="Then and Now" width="648" height="522" /></a></p>
<p>The group went through the typical rise to fame and eventual breakup, but what we wanted to focus on was the social impact they have left both on the music world, and more specifically, the gay community. Which each of their albums and tracks, they made a conscious effort to address an issue they felt important. In the <em>Two Tribes</em>, the images featured in the video are a mash up of famous clips of political figures around the world. Flip through any 80s nostalgia show or go to an 80s themed party and there is sure to be someone rocking a “Frankie Says…” shirt. The cultural impact the group has left has engrained them into pop history, probably as long as it will take to get <em>Relax</em> out of your head.</p>

<p></em></p>
<p><em>Dear MISSter Simms,</em></p>
<p><em>At the last dance of the school year last year my long time crush asked me to dance with him.  It was super sweet.  He was shy, but he held my hand and we got really close.  Afterwards I didn&#8217;t really see him until the new school year started a couple of weeks ago.  Now I constantly find him staring at me (not in a creepy way) and I see him a lot more because we do a lot of the same activities.  It seems like he&#8217;s into me but he&#8217;s just too shy to tell me.  How do I tell him that I like him too?  Or should I just wait for him to make the first move one day?</em></p>
<p><em>Role Reversal</em></p>
<p>Dear RR,</p>
<p>When dealing with a shy guy you&#8217;ve got to switch the roles a bit and be the one to make the first move.  Clearly he is into you.  You say he stares at you in a non-creepy way, and I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;re not walking the school halls in a clown suit.  Inside he&#8217;s burning with desire&#8230;.but can&#8217;t really express it.  So what you need to do is get yourself alone with him doing some activity where you can get around to letting him know that you like him too.  Maybe you could ask him to study something with you.  That&#8217;s a classic move right there.  Maybe you guys could go get something to eat.  Maybe you could ask him to hang out and help you do some shopping or something.  Whatever it is, just make sure you&#8217;re not surrounded by friends and you two will finally be able to get your feelings out in the open.  Good luck!</p>
