			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a world whereby our borders are open, where data is open, where organisations are open&#8230; where education is open.</p>
<p>Those of you who read my blog are pretty au fait by now with the <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/1081/">open principles of data and organisations</a>, and we live in a world of pretty open borders &#8211; so now, just bear with me through the open education thing.</p>
<p>There is an almighty (thank goodness) brauhaha at the moment about teaching programming in schools, indeed upping the interweaving of digital teaching throughout all subjects (beyond googling the best essay ever on any given subject). But there is the huge gap in enthusiasm amongst the young generations &#8211; relatively easy to solve &#8211; and the ability of teachers to teach all a young person needs to know in this future digital world, one that many have not grown up in, let alone been taught how to teach, this is harder.</p>
<p><strong>But is this a deal breaker?</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/t_talk-to-the-hand-graphic.jpg?w=150" alt="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/t_talk-to-the-hand-graphic.jpg?w=150" /></p>
<p>Many (many many many) people say to me: but I taught myself how to code and I am fine, I have a career and I do well, if it was taught to me maybe I would not have found it so interesting.</p>
<p>Fair point, but you are all over 25. The under 25s do not agree &#8211; well not 100% anyway.</p>
<p>So I think that we can accept, just by reading all there is online right now about this subject, that there is a need, a very real need; and it is not just for the younger generations whom we may be letting down by not doing anything about this. Can we take that for granted for the sake of this post?</p>
<p>However, there is a big problem that we need to be addressing at the same time as we fight for recognisance of the need to teach 21st century computing &#8211; and that is that the teachers we have now, indeed the teachers we are training now, are not equipped to teach this.</p>
<p>I am a part of a network called <a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/">Computing at School</a>, and have recently been included in their google group. This group is full of teachers who are supporting each other, sharing resources, introducing people from outside the education community who are programmers, are building software and hardware (open source), or who are parents with rudimentary knowledge or extraordinary knowledge &#8211; robotics anyone? or those just wanting to help somehow.</p>
<p>In this google group I am a party to many conversations between teachers crying out for help and information, and helping each other. They share links, wack up a wiki when a subject gets too big for just an email list, bring in industry experts &#8211; and all in their spare time. Those teaching Computer Science degrees helping the primary/secondary school teachers and vice versa. It is all an open forum, anyone can ask anything, and they do. I cannot tell you how humbling it is to read some of the conversations, enthusiastic and daily, sparked in this group &#8211; and it completely negates the publicly perceived view that this task is impossible because the IT teachers are crap. It is simply not true.</p>
<p>Yes, many of them did not train in IT, but they trained as teachers, and as teachers they take the education of the UK&#8217;s next generation extremely seriously. (I am sure you can all haul out a rubbish teacher to point to, but let&#8217;s play to the masses and not the exceptions). These are people who love what they do and want to do their best, they know that they need help to get this right, but I do not see any reticence there.</p>
<p>What I do see, is the occasional call for help &#8211; to assist with making the case for changing the stuff they are teaching, often a cry of:</p>
<blockquote><p>The head gets it, but will ask the *usual* questions. Anyone help me?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I am not a teacher, so have no idea what these questions are, but taking a wild stab I would assume that they are on a par with the senior management teams in organisations who can only approve things if they fit with industry approved measurements of success &#8211; and struggle when there is no such thing (yet).</p>
<p>Yet schools are already being forced to move into measurements not yet measured. Schools are no longer valued just on the say so of Ofsted (oh I know it is still a big thing, but for how much longer, open data?)</p>
<p><strong>Open education?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not impossible it is already here. Computing at Schools is an excellent example of open education. The head of ICT might not know how to teach Python to a bunch of 9 year olds and make it fun &#8211; but Mrs Miggins down the road does.</p>
<p>So please, when you hear the counter-argument to teaching kids to code being that teachers can&#8217;t do it, that&#8217;s not true, they can &#8211; it will be a good decade until they are officially trained to do so, but even then all they really need to know is how to teach, then they can choose what they teach, and it is an ongoing learning path, I am sure (unless it&#8217;s Latin or Ancient Greek).</p>
<p>Until then, let&#8217;s nurture open education. If you can code and know that you might be able to help a teacher, or write some open source software for use in schools &#8211; please do it.</p>
<p>I would encourage everyone to start with Computing at School (CAS) as it is already here and already plugging right into the heart of the teaching network. CAS is a grass-roots organisation and that is the only place we can start. Top-down simply will not work &#8211; anyone think we will still be learning Scratch in 2020?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s accept that government has a lot to do and that it will take time to make the necessary policy changes, and let&#8217;s make sure that our voices are heard as people living in a democracy, use the petition system, the voting system and the fact that we are actually allowed to speak to our politicians, and they will listen (again please let&#8217;s play to the masses not the exceptions here).</p>
<p>But at the same time, let&#8217;s just do what we can to make it all work a little bit better in the mean time. Besides, we can experiment (a bit) and if we experiment with the best minds we can lay our hands on (in an open education way) then the risk is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>And I think the next generations will forgive us for trying, they may not forgive us for giving up. I hope they wouldn&#8217;t anyway.</p>
<p>Please take time to sign the e-petition &#8211; <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/15081">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/15081</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If any of you have heard me tell the story of how <a href="http://rewiredstate.org">Rewired State</a> came about, you may be surprised that I am throwing myself into a barcamp. (For those who haven&#8217;t, it goes along the lines of &#8211; after 3 years of talking about the digital future of government in a series of barcamps, I got thoroughly bored and wanted action not words, so kicked off National Hack the Government day with the genius minds of James Darling and Richard Pope &#8211; since then I have been a bit scathing about chatty stuff &#8211; I am often wrong).</p>
<p>So, we are running a barcamp style informal evening on the topic of teaching coding in schools. We are doing this because actually the debate and issues that surround the subject of teaching programming in schools is so complicated, it is also noisy. So what we are hoping to do is bring some of those voices together in a room for a couple of hours, to hammer out some of the next steps.</p>
<p>We aim to have everyone commit to one action each at that barcamp, for them to then blog about their progress over the next few months and then run a hack day 3 months after that, to prototype any required digital tools. Thereafter we would like to hold regular alternate barcamps and hack days, relentlessly drilling through the issues and gathering the necessary experts around this topic.</p>
<p>It is way too big a subject for it to be owned or solved by any one organisation or thought leader &#8211; it requires an expert and committed community, self-driven and focused on specialist areas. Katy Beale from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wearecaper">Caper</a> and myself from <a title="#codingforkids evening barcamp" href="http://youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired State</a> are just acting as catalysts here &#8211; we want it to take flight.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you would like to take part in, then the event is being held on October 12th from 6-9pm at the Guardian, sign up to the Eventbrite form over <a href="http://codingforkids1.eventbrite.com/">here</a> and we will keep you posted on stuff.</p>
<p>This is very much a community thing, it is not an Emma and Katy thing, we just wanted to get it started.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So imagine a world where we had managed to delete the contracts of the people who charged over a million to execute a back button on Directgov (yes) plus untold numbers of stories of traditional ICT organisations ripping off government. All those very ICT contracts that we railed against and celebrated the fact that we finally had a government willing to put an end to this nonsense. And the very reasoned arguments for kids and coding. And then let&#8217;s see what happens.</p>
<p>Here is paragraph seven of the <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-09/15/tech-city-invests-in-young-people">Wired Article</a> on where we are now and the &#8216;good news&#8217; of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>An <a href="http://www.e-skills.com/">E-skills UK</a> partnership between major companies including IBM, the BBC, Capgemini, Cisco, Deloitte, HP and Microsoft, have teamed up to reinvigorate the IT curriculum and GCSE and A-level.  The companies will provide online resources, expert advice and Industry-based challenges to encourage creativity, entrepreneurship and team work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see you and your consultancy revenue based organisations, and I raise you a network of 100s of kids through YRS who will not be fooled (see what they did when I once got the wrong people in front of them?)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="QAvsBen" src="http://fifteenandahalf.com/photos/qavsben.gif" alt="" width="450" height="302" /></p>
<p>and a network of 100s of Rewired State developers who have no truck with your efforts that are based purely in profit margins and not the real issues this country faces. I also think I can raise you a country full of people fed up with your kind of ransom. With the exception of Microsoft and Ben Nunney (the enthusiastic one in the image above), every organisation named should be held to account for the money they have charged the taxpayer, as well as the disservice they have paid to the computer programmer.</p>
<p>The fact that government now holds this up as a success story sickens me. Are we really measuring our success by romancing the endorsement and fake charity of these named organisations? Let me point you for a second over here: <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/blog/2011/09/nurturing-our-own-talent">http://rewiredstate.org/blog/2011/09/nurturing-our-own-talent</a> I can assure you that pretty much every one (except Microsoft) told me to bugger off, or maintained a stony silence.</p>
<p>I see your hand and I raise you our country</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after declaring that this would not become a personal mission for me in my post: <a title="Year 8 is too late" href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/year-8-is-too-late/">year 8 is too late</a> it has become a personal mission.</p>
<p>The petition is appallingly written. In my defence it was a brutal, and random, word count; I had to keep removing chunks of copy and keep trying to submit it, until suddenly it worked (no the word count that it eventually allowed through bore no relation to the word count originally stated&#8230; bug?). Anyhow, this terrible prose means that many have tried to explain it through writing <a href="http://blog.jgc.org/2011/09/teach-our-kids-to-code.html">their own explanatory blog posts</a> and I thought I had better have a bash at explaining the background better myself.</p>
<p>What do I mean by code?</p>
<p>The word coding is a slang term for computer programming, used because programming basically means writing source code. Source code can be written in any number of languages (such as Ruby, Python and a gazillion others) and is the method used to instruct a computer to execute a series of actions. These actions are understood by the computer in what is known as binary code, that lovely series of ones and zeros loved by Hollywood futuristic films</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.digitalproductionme.com/pictures/gallery/Stock%20images/Binary_code_on_blue%20for%20web.jpg" alt="http://www.digitalproductionme.com/pictures/gallery/Stock%20images/Binary_code_on_blue%20for%20web.jpg" width="731" height="183" /></p>
<p>Lovely</p>
<p>When I wrote the post about teaching kids to code in Year 5, that this would address the nerdy image and encourage more female coders, I was focusing more on the immediate and tertiary &#8220;brand&#8221; issue that geekery has in this country. It is not yet awesomely cool to be able to build digital tools that shape the way the rest of us operate in our worlds, both social and work-based. Not in the UK anyway. And I could see this having a profound effect on our worldwide digital economy and reputation in the very near future &#8211; this drives me insane and I just could not understand why people were not a bit miffed by this.</p>
<p>Then I read a book called <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/program-or-be-programmed/">Program or be Programmed by Douglas Rushkoff</a> please buy it and read it, even if you just read the Preface and Introduction, it is one of the most important books of our age. Here is a bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real question is, do we direct technology, or do we let ourselves be directed by it and those who have mastered it? “Choose the former,” writes Rushkoff, “and you gain access to the control panel of civilization. Choose the latter, and it could be the last real choice you get to make.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read this book &#8211; my slight irritation at the fact that programming was not taught as a part of the curriculum, nor indeed seen as important by parents &#8211; it became a far greater philosophical concern, and one that I thought I had to really throw myself into doing something about.</p>
<p>I want my children to have choice, to be able to operate the world they grow up into, not just be driven by it. It&#8217;s not just being able to code, in any case, it is understanding computational thinking, really being aware of the value of the frontal lobe over the relative intelligence of the computer programme &#8211; are we really going to allow our kids to blindly stumble into a future so utterly dependent on digital tools and products, without giving them the chance to be the demi-Gods who sit behind these things, telling them what to to, and thereby us what to think?</p>
<p>Ben Hammersley used to say to me, the Foreign Policy of this country is not what the Foreign Secretary says it is, it&#8217;s what Google says it is. You could argue this fact, but it is broadly true, and now you could perhaps replace &#8216;google&#8217; with &#8216;twitter&#8217;. Ben has <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/2011/09/my-speech-to-the-iaac/">transcribed a speech he gave to the IAAC</a> &#8211; please go and read it, it is similarly essential reading.</p>
<p>Rushkoff says in his book that the difference between being able to code and not being able to code, is like being the driver or the passenger (not, as some people think, the difference between the driver and the mechanic). Think about that for a minute, and take a look about you, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/pause_for_thought_black_text_card-p137452235662050689tdn0_152.jpg" alt="http://rlv.zcache.com/pause_for_thought_black_text_card-p137452235662050689tdn0_152.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now I am very definitely not alone here. Many people are making lots of noise about this: writing stuff, lobbying Ministers, pestering the Department of Education, meeting, planning, tweeting &#8211; you name it, it&#8217;s done. The movement is definitely gathering energy and people are beginning to come together around this topic. All I have done, apart from <a href="youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired State</a> of course, is start the e-petition bit of this process; as it is the only way we have a real hope of this being debated in Parliament, even if it is in a year&#8217;s time and even if it is not guaranteed to be debated, even with 100,000 signatures.</p>
<p>But what it *does* do, is give everyone who is out there a public place to point, with a decent number of signatories: 1,180 it its first 7 days and growing. (We do need to up its rate of growth if we are to reach 100,000 in a year, but this is why understanding the need for it is so important.)</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>I am NOT saying that teaching programming in schools should replace ICT. ICT teaches you how to operate the digital tools now so paramount to our lives, of course we still need what we can fondly now refer to as traditional ICT. However, it is only half the story &#8211; we need to start teaching the other half, and fast.</p>
<p>Please sign the e-petition, and share it, tweet it, blog it, send it to your mate who is in the media and get them to talk about it.</p>

<p>Tim Rogers, a Young Rewired Stater and one of the founders of the fabulous Silicon Britain blog, has written his own piece on this, and it is worth hearing the voice of a young digital star <a href="http://www.siliconbritain.com/2011/09/computer-science-in-the-uk-is-year-8-too-late/">http://www.siliconbritain.com/2011/09/computer-science-in-the-uk-is-year-8-too-late/</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is a follow on from <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/year-8-is-too-late">the one I wrote about how we need to start teaching children to code in their junior years</a> (Year 5 is my stab in the dark). This would address the issue of fewer female coders than male, and the fact that not enough people are equipped with this super awesome skill whether their career ends up being in programming, car manufacture or shoe design. The post received such a wealth of feedback in the comments that I could probably write a blog post every day of the year to explore all of the stuff raised in there &#8211; I won&#8217;t but I will try to draw out some.</em></p>
<p><em>In this post I am going to answer the question: </em><strong>what resources can we use to learn or teach code?</strong><em> This seemed to be the question immediately raised in the comments on the post and on twitter, so I have simply read all of the comments and looked at the products and listed them all here for you to use as a resource. I am pretty sure that commentors will leave further links in the comments on this post.</em></p>
<p>However, before I continue, John Godfrey, one of the commentors on my last blog post left a link to this video. It&#8217;s just over an hour long, by Randy Pausch and I would love it if you could all watch it if you haven&#8217;t already, as well as read this list of resources! Bear with it, you will learn some excellent things as you watch, but you will also see the insight and inspiration behind Alice, one of the suggested links included below. (If you don&#8217;t have an hour or so free right now, then come back to it, but watch the ten <em>ish</em> minutes from <a href="http://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo?t=52m11s">this point in the video</a>) otherwise watch the whole thing here:</p>
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/how-to-initiate-kids-or-anyone-in-coding/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ji5_MqicxSo/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
<p>Deep breath&#8230; here is a list of resources (including Alice)</p>
<p><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/"><strong>Scratch</strong></a></p>
<p>Scratch got many thumbs up from commentors on the last post and was indeed the basic skill many of the <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/">Young Rewired Staters</a> attending this year&#8217;s coding challenge. Here is the blurb from Scratch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create your own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art &#8212; and share your creations on the web.</p>
<p>As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also learning to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29"><strong>Logo (and the turtle)</strong></a></p>
<p>A few people mentioned this. It *is* good, but it is also a bit <del>boring</del> dated. It is described as &#8220;<a href="http://www.mathsnet.net/logo.html">the term used to describe a range of programs that in various ways provide the user with the means of controlling the movement of an object on the screen ( often a turtle)</a>&#8220;. So yes, it is a great thing but would need some good teacher skills to make it relevant and exciting, I think. Or it could be a very painful and dreary maths lesson.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.r-e-m.co.uk/logo/?comp=imagine">Logotron</a> has a list of resources etc for teaching and teacher.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alice.org/index.php"><strong>Alice</strong></a></p>
<p>After insisting on you watching Randy Pausch&#8217;s lecture, how could Alice not feature highly? Alice is a 3d programming environment, designed to &#8220;create an animation for telling a story, playing an interactive game, or a video to share on the web. Alice is a teaching tool for introductory computing. It uses 3D graphics and a drag-and-drop interface to facilitate a more engaging, less frustrating first programming experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there is Alice 2.0 and Alice 2.2 as well as Story Telling Alice. The latter was the one mentioned by Randy as being developed by Caitlin Kelleher and is &#8220;&#8230; designed to motivate a broad spectrum of middle school students (particularly girls) to learn to program computers through creating short 3D animated movies.&#8221; &lt;- danaaaa!! You can download Story Telling Alice <a href="http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/download.html">here</a>, but it is not hugely tested, is only available for windows based machines, has no support &#8211; but I certainly plan on playing about with it with Amy (9).</p>
<p>&#8216;Proper&#8217; Alice has full support and documentation and teaching materials and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29"><strong>Android</strong></a></p>
<p>Android was recommended as an easy way to start mobile programming &#8211; &#8220;Android is a mobile operating system for mobile devices such as mobile telephones and tablet computers developed by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed just looking at all of the web resources to help a person get started in Android programming, I can see why it came so highly recommended. So I found <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/android/AndroidGuide.aspx">this on the Code Project website and it is a great tutorial</a>. This is a great starting point for teenagers/newby adult coders, frustrating for littler ones unless they are already into this. I lost quite a few hours researching these links for Android programming, and where you can go from there. So be warned, Googling &#8216;Android&#8217; might just mean that you can just sod off and go teach yourself everything you want to know really from a pretty decent standing start. There are bazillions of tutorials out there.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.2simple.com/2diy/">2simple.com/2diy</a></strong></p>
<p>This software was recommended but it costs money. Not that I do not agree with people charging for providing such useful resources, of course, but just a warning. It is software used for &#8220;creating your own interactive Flash resources, activities, games, puzzles, quizzes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a resource really for teachers to use in schools, co-creating with children to use across subjects utilising the whiteboards (as well as websites and learning platforms). Wins an *applause* award from me for making it all relevant! But is very much aimed at younger learners.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms"><strong>Lego Mindstorm</strong></a></p>
<p>Programmable lego *ends*</p>
<p>=======Drumroll please=============</p>
<p>Whilst in the process of writing this post a brilliant website was born: <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"><strong>http://www.codecademy.com/</strong></a> simple, brilliant perfect way to pick up javascript. I don&#8217;t need to tell you about it, they do a perfectly fabulous job of that all by themselves in their own ingenius fashion. I can see no fault in it, but it has been met with some scepticism, I just cannot see why really, but that&#8217;s my own opinion. It is the javascript version of <strong><a href="http://tryruby.org/">Try Ruby</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other interesting links</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blitz Academy</strong> has a whole <a href="http://www.blitzgamesstudios.com/blitz_academy/resources/">list of resources</a> for those thinking about getting a job as a games developer (in fact the reading and link list is interesting for anybody even vaguely interested in anything)</p>
<p>Someone mentioned the <strong>Bytes Brothers books</strong>. Now that was an interesting hour lost! (Again &#8211; this post has taken nearly a week just because I keep disappearing down digital allies). So the most useful link I could find for these was <a href="http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=1171">here</a>. Here&#8217;s the blurb: &#8220;Sort of a cross between Encyclopedia Brown and Micro Adventure, each volume in this series contains several short mysteries. The user must read carefully and run very simple BASIC computer programs in order to guess the solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote another post a while back for the <a href="http://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo?t=52m11s">&#8220;inquisitive&#8221;</a> it is for those reading this who want to try Python or Ruby, or even scraping websites.</p>
<p><em><strong>Post Script</strong></em></p>
<p>I am not equipped with a teaching degree, so I cannot give equivocal advice on what to teach at whatever stage, however here is a great guide from Matthew (@pixelh8):</p>
<p>Year 5 = 9-10 age Computational thinking, logic, cause and effect (try Scratch, Google app inventor or Lego Mindstorms all visual based programming) or even Game Maker.</p>
<p>Year 6 = 10-11 age Should definitely be coding (try Processing very visual very quick feedback and free see <a href="http://pixelh8.co.uk/category/programming-in-schools/" rel="nofollow">http://pixelh8.co.uk/category/programming-in-schools/</a> for code examples and <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/11/teaching-kids-programmers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/11/teaching-kids-programmers/</a> )</p>
<p>Year 7 = 11-12 age try XNA, iPhone &amp; Android dev the program doesn’t have to be complex or world changing you just have to show them a way in. Also they love being able to use and create on up to date tech.</p>
<p>Year 8 = 12-13 age some of the best iPhone developers are 13 years old.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every time we run <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired State</a>, indeed pretty much every time <a href="http://rewiredstate.org">Rewired State</a> runs any hack, we are asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>What is the male/female ratio?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is usually 5% max female.</p>
<p>Sometimes people then look at me expectantly for me to explain what I am going to do about this, and I usually look a little bit scared.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mum-blog-pics.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1155" title="Don't be scared" src="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mum-blog-pics.jpg?w=717&#038;h=316" alt="" width="717" height="316" /></a></p>
<p> To be honest, finding developers of any age or gender, willing, talented and happy to either volunteer their time or give up a weekend (even if it is paid) to help government or organisations as they emerge blinking into the open digital world, is challenging enough. But to answer the girl question &#8211; so far I have been at a loss really, and sometimes irritated by the question. Why is no one ever happy?</p>
<p>But yet&#8230; it<em> is</em> an important question; and pertinent to me, as the mother of two daughters, one of whom is crying out to code, counts down the days to come to work with me on a hack day &#8211; and often fills in the memory gaps where I have missed vital sections of presentations.</p>
<p><strong>The answer</strong></p>
<p>Kidding, I don&#8217;t really know the answer, but Courtney Williams (a mentor from the <a href="http://www.tnmoc.org/">National Museum of Computing</a>, Bletchley Park, at Young Rewired State (YRS) this year) and Wendy Grossman (a freelance writer who followed and <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Young-Rewired-State-2011-1319486.html">diarised YRS</a> this year) have volunteered to look at some of the data we have and do some clever brainy things. This research will kick off in September 2011 and I will keep you all posted.</p>
<p>In the mean time, here&#8217;s my personal opinion based on a few years of working with developers of all ages, children of all ages and being a Mum of an aspiring girl-geek (9) (and a teenage daughter who has no interest whatsoever &#8211; she can be the &#8216;control&#8217;).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>=========warning====personal opinion====not based on data====based on surmise and thinking=========</strong></p>
<p>I find it relatively easy to understand and explain the lack of girl geeks, in YRS as well as in the grown up world. Here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>girls get self-conscious and socially conscious at around puberty/aged 12-14ish</li>
<li>coding and digital prowess is still niche at a young age, self-taught by the studious. Often considered a bit nerdy in senior school, where it is not (nor ever has been) taught as a part of the curriculum; therefore those who code have taught themselves. Teaching yourself something that should really be covered as a part of lessons, is a bit like doing extra homework &#8211; *why* (ask many teens) on earth would anyone do that?</li>
<li>there is no way the majority of hormonally challenged, desperate to find their place in the world, teenage girls would risk ridicule or isolation by doing such a thing - let alone be open and proud about it? (Boys of the same age have different social challenges and do not measure their societal worth so much by peer review aged 13/14)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I reckon YRS gets a higher female sign-up but greater drop-out rate just before the event. They sign up because they want to, they drop out because they cannot face the potential embarrassment &lt;- if only they knew how heralded they would be by the achingly cool. But even the achingly cool kudos doesn&#8217;t win against the female peer group pressure.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the answer?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I hate to limit this to just the girl geek question, but perhaps in solving the problem of a dearth of female coders we can make a big dent in the broader problem of the lack of teaching any coding languages in the National Curriculum &#8211; anywhere.</p>
<p>Forget enticing computer science degrees, or trying to encourage teenage girls to pick up Python&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Year 8 is too late</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Start teaching coding as a part of the curriculum in Year 5. At this point the maths is strong enough in most kids. The IT curriculum has fostered a familiarity with computing and computers and the young minds are ready to start learning programming languages. Indeed they are creative, excited and have not yet developed any association, good or bad, with certain subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I don&#8217;t suggest replacing the teaching of IT, that really helps kids get to grips with spreadsheets and word processing skills (yeah OK, Microsoft products, but hey). This is a new subject, an emergent but critical one - as critical as the traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> subjects with which we are all so familiar.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If  it can be introduced as a part of the central curriculum in Year 5, I bet you my last penny that by the time those kids are drawn up through the education system, you would find far less of a disparity between the sexes &#8211; and maybe even an increased number of talented young people with an ability to manipulate open data, relate to code and challenging each other to design and build digital products that you and I have not even begun to imagine. <em>Have a little imagine now&#8230; good innit?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Make one change: teach coding in Year 5 and thereafter, make it a part of the curriculum (as relevant and necessary as the traditional STEM subjects).</p>
<p>If you want to talk about this, share knowledge, do anything, then I will track what I can on twitter through the hashtag #yr8is2late</p>
<p>But I am only one person and this is not a personal campaign (yet) I want to do what I can, and I can share knowledge and experience, but it takes far more than YRS, Courtney, Wendy and myself to make a difference. And this difference would be for all young developers, not just female.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So three years in to <a href="http://data.gov.uk" target="_blank">data.gov.uk</a> and the inaugural <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/events/hackthegovday" target="_blank">National Hack the Government Day</a> and now there is a tick box exercise to &#8220;run a hack day&#8221;&#8230; please&#8230; someone&#8230; anyone?</p>
<p>Open data is not about hack days and running one does not achieve &#8220;engagement with the developer community&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I met <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lizazyan" target="_blank">Liz Azyan</a> today. Someone whom I have been aware of for the last few years: blogs great stuff, is principled and keeps herself gainfully employed with a plethora of socially ethical social media support (if you know what I mean).</p>
<p>I was blindsided by her, she is awesome and I think really trying her damnedest to do the right thing in an environment that she totally understands, but with a community she is less accustomed to &#8211; yet. Watch this space, and government data geeks: I urge you to chat to her if you get a chance.</p>
<p>One of the questions she asked me today was: What is the next challenge for open government data? So thank you Liz for the inspiration for this blog post, it got me thinking about something I have not thought about much, recently.</p>
<p><strong>The environment</strong></p>
<p>Government has opened up quite a bit of data through <a href="http://data.gov.uk" target="_blank">data.gov.uk</a>, and has encouraged engagement with keen developers who have been hankering after such information for years.</p>
<p>Industry too has embraced Open, with a small number of notable businesses throwing open their data doors, with good results. I <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/1081/" target="_blank">wrote a post</a> about this, I shan&#8217;t repeat myself and bore you.</p>
<p>APIs are being released almost every day &#8211; developer information overload has maxed out, and now we risk lethal <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/developers/" target="_blank">developer apathy</a>.</p>
<p>Developers have attended hack days, meetings in Whitehall &#8211; indeed many of them have joined <a href="http://alpha.gov.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaGov</a>. This is all fabulous; but not scalable to the extreme that the open data dream promises.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge</strong></p>
<p>Making it all work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very well having developers working away with this data, but if government is not ready for it, it&#8217;s a waste of time.</p>
<p>Take just one example: two <a href="http://countculture.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">incredibly</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/delineator" target="_blank">talented</a> developers worked together over the course of a weekend hack last year, coding through the night to create a notification engine for the government Tell Us Once programme. It worked, it would have saved oodles of time and bucketloads of cash &#8211; but government was simply unable to implement it. This is one simplified example of <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/projects" target="_blank">100s of apps</a> created by <a href="http://rewiredstate.org" target="_blank">Rewired State</a> hack days alone, and there are many others.</p>
<p>Now, if you can imagine for a minute being a developer, donating your time &#8211; granted, sometimes the hack days are paid, but always weekends away from family &#8211; year on year creating apps that would help government and citizens. Solving problems time and time again &#8211; quick example, every year the Young Rewired State coders create apps to help them define safe routes to school/friends. Year on year we showcase these to the Home Office &#8211; nothing happens. Still no government supported/approved app to meet this obviously critical need.</p>
<p>Why would you bother?</p>
<p>Open data? Awesome, and we are making tracks.</p>
<p>Open Government? HARD, and we are not banging on that door yet.</p>
<p><strong>The reality</strong></p>
<p>The developers who work on government data often do so either out of personal frustration, or a genuine commitment to making the world a little bit better.</p>
<p>Rarely can they reach an audience that would benefit from their app/widget/website on their own and in their spare time, at least not without considerable support. Nor are they doing this for profit, so they are not going to get investor cash.</p>
<p>Helping government do its work better is not a good proposition for your typical angel or VC &#8211; the target is government; and only government can utilise the genius that they are being offered.</p>
<p><strong>Lots of tiny arrows</strong></p>
<p>Right now lots of tiny arrows are rained on the government portals day on day, by an increasingly disparate and desolate group of extremely talented people.</p>
<p>Is there any success anywhere? No. Well unless you count the oft-reported <a href="http://govspark.org.uk/" target="_blank">GovSpark</a> created by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/issyl0" target="_blank">Issy</a> in <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/events/young-2010" target="_blank">Young Rewired State 2010</a>, curated by a plethora of supportive geeks and designers and some financial and hosting support from The Stationery Office. But that was a &#8216;nice to have&#8217; addition to a Prime Ministerial commitment. It was not a revolutionary way to interact with central or local government.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the next challenge for Open Government data?</strong></p>
<p>Forget the data.</p>
<p>Find a way to enable these revolutionary ideas, apps, websites and widgets that save time, money and mind-numbing frustration from those who have to engage with government.</p>
<p>Do that, and only that.</p>
<p>And when you have done that &#8211; then engage the developers again around your open data through hack days, geek advisory boards or whatever means you can.</p>
<p>Until then, let them have a break. They&#8217;ll still be there if you do this. If you don&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And that is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Also, please don&#8217;t insist people &#8216;do hack days&#8217; for you. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/whats-the-point-of-a-hack-day/" target="_blank">point of a hack day</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, yes I do have much better things to do with my time but I just wanted to bang up a quick post, to help Directgov and anyone else who might mistakenly think that twitter is the social medium of choice for &#8216;the young&#8217;.</p>
<p>I did a quick survery &#8211; asked a couple of times &#8211; how old people were (who were reading my tweets &lt;- following me). I got 120 replies that were in a format that I could use (thanks @grahamashton for this little hack <a href="https://gist.github.com/1043057">https://gist.github.com/1043057</a> we have upped the number of calls it can make to try to capture everything, but it obv won&#8217;t read the dms &#8211; and you will need to install feedparser). I ended up having to work out the average age this way:</p>
<p><a href="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1134" title="Age calculation" src="http://mulqueeny.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/photo1-e1308911516690.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Anyhow, ages are still being sent to me as I write, but the average age at 11am today was 40.51.</p>
<p>Interesting things to note, although it is a bit &#8220;no shit sherlock&#8221;, those who choose to read my tweets will generally be interested in the stuff I am, which is a bit dull: open data, government, geeks, hack days, cooking and moaning &#8211; and so the age group is defined more by the subject and person; if I were Justin Bieber doing this my followers may well be younger.</p>
<p>My daughter, her friends and other teens I know are on BBM (the Blackberry messaging service) and Facebook, right now &#8211; they are not interested really in twitter, but do sometimes ask me to tweet stuff or find out what someone said.</p>
<p>Twitter is a platform, and from this little survey &#8211; most commonly used by grown-ups/the middle aged</p>
<p>Feel free to comment on how to run a proper survey and that this doesn&#8217;t really say anything &#8211; it was just an interesting thing to do and hopefully helpful somewhere to someone&#8230; and it did not cost 10s of thousands to research <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Right &#8211; to work</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get asked constantly what my favourite app was that was built at any of the many hack days I have run through <a href="http://rewiredstate.org" target="_blank">Rewired State</a>. I am often ashamed that I struggle to answer, although there are many. This is because hack days are rarely about the prototype.</p>
<p>To cover briefly what a hack day is, it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or two days long (often belying the name)</li>
<li>any number of developers, for me a minimum of 10 devs are needed to make it buzz a bit, but 20+ makes it exciting</li>
<li>a subject, challenge, dataset (the broader the better)</li>
<li>developers are given a brief of the subject or challenge at the beginning of day 1</li>
<li>they code/design/engineer over the course of a free form period of around 24 hours to create prototype solutions or ideas</li>
<li>they present back to their hack peers and any inquisitive viewers, as well as the sponsor, client or group who put the event together</li>
<li>prizes are awarded</li>
<li>beer and pizza is essential</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Many people will not experience a hack day, but if you can, please do. Show and tells are usually open to anyone who wants to attend and twitter and lanyrd are quite good at curating such event information.</em></p>
<p>However, the reason for this blog post is to explain the point of a hack day, now in 2011 (it will definitely be different in a year&#8217;s time, but to chart right now).</p>
<p>If you take a little time to look at the above list of what a hack day is you can understand that the common question might be: yes but what did they make and what happened next?</p>
<p>My response to that is that you are jumping the gun.</p>
<p>What we do at hack days is show you the future. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p><strong>Why do developers turn up?</strong></p>
<p>Well, in the current climate: API bonkers, information overload (yes devs get that too), tablet shmablet, toy shmoy world that we live in, there needs to be a little peace, as well as a challenge. As I have explained in a <a href="http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/developers/" target="_blank">previous post about developers</a> it is up to the rest of the world not to risk developer apathy (already here IMHO), and to look at what really matters.</p>
<p>Developers are simply awesome and if you know one I dare you to go try your million dollar idea out on them &#8211; they will have deconstructed and reconstructed it in minutes. Tell them your *save the world* idea and they will probably risk divorce to build it for you &#8211; please don&#8217;t do this.</p>
<p>Developers who know hack days turn up for the buzz, the competition and to learn, mainly to learn. Those who have never been to one come for the challenge.</p>
<p>I have been running hack days for three years now, and one veteran of the Rewired State hack days was at this weekends&#8217; hactivate event. He spent the weekend coding a composting app, it&#8217;s cool, you can see it and many more <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/projects" target="_blank">here</a>. But the big thing for him was spending 1.5 hours playing with a web server, in peace, legitimately, on a Sunday (and learning). Another group (and this is usual for a hack weekend) were hack day virgins, and have adopted the amaze-balls face of pride at what they can actually build when challenged by time (hack days are ruthless) as well as taking home the contact details of the colleagues who are as talented as themselves, at other stuff.</p>
<p>One developer gave himself this hack weekend as a Father&#8217;s day present. To have a weekend to spend with his peers, although coding was his day job, to work on his own projects, surrounded by like-minded awesomes, fed, watered &#8211; that&#8217;s the point.</p>
<p>Most developers will leave a hack day with new knowledge or at least new contacts, that can lead to extending their ability to deliver the awesomeness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably fair to say that most would not admit to being so excited by the non-coder audience blinking at what they have managed to create in a two-day period, nor the prizes showered upon them. And, from those I know, it is always the afterthought &#8211; although I am now really clever and spend my life finding flipping brilliant geek prizes that they can&#8217;t ignore <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>Which is why it is important to understand all this before you ask: what is the point of a hack day?</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in it for the non-coders/organisations/brands?</strong></p>
<p>So, there is an immediate and very obvious benefit for anyone engaging a number greater than ten developers on your own idea/API/bit of kit, and hack days seem to be de <strong><em>rigueur</em></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>Is not hard to be confident that good things will come of the weekend.</p>
<p>But is it the list of prototypes at the end? That no good hack day host would ever be able to predict?</p>
<p>No, it is engagement with the development community. Gifting your idea/API/bit of kit and enabling some free time for developers to engage with and over said idea/API/bit of kit. Yes of course you will get any number of good prototypes and even working applications &#8211; but better you will get to meet a number of developers, showing off their skills and often their newly acquired ones &#8211; this is really as rare as hen&#8217;s teeth (usually because they are fully employed fulfilling other peoples&#8217; ambitions) engaging over a dedicated period, with peers they may not have yet met, over your technology or challenge. Yes, your super-sexy next bazillion idea might come out of this &#8211; but you created the environment for that conversation, that dev-to-dev spark.</p>
<p><strong>But yet&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The thing I have noted today after Hactivate is that the sponsors are actually dedicated to seeing the apps go beyond the hack day. The winning app was one built to try to address human trafficking, and it was created to make the interface so simple that anyone could take it up without needing access to anything too technical; then we could crowdsource peoples&#8217; safety.</p>
<p>The judges are determined &#8211; from a human pov, not only the brand they represented &#8211; to help collate the necessary charity network information and wherewithall to make it happen. However the geeks who thought it needed to happen and were so passionate about beating human trafficking that they spent their weekend building an application to make people a little bit more safe, found it hard to adjust to the jump of someone actually taking it on and helping make it happen (within 24 hours). <em>Possibly because they had been coding non-stop for 24 hours, presenting to Press, sponsors and co-hackers &#8211; more probably because they were not used to their ideas being taken up so strongly and immediately by the kind of brands that can really make it a reality.</em></p>
<p>Such is the magic of a hack day.</p>
<p>This is why I love hack days&#8230; dilemma <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>And so&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The point of a hack day for a developer is to be with like-minded people, work on your own stuff, learn and be celebrated; for the rest of us, it is to create the environment for magic to happen.</p>
<p>Maybe in the next few years they may become simply about the prototype, but I hope that day is a long way off. The point is developers, living and learning from each other in an environment that is created by you: the challenger.</p>
<p><strong>Finally&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>As ever, my cry is: please, do not take the piss, developers are for life not just for your *next million* or *save the world* idea. They are an asset to be cherished and nurtured and they do not necessarily always value the same things you do. It is rarely money or jobs &#8211; most developers are awash with job offers, and extra-curricular *cash* offers.</p>
<p>Hack days do work, right now, because everyone wins when they are run well and with consideration. But please don&#8217;t ask me what my favourite app is that was ever built at a hack day! I can&#8217;t tell you, I have no idea. I do however now know 200+ developers whom I would be able to call in a heartbeat, and know their skills, passions and talents &#8211; but I would never sell them to anyone.</p>
<p>Developers are a talent to be nurtured in our open data and open society world. Hack days respect this and act as breathing spaces for devs.</p>
<p>It is rarely about the prototype, and when it is, I will probably go buy that flower shop I have been promising myself.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I got on your train at 18:15 from Waterloo, and I got off your train at 22.59:45 at Woking after the following:</p>
<p>1. Total chaos at Waterloo with delayed trains and no explanation whatsoever<br />
2. Finally getting on a train after failing to get on two previous ones as people were literally hanging out of the doors<br />
3. Train rode well to Clapham then crept towards Woking &#8211; no explanation<br />
4. Train stops</p>
<p>==== Guard does the following announcements in a variety of orders and not very often and very reluctantly =====</p>
<p>Apologies for the delays tonight<br />
Apologies for the delays tonight it is because of signal failures<br />
Apologies for the delays it is because of a fire in Farnham<br />
Sorry for no information, I can&#8217;t get through on the telephone for an update<br />
The managers say that you have to stay on the train<br />
The engineers are fixing the signals<br />
We have too many trains in the station<br />
There are no trains going in or out of Woking &#8211; (except that one)</p>
<p>Then &#8211; after 2 hours of being stuck on your train, the lights and air go off. No explanation. After ten minutes, the guard says that he is going to open the central doors to help air movement &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t. He also mentions that he has a drink and a sandwich, but does not offer to share &#8211; we have no food or water, people start getting ill.</p>
<p>==== the air is off for well over an hour &#8211; that&#8217;s the air conditioning that enables a packed train to breathe &#8211; imagine that =====</p>
<p>The announcements start up, and this time the driver joins in &#8211; once &#8211; (note he didn&#8217;t when it was the signal failure being blamed)</p>
<p>We are told:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we get off the train we will be arrested</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That police are walking the track and waiting at Woking to arrest anyone who attempts to leave the train &#8211; we see no sign</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That *passengers* have broken out of the trains and are roaming the tracks therefore we can&#8217;t move &#8211; I see no passengers, or indeed any activity outside</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That the manager cannot organise a manual evacuation as there are not enough staff (sorry I pay *how much*?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That the reason we have no light or air is because of these (alleged) passengers on the track &#8211; again, no one I was tweeting (and there were many), saw any passengers leave any train or on any track</li>
</ul>
<p>We were told the above in such authoritative and scary ways that we were all too frightened to ask if a door could be opened so we could breathe. By this point we have been stuck in your train for 4 hours and we have had no light or air for 2 &#8211; TWO HOURS&#8230; and FIVE HOURS in total on that damned carriage.</p>
<p>Incidentally, as the guard was telling us how Woking station was swarming with policemen waiting to arrest us, and that were it not for our fellow passengers escaping from these trains of hell we would all be home and dry. So a fellow passenger who was on the phone to a friend waiting at Woking station told us that there was no train movement in Woking, therefore we were not going anywhere anyway, and that the one van load of police who had turned up, left an hour beforehand and there was nothing other than concerned people waiting to collect people from the trains &#8211; friends and family, not your staff of course, they were not there.</p>
<p>We considered briefly calling the fire brigade &#8211; or Dominos &#8211; but Dunkirk spirit prevailed and we were all terribly English and sympathetic with the &#8220;poor&#8221; guard who was hogging his sandwiches and water and threatening us with the police &#8211; I have to say I was not so sympathetic, I thought he needed to go on a special course for awful people to use in emergencies.</p>
<p>At 22.59:45 we crept into Woking station, somehow the train staff had managed to make us all feel cowed and responsible for the whole debacle because some of our peers had allegedly broken out of a train &#8211; and quite frankly who could have blamed them &#8211; although I don&#8217;t believe it for a minute &#8211; I was there and I saw no one &#8211; nor any police or arrests &#8211; total blarney.</p>
<p>Therefore no one expressed any surprise, that after being trapped in your airless, oppressive, food and water free train (that we paid to go on) that you guys had not bothered, in the 5 hours we were all stranded on the tracks between Waterloo and Woking &#8211; to lay on some staff, food, drink, forms &#8211; when we piled out at 11pm, feeling a bit guilty for the trouble we had caused, in Woking, even though I and all my fellow passengers and fellow tweeters had done nothing more than swear at you a bit on twitter, no one had ACTUALLY left the train&#8230; no one and I don&#8217;t believe they ever did. But IF they did, who could  blame them quite frankly.</p>
<p>This authoritative and shouty voice that was relayed to us as &#8220;the SWT managers say you must not leave the train or we will arrest you and we have police patrolling the tracks&#8230;&#8221; etc which tried to keep us in our place, did not have the courage to meet us off these trains of hell and try to at least make sure we had a glass of water. NOT ONE of you bothered &#8211; and even the station staff had fled, just leaving the gates open &#8211; not ONE official was on Woking station, not one that I saw. Where was the help and apology?</p>
<p>So I suggest that you do the following:</p>
<p>1. Install emergency water and food on every carriage<br />
2. Have a phone on every carriage that in such emergencies people can use to call loved ones/get on the Internet<br />
3. Train your staff to explain always what is happening and why we have to stay in carriages<br />
4. Have a way to ensure that there is light and air in an emergency<br />
5. Ensure that if ever a train is stuck for longer than an hour, that there is a crack team to help at the first receiving station<br />
6. Have a manual signalling system to take over from faulty signals<br />
7. An arrangement with the local fire brigade to evacuate passengers held for longer than an hour in a safe way<br />
8. If indeed this was all caused by a cable theft bid that we are told this from the start, that you don&#8217;t run trains when there has been such a cable theft &#8211; although I am not totally believing this convenient story</p>
<p>One point I must make, is that the person or persons manning the twitter feed on @NRE_SWT was calm, informative, personal and not threatening. This was a job well done by those manning twitter and they should be commended. This was until my phone ran out after 3.5 hours on your train of hell.</p>
<p>*update* I am told by a fellow passenger, who is heavily pregnant, that she did get off the train but after she was told that the power was off on the track &#8211; whch would mean a decent amount of time after we had been trapped in the airless, light-free carriages &lt;- a convenient excuse for SWT to hold onto, in my opinion. What caused the panic amongst passengers that they would risk their lives and those of their unborn children? This is panic, not rationale, and cannot be blamed for what had happened beforehand</p>
