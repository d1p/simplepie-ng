<li>Nothing good happens after 2 am.</li>
<li>If you decided to stay at home and not go out on a weekend, stick to it.</li>
<li>A bottle of vodka is enough for a night. If it&#8217;s midnight and you&#8217;re out of alcohol a) you probably shouldn&#8217;t be offering other people the drink in the first place and b) you should go home.</li>
<li>Do take pictures, don&#8217;t let other people take pictures of you. If they do, make sure you get to keep the pictures.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t argue with anyone. Just shut up.</li>
<li>Hide your mobile in a place where you can&#8217;t find it when you badly want to talk or message someone. A place you can easily find it when there&#8217;s an emergency though.</li>
<li>Maybe it&#8217;s time to make that &#8220;I&#8217;m too old for this sh*t&#8221; list.</li>
<li>Pete Wentz is hotter in person than in TV.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s horrible when you came to see LMFAO and was already woozy when they went on stage.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t go with someone 1) you don&#8217;t really like 2) you don&#8217;t trust and 3) won&#8217;t make you stop doing anything which isn&#8217;t good, in other words, don&#8217;t go with someone you know isn&#8217;t a good friend.</li>
<li>If the IKEA instruction manual shows two guys assembling the furniture, don&#8217;t try to do it on your own.</li>

<br />
<p>It&#8217;s an obvious fact that I love <a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, most specially the <a title="Kindle" href="http://kennais.ms/?cat=179" target="_blank">Kindle</a>. The Kindle changed my life! If it weren&#8217;t for it, my room will probably be filled with books right now, I won&#8217;t have enough space to live in my apartment, plus it will be a big problem shipping all the books back to the Philippines or wherever I am moving to next.</p>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ve been convincing myself that I don&#8217;t need the new <a title="Kindle Fire" href="http://amzn.com/B0051VVOB2" target="_blank">Kindle Fire</a>, 90% of me thinks so. I&#8217;m thinking&#8230; I can give my Kindle Keyboard to someone else and get the <a title="Kindle Fire" href="http://amzn.com/B0051VVOB2" target="_blank">Kindle Fire</a>, yes I&#8217;m a horrible person! But since I&#8217;m on a really tight budget for now, and well until next year, I won&#8217;t buy it. So for those who&#8217;s thinking of getting a tablet, or an e-book reader, get the Fire. If you want an e-book reader, any of its Kindle siblings will do, <strong>not only will you not regret it, you will love it</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doesn&#8217;t matter if I bought mine for 139$ and now it&#8217;s only 99$.</span></p>
<br />
<p>You can view my <a title="Kenna on Kindle " href="https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Kenna/191377" target="_blank">Kindle profile</a> and <a title="Kenna's Wishlist" href="http://amzn.com/w/2Z9KHSJ60P3JL" target="_blank">wishlist (which now includes Fire)</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So done moving out of the old apartment and moving in to the new one. The new flat is furnished, in black and white as you can see, but I&#8217;ve been adding pieces of furnitures and stuff and I&#8217;m not yet done. The rest of the things I bought from IKEA will arrive tomorrow, what a way to spend your weekend, clean, fix and assemble furnitures by yourself, ah, the joy of living alone (I&#8217;m being half-sarcastic, if there&#8217;s such a thing).</p>
<br />
<p>The Instax photos and photos of my friends and places I&#8217;ve been to that I had printed are already up on the wall, I did it last night while doing laundry and trying to sleep. I noticed that I actually sleep better when I&#8217;m not alone, my friend was living with me for a couple of days, she moved out last night and although I&#8217;m happy to be living alone again, I had trouble sleeping.</p>
<br />
<p><a title="IMG_4038a by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197004351/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6016/6197004351_9df2ec0ef5_b.jpg" alt="IMG_4038a" width="450" height="299.7" /></a></p>
<br />
<p><a title="IMG_4036a by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197521398/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/6197521398_5d2b5efd23_b.jpg" alt="IMG_4036a" width="450" height="299.7" /></a></p>
<br />
<p>I had quite a number of reasons why I moved. One of which is to start with something new. It&#8217;s actually Step 2 in this plan I have which I expect to finish late next year. I&#8217;m still working on the succeeding steps though. Details of which I cannot really talk about.</p>
<br />
<p>The new place has an added bonus of being right next to the bus stop. My office is now a 7min., 2.6dirham bus ride, believe it or not, or a 3-4mins. cab ride! Not only is it convenient, it will also save me a lot of money. I used to spend 50dirham per day for my transportation, now it only cost me 5dirhams, do the math! Here&#8217;s to retiring at 30, cheers!</p>
<br />
<p>Have to add a divider, a lounge chair, a smaller table because I&#8217;m moving that big ass table near the bed and will serve as a workstation. I hope I don&#8217;t end up cutting myself or hitting my fingers anymore.</p>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197521160/" title="IMG_4040a by Kenn?, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/6197521160_5f40676450.jpg" width="450" height="299.7" alt="IMG_4040a"></a></p>
<p>Ha! I remember commenting about a friend&#8217;s bed lighting, told him they look like piñatas, and considering he&#8217;s always tired he could use hitting them, only to have a freaking light bulb hanging above the bed.</p>
<br />
<p>I also sold my TV to a friend, a pretty good deal for him I think haha! It&#8217;s a 40&#8243; inch LED and I sold it to him for only 2,000aed!!! I only use the TV to watch movies and shows I downloaded anyway, so I had to get rid of the TV since the new flat came with it. Which reminds me, I&#8217;m having a headache having my internet connection, connected. Thank you Etisalat for being so helpful and prompt (I&#8217;m being super sarcastic).</p>
<br />
<p>The place still looks unfinished but it already feels good to be living here.</p>
<br />
<p>I also got a new coffee press, my temporary flat-mate kind of broke my coffee press.</p>
<br />
<p><a title="Bodum Coffee Press by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197604450/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/6197604450_df447d6b49.jpg" alt="Bodum Coffee Press" width="450" height="299.7" /></a></p>
<br />
<p>IKEA&#8217;s 4aed hotdog meal. Since the unlimited drink at IKEA cost 3aed, it means the hotdog in a bun cost only a dirham!</p>
<br />
<p><a title="IKEA 4dirham hotdog meal by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197086771/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6197086771_9d53c6ccfd.jpg" alt="IKEA 4dirham hotdog meal" width="450" height="299.7" /></a></p>
<br />
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s almost winter now in my favorite desert, this was taken around 0700 in the morning two days ago, and yes, the area is filled with fog, which usually means, the weather will change really soon. And if it&#8217;s the time for the season to change from summer to winter it means&#8230; it&#8217;s time to party (but then again, it&#8217;s the same thing when it changes from winter to summer)</p>
<br />
<p><a title="Almost Winter by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197604570/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/6197604570_9e3b5c7017.jpg" alt="Almost Winter" width="450" height="299.7" /></a></p>
<br />
<p>Which reminds me&#8230; I went to Trader Vic&#8217;s for the first time about two weeks ago and got pretty smashed but had tons of fun, dancing-the-running-man-and-doing-all-kinds-of-funky-dance-moves-in-the-hallway-of-Crowne-Plaza-on-the-way-to-Zinc kind of fun.</p>
<br />
<p><a title="Coco Pink? by Kenn?, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennuh/6197604652/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6197604652_8196dd363b.jpg" alt="Coco Pink?" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<br />
<p>This, I believe is called Coco Pink, which taste pretty good, the rest of the drink I had that night were&#8230; well&#8230; tasted good but will definitely get you drunk easily.</p>
<p>So I guess all I really want to say is&#8230; everything has been good.</p>
<br />
<p>I leave you with one of my most favorite <a title="Armin van Buuren" href="http://www.arminvanbuuren.com/" target="_blank">Armin van Buuren</a>, <a title="DJ Mag Top100" href="http://www.djmag.com/top100" target="_blank">the no.1 DJ for the fourth consecutive year now</a>, track.</p>
<br />
<p>I think more than his talent, the reason why he stays in that spot is his charisma, his smile and love for music that is a delight to witness in person, hearing and watching him play is an awesome experience. He&#8217;s just amazing.</p>

<p>There was one incident, I was alone in the bathroom, I slipped and seriously thought I was going to die. I couldn&#8217;t speak and I was so scared, I wasn&#8217;t scared of dying, I was scared that no one will know I died, and that people will take about a week before finding my corpse. I eventually managed to get up on my feet after crying, figured I don&#8217;t want to die just yet, plus if I&#8217;ll die I&#8217;d rather have clothes on.</p>

<blockquote><p>And I don&#8217;t know who you are, or why you say the things you say, but you need to get out of me. Here, there&#8217;s only space for me.</p></blockquote>

</a></p>
<br />
<p>I have lots of friends back home and it sucks that most of my friends here have their family with them or aren&#8217;t into the things I enjoy a lot (generation gap?). I&#8217;ve learned how to be <a href="http://kennais.ms/?p=2535" title="Alone" target="_blank">alone</a>; I find it difficult to live with anyone and two I learned a whole lot of new stuff that I can do by myself. <strong>But it can still get lonely.</strong> And when it does, you forget about all the awesome things you&#8217;ve done by yourself. It&#8217;s not actually that I cannot live with anyone; I can live with someone I really really know like a really really good friend of mine or someone I&#8217;m comfortable with. The later being the most important one.</p>
<br />
<p>It is true, you can find me in the cinema watching a movie alone. You can even see me in a bar enjoying my pint of beer, alone. I like it. But I like being with people more.</p>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;m moving to my new apartment tomorrow and I&#8217;m really excited. I have a lot of projects lined up for it, will probably take me a month to finish them off, but it will be really nice *crossed fingers*. <strong>Sometimes people need fresh new sheets (new notebooks even) to write the next chapter of their lives. </strong> </p>
<br />
<blockquote><p>
It didn&#8217;t happen if you didn&#8217;t write it down.</p></blockquote>
<br />
<p>I need to write on my diary (offline) again. </p>
<br />
<p>You know how when something&#8217;s bound to happen but you&#8217;re unsure about it yet, you&#8217;d rather keep it to yourself, because telling people about it somehow can help not make it happen? It&#8217;s really hard to keep your mouth shut about something really good sometimes&#8230;.</p>
