<p>Apple won&#8217;t provide a public webcast of tomorrow&#8217;s &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk iPhone&#8221; media event, according to an Apple PR representative <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/03/apple-will-not-stream-tomorrows-iphone-event/" target="_blank">contacted by 9to5mac</a>. The company will make a private feed available for the European press in its Covent Garden retail store in London, but there won&#8217;t be a public live stream on Apple.com.</p>
<p>Apple streamed the September 2010 music event as well as &#8220;Back to the Mac&#8221; in <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-will-offer-live-streaming-of-back-to-the-mac-event/" target="_blank">October 2010</a>, but didn&#8217;t provide a live stream for the iPad 2 announcement and iOS 5 preview earlier this year. The 2010 live streams were based on Apple&#8217;s HTTP Live Streaming technology and required a Mac or iOS device running Safari.</p>
<p>However, Apple is expected to make streaming and downloadable versions of the event available a few hours after the keynote. Apple has <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank">a dedicated webpage</a> for media events, and Apple Keynotes can also be found on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.</p>
<p><em>MacStories will offer real-time tweeting of updates tomorrow through the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MacStoriesLive" target="_blank">@MacStoriesLive</a> Twitter account. Come back at 10 AM Pacific tomorrow for our complete coverage of Apple announcements on the site&#8217;s front page.</em></p>

<p>With a series of press releases <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/news/?ndmViewId=headline_list&amp;ndmHsc=infDays&amp;customerNumber=1168613" target="_blank">issued</a> today, Adobe has announced new software initiatives and acquisitions, including <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111003006347/en/Adobe-Announces-Agreement-Acquire-Nitobi-Creator-PhoneGap" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a> and <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111003006357/en/Adobe-Acquires-Web-Typography-Innovator-Typekit" target="_blank">Typekit</a>. In a separate announcement, the company has formally unveiled six new Touch Apps for tablets that will be available for Android devices this November, and on the iPad next year. An iPad announcement about the release date is expected in &#8220;early 2012&#8243;, but Adobe has already confirmed this new suite of apps will work with <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111003006439/en/Adobe-Unveils-Creative-Cloud" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a>, the company&#8217;s new web hub to &#8221; access desktop and tablet applications, find essential creative services&#8221; and share works online. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a> will come with 20 GB of storage and allow users to view, sync and share files created with desktop Creative Suite and mobile Touch Apps.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by Adobe Creative Suite software, these stunning new apps bring professional-level creativity to millions of tablet users. The apps address multiple areas of the creative process: image editing; ideation; sketching; mood boards; website and mobile app prototyping; and presenting finished work. They are headlined by Adobe Photoshop® Touch, a groundbreaking app that brings the legendary creative and image-editing power of Photoshop to tablet devices for the first time.</p>
<p>Available soon as standalone apps, Adobe Touch Apps are essential components of Adobe Creative Cloud, a major new company initiative also announced today (see separate release). Adobe Creative Cloud will become a worldwide hub for creativity, where millions can access desktop and tablet applications, find essential creative services, and share their best work. Files created via Adobe Touch Apps can be shared, viewed across devices or transferred into Adobe Creative Suite software for further refinement – key features of Adobe’s vision for the Creative Cloud. With stylus capabilities expected to become a key feature on some next generation tablets, Adobe Touch Apps are designed to work with both finger and stylus input.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26498" title="1" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1.png" alt="" width="600" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>According to a series of code strings found in the latest iTunes beta by <a href="http://thetecherra.com/2011/10/01/apple-to-allow-ios-app-rentals-soon/" target="_blank">The Tech Erra</a> (via <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/03/app-rentals-arriving/" target="_blank">9to5mac</a>), Apple may soon introduce support for app rentals &#8212; allowing users to rent an app for a limited time, test it and, eventually, buy it at full price. A string in particular seems to suggest app rentals may soon be available:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps are automatically removed from your iTunes library at the end of the rental period.</p></blockquote>
<p>The mention of an &#8220;iTunes library&#8221; also seems to suggest that this functionality may be related to iOS apps, which are stored in iTunes on desktop computers. The lack of trials/demos for iPhone and iPad apps has always been a popular argument against Apple&#8217;s App Store ecosystem, especially considering recent competitors like Microsoft have introduced support for trials in the Windows Phone 7 marketplace. Rentals would obviously be different from <em>free trials</em>, but they&#8217;d allow users to better consider a purchase before clicking the Buy button; it&#8217;s not clear if &#8220;app rentals&#8221; would simply be time-based, or also allow developers to exclude certain functionalities from the rental version. The use of <em>&#8220;Do you want to start playing the app&#8230;&#8221;</em> in the code reference is interesting, too.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s iCloud will allow users to instantly push new app purchases across devices, but the company has been unwilling to tackle the App Store demo/rental idea so far. If these strings are of any indication, there&#8217;s the possibility Apple will announce new app rental features at its media event tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-27-at-5.08.23-PM.png" alt="" width="529" height="486" /></p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, Apple will hold a press conference in Cupertino, where CEO Tim Cook is widely expected to introduce the next-generation iPhone, a new iOS 5 feature called &#8220;Assistant&#8221;, and a refreshed line-up for Apple&#8217;s iPod family. However, speculation has been running wild in the past months as to whether Apple will announce not one, but two different iPhone models, or perhaps even an iPhone 4 revision to target the low-end market. With rumors of upcoming Facebook integration, voice-recognition features and cheaper iPhone 4 models, Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk iPhone&#8221; may turn out to be bigger than expected. Or, as the name of the event suggests, perhaps the company will only focus on the iPhone, leaving other announcements for press releases and minor store updates in the next weeks.</p>
<p>In this post, we&#8217;ve rounded up the most recent October 4th rumors and predictions, some old rumors that haven&#8217;t been reported in a while, as well as last-minute speculation on what Apple will introduce tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Come back tomorrow at 10 AM Pacific on MacStories for our coverage of Apple announcements.</em></p>
<p><strong>iPhone 4S</strong>: This is the device that Apple is rumored to unveil as the &#8220;next-generation iPhone&#8221; tomorrow. Initially <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/04/21/apple-floats-iphone-4s-with-a5-chip-to-select-developers-to-prepare-for-next-gen-iphone-2/" target="_blank">described</a> as an &#8220;iPhone 5 inside an iPhone 4 case&#8221; for developers&#8217; testing back in April, the iPhone 4S with codename N94 should pack an A5 processor, 1 GB of RAM, SGX 543MP2 GPU (same as iPad 2), GSM-CDMA dual mode, HSPA+, same 3.5-inch screen and design of the existing iPhone 4. The device will come with a new software featured called <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-5-to-include-new-ios-5-assistant-voice-feature/" target="_blank">Assistant</a> for voice-recognition, and possibly a new panoramic photo functionality, likely related to the (rumored) new 8 MP camera. The iPhone 4S name has been spotted on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-4s-name-shown-on-otterbox-case-packaging/" target="_blank">packaging</a> for third-party cases, carrier <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/03/iphone-4s-16gb-32gb-64gb-listings-at-vodafone-germany/" target="_blank">websites</a> and even Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-4s-name-found-in-latest-itunes-beta/" target="_blank">iTunes 10.5 beta</a>. In the past months, several leaked <a href="http://www.macpost.net/977/iphone-5-evt-prototype-n94-back-cover-audio-and-volume-parts-leaked/" target="_blank">parts</a> and components have suggested the 4S will share the same design of the iPhone 4, only with largely improved specs.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone 5</strong>: The confusion caused by the &#8220;iPhone 5&#8243; name is due to the fact that it&#8217;s been widely used to generally indicate the new iPhone (iPhone 5 comes after iPhone 4) as well as a &#8220;completely redesigned&#8221; device, as opposed to the iPhone 4S. In fact, several analysts and industry sources believe Apple will announce two new iPhones tomorrow, a 4S for the low-end, and a &#8220;real&#8221; iPhone 5 as top-line device. The iPhone 5 was <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-5-to-feature-3-7-inch-screen-larger-home-button-thinner-design/" target="_blank">rumored</a> to feature a new design months ago, although over time some of its alleged specs have overlapped with the iPhone 4S (improved camera, A5 CPU, 8 MP camera). The distinctive rumor about the iPhone 5 is a new &#8220;teardrop&#8221; design with tapered edges and thinner form factor, possibly a bigger screen with edge-to-edge LCD and a new &#8220;elongated&#8221; Home button.</p>
<p>No parts or internal components of the iPhone 5 have been leaked, suggesting such device hasn&#8217;t entered production yet and won&#8217;t be announced tomorrow.</p>

<p>Andy Ihnatko and Jason Snell have published two articles on Macworld over the weekend, covering the upcoming <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162504/2011/10/app_sandboxing_risks_eroding_the_macs_identity.html" target="_blank">sandboxing restrictions</a> that Apple will begin enforcing this November for Mac App Store apps (with its possible implications for Apple&#8217;s own technologies like AppleScript) and the broader subject of <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162503/2011/10/the_app_culture.html" target="_blank">app culture</a>, which in a way is related to sandboxing and might lead to an overly simplified software environment that <a href="http://www.macstories.net/links/mac-app-store-and-micro-apps/" target="_blank">some</a> people imagined <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/a-tale-of-two-mac-app-stores/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162504/2011/10/app_sandboxing_risks_eroding_the_macs_identity.html" target="_blank">Ihnatko</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I fret about AppleScript. I’ve come to think of it as a brilliant and infinitely-resourceful friend who’s been working for twenty years at a company that doesn’t seem to appreciate all of his or her contributions. I’m not worried about Apple killing AppleScript outright; I’m worried that the company doesn’t collectively feel like system automation is a feature that’s worth rescuing if the building ever caught on fire. Some day, Apple’s OS engineers will come up with an idea for a new system architecture that delivers a long list of benefits but which will require tons of work to prevent it from breaking AppleScript. And at that point, scripting on the Mac will finally die.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162503/2011/10/the_app_culture.html" target="_blank">Snell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple getting serious about app security is a good thing. Unfortunately, many of the apps we Mac users have come to know and love over the years require a broad amount of access to the system for a lot of their key functions. Not as much as SuperDuper, say, but still quite a lot. What I’m hearing from some Mac developers is that they may actually have to remove features from their apps, or reduce their functionality, in order to fit them inside Apple’s new sandbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst after the Back to the Mac event in October 2010 we feared the Mac App Store&#8217;s lack of trials and license migration options for existing customers would kill the ecosystem and, ultimately, cause the Mac App Store to never take off, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. Apple is betting heavily on the Mac App Store as the future of digital distribution for desktop software, and it&#8217;s doing so by releasing Lion on the App Store, alongside several other apps (at a discounted price). Since January 6, when the Mac App Store opened for business, third-party developers have rushed to release their apps on it (most of the times with discounted prices) and <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/the-best-of-the-best-apple-design-awards-2011/" target="_blank">Apple awarded those who did</a> in time at last June&#8217;s WWDC. Some developers needed, obviously, to <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/1password-now-on-the-mac-app-store-50-off-menubar-icon-lion-only/" target="_blank">rethink how their apps would work</a> with Apple&#8217;s Mac App Store rules.</p>
<p>The issue mentioned by Ihnatko and Snell isn&#8217;t a logistic problem with the infrastructure itself, it&#8217;s a real technical question that has arisen lately. How much will sandboxing entitlements affect the functionalities of existing apps? An example is the aforementioned 1Password, whose Mac App Store version won&#8217;t allow you to keep its database sync file in Dropbox if that folder is not under your User&#8217;s directory. The change wasn&#8217;t well received, but that&#8217;s just the way it works now. Starting November, it&#8217;s safe to assume other apps will need to be updated with this kind of tweaks &#8212; a restriction <em>here</em>, some documents can&#8217;t be accessed <em>there</em>, and so forth.</p>
<p>You can see how sandboxing, security and app culture are related in Apple&#8217;s App Store vision. The concept of &#8220;app&#8221; has evolved over time to indicate a piece of software that does one thing well, and Apple is doubling down on this new idea by enhancing security (which is a good thing) and making sure an app is limited &#8220;to just those operations that it needs to perform&#8221;. App and security have come full circle.</p>
<p>In the past nine months, the Mac App Store did just fine for the majority of developers without trials and demo versions. Then Apple introduced in-app purchases and delta updates. Every major change creates victims &#8212; those who couldn&#8217;t settle down in a new environment &#8212; and winners, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/" target="_blank">literally</a>. What will be interesting to observe in the upcoming months isn&#8217;t sandboxing itself of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=apple%20is%20evil" target="_blank">evilness</a>, but the trade-off third-party developers will seemingly have to come to terms with if they want to keep their apps on the Store., with the same degree of power and innovation we&#8217;ve become accustomed to in the past decades.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/bbedit-header.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26460" title="bbedit header" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/bbedit-header.png" alt="" width="600" height="319" /></a></p>
<p>I was recently listening to an episode of the popular podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/39">Build and Analyze</a> where <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment">Marco Arment</a> was discussing his experience of leaving the comfort of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> to test drive <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> for a week. The results of his experiment were similar to many others who have attempted the same feat and after that week, according to Marco, he had returned to TextMate. I once did the same experiment. A dedicated TextMate user who switched to BBEdit for no other reason than the lack of updates and BBEdit happened to be in the Mac App Store at a greatly reduced price. I jumped on the opportunity to try the legendary text editor with its newly added fullscreen, auto-save, and resume features.</p>
<p>The humorous part of listening to Marco describe his time with BBEdit was knowing that we shared identical opinions on all of the quirks that differentiate TextMate and BBEdit. I don’t think one is any better than the other, I just think they solve the same problem with two different methods. What features BBEdit lacks, it generally makes up for in scripting ability. It has one of the most detailed and feature-rich AppleScript dictionary I have ever seen. So as I came across quirks that I could change with AppleScript, I wrote a script for them and that is what I would like to share in this mini-series of posts. Please note these articles are intended for people that are familiar enough with BBEdit to be able to add a new script and assign a keyboard shortcut in the preferences.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Text</h2>
<p>The first thing that drove me absolutely crazy with BBEdit is when hitting the quotes or parentheses key while text is selected, BBEdit doesn’t wrap the text in that punctuation but instead writes over the selection.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue I wrote six AppleScripts (one for each commonly wrapped punctuation) and I assigned each one a keyboard shortcut. In this situation I think the keyboard shortcut is just as important as the script itself. It has to be easy to remember and close to the position your hand is already in when typing the punctuation key. So in five of the six shortcuts I simply added the command key and it felt as natural as typing the punctuation normally. For the single quotes script I settled with the Option + Command combo because it is on the same key as the double quotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap in Asterisks: <strong>⇧ + ⌘ + *</strong></li>
<li>Wrap in Backticks: <strong>⇧ + ⌘ + `</strong></li>
<li>Wrap in Brackets: <strong>⇧ + ⌘ + ]</strong></li>
<li>Wrap in Parentheses: <strong>⇧ + ⌘ + )</strong></li>
<li>Wrap in Quotes: <strong>⇧ + ⌘ + &#8220;</strong></li>
<li>Wrap in Single Quotes: <strong>⌥ + ⌘ + ’</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All six scripts are variations of the same code shown below:</p>
<p><script src="http://snipt.net/embed/bc387a6da2ca3cf07d4dcc1e1daba034" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<p>Download these scripts here: <a href="http://cl.ly/AaRC">Wrap Text scripts</a></p>
<p><em>Save these scripts to the directory: ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts</em></p>
<h2>Commenting Entire Line</h2>
<p>The second feature of BBEdit that bugged me was the way commenting was implemented. Most of the time when I hit the “Comment” keyboard shortcut I actually wanted to comment out the entire line; instead, BBEdit starts the comment wherever the cursor is located. I wrote a script that reads the documents <em>source language</em> and comments out the entire current line using the correct syntax for that language.</p>
<p>For the keyboard shortcut I actually changed BBEdit’s default <em>Un/Comment Selection</em> to <strong>⌥ + ⌘ + /</strong> so that I could configure my script with the default combination I was already used to: <strong>⌘ + /</strong></p>
<p>The script is configured to work with but is not limited to these languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unix Shell Script</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>ANSI C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t see the language you want it is very easy to add your own – just open the script and take a look at the code.</p>
<p>Download the script here: <a href="http://cl.ly/AbQT">Comment Entire Line</a></p>
<p><em>Save these scripts to the directory: ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts</em></p>
<p><strong>*Stay tuned for more posts on ways to really get the most out of BBEdit!</strong></p>

Shown on a quality control form, these iPhone parts are for a model N90A iPhone &#8211; a new model that does not currently exists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our Brazilian brothers, Gizmodo.com.br, got their hot little hands on a few photos of one a new iPhone, to be announced next week. How? Well, there’s a Foxconn factory in Brazil, and Pedro &amp; co got one of their men inside. Inside, they found a new-SKU iPhone that looks just like the old iPhone 4.</p></blockquote>
<p>A report from earlier this week noted that an iPhone with the codename N90A had <a title="MacStories: Rumor: New iPhone And iPod Touch Models Appear In Apple’s Inventory" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/rumor-new-iphone-and-ipod-touch-models-appear-in-apples-inventory/" target="_blank">appeared in Apple&#8217;s internal inventory system</a>. Because the current codename for the iPhone 4 is N90 it is believed that this new SKU would represent an iPhone 4 with minor changes — likely becoming the cheaper iPhone available with 8 GB of storage at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Apple has apparently included the &#8220;iPhone 4S&#8221; name in a file inside the <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-releases-itunes-10-5-beta-9/" target="_blank">latest</a> iTunes beta seeded on Friday, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/01/iphone-4s-with-iphone-4-design-dual-mode-capability-leaked-by-itunes" target="_blank">9to5mac reports</a>. As shown in the screenshot above, two strings report &#8220;iPhone 4S&#8221; in the description, with a link to the same image used by iTunes for the older CDMA iPhone 4. Whilst the iPhone 4 had separate references for colors (black/white) and carrier variations (GSM/CDMA), the &#8220;4S&#8221; name in iTunes 10.5 beta 9 is only differentiated by color.</p>
<p>Speculation surrounding the next-generation iPhone initially described the &#8220;iPhone 4S&#8221; as the lower end model with improved specs over the iPhone 4, although recent rumors have suggested the &#8220;iPhone 5&#8243; may end up being the 4S itself, thus contradicting reports of two different models, one being &#8220;completely redesigned&#8221;.</p>
<p>The iPhone 4S name recently <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-4s-name-shown-on-otterbox-case-packaging/" target="_blank">appeared</a> on packaging for third-party cases and it also supposedly hit Apple&#8217;s internal inventory system with the codename N94. The CDMA image associated to the 4S in the iTunes beta may be a placeholder, but the 4S was previously rumored to have dual CDMA-GSM capabilities.</p>
<p>Apple will hold a keynote in Cupertino on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-confirms-media-event-on-october-4th/" target="_blank">October 4th</a>, where it&#8217;s widely expected to unveil the next-generation iPhone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/aa2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26443" title="Facebook" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/aa2.png" alt="" width="580" height="188" /></a>It’s been known that Apple and Facebook have had a strenuous relationship over the past year and a half or so &#8211; with the <a title="VR-Zone: Facebook Pulls The Plug on Apple's Ping" href="http://vr-zone.com/articles/facebook-pulls-the-plug-on-apple-s-ping/9768.html">debacle of iTunes Ping</a> being the key event known to the public over which the companies clashed. <a title="Mashable: How Apple and Facebook Nearly Fell Out — Over the HP TouchPad [EXCLUSIVE]" href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/apple-facebook-hp">Mashable</a> has a nice scoop today that delves deeper into the rift between the two companies and how things seemed to have taken a positive turn in recent months.</p>
<p>According to Mashable’s sources, Apple approached Facebook over fully <a title="MacStories: Vietnamese Videos Show Old iOS 4 Build With Several Unreleased Features" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/vietnamese-videos-show-old-ios-4-build-with-several-unreleased-features/" target="_blank">integrating Facebook into iOS 4</a> as well as making their own Facebook app — apparently “lacking confidence in Facebook’s ability to build a great application”. Disagreements arose and negotiations broke down, Apple canned most of the Facebook integration, except Ping which they didn’t fully inform Facebook of — this then led to Facebook banning Apple from the APIs soon after it launched.</p>
<p>Three months ago Steve Jobs supposedly visited Facebook to talk with Mark Zuckerberg about a Facebook iPad app. Jobs learnt that Facebook was working with HP to release a native webOS app and according to Mashable’s sources, Jobs was furious about it. Zuckerberg tried to appease Jobs by pulling the app, but Jon Rubenstien of HP’s webOS division refused. Nonetheless the app wasn’t perfect when released and was restricted because Facebook pulled certain APIs, just as it had done with Ping in the previous year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Was Facebook playing both sides? Absolutely, says a source close to HP. Facebook was made aware of the application and device integrations. The company knew what was coming, changed its tune right before release — and only did so to appease Apple. For its part, HP was furious. It had hoped the Facebook application would help differentiate the TouchPad from other tablets on the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then it appears Facebook and Apple have mended their relationship. As reported earlier this week from MG Siegler of TechCrunch, Apple and Facebook have been working together on a Facebook iPad app and on an HTML5 web app platform (Project Spartan) and could well be <a title="MacStories: Facebook’s iPad App And Project Spartan Likely To Launch Next Week, Possibly At Apple’s Event" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/facebooks-ipad-app-and-project-spartan-likely-to-launch-next-week-possibly-at-apples-event/" target="_blank">sharing the stage at Tuesday’s iPhone event</a> to launch the products. Just as Siegler mentioned, Mashable notes that this collaboration seems to stem from the fact that they both share a common enemy: Google.</p>
<p>Be sure to jump over to <a title="Mashable: How Apple and Facebook Nearly Fell Out — Over the HP TouchPad [EXCLUSIVE]" href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/30/apple-facebook-hp" target="_blank">Mashable and read their full article</a>, they mention other interesting snippets of information and do a great job of putting together the juicy jigsaw puzzle that is the Facebook and Apple relationship.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DMHeader.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26439" title="DMHeader" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DMHeader.png" alt="" width="436" height="194" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://debtminderapp.com/">DebtMinder</a> is the latest creation from the talented developers over at <a href="http://return7.com/">Return7</a> and aims to help users eliminate their debt. You might already be familiar with their successful BillMinder app that helps users keep track of when bills are due to ensure that late fees are a thing of the past. BillMinder is known for being polished, reliable, and incredibly easy to keep multiple devices in sync. Thankfully the developers were able to bring those features and more to DebtMinder all wrapped up in a familiar interface.</p>
<p>DebtMinder allows you to input multiple accounts of debt into the app and it will help calculate the best payment plan to reduce your debt as quickly as possible. You can also customize this plan by telling DebtMinder that you either want to focus on debt that has the highest interest rate or debt with the lowest balance. This is known as the debt-snowball method. You basically pay off the smallest debt first while paying the minimum payment on the larger debt. It is the quickest way to decrease your total number of bills. Once a payment plan is created your monthly minimum payment is calculated and you can begin paying off you bills.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/paymentplan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26437" title="paymentplan" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/paymentplan.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>If you are a user of BillMinder then you will be able to pick up DebtMinder and feel as if you already know how to use the app. I was able to log in with my BillMinder credentials (new users will have to set up an account). As I added accounts to DebtMinder I had the option to link them with accounts that I had already set up in BillMinder. It was hard to appreciate this at first because it was so easy to set up, only two clicks. Once the account was linked and I added a payment to DebtMinder, I was able to launch BillMinder and see that the bill had already been paid. And not just on my phone, but on my iPad and on my wife’s phone as well because all devices are kept in sync under one account.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/linkwithbm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26438" title="linkwithbm" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/linkwithbm.png" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>DebtMinder is my favorite kind of app for iOS because it is inexpensive, useful, and easy on the eyes. It will more than pay for itself when your credit card gets paid off ahead of schedule and unnecessary interest fees are avoided.</p>
<p>BillMinder is available in the iTunes App Store today for only <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdebtminder%252Fid464300742%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">$1.99</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-01-at-12.25.22-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26441" title="Screen Shot 2011-10-01 at 12.25.22 AM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-01-at-12.25.22-AM.png" alt="" width="600" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20114115-261/apple-seeks-worldwide-icloud-music-rights/" target="_blank">a report by Greg Sandoval at CNET</a>, Apple may announce international support for its iCloud music service at the media event scheduled for next week. Apple is said to be in negotiations with record companies and music publishers to gain worldwide music rights for iCloud, although CNET reports nothing has been signed yet, but if negotiations wrap up in time there could be an announcement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Whilst CNET mentions &#8220;access to iCloud&#8221;, iCloud music rights most likely refer to the specific iTunes Match service; however, another music-related feature of iCloud &#8212; iTunes in the Cloud &#8212; is also being tested in the US-only at the moment, as it can be seen on Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/features/" target="_blank">international iCloud pages</a>. It&#8217;s not clear whether CNET is referring to iTunes Match, iTunes in the Cloud, or both &#8212; thus bringing full iCloud access for music worldwide.</p>
<blockquote><p>Managers at iTunes are trying to lock down worldwide cloud-music rights, CNET has learned.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Some of the countries that could receive access to iCloud include Germany, France and the United Kingdom, the sources said.</p></blockquote>
<p>iTunes Match, originally previewed at the WWDC in June, is set to publicly launch this Fall in the United States. Apple hasn&#8217;t detailed a public plan for an international rollout of the service, which is currently in beta and requires a US iTunes account with credit card on file. The service costs $24.99 per year for 25,000 songs, but iTunes purchases won&#8217;t count against this limit. iTunes Match was previously rumored to be <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/uk-wont-get-itunes-match-cloud-until-2012/" target="_blank">coming to the UK in 2012</a>, however CNET has a solid track record in reporting <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-inks-deal-with-emi-cloud-music-almost-finalized/" target="_blank">Apple&#8217;s negotiations</a> with the music labels and publishers, correctly predicting ahead of WWDC that Apple would announce a new cloud-based music service.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gradient.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26431" title="Gradient" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gradient.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="271" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gradientapp.com/" target="_blank">Gradient</a>, made by <a href="http://jumpzero.com/" target="_blank">JUMPZERO</a>, is a simple yet powerful Mac OS X app that lets you easily create CSS gradients by getting rid of the clumsiness of vendor prefixes. The user interface is beautiful and works wonderfully. Gradient is in open beta for any designer that wants to help test the app out or see what Gradient will be able to do.  In Gradient, you can pick/select/input the colors and then define which type of gradient you&#8217;re looking for; click the Copy button near the bottom of the application window and paste the generated code into your favorite editor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GradientTips.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26432" title="Gradient Tips" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GradientTips.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="645" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gradientapp.com/" target="_blank">Gradient</a> is customizeable as to which browser needs support by opening the preference pane and activating the radio buttons for the browsers you are going to support. No need for Internet Explorer? Simply uncheck the button. Gradient not only supports linear gradients but radial as well, just move the slider over to the type you need. The gradients&#8217; directions can be altered by the directional arrows for linear and by using the radial-center-matrix-button for radial gradients. Before you decide to copy the CSS, you can preview the code in-app by clicking the CSS button. A hovering code box pops up and displays your code all within Gradient.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GradientTips2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26434" title="Gradient Tips 2" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GradientTips2.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="161" /></a></p>
<p>Gradient lives in your dock, menubar, or whatever mix you want. You can click the menu bar icon to activate the app and get to work. You can also click either of the two large top colors to bring up the OS X built-in color selector or click the magnifying glass icon to bring up the zoom tool to use on every pixel of your Mac&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>Gradient feels very polished for only being in beta 2, and it looks like this will be a great tool for web designers looking for a simple yet intuitive way to create CSS gradients. Gradient&#8217;s development roadmap consists of adding HSL input &amp; output, SASS syntax and multiple step gradients. No details on the app&#8217;s release date have been provided, but it should be soon according to the <a href="http://www.gradientapp.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, it was reported the final version of iOS 5 for the next-generation iPhone <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/iphone-5-to-include-new-ios-5-assistant-voice-feature/" target="_blank">would include a new functionality</a> called &#8220;Assistant&#8221;. Based on the acquisition of Siri in 2010 and allegedly using some of Nuance&#8217;s voice recognition technologies, Assistant is said to be the next iPhone&#8217;s biggest new software feature, which will allow users to &#8220;speak&#8221; to their device to complete a variety of tasks such as sending text messages, creating calendar events and reminders, or get information on a specific topic only with their voice. Assistant will apparently put the next iPhone&#8217;s A5 CPU and 1 GB of RAM to use, providing an effortless experience to execute voice commands with a natural language.</p>
<p>Based on this week&#8217;s report and details from &#8220;sources with knowledge of the feature&#8221;, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/30/a-look-at-apples-assistant-interface-for-the-new-iphone/" target="_blank">MacRumors has mocked up Assistant&#8217;s activation screen</a> and asked Jan-Michael Cart (author of several <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/another-ios-5-concept-lion-like-dashboard/" target="_blank">iOS 5</a> and OS X <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/os-x-lion-concept-imessage-app/" target="_blank">concept</a> videos) to create a quick demo showing what Assistant should look like.</p>
<blockquote><p>After a long press on the home button, the screen fades and slides up, just like with the multitasking interface. Revealed is a silver icon with an animated orbiting purple flare which indicates a ready state. From what we&#8217;ve been told, this image is a close representation of the actual Assistant interface.</p>
<p>From there, the user may be taken to a conversation view that somewhat mimics Siri&#8217;s original interface, but in Apple&#8217;s own styling.</p></blockquote>
<p>You may remember MacRumors also <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/macrumors-mocks-up-the-iphone-5-based-on-design-specifications/" target="_blank">commissioned</a> a mockup of the iPhone 5 design in what has become an unofficial representation of the rumored &#8220;completely redesigned&#8221; device. The Assistant mockup posted today shows an equal attention to detail, and undoubtedly resembles something Apple could do with the multitasking tray, linen background, and styled buttons. Obviously, Apple&#8217;s official design will be different, but you can get the basic idea of this feature by looking at the video below.</p>
<p>Voice commands aren&#8217;t new to smartphones, but looking at the video and trying to imagine what would Apple do with reliable voice recognition tech, I assume Assistant could still feel &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; in some way, especially if Apple has really managed to build a &#8220;conversation view&#8221; that would let you give detailed instructions to your phone. Imagine being able to create quick reminders when you don&#8217;t have time to type (for example, while you&#8217;re driving) or dictate long emails and text messages directly to your iPhone, which would transcribe everything for you. Assistant is still a rumor, but an exciting one to think about.</p>
<p>Apple will hold a press conference in Cupertino on Tuesday, October 4th, where it&#8217;s widely expected to unveil the new iPhone.<br />

<p>Apple has released a new beta of iTunes 10.5 to developers this afternoon, re-enabling some iTunes Match functionalities that have gone missing after the iCloud music library reset that several developers reported on Apple&#8217;s Dev Forums this week. iTunes 10.5 beta 9, available now, contains bug fixes and improvements over iTunes 10.5 beta 8, which was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/macstoriesnet/status/112242487011196929" target="_blank">seeded</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>iTunes 10.5 is required to sync devices running iOS 5, and it brings a number of optimizations and improvements to iTunes&#8217; code, which now runs natively at 64-bit on Lion. The first beta of iTunes 10.5 that implemented support for iTunes Match &#8212; Apple&#8217;s upcoming backup and scan &amp; match service for music in the cloud &#8212; was <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-releases-new-itunes-beta-with-itunes-match/" target="_blank">seeded</a> in late August.</p>
<p>iTunes Match will launch this Fall alongside iCloud, and it will be compatible with OS X and iOS 5 devices.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/111.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26423" title="1" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/111.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="389" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/30/apple_removes_ipod_classic_click_wheel_games_from_itunes_store.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">As noted by AppleInsider</a>, Apple has removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_game" target="_blank">iPod click wheel games</a> from the iTunes Store, pulling a link to the category from the App Store&#8217;s dropdown menu inside iTunes, and also removing listings for those games that users could play on a click wheel-based iPod. It&#8217;s not clear when Apple made the change exactly, but it appears to be recent. Apple updates the App Store&#8217;s homepage every week with new features, banners and links to special sections, and the removal of iPod Click Wheel Games (which had their very own category) might have been part of a weekly refresh. There were around 50 games for click wheel iPods in the iTunes Store, including classics like Vortex and Klondike, or other titles like Song Summoner by Square Enix.</p>
<p>Click wheel games were compatible with the iPod classic, as well as older versions of the iPod, iPod nano and iPod mini. They allowed users to control games using an iPod&#8217;s touch-sensitive click wheel, and they&#8217;re still mentioned on Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/features.html" target="_blank">iPod classic Features page</a>. Development of click wheel games never really took off with third-party developers, as Apple didn&#8217;t make a software development kit publicly available.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1460" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> for iPod Click Wheel Games has been marked as &#8220;archived&#8221; and &#8220;old article&#8221; by Apple on September 21, 2011. The article still reports click wheel games are available in the iTunes Store, but old <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGame?id=284555436&amp;s=143441" target="_blank">direct links</a> for such games aren&#8217;t working anymore, and games no longer appear in iTunes&#8217; search results.</p>
<p>The removal of click wheel games comes amidst rumors of the discontinuation of the <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-could-be-about-to-discontinue-the-ipod-shuffle-and-touch/" target="_blank">classic and shuffle iPod lines</a>, quite possibly with a formal announcement as early as next week at Apple&#8217;s October 4th keynote. The iPod classic was rumored to be nearing discontinuation <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/ipod-classic-stock-running-low-refresh-imminent/" target="_blank">before</a>, as Apple didn&#8217;t announce a refresh at last year&#8217;s music event in a clear focus on iOS devices (and the updated iPod nano). Apple&#8217;s Steve Jobs allegedly <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/steve-jobs-we-have-no-plans-to-kill-the-ipod-classic/" target="_blank">confirmed in an email to a customer</a> that they had no intention to cease production of the iPod classic, which remains the only iPod to offer high capacity with 160 GB of storage. Speculation surrounding the iPod suggests Apple would axe the Classic to make room for a new 128 GB iPod touch, although this year&#8217;s iPod touch refresh is believed to be a minor one and there have been no signs of a 128 GB iPod touch in the past months. A 64 GB iPhone prototype <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/supposed-prototype-64gb-iphone-demoed-on-video/" target="_blank">surfaced</a> earlier this year, if this can be an indication of Apple looking to bump the storage sizes of its iOS devices.</p>
<p>In 2010, the iPod classic was the <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/death-or-refresh-the-ipod-classic-was-the-5th-most-popular-player-in-2010/" target="_blank">5th most popular MP3 player</a> in the United States.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-2.40.33-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26417" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-30 at 2.40.33 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-2.40.33-PM.png" alt="" width="600" height="362" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://clicktoflash.com/" target="_blank">ClickToFlash</a>, the popular plugin to block Adobe Flash content in Safari and make videos play in higher quality through HTML5, had to go through a series of changes after Apple released Safari 5.1, which dropped support for WebKit Plugins. Those of you who use ClickToFlash on a daily basis may have noticed that ClickToFlash for Safari 5.1 recently got a new home, and it&#8217;s been developed by Marc Hoyois as <a href="http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/" target="_blank">a Safari extension called ClickToPlugin</a>.</p>
<p>Marc Hoyois actually offers both ClickToPlugin and ClickToFlash rewritten as a Safari extension &#8212; the former is simply a broader version of ClickToFlash that doesn&#8217;t stop at Flash content, but prevents Safari from launching a variety of plugins, including Facebook Video Calling and Java. The same functionality of ClickToFlash is still there, only it&#8217;s been split in two versions depending on what you need (if you only want to block Flash, get the new ClickToFlash extension) with a new settings page. As usual, the extension replaces content with a placeholder that doesn&#8217;t load automatically and, when possible, allows for a direct plugin-to-HTML5 conversion that, in the case of YouTube, will allow you to load a video&#8217;s source in higher quality. ClickToFlash/ClickToPlugin comes with several preferences to tweak and support for many video websites &#8212; you should check out the <a href="http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/" target="_blank">complete list of features and screenshots</a> of the settings at the developer&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>An update released earlier this week for the ClickToPlugin/ClickToFlash extensions adds a feature Mac users have been requesting since the introduction of iOS 4.2 last year &#8212; AirPlay support in Safari for Mac. While AirPlay had been enabled first in Apple&#8217;s iOS apps, then the Mobile Safari browser and third-party apps, Mac users were only given AirPlay support for audio in iTunes, but nothing related to video streaming on OS X. A <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/stream-media-back-to-your-mac-with-banana-tv/" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/erica-sadun-releases-airflick-for-os-x-airplay-just-about-anything/" target="_blank">hacks</a> and <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/airserver-2-2-airplay-on-os-x-already-working-with-lion-and-ios-5/" target="_blank">utilities</a> surfaced to send Mac video to an Apple TV or AirPlay <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/airserver-now-available-on-ios-turns-devices-into-airplay-receivers/" target="_blank">receiver</a> and even turn a Mac into an AirPlay-compatible device, but there&#8217;s never been a way to easily select a video in the browser, and instantly beam it to an Apple TV with the click of a button.</p>
<p>The latest ClickToPlugin adds exactly this feature in combination with its built-in HTML5 video recognition and a second utility available on Marc Hoyois&#8217; website called <a href="http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/mediacenter/" target="_blank">Media Center</a>. Version 2.5.2 of Hoyois&#8217; extension adds a new &#8220;AirPlay&#8221; option in the HTML5 media player (the one you get if you, say, decide to replace Flash content on YouTube with HTML5 video), enabling you to send video to an Apple TV on your network. The Apple TV&#8217;s hostname or IP address needs to be specified in ClickToPlugin&#8217;s settings, but it&#8217;s set by default to apple-tv.local, which is what Apple gives you with an Apple TV out of the box. The default hostname worked for me and found my Apple TV (connected with WiFi first, then via Ethernet to my AirPort Extreme).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-3.17.30-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26418" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-30 at 3.17.30 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-3.17.30-PM.png" alt="" width="600" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Once ClickToPlugin is set to fetch HTML5 video instead of Flash (you can optionally choose a default resolution &#8212; I picked 720p) and the Apple TV is configured to accept incoming AirPlay streams (the extension has support for AirPlay passwords, too), you&#8217;ll be able to try AirPlay in Safari by opening a YouTube video, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc" target="_blank">this one</a>, and choose AirPlay from the source selector on the top left. If your settings are correct, the video should start playing on your Apple TV.</p>
<p>Media Center works in conjunction with the latest ClickToPlugin in that it adds a contextual menu item to links and HTML5 media to download a video file, open it in QuickTime, or send it to an Apple TV via AirPlay. Some of these functionalities are already provided by ClickToPlugin, but I like Media Center&#8217;s AirPlay action on right-click and, more importantly, the toolbar button that allows you to stop a a video from being streamed to the Apple TV.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-4.25.43-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26419" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-30 at 4.25.43 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-4.25.43-PM.png" alt="" width="467" height="66" /></a></p>
<p>In my tests, ClickToPlugin and Media Center have been fairly reliable, streaming 720p content from YouTube to my Apple TV, although I&#8217;ve experienced some connection drops (the video would stop playing after a few minutes on the Apple TV) and errors with the Vimeo website. I need to mention, though, that I&#8217;m running OS X, Safari and Apple TV beta software, so that might be the culprit. Even with these betas (OS X 10.7.2, Safari 5.1.1, Apple TV Software beta 6), ClickToPlugin&#8217;s AirPlay support worked fine most of the time, and I&#8217;m sure optimizations for the new OS and Safari will be available once Apple publicly releases the updates. I&#8217;ve also noticed you don&#8217;t have to keep a tab open after the video starts playing with AirPlay, but Safari can&#8217;t be quit or you&#8217;ll lose the AirPlay stream.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see native AirPlay support by Apple in a future version of Safari for Mac (or, even better, systemwide AirPlay support on OS X), but right now, ClickToPlugin and Media Center provide an interesting solution for those who want to comfortably enjoy video from their web browser on a widescreen TV. The extensions surely need some work and refinements, and it would be great to see them land on Chrome someday (if it&#8217;s even possible, I don&#8217;t know).</p>
<p>Go download ClickToPlugin and Media Center <a href="http://hoyois.github.com/" target="_blank">on Marc Hoyois&#8217; website</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-1.26.25-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26413" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-30 at 1.26.25 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-1.26.25-PM.png" alt="" width="600" height="546" /></a></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/firefox-7-officially-released/" target="_blank">Firefox 7 hit the public channel</a> earlier this week, Mozilla has published a new blog <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/futurereleases/2011/09/30/firefoxbeta8/" target="_blank">post</a> detailing some of the features of the new Firefox 8, now available in beta. Keeping true to their renewed schedule for Firefox updates, Mozilla aims to release a new version of their browser every six weeks, which has lead to some confusion among users as to whether it&#8217;s really necessary to call every update a major release when there are only minor differences to test.</p>
<p>Firefox 8 will deliver some improvements to tab management, allowing users to choose whether tabs should load at start-up, or only when they&#8217;re selected. This should allow for faster start-up times when windows with many tabs are restored; from a first test, it indeed appears Firefox 8 will restore the last opened tab, display other tabs&#8217; titles and favicons, but load their contents only when the user clicks on them. Mac users can find this new option under Preferences -&gt; General. Also, a new tab animation should make it easier to re-order tabs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-1.26.55-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26414" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-30 at 1.26.55 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-30-at-1.26.55-PM.png" alt="" width="418" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>Another new feature of Firefox 8 is Twitter integration in the search box. By clicking on the search provider&#8217;s icon (by default it&#8217;s Google), users will have the option to choose Twitter and enter terms to look up on the social network&#8217;s Search page.</p>
<p>Firefox 8 also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced control of add-ons: Users will receive a one-time notification to review and confirm third party add-ons they want to keep, disable or delete. When Firefox starts and finds that a third-party program has installed an add-on, Firefox will disable the add-on until the user has explicitly opted in, giving users better control over their Web experience.</li>
<li>CORS for WebGL textures: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enables Web developers to load textures from other domains for WebGL in a secure way.</li>
<li>WebSockets updates: Firefox now prevents the use of plaintext WebSockets when created from an SSL page, which improves security for users.</li>
<li>HTML5 Native Right Click Menu: Web developers can now add items directly to the Firefox right click menu using simple HTML5 markup.</li>
<li>HTML5 media elements: Developers can add a lot of video and audio elements to a website without impacting performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox 8 is expected to be available later this year. The first beta can be download from Mozilla&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JAMBOX 2.1 Software Update</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jambox-gallery-main-16.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26411" title="jambox-gallery-main-16" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jambox-gallery-main-16.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>When Jawbone <a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/08/24/jambox-liveaudio-update-worth-effort/" target="_blank">shipped the 2.0 software update</a> for the JAMBOX (my <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/macstories-product-review-jawbone-jambox-portable-speaker/" target="_blank">review</a>), I was very disappointed. Not only I couldn&#8217;t experience the three-dimensional binaural recordings (in spite of listening multiple times to the dedicated Spotify playlist) &#8212; the update itself made overall audio quality considerably worse, even with <a href="http://jawbone.com/liveaudio" target="_blank">LiveAudio</a> turned off. I&#8217;ve heard mixed responses about the 2.0 update (some people seemed to love it, others couldn&#8217;t stand it at all), and whilst it didn&#8217;t stop me from using the JAMBOX every day, I was definitely looking forward to the &#8220;fix&#8221; that Jawbone promptly promised. On 2.0, sound was distorted, &#8220;cold&#8221;, fuzzy &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t the same JAMBOX I bought.</p>
<p>With the 2.1 update released this week, Jawbone seems to have fixed most of the annoyances that creeped into version 2.0. I still can&#8217;t fully understand (or, for that matter, <em>hear</em>) LiveAudio, but the JAMBOX engineers have restored the device&#8217;s original audio and introduced a new Sound Clarity option that delivers distortion-free audio at high volume levels when LiveAudio is off. From Jawbone&#8217;s email about the update:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can also enjoy a clearer, distortion-free sound when LiveAudio is OFF by turning Sound Clarity ON. When Sound Clarity is ON, the software uses an audio tuning algorithm that cleans up distortion at high volume levels. Sound Clarity is OFF by default &#8211; to turn it on, go to Advanced Settings in MyTALK and set &#8220;Sound Clarity&#8221; ON.</p></blockquote>
<p>After a full day of testing, I can say I like this latest software update. A lot. I&#8217;ve listened to Pink Floyd, Biffy Clyro, Kasabian, Blink-182, Bon Iver and Noel Gallagher this afternoon, and sound quality was at the same level of my original JAMBOX review. With Sound Clarity on, the JAMBOX perhaps loses a bit of detail and bass deepness, but there&#8217;s a sensible gain in loudness with clearer sound.</p>
<p>Go update your JAMBOX right now. You can visit <a href="http://mytalk.jawbone.com/" target="_blank">mytalk.jawbone.com</a> to download the latest Jawbone Updater for Mac, and then configure LiveAudio and Sound Clarity directly in your browser. Highly recommended.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Reuters: Brazil&#8217;s $12 Billion iPad Deal Is &#8220;In Doubt&#8221;</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-13-at-10.49.34-PM.png" alt="" width="600" height="136" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/29/us-brazil-ipad-foxconn-idUSTRE78S4O420110929" target="_blank">According to Reuters</a>, Brazilian officials are claiming the $12 billion deal between Brazil and Foxconn, maker of the iPad, is &#8220;in doubt&#8221; because of a lack of an agreement on tax breaks, work conditions, and other &#8220;crazy demands&#8221; by Foxconn. It appears the talks between the local government and Foxconn have been difficult, mainly due to Brazil&#8217;s high taxes and non-skilled workers that don&#8217;t meet Foxconn&#8217;s expectations. These demands may also include priority treatment at Brazilian customs, Reuters reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re dealing with a lot of issues, like the (Taiwanese) trying to figure out how to do business in Brazil &#8230; and Brazil figuring out how to produce these complicated products,&#8221; a second government official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Maybe we will end up starting with something smaller.</p></blockquote>
<p>The deal between Foxconn and Brazil was <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/foxconn-to-invest-12-billion-in-brazil-begin-ipad-production-in-november/" target="_blank">announced</a> back in April by Brazilian’s President Dilma Roussef, with production set to begin in July. The date was then pushed back to November, and more recently Brazilian Minister of Science and Technology, Aloízio Mercadante, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/new-ipad-factory-in-brazil-is-ready-already-making-ipads-for-december/" target="_blank">said</a> that the new factory was &#8220;ready&#8221; and making iPads that would start shipping in December.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-29-at-5.56.20-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26408" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-29 at 5.56.20 PM" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-29-at-5.56.20-PM.png" alt="" width="600" height="362" /></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/apple-tells-education-no-more-boxed-software-except-logic/11240" target="_blank">a report by ZDNet&#8217;s Jason O&#8217;Grady</a>, Apple has informed educational resellers and customers of academic institutions that they will no longer receive boxed copies of Apple software like Snow Leopard, iLife, and iWork. With the exception of Snow Leopard, required to upgrade to OS X Lion and still available on Apple&#8217;s website, all the apps mentioned in the letter have been released on the Mac App Store, including Apple Remote Desktop and Aperture, the latter with a heavily discounted price compared to its physical counterpart.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple confirmed today that, with limited exception, they will cease to ship boxed software to campus resellers. This includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard , iLife, iWork, Apple Remote Desktop, and Aperture, among others.</p>
<p>We have a limited supply of copies of each in stock in the store, so consider this a “last call” for anyone who would like a hard copy before they are gone. Particularly anyone who would like to get Snow Leopard, as we just received our final shipment of that version of the OS.</p>
<p>The only products that will remain as boxed software offerings are Logic Express and Logic Studio.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious move towards digital downloads falls in line with Apple&#8217;s recent Mac App Store-only strategy: the discontinuation of <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/mobileme-retail-boxes-move-to-trash-free-version-soon/" target="_blank">MobileMe boxes</a> and less space for <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/20/apple-kills-more-boxed-software-in-favor-of-app-store/" target="_blank">boxed software</a> in Apple retail stores; the popularity of the Mac App Store as a digital distribution platform; the release of new major upgrades (Lion, Final Cut Pro X) exclusively on the Mac App Store. Clearly, Apple is putting all the pieces together to eliminate boxed software completely from its future offerings. There are a few exceptions of course &#8212; Apple had to release <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/os-x-lion-usb-thumb-drive-now-available/" target="_blank">a physical copy of Lion</a> for users unable to download the 4 GB installer, and recently made the old Final Cut Studio (boxed copy) <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/final-cut-studio-back-on-sale-at-999/" target="_blank">available again</a> through tele-sales. But as this &#8220;last call&#8221; to educational resellers confirms, Apple&#8217;s future software distribution won&#8217;t include boxed copies, not even for academic institutions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora</a>, the question-and-answer website publicly launched in summer 2010, has released its first official iPhone app today, free on the App Store. For those not familiar with Quora, it&#8217;s a community-driven resource for answers on a variety of topics including technology, science, sports, media, health, and more. Quora aggregates topics and questions, allowing users to collaborate on them and vote the best answer to a specific question. Each &#8220;author&#8221; has a profile with detailed stats for recent posts and answers, activity and &#8220;related answers&#8221;. Quora has been widely regarded as a revolutionary knowledge platform comparable to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The iPhone app brings many of the features that made Quora popular on mobile devices (the app also runs on the iPod touch) and adds a &#8220;nearby feature&#8221; to browse topics on a map, add or answer questions about a place near you, or simply explore questions on a map overlay. You can view your profile, ask and answer questions, or read your feed for interesting questions and topics you might want to follow.</p>
<p>The developers of the Quora app <a href="http://www.quora.com/Anne-K.-Halsall/Quora-for-iPhone/Announcing-Quora-for-iPhone-and-iPod-touch" target="_blank">write</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Neeraj Agrawal and I started working on the app earlier this year, we spent a lot of time thinking about how to translate both the experience and the technology of Quora to a mobile platform. We rethought the design from the ground up and worked hard to make it fast and native while strengthening the core product. Now, just like on the Quora web site, you can read your feed, search and add questions, check your notifications and add answers and posts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made existing features like Shuffle even better. You can find Shuffle at the bottom of your feed. It&#8217;s perfect for surfacing even more great content when you&#8217;re stuck at a bus stop and looking for something to read.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quora for iPhone is <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fquora%252Fid456034437%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="_blank">available for free on the App Store</a>.</p>

Shazam believes this shift will give them more opportunities for users to discover and interact with their favorite music and television shows.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew Fisher, Shazam CEO said, “Shazamers already identify over 1 billion songs each year and go on to purchase over $100 million in digital music via our service. Now, with no limits, people can Shazam even more songs they don’t know – or they already know &#8211; to conveniently purchase them, see the lyrics, watch the official music video, share on Facebook, Twitter or email, get recommendations and purchase concert tickets instantly. Unlimited free access means people can use Shazam even more as part of their daily lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Users of the Shazam service can of course upgrade to the paid app, called <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fshazam-encore%252Fid337288863%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="_blank">Encore</a>, and get the benefits of ad-free usage and features like LyricPlay, which allows users to view lyrics as the tracks play. </p>
<p>A link to the free Shazam app can be found <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fshazam%252Fid284993459%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spartan.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26401" title="Spartan" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spartan.png" alt="" width="394" height="300" /></a>Back in July TechCrunch revealed that Facebook had already developed an iPad app that was <a title="TechCrunch: Facebook’s iPad App Is Hidden Inside Of Their iPhone App" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/25/facebooks-hidden-ipad-app/" target="_blank">live inside the iPhone app</a>. It seemed feature complete, which has confused many as to why Facebook has taken so long to launch it — they didn’t even launch it at last week&#8217;s f8 conference. If MG Siegler of TechCrunch is correct (which he has been for <em>many</em> Facebook scoops this year), it has been waiting on another of Facebook’s <a title="MacStories: Ahead Of “Awesome” Launch, Screenshots Show Facebook’s Project Spartan" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/ahead-of-awesome-launch-screenshots-show-facebooks-project-spartan/" target="_blank">Project Spartan</a> and various negotiations with Apple &#8211; as was <a title="MacStories: Facebook iPad App “Feature Complete” Since May, Apple and Facebook Negotiating Over HTML5 Platform?" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/facebook-ipad-app-feature-complete-since-may-apple-and-facebook-negotiating-over-html5-platform/" target="_blank">reported this week</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today another TechCrunch writer, Alexia Tsotsis found some <a title="TechCrunch: This Sure Looks A Lot Like Facebook’s Project Spartan [Screenshots]" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/this-sure-looks-a-lot-like-facebooks-project-spartan-screenshots/" target="_blank">screenshots of Project Spartan</a> (see above) which MG Siegler believes to be the real thing. He writes this morning that “the planets are aligning” and that the Facebook iPad app and Project Spartan (of which both have seen delays and delayed each other) will <a title="TechCrunch: The Planets Are Aligned: Facebook’s Spartan And iPad Projects Set To Launch Early Next Week " href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/29/facebook-ipad-spartan-event/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29" target="_blank">launch next week</a>.</p>
<p>According to him Apple has been involved with both projects and that the two companies have been collaborating on both projects. His sources note that the two Facebook projects may launch at <a title="MacStories: Apple Confirms: Media Event on October 4th" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-confirms-media-event-on-october-4th/" target="_blank">next week&#8217;s Apple event</a> (<a title="Mashable: Facebook to launch iPad App at iPhone 5 Event" href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/26/facebook-ipad-app-iphone-app-exclusive/" target="_blank">Mashable also suggests this</a>), potentially as part of a demonstration that shows off improved HTML5 support on iOS. But if that arrangement falls through Facebook will apparently reveal the two projects during a Monday event.</p>
<blockquote><p>But make no mistake, the relationship between the two companies is tenuous at best. Both know that they’d probably be better of working together, but both also believe that they don’t actually need each other. Hence, the dancing we’ve been seeing and hearing about. The two are frenemies. But the launch of Google+ has made the common enemy very clear…</p></blockquote>
<p>Project Spartan is an HTML5-based development and distribution platform that’s being built with Mobile Safari for iOS in mind. When MG Siegler first posted <a title="TechCrunch: Facebook's Project Spartan" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/" target="_blank">about Project Spartan in mid-June</a>, he described the purpose of it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook will never admit this, but those familiar with the project believe the intention is very clear: to use Apple’s own devices against them to break the stranglehold they have on mobile app distribution. With nearly 700 million users, Facebook is certainly in the position to challenge the almighty App Store distribution mechanism. But they need to be able to do so on Apple’s devices which make up a key chunk of the market.</p></blockquote>

He says the subscription numbers are less than a quarter the number that is required for the publication to make money.</p>
<p>When The Daily <a title="MacStories: The Daily is Now Available in the App Store" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/breaking-the-daily-is-now-available-in-the-app-store/" target="_blank">was unveiled in February</a>, News Corporation Chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch said &#8220;We believe the Daily will be the model for how stories are told and consumed&#8221;. He spoke of how the publication would have the speed and versatility of new technology with the &#8220;serendipity and surprise&#8221; of newspapers &#8211; making &#8216;newspapers&#8217; &#8220;viable again&#8221;.</p>
<p>News Corporation did reveal that more than <a title="MacStories: The Daily for iPad Nearing 1 Million Downloads" href="http://www.macstories.net/news/the-daily-for-ipad-nearing-1-million-downloads/" target="_blank">1 million people had downloaded the app</a> between February and June but had declined to give out figures of actual readership. In May, News Corporation COO, Chase Carey defended the publication calling it a &#8220;work in progress&#8221;, and it being &#8220;early days&#8221;. Murdoch revealed in February that they had invested $30 million in the project, hiring over 100 staff and required a readership of 500,000 to break even.</p>

It will listen to a question or statement you make and then using the number of services it supports (from Yelp to Twitter to the iPod app), complete the task that you invoked.</p>
<p>Today Nuance has released an update to Dragon Go! that, in a sense, upgrades its intelligence that we described. It has improved it&#8217;s intelligence by adding support for a number of new services &#8211; meaning it can now understand more commands and actually do more things. It has added support for media services Netflix and Spotify, search engines Wolfram|Alpha and Ask.com as well as Google+.</p>
<p>It has also improved the Yelp experience from within the app by allowing users to access a map from within the Yelp tab. You can grab the update now, or if you haven&#8217;t yet tried Dragon Go! you can download it for <a title="App Store: Dragon Go!" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-go!/id442975871?mt=8" target="_blank">free on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/ios_needs_a_universal_save/" target="_blank">Ted Landau at The Mac Observer covers</a> an issue I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/talking-apps/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-multitasking-it-doesnt-need-to-be-pc-like/" target="_blank">times</a> in the past, which Apple has partially fixed with the last releases of iOS: saving documents and moving them across apps. Specifically, Landau notes that the lack of a &#8220;universal save&#8221; option for documents that can be read by third-party apps (PDFs, text files, images) leads to an annoying and pretty much useless duplication of content. Apple has implemented an &#8220;Open In&#8230;&#8221; menu to send files to other apps, but the file that&#8217;s being sent is a <em>copy</em>. iOS apps can&#8217;t read and modify a source file from a single location.</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, iOS does not come close to matching the advantages of Mac OS X here. There is no way to have a unifying folder in iOS that contains related documents from different apps. There is no way to have a document easily opened in different apps, where any changes you make in one app are instantly accessible by all the compatible apps. You can come closer with Dropbox, but closer is not good enough here.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s annoying for me, too, as I constantly switch between apps to get my work done, and it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t enjoy trying new ones. This typically leads to some sort of geek frustration &#8212; why can&#8217;t Apple build an invisible layer that lets <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/" target="_blank">Elements</a> edit a text document from Evernote and Pages access the same file?</p>
<p>For Ted and me, yes, being able to avoid file duplication and tedious exporting processes would be nice. But I do wonder how much does Apple care about such functionalities considering the underlying paradigms of iOS and the upcoming iCloud functionalities of iOS 5. For one, Apple really cares about application sandboxing: each app has its own controlled data environment and only a few items can be shared between multiple apps. Apple cares about sandboxing so much that they&#8217;re bringing it to the Mac App Store. Would iOS sandboxing allow for a source file to be edited and &#8220;saved&#8221; by multiple apps? Where does that file belong to, technically? Would iOS apps be able to write specific metadata to it? And what happens if, hypothetically, this &#8220;shared&#8221; file needs to be pushed back and forth with iCloud?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no iOS developer, but I can see this proposed &#8220;universal save&#8221; model becoming an issue when on iOS, unlike the Mac, there&#8217;s no visible, centralized Finder location to write and read files from. In fact, Ted is right when he says that the convenience of a Mac is being able to create &#8220;a folder that will contain all the assorted files needed to put his column together&#8221;. That&#8217;s made easy by the Finder &#8212; but on iOS? Apple allows third-party developers to plug into the Music library or Camera Roll, yet there&#8217;s no Apple app to &#8220;create text file here&#8221; or &#8220;save webpage from Safari here&#8221;. Again, the lack of an iOS Finder would require &#8220;universal save&#8221; to work inside any app. iDisk could have been a centralized location for files &#8212; it could have even been Apple&#8217;s &#8220;answer to Dropbox&#8221; &#8212; but it&#8217;s not going to be supported by iCloud.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the conceptual issue of an iOS device being <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad" target="_blank">the app that you&#8217;re using</a>. When you use Pages on an iPad, the iPad <em>is</em> a word processor. When you browse the web with Safari, you&#8217;re holding the web in your hands. On a technical level, this <a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/1432038656/geek-luddites" target="_blank">app console</a> model is represented by sandboxing and one-way &#8220;Open In&#8221; menus, and soon <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/documents.html" target="_blank">iCloud-based documents</a> that allow multiple versions of the <em>same app</em> to access files. Would a &#8220;universal save&#8221; option somehow break the illusion that you&#8217;re holding an app, reminding us that we&#8217;re using a device with multiple layers of abstractions including a filesystem?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. I believe I&#8217;d like this feature in theory, but I wonder if there would also be a considerable trade-off to accept.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26393" title="1" src="http://www.macstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="441" /></a></p>
<p>Earlier today Amazon announced a completely revamped Kindle family, which includes the standard $79 Kindle, the $99 Kindle touch, and the much-anticipated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051VVOB2" target="_blank">$199 Kindle Fire tablet</a>. Ad-supported <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/28/most-of-the-amazon-kindles-introduced-today-cost-more-without-special-offers/" target="_blank">options</a> and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/28/amazons-big-event-here%E2%80%99s-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">hands-on coverage</a> aside, I&#8217;d like to quickly touch upon a common mistake in today&#8217;s tech headlines &#8212; that the Kindle Fire will &#8220;kill&#8221; the iPad.</p>
<p>First off, <strong>Amazon gets it</strong>: they know an ecosystem <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/an-ecosystems-uniqueness-and-similarities/" target="_blank">has to scale to different devices and operating systems</a>, so they diversified their approach to ebook reading and media consumption with three different sets of Kindle (Keyboard/$79 Kindle, Touch, Fire) all tied to a single defining feature: your Amazon.com account.</p>
<p>In discussing Microsoft&#8217;s approach to the concept of ecosystem when compared to Apple&#8217;s, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Apple’s vision, separate operating systems can live inside the same ecosystem. The single defining aspect of this vision is the Apple ID, which on iOS devices, Macs, PCs, and web browsers gives you access to:</p>
<p>- Songs, Movies, TV Shows, Books, Podcasts;</p>
<p>- Apps;</p>
<p>- The Apple Online Store;</p>
<p>- Your iOS device’s location (still free with MobileMe);</p>
<p>- Email, Calendar, Contact and data sync with MobileMe;</p>
<p>- Your desktop operating system (with Lion’s Apple ID support).</p></blockquote>
<p>Compare this to Amazon, which is doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Prime: faster shipping times and Instant Video;</li>
<li>Amazon MP3;</li>
<li>Amazon Kindle;</li>
<li>Amazon Appstore;</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is building an ecosystem, and all you need to access these services is a single Amazon.com account, possibly connected to a credit card. Like Apple, it may be difficult to keep everything in one account, but it&#8217;s not like the average consumer needs all the functionalities of Web Services anyway. Furthermore, Amazon controls its platforms with the web infrastructure they&#8217;ve created, and the newly announced Silk browser is the perfect example of how Amazon should also be able to somehow control and optimize web traffic operated by its devices.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more. Amazon gets it because they&#8217;re offering a limited choice of devices to use with their ecosystem. Many often cite Apple&#8217;s product line-up as an example of simplicity and &#8220;just one model&#8221; philosophy, but if you think about it, there are multiple ways to get started with iOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone (two colors, different storage options, carrier variations);</li>
<li>iPod touch (different storage options);</li>
<li>iPad (two colors, different storage options, carrier variations).</li>
</ul>
<p>and the Mac (all with multiple configuration options available):</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Air;</li>
<li>MacBook Pro;</li>
<li>iMac;</li>
<li>Mac mini;</li>
<li>Mac Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon may kill off some members of the Kindle family soon (DX perhaps?), but here&#8217;s what they offer today to access the Amazon.com ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindle;</li>
<li>Kindle Keyboard;</li>
<li>Kindle DX;</li>
<li>Kindle Touch;</li>
<li>Kindle Fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>The similarities in the underlying concepts of &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; and &#8220;uniqueness&#8221; between Apple and Amazon are clear, but there are some key difference that many people don&#8217;t seem to properly consider when referring to the latest Kindle Fire as an &#8220;iPad killer&#8221;. Assuming that by &#8220;killer&#8221; they actually imagine a scenario where people will stop buying iPads altogether and start seeing the Fire as the only option, Amazon would still need Apple&#8217;s retail power at an international level. These people that write &#8220;iPad killer&#8221; seem to forget that the iPad is available in 64 countries <em>today</em>. Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire will ship November 15th in the US. So let&#8217;s put the &#8220;killer&#8221; argument behind us once and for all.</p>
<p>Amazon is about to launch a product that may end up being a feasible alternative to the iPad for some people, a product shares several similarities with Apple&#8217;s approach to the digital ecosystem. I have no doubt Amazon will sell millions of these new Kindles, and I think the Fire in particular will prove popular with families, readers, movie watchers, gamers &#8212; <em>average consumers</em> that may prefer a cheaper device integrated with the Amazon.com account they already have and use daily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to form a complete thought on Amazon&#8217;s new strategy because they&#8217;re just getting started. The unification process of Amazon&#8217;s ecosystem and diversification of unique devices begins today, and the Kindle Fire will ship in less than two months. It&#8217;s hard to imagine whether Amazon&#8217;s long-term plan is &#8220;trying to be like Apple&#8221; with international releases, rich App Store, deals with music labels, partnerships with carriers, and so forth. It&#8217;s also worth considering that Amazon isn&#8217;t completely independent from others yet, as the Kindle Fire runs on a modified version of Android 2.x with <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/10771260025/free" target="_blank">possible legal implications in patent fees</a>. And more importantly, it doesn&#8217;t even make sense to &#8220;judge&#8221; the Kindle Fire right now as a winner or PlayBook when we even haven&#8217;t tried one. But two months from now, right ahead of the holiday season, let&#8217;s picture the following situation: assuming an average consumer interested in reading, listening to music, playing games, watching movies and browsing the web has $500 to spend, will he pick an iPad or a Kindle Fire? And is there a reason to pick both?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where ecosystems prove their strengths.</p>
