This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions, but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Middle Ages, developed the notion -- Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi --&lt;br /&gt;where the wheel of fortune could not be modified.  M. tried to insert the notion of free will into the experience of chance in the world.  There's a lesson in there.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-1693680508877387295?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-fortune-can-effect-in-human.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-5009057577638578610</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2010 14:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-05-23T08:05:18.424-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>cyborg</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>posthuman</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>consciousness</category><title>How we became posthuman</title><description>Hayes distinguishes between the presence/abscence axis, and the pattern/randomness axis.  Traditionally, the focus of the economy was on 'possession' -- the presence of resources within the control of an entity.  In the postmodern economy -- the information is the key axis/focus .  This is simply common information economy manifesto-speak.  However, Hayes analyzes the possibility of the dematerialization of information more deeply.   is it really possible to cyborgize humanity? isn't it true that all information has to be present in some manifestation?&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"even though information provides the basis for much of contemporary society, it is never present in itself."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because they have bodies, books and people have something to lose if they are regarded solely as informational patterns, namely the resistant materiality that has traditionally marked the experience of reading no less than it has marked the experience of living as embodied creatures. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-5009057577638578610?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2010/05/how-we-became-posthuman.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-8045595312110158319</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2010 02:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-05-15T19:41:31.800-07:00</atom:updated><title>cynics in the organization</title><description>Dave Snowden, says ..&lt;br /&gt;"At a recent session with a few CEOs I has asked for my three ideas that would help them cope with uncertainty.

Clocks are neat, orderly systems that can be solved through reduction; clouds are an epistemic mess, “highly irregular, disorderly, and more or less unpredictable.” The mistake of modern science is to pretend that everything is a clock, which is why we get seduced again and again by the false promises of brain scanners and gene sequencers. We want to believe we will understand nature if we find the exact right tool to cut its joints. But that approach is doomed to failure.

Yet intelligent programmers have not been able to produce software systems that match even the full capabilities of insects.  Recent experiments demonstrate that evolution by natural selection is able to operate effectively in genetic languages based on the machine codes of digital computers (Ray 1991a, 1991b, 1994c). This opens up the possibility of using evolution to generate complex software (&lt;a href="http://www.his.atr.jp/%7Eray/pubs/reserves/node2.html#SECTION00011000000000000000"&gt;Tierra)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-2595267875718650052?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2008/03/artificial-life-overview.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-5053544487666782112</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 02:23:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-03-13T19:34:49.901-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>emerent order</category><title>Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams</title><description>1) Positive Feedback isn't always bad, &lt;br /&gt;2) Randomness can help create order,  &lt;br /&gt;3) A Flock isn't a big bird, &lt;br /&gt;4) A traffic Jam isn't just a collection of cars, &lt;br /&gt;5) The Hills are Alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paraphrases -- the virtuous cycle is responsible for emergent order -- randomness is what you NEED to create order -- planning is impossible for the units involved in creating the order -- they are incapable of planning.  -- levels of interaction -- the cars can be moving forward while the jam is moving backward.  the environment itself interacts with the items.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-5053544487666782112?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2008/03/turtles-termites-and-traffic-jams.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-4863154142241687154</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2008 03:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-03-06T20:06:07.153-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>complexity</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>chaos</category><title>Harnessing Complexity</title><description>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Harnessing Complexity &lt;/span&gt;by Robert Axelrod, and Michael Cohen / a framework for using complexity, unleash the notion of populations, using strategies, in patterned interactions, by means of artifacts.

To the frustration of the researchers, the Kpelle chose functional pairings. They put a potato and a knife together because a knife is used to cut a potato. “A wise man could only do such-and-such,” they explained. Finally, the researchers asked, “How would a fool do it?” The tribesmen immediately re-sorted the items into the “right” categories. It can be argued that taxonomical categories are a developmental improvement—that is, that the Kpelle would be more likely to advance, technologically and scientifically, if they started to see the world that way. But to label them less intelligent than Westerners, on the basis of their performance on that test, is merely to state that they have different cognitive preferences and habits. And if I.Q. varies with habits of mind, which can be adopted or discarded in a generation, what, exactly, is all the fuss about?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Cole is part of the center that works on Activity Theory (&lt;a href="http://lchc.ucsd.edu/index.html"&gt;LCHC &lt;/a&gt;) I would say the fuss is about the fact that the modern definition of intelligence is a series of disembodied abstractions -- but the primal definition of intelligence is related to the activity of the mind in the world.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-6771657167327917168?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2007/12/what-does-iq-tell-us.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-7747557188405429105</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2007 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-11-11T19:46:09.414-08:00</atom:updated><title>Context and Consciousness</title><description>Bonnie Nardi quotes the Little Prince:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes it&lt;br /&gt;so precious...

Wack, who gained some fame as a strategic planner during the oil crises of the 1970s with his ability to get the senior executives in Shell Oil to understand what might happen in the energy business, wrote in the Harvard Business Review some years later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world of&lt;br /&gt;   perceptions. They explore the facts but they aim at perceptions&lt;br /&gt;   inside the heads of decision makers. Their purpose is to gather and&lt;br /&gt;   transform information of strategic significance into fresh&lt;br /&gt;   perceptions. This transformation process is not trivial--more often&lt;br /&gt;   than not it does not happen. When it works, it is a creative&lt;br /&gt;   experience that generates a heartfelt "Aha!" from you ... [decision&lt;br /&gt;   makers] and leads to strategic insights beyond the mind's previous&lt;br /&gt;   reach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pierre Wack, "Scenarios: Shooting the Rapids: How Medium-Term Analysis Illuminated the Power of Scenarios for Shell Management," Harvard Business Review (November-December 1985)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12408902-6640822615759563295?l=noologist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://noologist.blogspot.com/2007/08/art-of-reperceiving-scenarios-and.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Rick)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-12408902.post-23141693884403540</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2007 02:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-08-14T23:19:13.672-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>diverstiy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>networks</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>social_networks</category><title>Institute of Network Cultures</title><description>Poets have descended from the peaks, which they believed&lt;br /&gt;themselves to be established.
