			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here you can download sample syllabi that showcase a number of my strengths and approaches as a teacher.</p>
<p><a href="http://racollin.mysite.syr.edu/cultural%20approaches%20to%20literature.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cultural Approaches to Literature</span> [get pdf]</a><br />
“Cultural Approaches to Literature” is a course I designed after realizing that many of my students experience the historically-distant literature I teach as utterly alien or foreign.  Though I teach American literature, the historical worlds represented in nineteenth and early twentieth century texts are effectively a “different culture” from our own.  Because of this I have designed “Cultural Approaches to Literature” specifically to help students build familiarity with the larger social and cultural worlds depicted in older texts. In this course students work very slowly through a handful of novels, while simultaneously immersing themselves in a tremendous amount of supplementary materials from the same period: etiquette manuals, cookbooks, political tracts, newspaper articles, domestic manuals, architectural blueprints, advertisements, and other materials that help bring to life the social and material world of the novels, and help students understand those novels as their original readers would have.</p>
<p><a href="http://racollin.mysite.syr.edu/ecocriticism%20syllabus.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature Writing and Environmental Literature</span> [get pdf]</a><br />
“Nature Writing and Environmental Literature&#8221; is a course that balances theoretical inquiry with attention to primary texts.  Students will begin to make connections between different disciplines&#8211;  in this case, between literature and environmental studies&#8211; and to see that much of what literary texts “mean” is a consequence of the priorities and interests of the person interpreting them.  Students will also gain an understanding of the activist potential of literary writing as they read fiction in the context of a vigorous and expanding body of environmental criticism.  This course encourages students to understand environmentally oriented literary criticism to have far-reading social and political implications and to think about the relationship between reading, writing, and activism.</p>
<p><a href="http://racollin.mysite.syr.edu/realim%20and%20gilded%20age.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Realism and the Syntax of Class</span> [get pdf]</a><br />
“Realism and the Syntax of Class&#8221; offers students the opportunity to engage in a sustained and detailed investigation of a major literary movement.  Starting from the premise that one of realism&#8217;s defining features is its persistent engagement with the gritty realities of social failure, this courses encourages students to investigate why realism so often takes the form of classed social critique. This course asks students to grapple with nineteenth century formations of class and to ask how the conventions of the school of realism helped to produce a literary syntax of class.</p>
<p><a href="http://racollin.mysite.syr.edu/women%20writing%20reform.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">U.S. Women Writing Social Reform, 1840-1920</span> [get pdf]</a><br />
&#8220;U.S. Women Writing Social Reform&#8221; is designed to allow students to explore the contributions of women to the literary and progressive social transformations that were taking place during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  This course invites students to consider the status of literature as a platform for social critique, and challenges students to ask questions about the different efficacies that different written forms might have.  Students also grapple with the complex issue of gender in literary expression, particularly as it is vexed by racial, ethinic, and class lines.</p>
