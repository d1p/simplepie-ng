Whilst I don't completely agree with some of the sentiment in this article (social connections via the web may not be a 'technology' in the traditional sense but will prove to be just as critical a breakthrough in the development of communications despite this writer's pessimism) it's overall a very interesting and important read.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tech bubbles happen, but we usually gain from the innovation left behind. This one—driven by social networking—could leave us empty-handed.

Page is ending his first week back as CEO by naming the senior team who each will run a different part of Google and report directly to him.  

If you want to know what Page's priorities will be for Google, just look at this team and the products they run: search, ads, YouTube, mobile, Chrome, and social.  Team Larry consists of six key people at Google: Andy Rubin (Senior Vice President of Mobile), Salar Kamangar (Senior Vice President of YouTube and Video), Vic Gundotra (Senior Vice President of Social), Sundar Pichai (Senior Vice President of Chrome) Alan Eustace (Senior Vice President of Search), and Susan Wojcicki (Senior Vice President of Ads).  Each will run their respective parts of Google independently, with a direct line to Page.  After all, extra layers of management just get in the way.</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">techcrunch.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techcrunch.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1301837010655"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a5d727c3d25486a</id><title type="html">Brixton: could it happen again? 30 years after the riots | UK news | The Guardian</title><published>2011-04-03T13:23:30Z</published><updated>2011-04-03T13:23:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/apr/02/brixton-riots-anniversary#" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" title="www.guardian.co.uk"/><content xml:base="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/apr/02/brixton-riots-anniversary#" type="html">It is 30 years since Brixton was torn apart by riots.

Duke University engineering dean Kristina Johnson gave me a great spiel about how the school’s Masters of Engineering Management program churns out great engineers, and how engineers solve the world’s problems. She said that I could make a big impact by teaching engineering students about the real world and encouraging them to become entrepreneurs. I felt so excited that I joined the university without even asking for a proper salary. That was in 2005.

I was shocked—and upset—when the majority of my students became investment bankers or management consultants after they graduated.  Hardly any became engineers. Why would they, when they had huge student loans, and Goldman Sachs was offering them twice as much as engineering companies did?

So when the investment banks tanked in 2008, I cheered because engineering had become sexy again for engineering grads (read my BusinessWeek column).

But thanks to the hundred-billion-dollar taxpayer bailouts, investment banks recovered and went back to their old, greedy ways.  And they began offering even more money to engineering grads (and themselves).</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">techcrunch.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techcrunch.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1300114683192"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a8b1f0bfa5d3de9</id><title type="html">The hesitant saviour: how Germany bestrides Europe once again | World news | The Guardian</title><published>2011-03-14T14:58:03Z</published><updated>2011-03-14T14:58:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/13/germany-bestrides-europe-again#" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" title="www.guardian.co.uk"/><content xml:base="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/13/germany-bestrides-europe-again#" type="html">Simon Jenkins: Berlin's revival is symbolic of the country's new role as generous leader of ever-closer union</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/12118579739507507399/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.guardian.co.uk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1299231628571"><id gr:original-id="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/business/global/03android.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bea607b89d474582</id><category term="Cellular Telephones" scheme="http://www.nytimes.com/namespaces/mdes"/><category term="Japan" scheme="http://www.nytimes.com/namespaces/nyt_geo"/><category term="Android (Operating System)" scheme="http://www.nytimes.com/namespaces/des"/><category term="Smartphones" scheme="http://www.nytimes.com/namespaces/mdes"/><title type="html">Japan Phone Makers See Opportunity in Android</title><published>2011-03-02T14:34:25Z</published><updated>2011-03-02T14:34:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nytimes.com/click.phdo?i=596208d9dfbd1592173fc20ea668572d" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/index.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss" type="html">Sharp, Sony Ericsson and others are hoping that Google’s system will finally help Japan’s cellphones catch fire abroad.&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;

He will tell them he has no qualms about the Liberal Democrat party claiming credit for its successes, but only once announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg is convinced that the public will respect the coalition less if Lib Dem ministers are either moaning, highlighting friction or lording it over their partners. Trust between the two parties, a prerequisite for a functioning coalition, would also be sapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time his aides say damage from the undercover constituency tape recordings made by the Daily Telegraph of disgruntled Lib Dem ministers has not been massive. One said: "It is pretty lame stuff and looks well within the boundaries of the Geneva convention in comparison with what went on inside the Blair government between 2001 and 2006."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting the Liberal Democrat eminence grise, Lord Jenkins, the aide added: "All government are coalitions, overt or covert, and overt ones tend to be more healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg's critics in the party say that in his pursuit of coalition stability, he has tipped too far in one direction excessively celebrating the common ideological lineage between himself and David Cameron over issues ranging from fiscal policy and public services to the "big society".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this criticism reflects ideological differences within the Lib Dems, but it is also a tactical argument about managing the coalition and retaining identity, something the party leadership admits is a delicate balancing act. This debate over tactics and preserving identity has been bubbling inside the party for months, inevitably intensifying as its popularity slides in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most extreme call to do more to distinguish the party from the Tories was put by Adrian Sanders, the MP for Torbay. He said he supported the coalition programme, but criticised a leadership that "seems keener on impressing the Conservatives as to how much we can be relied upon to take 'tough' decisions, than on asserting how much the Conservatives need us in order to remain in government". He described the Tories as the enemy, and spoke of a demoralised party, angry at the extent to which Clegg does not see politics in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the Telegraph tapes, Edward Davey, the business minister, reflected a similar if  milder frustration, saying: "What I hope is that we had the love-in and that we can begin to assert our identity a little more clearly. We are asserting our identity internally, but I absolutely agree with you, and I have said this to colleagues, we have to assert our identity more publicly, that we are an independent party kicking for our values."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point was also made by the business secretary, Vince Cable, in his speech to the Lib Dem conference in the autumn. He said: "To hold our own, we need to maintain our party's identity and our authentic voice. We had to go through a merger to found our party. We'll never merge again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg argues that the great strategic prize is to show that coalition politics works – something, judging by the polls, the public still believe. Repeatedly accentuating differences will only alienate voters. He partly bases his views on a study of successful European coalitions, including in the Netherlands  and Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg has been influenced by Lousewies van der Laan, a former Dutch Liberal leader and European parliament colleague. At a seminar in Westminster in November, she set out the dos and don'ts of coalition. It did not work to behave like a mayor in wartime during an occupation, complaining it was terrible but at least we had some power, she said. Equally, showing your battle wounds did not impress voters.  A current Clegg adviser was more succinct: "Yes we can advertise our wins, but we have to be careful which ones and be aware every time of the impact on the Tory right. But this is a long haul, and this episode has shown us the importance of being disciplined and being even more ready for attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dailytelegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/5ah1nlegk960hjmo91i6b6o7v0/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fpolitics%2F2010%2Fdec%2F23%2Fnick-clegg-lib-dems-coalition" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Patrick Wintour</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rss</id><title type="html">The Guardian World News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1292445988253"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/737a27be606e5034</id><title type="html">Radiohead: 01 and 10 | Puddlegum</title><published>2010-12-15T20:46:28Z</published><updated>2010-12-15T20:46:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://puddlegum.net/radiohead-01-and-10/" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://puddlegum.net/" title="puddlegum.net"/><content xml:base="http://puddlegum.net/radiohead-01-and-10/" type="html">Ten years after OK Computer shocked the world, Radiohead released In Rainbows on October 10 (10/10).
