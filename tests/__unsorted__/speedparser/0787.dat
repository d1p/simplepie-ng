			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I tackled something that&#8217;s been surprisingly difficult for me to do. I made up &#8216;the plan&#8217; as in the birth plan.<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/09/01/the-plan/#footnote_0_757" id="identifier_0_757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ok, and I did have a rough draft messily written out on paper stuffed in my purse over the weekend. You know, just in case things started happening while we were in Seattle at PAX.">1</a></sup> Or, as the teacher for our birth classes liked to call them, my birth wishes. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have very clear ideas about what I want. You see, the big important things I can be decisive about. It&#8217;s just what to eat for dinner that seems to stump me daily.</p>
<p>Most of what went on the wish list doesn&#8217;t need to be shared here and I&#8217;ve no intention on sharing it with anyone unless they really want to know. However, there are some things about our plan &amp; wish list for baby-geekling that will extend beyond the labour and delivery process and will somewhat affect our friends and family. And I figured that this is a good venue to share what some of those wishes are.</p>
<p><strong>In the very beginning . . .</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The only person I want present during labour and delivery (excluding the trained medical staff) is Benevolance.</li>
<li>If you want to be on the phone-list to be notified when things start happening, let us know so we can get your info to the important people. Keep in mind that I tend to be the phone list keeper of our household and will be unable to be making all those phone calls. However, my sister will have the phone update duties, so if you want to be notified, you&#8217;ll need to let me know so I can get your information to her.  You might also want to let us know what milestones you want to be notified about (ie. when we go to the hospital, when the baby is actually born, etc.) and if you only want to be notified during certain hours of the day.</li>
<li>The only people we want visiting at the hospital are the baby-geekling&#8217;s grandparents.</li>
<li>And, we don&#8217;t really want a lot of visitors during the first week or so either.<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/09/01/the-plan/#footnote_1_757" id="identifier_1_757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again, except for the grandparents. And yes, we do realize this might not be a very popular choice, but that&amp;#8217;s ok.">2</a></sup> If you want to visit and meet baby ASAP, let one of us know and we&#8217;ll get in touch with you just as soon as we feel ready to handle company. Also, before you come over you <a href="http://offbeatmama.com/2011/07/guide-for-visiting-friends-with-new-baby?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OffbeatMama+%28Offbeat+Mama%29" target="_blank">MUST READ THIS ARTICLE</a>!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>A little later . . .</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Baby-geekling is eventually going to have his/her own screen name.<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/09/01/the-plan/#footnote_2_757" id="identifier_2_757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In fact, we started a contest to see who could come up with the best screen name at my baby shower. We probably won&amp;#8217;t pick the winner until baby is born, so if you want in on the potential of winning the $25 BC Liquor store gift card, get in touch.">3</a></sup> And it&#8217;s important to us that the baby be referred to only by its screen name online. That will include posts on this blog, references on twitter, &amp; references on Facebook or any other social media site.</li>
<li>No public photos. At all. Not even here on my blog.<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/09/01/the-plan/#footnote_3_757" id="identifier_3_757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="We&amp;#8217;ll definitely be sending out photos to people who want to see, but will be doing it in a secure &amp;amp; private manner.">4</a></sup> We&#8217;re asking all our friends and relatives to respect this and let us handle any and all photo distribution.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in a really DIY crafty kind of mood lately and having a lot of fun making things or thinking of different projects to work on in the future. I&#8217;ve also been in a very thrifty kind of mood too. We picked up a couple more of our favourite wooden cutting boards recently and they come with these wooden tags held on by some leather cord. The leather cord I plan on using to try out making one of these bracelets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone" style="margin: 5px;" title="Chan Luu wrap bracelet" src="http://www.madebylex.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/lg42bracelets.jpg" alt="Chan Luu wrap bracelet" width="320" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But the wooden tags I&#8217;m a little stumped about. Since they are actual wood I&#8217;m loathe to throw them in the garbage and they aren&#8217;t accepted in our recycling either. I can sense crafty/upcycling potential here, but I&#8217;m not sure exactly what to do with them. I could just paint them up and make them pretty, but I&#8217;d rather create something useful than just another decorative item.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone" style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6085/6024090889_3a14f7c79b_m.jpg" alt="Wooden tags" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Anyone have any ideas for useful ways to re-purpose these?</strong></p>

<li>Also, got blessed with a whole truck-load of hand-me-down baby stuff from my fabulous step-sister &amp; her family. Meaning we&#8217;re set for a crib, infant car seat, stroller, bassinet, various toys, bottles, &amp; a breast pump.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Leaving:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Tossing out more boxes of junk to be recycled: 1.5 boxes of books (though still not enough so that they all fit), some old stuffed toys, and a couple of boxes of old electronics.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Wishlist:</strong></div>
</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve been increasingly obsessed with getting new things for myself lately. Not sure if it&#8217;s just a case of me wanting things I can&#8217;t have, or if I&#8217;m just going through a selfish phase.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Tablet or eReader &#8211; can&#8217;t decide if I want an eReader or to go for a big fancy tablet. I&#8217;d originally thought I&#8217;d wait until my laptop died before replacing it with a tablet. But that will probably take a few years and I&#8217;m not sure that I can wait that long.</li>
<li>Jewelry &#8211; I have ethical issues with gemstones. But lately I&#8217;ve been wanting an infusion of new accessories. Maybe because it would be the only thing that would fit me now and would still fit after I have the baby?</li>
<li>New clothes &#8211; I&#8217;m tired of my limited wardrobe. If I could, I&#8217;d chuck out most of it and replace it with all new fabulous stuff. But for now, I&#8217;ve just got to make due.</li>
<li>Makeup &#8211; MAC&#8217;s got a new collection coming out and there are several things on my list for Sephora now too.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so here&#8217;s a quick post to show you what we decided to do with the nursery. Originally, this was a book/music room that ended up being a dumping spot for a lot of our miscellaneous stuff. We did several purges before this, but you can still see a lot of stuff sitting around that we ended up cleaning out.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5996917890_35b7367a3b_m.jpg" alt="Before" width="180" height="240" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6027/5996361329_9e758fd4fe_m.jpg" alt="Before" width="180" height="240" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5996358487_b16214192f_m.jpg" alt="Before" width="180" height="240" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/5996907518_9d38ebb7f7_m.jpg" alt="Before" width="180" height="240" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/5996904906_3623f50a84_m.jpg" alt="Before" width="180" height="240" /></p>
<p>We were even storing the vacuum in this room, as evidenced by the vacuum hose hanger still attached to that wall. We also had/have a full-size bookcase full of books. Some of them are children&#8217;s books, but there were a lot of other books there that will need to find other homes sooner or later. Sadly, in the process of moving boxes of books out of the room, I ended up over-doing it a bit and have had a strained back for the past week.</p>
<p>My very talented mother wanted to do the nursery painting, and we mostly just stood back and let her do her thing after telling her the theme we wanted. Anyway, here&#8217;s how the nursery looks now (no furniture yet) . . .</p>
<p><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5996309277_390ab00d5a_m.jpg" alt="After - Ghibli Mural" width="240" height="180" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6150/5996870252_01659084fe_m.jpg" alt="After - Ghibli Mural" width="240" height="180" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5996878808_603b851578_m.jpg" alt="After - Ghibli Mural" width="240" height="180" /><img style="margin: 5px;" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5996327031_0da0e751d4_m.jpg" alt="After - Ghibli Mural" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>We decided to go with a Ghibli theme using some of the characters from a few of the most &#8216;kid-friendly&#8217; films. We figured it worked perfectly for us since it&#8217;s a kid-friendly version of our overall household theme incorporating Asian and Steampunk elements. Here are some more detailed closeup shots . . .</p>

<p>Part of me is wondering if the original series was also this badly written and I just never noticed.</p>
<p>One of the things that irked me from the very start was when she mentioned a couple of pop songs at the beginning. It immediately dates the book, and unless it&#8217;s a song that will be well-known enough to last the ages, doesn&#8217;t convey any sort of mood or tone beyond the brief span of time when people would be able to recognize it. It added nothing to the scene or overall book.</p>
<p>Also, there was no real conflict in the book. Everything was solved by the main characters simply getting together and talking it out and there were no events in the book that really prevented them from doing so. The book used flashbacks and jumped between the characters in order to create false suspense. It was completely contrived and unsatisfying for the reader.</p>
<p>Also, the characters didn&#8217;t really seem to have clear motivations or goals.</p>

<p>Really enjoyed the book. I liked how the characters were mostly believable. The villains were a little bit cardboard, but for some stories, you just need a big, bad, evil dude at the end. They had their own motivations but were not very sympathetic at all. I&#8217;m wondering if the rest of the series will help to flesh out the world a bit more and perhaps give a better perspective to where they might have come from?</p>
<p>I also like the fact that this seems as though it will be a series of standalone-type stories that are loosely interlinked. Like some of <a class="zem_slink" title="Shannon Hale" href="http://www.squeetus.com" rel="homepage">Shannon Hale</a>&#8216;s work and <a class="zem_slink" title="China Miéville" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Mi%C3%A9ville" rel="wikipedia">China Mieville</a>&#8216;s, it&#8217;s nice to be able to come into the world again, but not be left dangling at the end of book one and needing to read book two before you get a complete story.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For my next reading challenge I&#8217;m tackling books that I already own, but for one reason or another, haven&#8217;t read yet. Some are books that I won in contests or giveaways. Others are books that Benevolance bought/had in his collection that I&#8217;ve been meaning to tackle. In order to keep focused, I rounded up a bunch and stacked them up on my nightstand so that I can work my way through them. I&#8217;m hoping that one or two of them aren&#8217;t worth keeping because we&#8217;re kind of looking to thin out our book collection at the moment. I&#8217;m setting up a new goodreads widget for the sidebar and might be blogging reviews if I have time. Just for fun, here&#8217;s a visual of the stack of books I gathered up.</p>

</a>Quite the variety, hunh? I&#8217;m starting off with Graceling and we&#8217;ll see where I go from there.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do reviews of individual books this time around, but if you want to see what I thought of a book, just click over to goodreads and most of them will have a star rating. My rating system works like this:</p>
<p>*= complete waste of paper &amp; I’m not sure why I even read it<br />
**= still pretty bad, but may have a redeeming quality or two. Would not recommend.<br />
***= glad I read it but I’m not likely to re-read it in the future. Would recommend to others to read.<br />
****= really enjoyed it, would re-read it if I have the chance and is definitely a book I’d recommend others read.<br />
***** = loved it, had a profound impact on me, want to re-read it, will probably purchase a copy (if I don’t have one already)</p>
<p><strong>Things I liked about this challenge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part of it took place in Mexico. There&#8217;s just something so fitting about reading romance novels while sitting in tropical breezes and sipping frozen drinks!</li>
<li>It was a really good mix of serious reading and escape reading.</li>
<li>It also helped to refine my reading tastes in the genre of romance. This genre is so huge with a lot of sub-genres that it really helped to have some time where I could try out different titles.</li>
<li>I also got help on this one too. Cait, from the last reading challenge, forwarded me a big list of a paranormal romance titles that were recommended by her friend Christine. I didn&#8217;t want to spend a bunch of money on the books so I was limited to what was available at my library and read quite a few as ebook formats.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Things I learned from this challenge:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I like paranormal romances.<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/07/14/r-r-reading-challenge-follow-up/#footnote_0_728" id="identifier_0_728" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="With the exception of vampire stuff. It just doesn&amp;#8217;t really appeal to me much. I&amp;#8217;ll make a rare exception if something is very well rated, or to check the hype. More likely to listen to an audiobook about it than to read through an actual book about vampires.">1</a></sup></li>
<li>I can handle a fair bit of cliched smut so long as there is still a good underlying plot to it.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s going to have a historical aspect to it, it better be well researched &amp; historically accurate. I&#8217;ll suspend a little disbelief if the attitudes of the characters are modernized a bit, but at least be consistent with it.</li>
<li>Characters. Must. Be. Consistent. And. Realistic. This is a big one for me. I won&#8217;t specifically call anyone out, but if you&#8217;ve got a woman, and a man comes at her with a sword, her first thought isn&#8217;t going to be about how attractive the sword-bearer is.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/625.Nora_Roberts" target="_blank">Nora Roberts</a> books. I may even branch out into her non-paranormal books and/or non-trilogy books one of these days.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here goes one last installment in my mid-year review.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t really talked about it much on the blog, but one of the areas in which I wanted to set some goals this year was <strong>Adventure</strong>. At the beginning of the year we had tentatively planned on making several shorter trips this year including: a steampunk convention in Arizona, crashing a wedding in Mexico, a stagette trip to LA, and another wedding celebration to Las Vegas. We ended up nixing all but the trip to Mexico. As we started planning the rest, circumstances just kept coming up to make them more difficult. Plus, when we found out I was pregnant, we had concerns about the radiation levels of the TSA scanners. The alternative option of having someone pat me down weren&#8217;t very appealing after hearing many stories about how invasive it actually is. In retrospect, we&#8217;re very happy with all of our travel choices. Plus, we do have one last adventure planned this summer . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend PAX!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll be very pregnant when we go, but so long as I&#8217;m still feeling as good as I do now, I shouldn&#8217;t have any problem attending<sup><a href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/07/13/2011-mid-year-review-pt4/#footnote_0_721" id="identifier_0_721" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="though I will be making a lot more frequent bathroom stops this year!!!">1</a></sup>. We&#8217;re looking forward to picking up a giant pitcher of dice. I&#8217;m going to keep my eyes open for any must-have geek-baby gear as well. Definitely looking forward to a weekend away to check out all the latest gaming stuff :)</p>
<p>Finally in the realm of <strong>Finance</strong> I think we&#8217;ve also made some good progress so far this year. I actually started up a Money Club and we&#8217;re working towards a savings goal that will ideally be a chunk of money against our mortgage. My overall purpose for this category was to have a better sense of control over our finances and doing the money club is definitely helping me in this respect.</p>
<p>When I started doing this little review, I felt kinda bad about my progress on my goals. Especially lately where any planning seems a little pointless because I know this huge life-altering event is going to happen in just a couple of months and change everything. Plus, a lot of goals I did set for myself this year didn&#8217;t see completion because having a baby does take over a certain portion of your brain, body, and life.</p>
<p>Looking back after typing everything up I&#8217;m feeling much better though. Despite all the changes of plans, I still feel like I&#8217;ve managed to accomplish a lot this year. Plus, I didn&#8217;t really touch on a lot of the other things we did, goals made and met, BECAUSE we&#8217;re having a baby. It&#8217;ll be very interesting to get to the end of the year and do my final review. One caveat readers . . . expect that one to have more than 4 parts to it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing on my mid-year review, let&#8217;s jump into some academics . . .</p>
<p>My <strong>Reading</strong> goals are the only ones where I&#8217;ve made any real progress lately. My <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/challenges/2-2011-reading-challenge" target="_blank">Goodreads challenge </a>was to read 30 books this year and I&#8217;ve already read 25. I&#8217;ve also done <a title="Cait’s Reading Challenge Extravaganza!" href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/01/08/caits-reading-challenge-extravaganza/" target="_blank">Cait&#8217;s Reading Challenge</a> and am just wrapping up the <a title="My R&amp;R Reading Challenge" href="http://jennerosity.org/2011/05/08/my-rr-reading-challenge/" target="_blank">R&amp;R Reading challenge</a>. I&#8217;m part-way through a baby/parenting book that I&#8217;ll finish off soon.  I also just finished another romance ebook I downloaded from the library and put the third book in the series on hold.  And I even know what my next (and possibly final) reading challenge of 2011 will be!</p>
<ul>
<li>I will endeavor to read books that I own, but have not yet read</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, it&#8217;s the &#8216;Own But Haven&#8217;t Read&#8217; reading challenge. I figure this is a good challenge to tackle before baby arrives, when I might not have as much time for reading as I used to. Plus, I&#8217;m so busy now that I don&#8217;t have a lot of extra time to stop by the library to pick books up. And there are lots of books that I have in my collection but haven&#8217;t yet read, so I know I won&#8217;t be lacking for material. I&#8217;ll definitely have my progress on goodreads and I&#8217;ll try to do a few blog post book reviews as I read them.</p>
<p>The flip-side of progress is stagnation. Which sums up my <strong>Writing </strong>progress nicely. Not a word or any progress whatsoever. And I&#8217;m not setting any goals for this quarter either.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to blog as much since my wrists have been bothering me more than usual thanks to pregnancy side effects.</p>
<p>I started the year with some separate and lofty <strong>Job </strong>goals too. And made pretty decent progress. I finished the Human Resources Management Course and loved it! But then most of my other job goals got nixed or made irrelevant by &#8216;the powers that be&#8217; at my job. My final job goal was to get the necessary licensing credits for my 2012 license renewal before going on maternity leave. And as of today, that&#8217;s also done :) Now my lofty goals for my job are to just clean out and bring home my personal stuff. Since my computer terminal is getting upgraded sometime I&#8217;m not even too worried about un-modifying my personal setup (though I will have to remember to send some digital files home and/or delete them).</p>
