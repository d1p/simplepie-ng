<p>SFD medics responded to the scene and transported the victim to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p>The suspect was gone upon officers&#8217; arrival in the area however, a search for the suspect continues.</p>
<p>The suspect is described as a thin white male in his 30&#8242;s, 5&#8217;7&#8243;, brown hair, wearing a Seattle Seahawks jersey and dark-colored pants.  He ran southbound from the shooting location and possibly got into a silver Jaguar sedan near Boylston Avenue and Pike Street.  The vehicle fled westbound. </p>
<p>Both the suspect and the silver Jaguar remain at large. </p>
<p>Anyone with information about this incident or who may know the identity or whereabouts of the suspect is asked to call 911 or Seattle Police immediately.  Anonymous tips are welcome.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2011/10/02/two-officers-assaulted-at-collision-scene-investigation/"><![CDATA[<p>On October 2nd at approximately 3:00 a.m. two female West Precinct officers were working traffic control posts at the scene of the earlier Hit and Run vehicle/pedestrian collision in the 1600 block of 15th Avenue West.  The officers were blocking vehicular traffic for southbound 15<sup>th</sup> Avenue West and eastbound off the Magnolia Bridge while additional officers blocked other traffic patterns so the Traffic Collision Investigation Squad (TCIS) detectives could safely process the scene and conduct their investigation.  Northbound 15th Avenue West vehicular traffic was completely shut down. </p>
<p>An adult female suspect along with another female friend arrived near the collision scene in a cab that was blocked from going any further.  Both subjects got out of the cab and began to walk down the middle of 15<sup>th</sup> Avenue West. </p>
<p>The suspect was repeatedly screaming vulgarities specifically directed at the officers as she walked along.  The two female subjects walked up to and past one of the TCIS detectives taking measurements of the collision scene and then started to walk towards the actual crime scene when they were told by a detective that they needed to be on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The friend (2nd subject) complied with the detective&#8217;s directive but the suspect continued to scream profanities while completely disregarding the detective&#8217;s  lawful order.  A patrol officer stopped the suspect and tried to explain to her that there was an on-going criminal investigation being conducted and showed her another route she could take to get around the crime scene.</p>
<p>The suspect responded by screaming profanities at the officer and continued to walk on, subsequently knocking over a piece of measuring equipment used by the TCIS detectives.  The officer grabbed the suspect by the arm to prevent her from walking through the crime scene.  The suspect responded by punching the officer in the face, knocking her to the ground.  The suspect then jumped on top of the officer and attempted to strike her some more.</p>
<p>A second officer ran over to assist and was assaulted as well.  A TCIS detective then ran over to assist and the suspect was taken into custody. </p>
<p>The two involved female patrol officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries. </p>
<p>The adult female suspect was booked into the King County Jail for felony assault (two counts of Assault on an Officer).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A witness followed the suspect for a distance reporting the suspect&#8217;s vehicle description and license plate to Seattle Police dispatch.  The witness lost sight of the suspect but a North Precinct patrol officer located the suspect driving northbound on 15<sup>th</sup> Avenue NW near NW 59th Street. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The suspect pulled into an unknown person&#8217;s driveway in an apparent attempt to throw off the police car following him.  It didn’t work.  The officer contacted the suspect and placed him under arrest. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SFD medics responded to the collision scene and transported the victim to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traffic Collision Investigation Squad (TCIS) detectives responded to both the collision scene and the scene of the arrest to inspect the suspect&#8217;s vehicle and impound it for further processing.  TCIS detectives were at the site of the collision investigating and processing the scene for several hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The adult male suspect was booked into the King County Jail for Investigation of Vehicular Assault, a felony.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This remains an active and on-going TCIS investigation.</p>

<p>September 28th, 2011</p>
<p>It has been nearly 10 years since a killer stood outside the Seattle home of Tom Wales and fired several shots from a handgun through a basement window, killing the assistant U.S. attorney and father of two while he worked at his desk.</p>
<table border="0" align="right">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> </th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since that time, the FBI and our law enforcement partners have dedicated themselves to finding those responsible for the murder. Now, as the 10th anniversary of the killing approaches on October 11, we are announcing a new media campaign to again ask for the public’s assistance. </p>
<p>“This is an active case in which we are constantly and aggressively pursuing leads,” said Greg Fowler, the FBI inspector in charge of the task force investigating the murder. “Information is the key,” Fowler added, “and the better the information, the greater the chance of finding those responsible.”</p>
<p>Wales, a prosecutor who specialized in white-collar crime cases, was shot at 10:40 p.m. It has been reported that a lone male suspect was observed leaving the scene.</p>
<p>“We know information about the crime is still out there,” Fowler said. “We know there are people who—because of fear, doubt, or other reasons—have not yet come forward.  Regardless of the reasons, now is the time to come forward. Now is the time to tell us what you know. Now is the time to help us solve this crime.”</p>
<table border="0" align="right">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> </th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>During the next few weeks, residents in the Seattle region will see and hear a variety of print, broadcast, and billboard advertisements regarding the Wales investigation and the reward of up to $1 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. In addition, detailed information about the case will be available on our website and our social media outlets, including Facebook.</p>
<p>“There are those who may not even know their information is important,” Fowler said, explaining the need for the media campaign. “Something seen, something heard, something out of place, something unusual—even the smallest clue may help.”</p>
<p>Special Agent Russ Fox, who has been supervising the investigation for the past two years, added that the 10th anniversary of the murder is a natural point to “renew the public’s interest in the investigation.” Fox noted that the murder took place exactly one month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which should help people remember that time period.</p>
<p>Fox acknowledged that the case has special significance because Wales was a federal prosecutor and a partner to law enforcement. “But he was also a neighbor, a father, and a member of our community.”</p>
<p>The FBI, the Seattle Police Department, the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, and the Department of Justice—which form the Seattle Prosecutor Murder Task Force—“are still fully committed to this case,” Fox said.</p>
<p>“The murder of Tom Wales was more than a single act of violence against an individual,” Fowler added. “It was a crime that impacted many, but no one more than his family. Tom Wales left behind a legacy and a life that cannot be replaced. We remain confident that, with the public’s help, we will find those responsible and bring them to justice.”</p>
<p>If you have any information about the case, there are three ways you can contact the FBI, all of which are confidential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call  800-CALL FBI;</li>
<li>E-mail <a href="mailto:walestips@ic.fbi.gov">walestips@ic.fbi.gov</a>; or</li>
<li>Send a letter to P.O. Box 2755, Seattle, WA 98111</li>
</ul>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2011/09/28/spd-and-target-team-up-to-help-families-prepare/"><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday, 100 families will become better prepared for disasters and other emergencies, thanks to a generous donation by Target. The event is part of National Preparedness Month, encouraging people to take necessary steps to ensure their homes, workplaces and communities are ready for disaster.</p>
<p>The Seattle Police Department’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and Target will co-host the event, set for 9 a.m. at the West Seattle Target, located in Westwood Village. Each family will receive a gift card for up to $100 that they will use to build their family emergency kits. All families have been notified in advance and pre-registered for the event. Target employees, Seattle police officers and OEM staff will provide assistance throughout the store.</p>

<p>On August 31st, Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna and 45 other attorneys general sent a letter to Backpage.com calling for information about the company’s stated efforts to delete advertisements for sex trafficking, particularly those that could involve minors. The attorneys general cited growing concerns of those in law enforcement that minors and others are increasingly advertised for sex on the site. Since the original announcement, two states – New York and New Jersey – have added their names to the list of those concerned. A total of 51 attorneys general, representing 48 states and three territories, are now a part of the effort. Seven Washington State mayors have also called on Backpage.Com to change their policies.</p>
<p> On September 27, the attorneys general released Backpage.com’s refusal to change their existing policies, which the Seattle Police Department have identified as an accelerant for the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p> “In light of Backpage.com’s response to the 51 attorneys general, I’d like to update you on our efforts rescue children from being sexually exploited on Backpage.com,” said Mayor Mike McGinn. “On Thursday September 22, while Backpage.com was drafting its lengthy rationalization of their practices, our High Risk Victims Unit participated in a task force operation in SeaTac. We recovered three female children who were being advertised for sex on Backpage.com. Rescuing children from being sexually exploited is a top priority for our police department, but we can never get ahead of this crime while a company like Backpage.com profits from the sexual exploitation of children and uses their newsrooms to minimize the extent of the issue.</p>
<p> This is unacceptable. How many more children will be exploited for profit on Backpage.com before this company changes their policies?”</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2011/09/28/wanted-robbery-suspect-inside-surrounded-residence/"><![CDATA[<p>On September 27th at approximately 7:39 p.m. Seattle Police Gang Unit detectives were out conducting field investigations in South Seattle when they spotted a known convicted felon in a 1994 black BMW.  Gang detectives had information that this particular suspect was in possession of a firearm and attempted to initiate a traffic stop. </p>
<p>The suspect failed to yield to the detectives and a pursuit was initiated (the Gang Unit detectives were driving a black Ford Crown Victoria police car with subdued Seattle Police markings and fully equipped with lights and siren).</p>
<p>The suspect vehicle drove into an apartment complex parking lot in the 12600 block of 68th Avenue South where it collided into an occupied, parked vehicle.  Neither of the two occupants of the victim vehicle were injured.</p>
<p>Two suspects then exited the black BMW and fled the crash scene on foot.  A canine unit track for the suspects was negative.  Seattle Police and allied law enforcement agencies conducted an area search for the suspects.  </p>
<p>A King County Sheriff&#8217;s Office deputy spotted the primary suspect in a residence in the 12600 block of Beacon Avenue South and called for assistance (the other suspect from the vehicle remains at large).  Seattle Police Patrol, Gang, and Canine units responded to the scene. </p>
<p>Officers surrounded the residence and Seattle Police SWAT team officers and negotiators were called to the scene to assist.  Multiple subjects exited the residence and were interviewed by officers.  The only remaining person believed to still be inside the residence was the wanted suspect. </p>
<p>The suspect has an outstanding warrant for his arrest for a robbery he committed where he implied a firearm.</p>
<p>Negotiators made multiple attempts to get the suspect to exit the residence and surrender.  After the suspect ignored all of those requests, the SWAT team made entry at approximately 3:30 a.m. and located the suspect in a crawl space. </p>
<p>SWAT team officers took the suspect into custody without further incident.  The SWAT team continues to clear the residence at this time.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old male suspect will be booked into the King County Jail on the robbery warrant.  Additional charges may be forthcoming.</p>
<p>This remains an active and on-going Seattle Police Gang Unit investigation.</p>
