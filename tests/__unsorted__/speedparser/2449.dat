<p>A lot of my previous articles talked about love and heartache.  Writing about them was a sort of way to release some emotion and it helped me understand the relationship and eventually heal.  It took some time, yes, but it can be done.  In fact I found &#8216;the one&#8217;/my twin flame.  My husband.  But before that let me share with you that I ultimately had to come to the decision that I wanted a lasting true romance where there was unconditional love and ditch the &#8216;whatever I can get&#8217; mentality.  I had to realize that I freakin&#8217; was worthy and deserved those amazing relationships that only seemed but a myth.  And then after that moment of clarity, I had to show what I wanted to myself.  Yes, I had to learn how to love myself.  See, before you could experience true love, you have to love yourself.  Sounds simple but for many people including myself, it proved to be rather difficult.  When you grow up not having not much of a self-esteem or had been abused in some form or another, loving yourself becomes a challenge.  Hell, it doesn&#8217;t even factor in at all.  I used to seek out love and really bend and twist for someone to love me.  And when they liked me or &#8220;loved&#8221; me it became an obsession to keep that love, that feeling of ecstasy to flow towards me at all times.  And when the partner stopped reciprocating or didn&#8217;t reciprocate in the way I wanted, then down depression road I went.  In short, I became co-dependent.  I <em>needed</em> that &#8220;love&#8221; like I needed crack.  In retrospect, that wasn&#8217;t true love.  Because true love consists of two whole people who overflow their own love to one another &#8212; not one siphoning affection from the other.  Anyway, I read the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/purpleversesc-20/detail/0931580706">Peter McWilliams book Love 101</a> to learn that the greatest love comes from you and only you.  So I started doing things on my own and enjoying my own company.  And the funny thing is when I finally liked doing those things, shortly after I met my husband, AND I had no intention of meeting any one that night I went out with one of my girlfriends.  I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is when you want that somebody special in your life, you can&#8217;t be desperately seeking it.  You got to just be happy on your own and the universe just brings you together at the right time.  Also, I had a lot of faith and I just knew that everything&#8217;s okay and I would meet him at the right time.  Oh and what stood out between my husband from the rest was that my relationship with him was just easy.  Caring and loving each other just came with great ease.  I never was needing that love from him.  It just flowed between us naturally.  There is some wisdom to that old adage, &#8220;you know when you&#8217;ll know.&#8221;  Trust me.  There is great love for you (from you and from your <strong>soul mate</strong>)!  Check out the video below b/c this I also used to get me to clarity about finding a true lasting relationship.</p>

<p>So I talked to my older sister recently.  She was talking about wanting to change careers, possibly start her own business. Currently she is a  registered nurse and makes very good money.  However, it was never her dream to become a nurse.  In fact it was our parent&#8217;s dream. My parents instilled in her the notion of pragmatism when it came to careers.  &#8220;Be a nurse or be a doctor or something in the medical field because it is a sure route to making good money.&#8221; I think they said something along those lines.  I for one ditched their belief and went on my own path&#8230; a creative path that has yet to see monetary rewards. Yet, I think I&#8217;m happier than her.  She told me during our conversation that she didn&#8217;t really know her passion.  I asked her did she still have some burning childhood desire/dream within her.  She replied, &#8220;no.&#8221;  Okay&#8230; &#8220;What gets you going right now and makes you excited,&#8221; I asked. No response.  Wow was it really possible for someone to not have a dream?!  I guess I&#8217;ve been in this entertainment town called Los Angeles far too long (b/c here everyone and I mean EVERYONE&#8217;s got a dream).  After much probing, my sister did mention her fiance wanted to open up a Greek restaurant (the guy is Greek so it&#8217;s quite fitting).  But then I thought isn&#8217;t that <em>his</em> dream?  Anyway, she finally revealed that her dream is to be ridiculously rich and have a good life.  Okay fair enough.  And I told her: <strong>Your Dreams Are Worthy!</strong>  So are everyone else&#8217;s dreams really.  So going back to this idea of attaining the good life and her fiance wanting to open up a restaurant.  I asked her do you know anything about running a restaurant??? Or a business?  She&#8217;s a nurse so I know she can take good care of her clients <img src='http://purpleverses.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .  But seriously, if she wants to achieve her dreams she&#8217;s got to have a game plan. So that&#8217;s when I told her it&#8217;s time to take action.  And I&#8217;m not saying to achieve that goal within a week. I&#8217;m talking baby steps.  I told her to pick up or buy a book on running a business and/or running a restaurant.  I felt she needed to start expanding her mind first because all she knows is nursing and also listening to mom and dad.  See, to be a successful entrepreneur (or successful anything) you gotta have the guts, drive and resolve to go against the status quo to realize your dreams. You can dream but sooner or later you gotta take that action towards it.  And again it doesn&#8217;t have to be all done by next week.  One step at a time.  Anyway, my sister thanked me profusely on giving her the idea to read a book on starting a business. Funny though, I would think that would be the first logical step someone would take in her position &#8212; <strong>research.</strong> And if after researching through books, magazines, or the internet you are still convinced that&#8217;s the path you should take then the I would recommend interviewing people who have <strong>made it successfully</strong> in that particular field.  I have talked to many successful people in my field and it&#8217;s only inspired me and pushed me to become better at my craft and finish projects.  So yeah talking to people in the field really helps motivate oneself.  To find these people, you can attend seminars, panels, networking events, go though your career center at school, asking your own network for referrals, etc.  The possibilities are endless. Really, if you&#8217;re serious and you put it out there and take action when the inspiration occurs, the universe will bring the right people and opportunities at you.  No sweat.  It&#8217;s up to you to grab them.  Just remember: <strong>Your Dreams Are Worthy!!!</strong></p>

<p>Tomorrow is my birthday.</p>
<p>&#8230;And I, finally, am turning 21.</p>
<p>Another date signifying that I have lived x amount of days and survived y amount of years. Its a wonderful feeling to look back and see the kind of life I&#8217;ve lived.  Each person I&#8217;ve encountered, all the things I&#8217;ve done, and everything that I&#8217;ve ever felt, saw, or said is a pretty accurate summation of my current state of being.</p>
<p>After all, birthdays are just reminders of how far you&#8217;ve come&#8230;and also how completely clueless about life you still are. The whole, &#8220;you&#8217;re another year wiser&#8221; saying may or may not be applicable for everyone. In all honesty, tomorrow I will wake up feeling exactly the same as I did the day before: tired yet hopeful (Tired mostly due to me getting my ass kicked at the gym. Hopeful because I hope and pray that my body will recover). But when does the wisdom part kick in? The part where you know now not to make the same mistakes or have a clearer vision of your future than before&#8211; when does that happen? Is it somewhere between the many birthday shots or the morning after with the ever present hangover? No, I am assuming that the wisdom and the answers to all of life&#8217;s questions will come later&#8211;MANY birthdays later. Because right now, I am turning 21 and the only answers I can provide are to pop culture trivia and who is Blair Waldorf&#8217;s favorite actress (Audrey Hepburn, by the way). But I&#8217;ve also wised up to a few things: sleep when you can, exercise is good, if you wear leggings make sure the shirt you are wearing appropriately covers your butt, and never take yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>So for now, I&#8217;ll leave the answers to the wiser, slightly older folks. I&#8217;m sure they will be more than happy to tell you what and what not to do. And as for me, well, I may not have all of life&#8217;s answers, but I have all the ones I need right now. So tomorrow, I will continue to enjoy my life and all of its blessings. But most importantly, I will definitely enjoy my 21st birthday and hope a <em>little</em> wisdom comes my way. Cheers.</p>

<p>Faith.  It&#8217;s a seemingly heated topic these days.  Or perhaps it was always that way.  So what is faith?  The two definitions I want to work with here are 1: confidence or trust in a person or thing AND 2:belief that is not based on proof.  I can honestly admit that I have always struggled with faith.  On a personal level, I have been doubtful of my abilities in the past and I sure as hell have suffered from low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence.  On an interpersonal level, I have distrusted even my closest allies, loved ones, and family members.  When it came to boyfriends, I had some huge jealousy and trust issues which in essence, came from my almost non-existent self-esteem at the time.  And on a more macro level, I definitely doubted the ability of God/the Universe to come through on my prayers and requests.  Even worse, I had come to the point of not believing in humankind any longer; that this world has come to its point of no return and on its way down the shitter.  But that my friends, was the PAST.  I can honestly believe and say that I have a renewed sense of faith.  A faith in which even when it&#8217;s seemingly dark or things are down, I don&#8217;t completely fall apart like I used to.  </p>
<p>So how did I get to this point when I had hit rock bottom on the faith scale?  Well, it wasn&#8217;t easy.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t impossible.  In 2005-2006, I was at my darkest and lowest point.  My secret best friend was Jack D.  I had an affinity for the sweet powder sugar that stained my pillows scarlet, and I popped cutting edge pharmaceuticals that were <em>supposed</em> to help me like they were Altoids.  However, around the same time, I was introduced to the woman that probably saved my life.  She was my therapist.  And that was the start of finally coming clean and rebuilding my faith once again (Note: I say &#8216;rebuilding&#8217; because I used to have faith and a lot of it when I was younger.  A series of events in childhood and my adolescence finally culminated to the dark point where I was at).   Anyway, my dear therapist introduced me to some insightful self-help and spiritual material and really instated within me the idea of rose-colored glasses, or optimism.  To be honest, every time she talked about seeing the glass half-full or seeing the world through rose-colored lenses, I scoffed at her.  I mean, I could&#8217;ve sworn that her glasses were actually tinted a rose color.  So how was <em>I</em> to possibly see the same way as her?  It seemed like a long shot.  But I wasn&#8217;t forced to go see her.  I went on my own accord.  I willingly went.  Because at the end of the day, I knew somewhere deep down inside of me, I wanted to get better.  I wanted to see the world a better place.  I didn&#8217;t know how it was going to happen but I knew what I wanted.  I mean I must have wanted to get better even with all the thoughts and threats of suicide, or I wouldn&#8217;t be here writing this right now.  And it&#8217;s that thing that burned inside of me that kept me have just an ounce of faith.  An ounce that would eventually turn into a river.  And yes, that river is flowing.</p>
<p>I am at the point right now where I do have lots of faith.  Yes, I still have worries and anxieties pop up from time to time.  But through practice and patience, I have learned the art of letting go.  Lots of people want to be able to know <em>how</em> things are going to work out and inadvertently inundate themselves with fear or worry.  That I have learned is what breaks down the faith.  What happens is that people don&#8217;t believe in themselves that they can do something or worse need proof that it&#8217;s on its way.  How faith and manifesting works is that it really is a catch-22.  You can&#8217;t have it until you let go.  And maybe people have a difficulty in grasping what that really means (I sure did&#8230;or do).  It doesn&#8217;t mean that if you let go, you don&#8217;t want it anymore or it&#8217;s of no importance.  Quite the opposite.  It just means that you don&#8217;t worry or fear anymore&#8230;you let go of all negative thoughts and feelings associated with it.  Just let go and let the river flow.  </p>
<p>And there is a beauty to all of this.  I have witnessed that when your faith is unwavering and at an upmost high (you have already let go), the proof comes flowing right to you with little or no effort at all.  This proof or <em>sign</em> reinforces your belief/faith little by little.  The more you acknowledge even the littlest of signs, the bigger ones come crashing at your door&#8230;until one day, BAM!  You finally get what you&#8217;re praying for.   And that my friend is your <strong>miracle</strong>.</p>
<p>Be Strong.  Have Faith.</p>

<p>My good girlfriend just introduced me to this Buddhist chant.  I have done Hindu chants/mantras, so I already know the science and philosophy behind them.  And yeah they do work. It&#8217;s all about the sound as sound is the fundamental thing in the universe.  It permeates your being, your chakras, subconscious, and essence and transforms your life.  She gave an example on how this chant has helped her numerous times.  When she first moved out to Los Angeles, she moved in with her boyfriend.  That didn&#8217;t work out so she needed to live elsewhere.  Well thru chanting, she eventually got a good place with another girl (which actually is my friend from college).  Then her job came next, and her current employer, Honda, found her&#8230;so she didn&#8217;t even need to apply to them.  And now she has a great new car when before she had to ride the bus for hours to get around.  Really it&#8217;s an inspiring story. </p>
<p>I believe everything happens for a reason and the fact that she gave this to me especially at this point in my life where I&#8217;m seeking change is quite significant.  And I found this chant on youtube with Tina Turner doing it.  And boy was I blown away.  I felt tingling on my body.  Then when I finally did it myself, I felt its power.  There&#8217;s definitely a divine energy within those sounds.    Here&#8217;s a nice video chant of NAM MYOHO RENGE KYO.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the saying that we are all the same?  That the essential part of me is the essential part of you?  Yes, I agree that we are made of stars.  But go down even deeper and some may say that we are all interconnected.  We are ONE <em>soul</em>.  Now do I believe this?  Yes.  In fact, you could think of it as one soul or mind having different interpretations.  Thus, you have your own life that you see with your &#8220;eyes&#8221; as I have the same.  We are one.  </p>
<p>However, life for the most part (at least in the capitalistic society I live in) seems so fragmented and that people are busy being divided and living individualistically rather than as part of a whole.  Unfortunately, these types of attitudes get people and societies in trouble as they argue and in the end battle each other for their elusive gold (and kill each other and destroy the Earth while at it).  The reason why people act in such ways that ultimately divide is because the ego-self is in control.  Now what is the ego-self or ego, you may ask?  It is the part of us that constantly thinks and constantly needs reaffirming of its own existence.  It is the part that says &#8220;I&#8221; and creates the illusion of your identity and your individualism.  Thus, its very nature is to always create divisions, labels and non-unity (which leads to all sorts of problems for humankind). </p>
<p>Yet it seems to be a pipe dream for everyone to let go of their ego and start working as a whole for the betterment of humankind.  Well not entirely.  You see, if everyone is really the same thing and is just one thing, then dissolving your own ego would be suffice for the betterment of all.  There&#8217;s a beautiful and true adage that says: <strong>as above, so below.</strong>  This means that everything is a microcosm or macrocosm of something.  Or another way to put it is that you can put forth change in the universe by changing your own universe (your own mind).  A lot of people (including myself) have believed that the universe is of effect, meaning that what happened, happened and you are just a product of all things forth and had nothing to do with it (a very victim mentality).  Well, I have learned that you have everything to do with it.  In fact, you created everything that&#8217;s happening to you and that will always happen to you.  It is a causal place so that whatever you do has an effect&#8211;simply cause and effect.  So once you change how you see the world, then everything else changes with it&#8211;sort of like a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Now how do you change how you see the world?  Well, I really like how Eckart Tolle explains in his book, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/purpleversesc-20/detail/0452289963">A New Earth</a>.  He basically says that in order to dissolve the ego, you first need to become aware of your thoughts and emotions.  The reason for this is that you typically identify yourself with your thoughts and emotions (<em>I am hungry.  I am happy.  I am sad</em>).  But that is false.  You are not your emotions or any of your thoughts.  You are divine presence.  And when you become aware of yourself thinking these thoughts, then they are no longer identified with you because you are outside of them.  Then you realize you are much more and much deeper than what you formerly thought you were.  You are timeless, divine being.  </p>
<p>A step further, you come to the realization that not only is your individual self/body an illusion but everyone else is too.  I mean isn&#8217;t there only ONE?  How can there be a bunch of &#8220;individual&#8221; persons or souls out there?  Well, folks, that&#8217;s the GRAND ILLUSION or <em>maya</em>.  So whatever you do or say to another is really toward or about yourself; thus, unconditional love is crucial.  Once you come to this awareness, then you are able to break free and advance spiritually to become enlightened.  It&#8217;s not going to be an easy road.  Trust me, I am consistently practicing and sometimes (or a lot of the times) the ego finds ways to creep back in and messes you up.  But I keep trying and everyday I learn and am more aware and grow as a result.  I know achieving true peace of mind is eternal and just plain worth it <img src='http://purpleverses.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>In the past week, I have had to reprimand my best friend and cousin about something I think a lot of women (and maybe even men) do to themselves.  They sabotage their happiness due to someone else not responding in the way they want them to.  In more or less words, they are still stuck on their EXES.  Which leads them to being stuck in the past, meaning they aren&#8217;t able to grow and become who they really are.  I have seen this with myself and I have seen it in countless others: people get so wrapped around their significant other that somehow their happiness is dependent on them.  And I have had to learn the hard way but this is absolutely absurd and even dangerous. It is absurd because true happiness comes from within and not from an external source; it is dangerous because one could easily fall into depression if one depends on another for their source of happiness.  Trust me, no one will ever do things exactly the way you want them to each and every time&#8211;people make mistakes and are human.  But what happens is that when one gets in a relationship, one can end up having expectations that aren&#8217;t realistic.  So many times we expected our guy to text us every hour on the hour or to read our minds that we don&#8217;t want them to go out with their buddies tonight.  Oh and even worse is when we prematurely start thinking he&#8217;s the one and we start making <em>plans</em>.  Yeah ladies, you know what plans I&#8217;m talking about!  So yeah, we have these unrealistic expectations and when they are not met, we go haywire.  Okay but let me backtrack a little.  Before he (or she or fill in the blank) starts sucking at life, he did make you somewhat happy.  I mean how the hell did you guys get together in the first place?  I&#8217;m pretty sure you were happy in the beginning.  He called you.   He made you dinner.  Life was damn good.  But the weeks and months roll by and true colors show.  He wants to hang out with his buddies.  He wants to focus on his career.  Then suddenly that lovely feeling of elation you had at the very beginning takes a nosedive.  And then the inevitable happens.  You guys break up.  And then you cry.  A lot.  But no worries&#8211;there is <a href="http://purpleverses.com/2009/07/11/hope-for-the-heart-the-evidence/">hope for the heart</a>!  First of all, ending a relationship (whether a long-term or pseudo) is the first step to liberation.  This is a crucial time where you can assess his behavior, and better yet, <em>your</em> behavior.  Yes, your behavior.  Think about it.  How many times did you get sad because he didn&#8217;t do something the way you wanted him to?  How many times have you cried because he just didn&#8217;t get you&#8211;or worse forgotten important dates like your birthday!?  How many times did your heart skip every time you received a damn text or wall comment on facebook (didn&#8217;t you just love the fact that everyone knew you were his girl?!)?  For crying out loud, how many times did he make or break your day by doing whatever the heck he did?  Do you see where I&#8217;m heading here?  It&#8217;s really very simple.  People end up unhealthily attaching themselves to another and end up losing their identity in the process.  Thus, their emotions become intertwined with the actions or responses of their other half.  And that is why when a break-up occurs, the person who depended on their partner for their happiness gets royally screwed.  Since their partner can no longer be a part of their life, that person ends up suffering because he or she forgot how to be okay on his or her own.  And even when the relationship no longer exists, some exes keep in touch way too much with their broken-hearted that the suffering party is restricted of their freedom and true happiness since they are hooked on to the false sense of relief that the manipulation brings. </p>
<p>So how do you protect yourself from ever depending on someone else for your happiness?  Simple.  You just have to learn how to be happy on your own.  Don&#8217;t like being on your own?  Well you got to at least try.  It really isn&#8217;t that bad.  I used to hate doing things on my own.  And then I realized how pathetic that was.  Seriously there are people who are so co-dependent that doing things that are actually supposed to be done on their own aren&#8217;t even an option.  I won&#8217;t even try to list those things.  But yes, you have to try.  I recommend finding a hobby or a passion that you can do on your own.  When you&#8217;re in tune with what you really want to do in life and actually pursue it, then most of the bullshit fades away.  I know this from experience because when I&#8217;m in the zone from doing my passion, I ain&#8217;t lonely or sad.  Not one bit.  And when you keep yourself busy with what you want to do, you don&#8217;t even have the time to worry about insignificant matters.  Oh and friends do help.  But then again, you shouldn&#8217;t depend on them either for true happiness.  Definitely appreciate them for their support but make sure you are completely self-sufficient and whole.  In that way, you aren&#8217;t sucking on people&#8217;s energy in order to fill up yours (this is what we call &#8216;needy&#8217;).  Lastly, a true and time-tested approach to feeling good is by simply helping others.  Help others in need.  Donate unused clothing and goods to your charity.  Tutor disadvantaged youth.  Assist the elderly.  Be a lending ear or shoulder to cry on.  Anytime you help anyone in any way, your spirit is lifted.  Therefore, make it a natural part of your existence to reach out to others.  Remember, your happiness is up to you, and only you.  That I can say with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>Jealousy. Now the word doesn&#8217;t exactly have the most positive connotations, but it can, if harnessed properly.</p>
<p>After graduating from college I went in search of jobs, even though I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what I wanted to do. Summer passed and my energies were scattered, still not sure where I was going or what was going to make me happy. A good friend of mine however, a year younger and still in school had an amazing internship lined up in the field of work that I love, broadcast journalism. She was going to work for a major news network covering local and world news. My question (or rather fear), was how had she managed to come so far but not me?  </p>
<p>We had a lot in common this friend and I, and I value her dearly, but at the time I was so jealous of her. She was younger and already had her feet firmly planted in the ground. She was off to a great start in a field that I am equally passionate about. I certainly felt left behind, and had that &#8220;not good enough&#8221; feeling brewing inside of me.</p>
<p>As these feelings continued to simmer inside, and my attitude towards her began to take on a &#8217;not-so-nice&#8217; vibe owing to this jealousy I felt, I decided to write about my feelings as a way of venting. As I frantically scribbled them in my journal so as not to forget anything, I suddenly realized&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t really jealous of HER per se, but rather, I was jealous of the fact that she had found her passion in life and pursued it relentlessly. I knew the same career and line of work was also my passion, but I had not harnessed it as well as she had. As a result I felt inferior to her, and that&#8217;s what jealousy comes down to, it reflects a feeling of inferiority within ourselves.</p>
<p>Everything my friend did had the flair and intention of a journalist and now she had the professional experience to back it up. Where was my passion and why was I not calling it into existence? When I realized this, it was time to stop being angry at her and start taking responsibility for myself.</p>
<p>The jealousy I felt made me angry at my friend, but what had she done to me? Nothing. I realized then and there that part of living a full life is to take responsibility for your life. Taking responsibilty didn&#8217;t mean &#8221;beating her up&#8221; for knowing and succeeding in her passion, and it didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;beating myself up&#8221; for not having found and pursued my passion earlier. </p>
<p>So what did it mean?  Taking resposibilty means embracing this feeling of jealousy and allowing it to guide you towards that which fulfills you, so you feel whole and complete. I&#8217;ve learnt that jealousy is never directly about the other person per se, but rather what they have. And I don&#8217;t mean a car, job, house et., I mean a feeling, a state of being, that you wish you had too..whether it&#8217;s a feeling of being content, worthy, satisfied, fulfilled, loved or loving. </p>
<p>Jealousy helps to tells us what&#8217;s lacking in our own lives, what we&#8217;re unable to give to ourselves, but wish we could.  </p>
<p>So next time the green monster pops up, use it to recognize what the other person is creating for themselves, that you wish you could create for yourself too. Once you start figuring that out, you can start identifying the blocks and working on dissolving them. And of course, don&#8217;t forget to thank the green monster along the way. </p>
<p>And did I mention, thanks to my green monster, I&#8217;m doing what I love now, I&#8217;ve found my passion and I know why I&#8217;m here. We all can <img src='http://purpleverses.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
