&lt;p&gt;Would I have sat down after one at-bat like Jose Reyes did yesterday--ending the game after a leadoff hit in an attempt to preserve his batting title?&amp;nbsp; I'd like to think I wouldn't and yes, I thought it was bush league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the Mets trade my character for his 16 triples and 101 runs scored in just 126 games?&amp;nbsp; I doubt it.&amp;nbsp; At least, I hope they wouldn't, since I'd bat like .085 (Come on, I'd have to be at least as good as Al Leiter at the plate--the worst hitter I ever saw).&amp;nbsp; Still, I'd be a great clubhouse presence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it would be nice to live in a world where all our best performers are heros, but that's pretty far from realistic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Red Sox fans would have rather had nicer guy than Manny Ramirez in 2004, or would they rather have had his 130 RBI?&amp;nbsp; Not everyone can be Derek Jeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, Derek Jeter isn't even really Derek Jeter.&amp;nbsp; His postseason average is actually 4 points lower than his career regular season average.&amp;nbsp; That's not what people think about when they tell stories.&amp;nbsp; They like to tell the story of smashing into the seats to get a fly ball in the stands or coming out of nowhere to cut off a relay throw.&amp;nbsp; Heroes are built on incidents that may or may not reflect the reality of success and where it comes from.&amp;nbsp; Not surprisingly, villians are built the same way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, he's made some amazing plays, will make the Hall of Fame, and is probably one of the top 10 shortstops of all time, but a lot of source of his luster comes from playing for a big market team with a huge payroll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he didn't play in New York, he'd basically be Craig Biggio.&amp;nbsp; I think you can make a case for a guy like Biggio being more of a team player and a "hero".&amp;nbsp; Biggio, who also only played for one team, switched positions from catcher to second base to centerfield to second base again as the team needed.&amp;nbsp; He only made more than $6 million bucks just a few seasons, and never cracked double digit millions for similar production. &amp;nbsp; Jeter, on the other hand, wouldn't budge from shortstop for A-Rod, even though A-Rod was clearly the better shortstop--and demanded $17 million a year for declining performance in his twilight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't about knocking Derek Jeter--I'd love a guy who bats .300 year in and year out.&amp;nbsp; It's about the stories we tell about people and what really counts for success.&amp;nbsp; Jose Reyes is now a bum because he took the easy way out on his way to a batting title, missing three at bats in the last game.&amp;nbsp; Forget the 180 hits he had before yesterday to get there--the way he left off is a black mark in the eyes of the fans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's kind of unfair and I think we need to be careful about taking anecdotes as reality.&amp;nbsp; Just today at lunch someone told me how a certain person was a great marketer and that I should think about them as a potential founder to back.&amp;nbsp; I asked exactly what things this person had accomplished.&amp;nbsp; When pressed, they couldn't actually name anything.&amp;nbsp; At first, they swore this person had put a startup they worked at on the map, but then we quickly determined that the startup was kind of on the map already, and it certainly doesn't seem like the buzz around the company created long term, sustainable success.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it was unclear whether or not this person had created any success anywhere--yet there's a very heroic story about their accomplishments that doesn't have a lot of depth to it.&amp;nbsp; Happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not like it, but some people simply produce better than 99% of other people out there--but they do it without some of the character intangiables you want to see in your heroes.&amp;nbsp; They just work.&amp;nbsp; You're going to hire developers on your team that aren't very social.&amp;nbsp; You'll have salespeople who are simply doing it for the money and for the competition--not because they believe in the startup vision.&amp;nbsp; You know what? It's ok.&amp;nbsp; Not every single person on your team is going to bleed startup blood--and you know what, you don't even really make it worth it for them to.&amp;nbsp; If you're not a founder, you're not going to get a ton of equity.&amp;nbsp; They do it for the same reason most people take jobs--liking the task given, liking the people they work with, and liking the environment.&amp;nbsp; That's why people like working at startups.&amp;nbsp; They often attract great teams and create great environments to work in--simple as that.&amp;nbsp; It's not a religious conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fine as long as they're not disruptive to the culture.&amp;nbsp; Is Reyes disruptive to the Mets culture?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; They know that when he's on the field, they have a better shot at winning then without him--just like Manny did when he was being Manny.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need winners and experts on your team.&amp;nbsp; Character alone without the raw tools isn't going to get you there.&amp;nbsp; Those are the people you should be great friends with, but not necessarily hire.&amp;nbsp; And as for culture--great cultures allow the best qualified to work at their best.&amp;nbsp; They don't magically make nice, but otherwise underqualified, people perform miracles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/63ZHgP2Z7-M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-13028167.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/29/not-everyone-is-a-hero-some-people-just-bat-337-mets.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>You can't win them all... but you can learn why you failed and be better for next time</title><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 17:54:47 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/NAzBBZxxZNs/you-cant-win-them-all-but-you-can-learn-why-you-failed-and-b.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:13000769</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I lost a deal last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it wasn't really a deal that I "had", but there was a company that our team at First Round got excited about and offered an investment to.&amp;nbsp; There were lots of other investors interested and even when we had relegated ourselves to just having an angel-sized piece, when the music stopped, we were left without a chair to sit on.&amp;nbsp; The company didn't offer us the opportunity to invest--and I take the responsibility for not being able to get us in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was surprising, because I thought I had built a great relationship with the entrepreneur and I know we can add a ton of value, but, it happens.&amp;nbsp; It's kind of like dating.&amp;nbsp; You could think something went terrifically well, but if the other person doesn't feel that spark, you just have to accept it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's hard for me, because my initial inclination, as I'm sure it comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me, was to keep pushing--to keep giving the pitch, selling hard, and finding *some* way to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshk"&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt; gave me great advice.&amp;nbsp; He said to just signal that we accepted that things weren't going to work out, but most importantly, figure out what it was that the company felt like we were missing, and do what we could to be better for next time.&amp;nbsp; He suggested I ask the company for five or ten minutes on the phone to just get some honest and direct feedback about how we could be on that "must have" investor list for *every* team of smart folks doing interesting stuff that we like.&amp;nbsp; Pushing and selling any more would run the risk of alienating the company--and then we'd really come up empty.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing worse than failing and having no idea why, because then you're destined to just repeat the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a baseball guy, this resonated with me.&amp;nbsp; Baseball is a sport full of failure--where seven out of ten times you could fail and still be one of the best players.&amp;nbsp; You have a lot of failure data to analyze as a baseball player.&amp;nbsp; Even in softball as a player now I still think hard about what I did in each at bat that made my execution not what it should be.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, you hit the ball right at the center fielder on a scorching line drive--you do everything right and still, it doesn't work out.&amp;nbsp; Other times, like I did on Sunday in the first game of a doubleheader, you pop the ball up three times.&amp;nbsp; That gave me a lot to think about between games--especially since I pride myself as being an on base guy and a leadoff hitter that isn't supposed to do that.&amp;nbsp; I replayed each pitch that I saw in my mind, thought about my swing, and made adjustments.&amp;nbsp; I went 3 for 4 in the second game, hitting the ball on the ground three times before opening up for a home run to right field the last time up.&amp;nbsp; It's funny to think that after playing a sport for 26 years, you can still lapse into bad habits, make simple mistakes, and get off track--but get right back in it with some careful thought and readjustment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're on the venture capital side or you're an entrepreneur, you're going to have to think a lot about failure.&amp;nbsp; You'll have someone get hired away from you, lose a deal, or have an partnership fall apart on you.&amp;nbsp; If you don't accept your fate at some point, and take some learnings out of it, that is the true failure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have successes and have lessons.&amp;nbsp; There is no failure.&amp;nbsp; On to the next at bat, the next hire and the next exciting founders to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/NAzBBZxxZNs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-13000769.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/27/you-cant-win-them-all-but-you-can-learn-why-you-failed-and-b.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Thoughts on #occupywallst</title><category>Politics</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 16:04:25 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/aDc0f5BXp1s/thoughts-on-occupywallst.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12986791</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so about those protesters downtown&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; (obviously these are my own thoughts, not representative of my employer...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the aimless and outraged struggled to get pics and videos of police abuse downtown and telling tails of the horrors of pepper spray, some people actually attempting to *create* change were busy hacking together funding projects for UNICEF at the &lt;a href="http://5050.gd/projects/nyc-famine-hackathon"&gt;NYC Famine Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The tech community is creating more and more of these change agents everyday.&amp;nbsp; They have the capability to move markets and build new companies based on positive principals.&amp;nbsp; This Sunday, student hackers will be demoing their creations at the &lt;a href="http://hackny.org/a/f2011"&gt;hackNY Student Hackathon DemoFest&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Undoubtedly, social good projects will be on the minds of a number of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While protesters demand undefined &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo; by stripping down to their underwear, the team at &lt;a href="https://banksimple.com/"&gt;Banksimple&lt;/a&gt; (First Round company) works hard at ending the tyrrany of bank fees and customer abuse by actually building a new kind of bank from the ground up&amp;mdash;one with the consumer at the center.&amp;nbsp; If all of these kids got their parents to transfer all of their wealth (you know, the money they paid for them to go to NYU) to Banksimple, a startup, and away from the banks they protested in front of, well then we&amp;rsquo;d have something.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of these kids have iPhones and Macs?&amp;nbsp; How come they&amp;rsquo;re not protesting in Cupertino against corporate monopolies and greed&amp;mdash;or did they not notice all the suicides at Foxconn, where their sleek devices are made?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying there aren&amp;rsquo;t real problems in this country.&amp;nbsp; Far from it.&amp;nbsp; Poverty levels and unemployment are ridiculously high, and our workforce just isn&amp;rsquo;t equipped to propel this country forward into an innovative global marketplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that we need people willing to come up with&amp;mdash;and build&amp;mdash;real solutions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/nyregion/protesters-are-gunning-for-wall-street-with-faulty-aim.html"&gt;The NYT said it well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Their] cause, though, in specific terms, was virtually impossible to decipher. The group was clamoring for nothing in particular to happen right away &amp;mdash; not the implementation of the Buffett rule or the increased regulation of the financial industry. Some didn&amp;rsquo;t think government action was the answer because the rich, they believed, would just find new ways to subvert the system..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;Some said they were fighting the legal doctrine of corporate personhood; others, not fully understanding what that meant, believed it meant corporations paid no taxes whatsoever. Others came to voice concerns about the death penalty, the drug war, the environment&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;..The group&amp;rsquo;s lack of cohesion and its apparent wish to pantomime progressivism rather than practice it knowledgably is unsettling in the face of the challenges so many of its generation face &amp;mdash; finding work, repaying student loans, figuring out ways to finish college when money has run out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I got chastized in the street by one of those sidewalk fundraisers for not caring enough about the environment to listen to her message.&amp;nbsp; I then proceeded to run a kayaking trip on the East River for a group of people who donated money to make our &lt;a href="http://www.bbpboathouse.org"&gt;boathouse in Brooklyn Bridge Park&lt;/a&gt; possible&amp;mdash;a boathouse that teaches people about reclaiming and protecting their environment in a park that, just a few years ago, used to be industrial piers in an abandoned waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are creating change and others are acting in a very nice little production of &amp;ldquo;change theater&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; So kudos to everyone who has ever participated in an open source project&amp;mdash;making available for free what some big corporation would otherwise charge an arm and a leg for.&amp;nbsp; Hats off to the teams at Kickstarter, Donorschoose, Meetup, Twitter, GroupMe, etc for building the tools that enable self-organization, democratization, and disruption of the status quo.&amp;nbsp; I support the efforts of Skillshare, Codecademy and others that are trying to make education&amp;mdash;the greatest weapon we have against injustice&amp;mdash;more freely available.&amp;nbsp; This is the change we should be in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to incite police brutality when you&amp;rsquo;re not even sure what you&amp;rsquo;re protesting so you can get more hits that the &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Taze Me Bro&amp;rdquo; kid&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s really not helping anyone.&amp;nbsp; It is, however, undoubtedly costing all of us taxpayers a lot of police overtime.&amp;nbsp; Peaceful protest can create a lot of general awareness, but it should, at minimum, be combined with productive action and a clear message.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/aDc0f5BXp1s" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12986791.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/26/thoughts-on-occupywallst.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Excitement of Possibility</title><category>Random Stuff</category><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 11:30:21 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/cCqFU3K1WgI/the-excitement-of-possibility.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12900728</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing thing about the internet is that you never know when and how you&amp;rsquo;re going to get inspired&amp;mdash;and what voice will emerge and speak to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/chat-history/"&gt;This is a story that you have to read&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/whoabecca"&gt;a girl&lt;/a&gt; looking back, through her Gmail archives, at a relationship with a love she lost to cancer.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to know who it was that wrote this and so I poked around, finding her blog.&amp;nbsp; She recently wrote &lt;a href="http://whoabecca.com/2011/09/01/anniversary-2/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today is the anniversary of the day I met Clark. I&amp;rsquo;m honoring the day not by acknowledging it as a reminder of how curious, hopeful and confident I was walking home from the bar after giving him my phone number, but by recognizing that lately I am feeling, for the first time since he died, the very same way. &lt;strong&gt;The excitement of possibility&lt;/strong&gt; has slowly come back. I&amp;rsquo;m mourning my sadness a little bit, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel guilty that it has diminished. I&amp;rsquo;m doing right by him to enjoy my life and to appreciate when things are good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful story, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but focus on that one phrase&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;the excitement of possibility&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;and think of how it relates to what we all do everyday.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s what hopefully makes our jobs worth getting up for, staying late for, and what gets us motivated to connect with interesting people doing interesting things.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s what makes things at a startup different than working at a big, mature company.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s in the air&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; The excitement of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on an investment right now in a company that could change the world.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong.&amp;nbsp; Right now it&amp;rsquo;s your typical two dudes and some code&amp;mdash;a far cry from world changing at the moment&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; but&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One could imagine a world that it makes an impact in&amp;mdash;where people login, get motivated to learn, motivate others, and have new possibilities opened to them.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s this &lt;em&gt;excitement of possibility&lt;/em&gt; that makes what we do exciting.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s what makes each Tungled calendar appointment with an entrepreneur something to look forward to.&amp;nbsp; The road is long and it is fueled by what could possibly, no matter how unlikely, happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/cCqFU3K1WgI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12900728.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/19/the-excitement-of-possibility.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Future of Publishing and an Opportunity to Work with CNN/Money</title><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2011 15:49:45 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/BsX45o2BHK4/the-future-of-publishing-and-an-opportunity-to-work-with-cnn.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12882427</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Don't know if you noticed, but LinkedIn has an editor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about that for a second.&amp;nbsp; A professional social networking site has hired a content focused executive away from a traditional media company's digital arm.&amp;nbsp; Isn't LinkedIn doing terrifically well with it's recruiting focused business?&amp;nbsp; Isn't ad-supported content a tough place to be?&amp;nbsp; Why would LinkedIn &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110622/linkedin-connects-with-fortunes-dan-roth/"&gt;hire away Dan Roth&lt;/a&gt; from Fortune a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What LinkedIn is realizing is indicative of a recent trend--that the best use of online content as a business might be as a synergistic compliment to other activites.&amp;nbsp; Take &lt;a href="http://www.refinery29.com"&gt;Refinery29&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&amp;nbsp; The "HuffPo for Fashion" site has seemlessly integrated its &lt;a href="http://reserve.refinery29.com/new-york"&gt;Reserve&lt;/a&gt; deals with the same fashion brands it often writes about.&amp;nbsp; Conflict?&amp;nbsp; Please!&amp;nbsp; Picked up a fashion magazine lately?&amp;nbsp; For years and years fashion magazines have known for years that editorial and advertising is a blurry one at best--and it's what the consumer wants anyway.&amp;nbsp; The consumer picks up a fashion magazine with the mindset of "Show me what to buy."&amp;nbsp; That might mean a great branding initiative or deal from a sponsor or it could mean a story on a cutting edge trend.&amp;nbsp; Either way, quality and relevancy seem to ring more authentic to the consumer than the economics of how it got in front of my eyeballs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn realizes that it needs to be not just a place to get a job--but to be knowledgable enough to be on the cutting edge of your industry.&amp;nbsp; In a way, it has a responsibility to keep it's "product"--the professionals on the site--in the know.&amp;nbsp; In this case, content improves the offer.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, when I'm reading a piece of content, I may want to spread it across my professional network--and especially when I'm publishing one.&amp;nbsp; I can't wait until I can write a post about startups and make sure it gets to every entrepreneur within two degrees of me on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal is getting into the community and content game as well with their soon to be released stealth GetSocial effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers like TechCrunch and Business Insider are active in the events business, just as O'Reilly has been for years.&amp;nbsp; There are a ton of synergies here.&amp;nbsp; Having an online audience enables you to sell an event to your community--lowering cost of customer acquisition--but it also allows you to create unique. exclusive content out of what happened at the conference.&amp;nbsp; Why cover news without any information advantage when you can setup a forum for news to break right in your lap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands and advertisers are getting into the fold, too.&amp;nbsp; Content brings communities of shared interests together, allowing brands to tell their message directly to their audience.&amp;nbsp; Agencies like &lt;a href="http://www.bynd.com/"&gt;Beyond&lt;/a&gt; are helping brands become little publishers themselves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a blurry little content world we're creating.&amp;nbsp; Seems to me that anyone wanting to get into the pure content business or have a career in it needs to start thinking more creatively about what business goals of the stakeholders in their field are complimented by content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other publishers are looking at these new models and the tools needed to find synergies, pivot, and move forward, and thinking that innovative startups might be able to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take CNN/Money.&amp;nbsp; They've invited the startup community to come pitch them on what they can do to help CNN/Money innovate.&amp;nbsp; If you're in the business of helping publishers transform, improve, and jumpstart their offering,&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/startupevent/"&gt; you absolutely need to apply to pitch (deadline is today)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The winners will pitch their wares in front of a live audience and a panel of experts (VCs, executives at CNN/Money) for a chance at a real business offering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time this nextNY event was done with the Daily News, one company, &lt;a href="http://www.olapic.com"&gt;Olapic&lt;/a&gt;, got a distribution deal (and revenue) that changed the nature of their business.&amp;nbsp; If you can use CNN/Money as a partner, there's no excuse not to give it a shot.&amp;nbsp; If you just want to attend and see what startups are changing the future of publishing, &lt;a href="https://websvp.com/startup_event/"&gt;you can RSVP here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kayak on the waters around Manhattan--which is a ton of fun but can also be a bit precarious when it comes to navigating ferry traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we were with a group of paddlers and came face to face with a ferry boat heading in our direction.&amp;nbsp; We wound up between it and the pier that it wanted to turn into coming around a bend.&amp;nbsp; The ferry boats in NYC are on pontoon-like structures, and so the worst thing you can ever see as a kayaker is straight through to the other side of the boat.&amp;nbsp; That means you are dead set in its forward path.&amp;nbsp; On the street, sometimes you wind up doing that little back and forth shuffle with someone walking in your direction and you bump into each other.&amp;nbsp; No biggie.&amp;nbsp; On the water, if you're a kayak, you can't afford to bump into a ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you signal what direction you're going to?&amp;nbsp; Point with your oar?&amp;nbsp; Some kind of lighting system?&amp;nbsp; No, you just start turning... and fast!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Since you can turn quicker than the bigger boat can, by committing to a direction, you force the other boat to move the other way to avoid you.&amp;nbsp; Instead of trying to guess, they clearly know where you're going and where they need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same maneuver works in product development.&amp;nbsp; The worst situation you can ever get caught in is when your users just feel so-so about your product, and you're kind of left guessing what the next feature or overall direction should be.&amp;nbsp; That's why a lot of people advocate dramatic product moves early on in a product lifespan to get good feedback.&amp;nbsp; If you start out with no social features whatsoever, you'll hear early on whether or not people want that.&amp;nbsp; When you suddenly make things public, you'll either see site usage go up, or see your fans completely throw up all over it.&amp;nbsp; Actually, either is a good outcome, because like in the kayak example, big moves make it clear what direction you need to go in to avoid disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/m1ew8TpUf98" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12771934.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/9/kayaks-and-startups-signalling-direction-on-the-open-water-b.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Pick a graph, any graph: Thinking about Facebook connect vs creating a new graph</title><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 16:52:10 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/MV9cTH9BkvY/pick-a-graph-any-graph-thinking-about-facebook-connect-vs-cr.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12760204</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Facebook first started out, it was a social network that connected you with people who went to your college.&amp;nbsp; What you were signing up for when you friended someone, at least at the time, was pretty clear.&amp;nbsp; You could justifiably say that if the functions and features of the application is consistant, you might not even need privacy features.&amp;nbsp; When connecting means that other people can see my stuff, I manage my privacy by managing my connections--I decide upfront whether or not you are someone that I want to see what I'm posting, because I know what a post is and where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was and has been the nature of Foursquare.&amp;nbsp; Foursquare has been very consistant about what friendship means in their application--people can see where they check in.&amp;nbsp; You can check in off the graph, but that seems kind of silly and isn't a mainstream activity.&amp;nbsp; Not surprisingly, with a consistant sharing policy, there hasn't been that much discussion of Foursquare privacy--other than what's visable on the web and how it tweets who you are with.&amp;nbsp; If you don't want people to know where you are, don't friend them on Foursquare--simple as that.&amp;nbsp; That's why my Foursquare graph is about a third the size of my Facebook graph--clearly I don't need everyone knowing where I am, nor do I care where everyone else is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's when the application changes, like when the Facebook newsfeed launched or when people who weren't at your college could see you, that things go awry.&amp;nbsp; When the features chaged, you got stuck in a situation where you weren't exactly sure the people you brought to this party when it was a dance party were the same people you wanted in the room when it became a key party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of applications are using Facebook Connect as a way to help users discover their friends and start sharing, but I'm not sure they've all considered the implications of borrowing from that broad social graphs.&amp;nbsp; PicPlz seems to use Twitter or Facebook--I can't even remember how it's friending me with others automatically and figuring out who I'm following, so I'm a little more careful about which pictures I put up there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may feel annoying to have to refriend or refollow folks on a new social application, but getting people to do that might be worth it to ensure quality and gain trust from your users.&amp;nbsp; You can always use Facebook Connect to help me identify who I might want to follow, but I don't think graph recreation is a bad thing.&amp;nbsp; That's why I never liked Friendfeed--because who I want to connect with around different functions on the web is nuanced, and I didn't like the one graph fits all model for sharing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups might think that the more friends someone has on their site, the better, but I'd be more focused on engagement.&amp;nbsp; GroupMe was the smallest of all of my social graphs, but it was a high engagement platform that I participated with the people I see most.&amp;nbsp; That's just as valuable as adding a bunch of people I don't care about for functions that may change in the future.&amp;nbsp; The more uncertain I am about the consistancy of the future feature set, the more I'm going to be hesitant to engage on the platform for fear of the privacy rug being pulled out from under me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/MV9cTH9BkvY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12760204.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/7/pick-a-graph-any-graph-thinking-about-facebook-connect-vs-cr.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Entrepreneur Social Media FAIL: I don't have time to blog because I need to hire, get customers, get PR and raise money</title><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2011 20:41:13 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/VOuE3seiih8/entrepreneur-social-media-fail-i-dont-have-time-to-blog-beca.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12753165</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be clear--you can absolutely build an incredible company without participating in social media.&amp;nbsp; There is certainly success without blogging, and blogging definitely isn't a guarantee of success by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have tons of things to do as a founder.&amp;nbsp; You have hiring to do, money to raise and you've got to get your company's story out there.&amp;nbsp; Blogging takes up time that you don't have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most entrepreneurs don't recognize the value of personal use of social media as an important--maybe the most important--channel for accomplishing these milestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things are true for every startup:&amp;nbsp; 1) Founders and CEOs are key to driving success and 2) these companies need awareness for their unique message to accomplish all sorts of goals.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the entire team does the work, for sure, but founders and CEOs set the tone with their first hires.&amp;nbsp; The initial team and the level of work they are challenged and motivated to do is a direct result if the environment created by the people at the top.&amp;nbsp; That's why startups are uniquely personal.&amp;nbsp; The DNA of the founders makes its way into the product, sales strategy, recruiting efforts, etc.&amp;nbsp; If you are going to accompany these efforts with a public message, you're going to want to choose an equally personal channel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, using other people's channels and audience, which is essentially what PR is, won't be as effective--simply because no one can tell your story as well as you can.&amp;nbsp; PR can magnify, distribute, etc., but it's your own story that is the fuel for a well executed PR campaign these days--and I think it starts best on your own site in your own voice.&amp;nbsp; Your blogging or participation on Twitter won't suffice alone, but it's a key ingredient to a comprehensive PR strategy these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, no one really gets paid to tell *your* story--but that's what people want to hear.&amp;nbsp; When people consider working for you, they want to hear who you are and where you're taking this company.&amp;nbsp; You can tell them on the interview, but how many people aren't even coming for an interview because they haven't heard about you and your story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's part of what blogs, Twitter and other forms of social media do--they make you discoverable.&amp;nbsp; They also make you more easily followable.&amp;nbsp; I can watch your napkin develop into a company from afar without further cluttering my inbox--not that email lists are easily discoverable anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These channels also allow you more at-bats with your message.&amp;nbsp; You don't want to spend your whole NY Times interview telling the whole story about how your grandfather's shoe store inspired you to be an entrepreneur, but you can tell that story on your blog--as well as any other lessons he taught you.&amp;nbsp; That story might surface a VP of Marketing with an interest in startups who has a similar story of family inspiration.&amp;nbsp; That person may have been following you based off of someone else's retweet of that post you wrote on why good marketing talent is so hard to find.&amp;nbsp; A coffee and a handshake later and you just added a key member of your team who was enthusiastic enough to take a huge pay cut in exchange for more equity, without paying a recruiter fee.&amp;nbsp; What was that you were saying about what your time its worth?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogs and social media can be as equally serendipitous in surfacing early customers, speaking opportunities or potential investors.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it is absolutely entirely possible to do this on your own, but why not use a cheap channel that works effectively if it is available to you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, that's why--but there are ways to solve for that.&amp;nbsp; If I was a busy entrepreneur with a commute, for example, I might record my thoughts over audio and get a ghost writer to summerize them into a set of discrete posts.&amp;nbsp; In fact, getting interviewed for an hour by someone could result in enough content for 3 or 4 blog posts--since you can speak faster than you can type.&amp;nbsp; Is this inauthentic?&amp;nbsp; Not if you're conveying your unique perspective, experience and message--it's no different than having an editor.&amp;nbsp; How about having everyone in your company contribute suggestions for things they'd like to hear you talk about--take requests if you can't think of what to write about.&amp;nbsp; Anything, really, that is you being the face of your vision and your company, telling your story is a potentially valuable asset--one that I don't see nearly enough entrepreneurs taking advantage of.&amp;nbsp; Instead, they spend way too much time trying to convince others to tell their story for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/VOuE3seiih8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12753165.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/9/6/entrepreneur-social-media-fail-i-dont-have-time-to-blog-beca.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Paywalls and Kettlebells</title><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 13:26:53 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/1lDmNzK9BN0/paywalls-and-kettlebells.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12696609</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=":17v" class="gt ii"&gt;
&lt;div id=":2g1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was  working out in New York Sports Club in Bay Ridge, doing my kettlebell  swings and basu ball as per the Four Hour Body.&amp;nbsp; I was standing in an  area marked "for personal training only -- when personal training  sessions are occurring, this area is private" or something to that  effect.&amp;nbsp; When I started, there weren't any trainers to be seen.&amp;nbsp; After a  few minutes, a trainer just walks by and moves the basu ball I was  using over to his client without saying anything.&amp;nbsp; Because he was  already using something else, I asked if it was in the way or if he  needed to use it.&amp;nbsp; He said he was using it and then just rudely pointed  to the sign without saying anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that there are people paying up for personal sessions that  might need more room, but I don't think that expecting someone to drop  everything and vacate the area immediately in the middle of a workout  is a reasonable way to treat existing customers.&amp;nbsp; On top of that, taking  without asking, even if you have a right to something, is just plain  rude.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like a second class citizen in a gym I've belonged to for 10 years.&amp;nbsp; The person being trained might be higher margin, but I provide the base of the business--consistant and predictable revenue that isn't likely to suddenly fall off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had an odd kettlebell experience a few weeks prior.&amp;nbsp; At the 14th/5th location, they started locking the kettlebells up.&amp;nbsp; When I asked to use them, they offered to get me a personal trainer to show me how.&amp;nbsp; I knew how to do the one exercise that I wanted to do, and said I didn't need one, but they were insistant about making sure I don't get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, anyone can go up to the dumbbell area and pick up an 85 pound weight and swing it around as they please.&amp;nbsp; I have a feeling that anyone who goes over to try the kettlebells probably knows what they're doing more so than the average meathead who tries to lift too much at the free weights--simply because kettlebells are new and probably intimidating to newbies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much better sell would be to ask anyone who tries to use them if they need some help.&amp;nbsp; Keeping something I want to use away under lock and key was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me think of the questions that people have around freemium and where to put paywalls.&amp;nbsp; I'd say the number one thing you want to make sure is that whoever isn't paying for your site doesn't feel like a second class citizen.&amp;nbsp; They should just feel like the features that other people are using aren't of interest to them and it shouldn't degrade their experience not to have them.&amp;nbsp; At NYSC, the personal training areas are getting bigger and bigger.&amp;nbsp; While I'm sure they make more money from people getting trained, I wonder whether they stick and how the growing training area makes the rest of the gymgoers feel--especially when certain equipment is behind the paywall.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I don't like feeling like I'm intruding in a place I pay to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, you want to make sure that your targeting is right--that the right feature set is being offered to the right customer.&amp;nbsp; I'm the last person on the face of the earth to pay for a personal trainer--and so to try the hard sell on me in exchange for releasing equipment that I use normally was a bad idea.&amp;nbsp; How can you watch and segment user behavior so that you have a high conversion rate--not because the product is good but because you're offering it to the right people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/194528/hiringfunnel.GIF?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1314814456682" alt="" width="268" height="200" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At a board meeting yesterday, a management team was talking about their hiring needs and some of the challenges they're having hiring great people.&amp;nbsp; This conversation seems to take place at nearly every growing company in just about every board meeting... over and over again.&amp;nbsp; It's clearly one of the most important things a company can do--yet companies don't ever get as organized around it, with dedicated resources, until much later in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple tip: track hiring analytics and assign them to someone.&amp;nbsp; The reason?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you're not interviewing enough people, you're not going to be able to hire someone--simple as that.&amp;nbsp; Hiring is a funnel with inputs and outputs--just like a normal sales process, except you're selling your company and the opportunity to work for it.&amp;nbsp; Potential candidates and leads go in the top, hired employees come out the bottom.&amp;nbsp; You have trackable metrics for sales, site conversions, traffic, etc., so why not for hiring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of just tracking, actually assigning someone responsibility for it is a surefire way to actually improve the numbers.&amp;nbsp; Who goes to sleep at night worrying about whether you've interviewed enough people this week?&amp;nbsp; Recruiting isn't hard work--it just takes bandwidth--a dedicated effort.&amp;nbsp; You can't hire the top salespeople unless someone makes a valiant effort at creating a list of the 25 top salespeople in your area.&amp;nbsp; Any trained LinkedIn monkey can do that through a combo of searches, tapping their own networks and that of the company, etc., but not everyone has the time--especially if it's not their primary responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I'm not sure an in-house recruiter is a necessary option here.&amp;nbsp; How about just a tenacious project manager who organizes the effort, can communicate well to reach out (or at least craft the writing to help others reach out), and help schedule everyone?&amp;nbsp; Might not even need to be fulltime.&amp;nbsp; Their job could be to hand every engineer in your company a weekly list of 5 other engineers to e-mail, with some copy and an opportunity for personized notes on the person in an effort to get them to a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about the funnel, I think about the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressions&lt;/strong&gt; - How many times does your company get its name out there--and you could specifically tailor it to impressions related to hiring if you want.&amp;nbsp; In here, I'd count the number of times employees spoke at conferences, meetups, wrote blog posts, got press, etc. that included the mention that they were hiring.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If no one knows about you, it's tough to get a lot of inbound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names&lt;/strong&gt; - This is just the unvetted target list.&amp;nbsp; This is what you create when you hear that a certain company can't get financing, is winding down, or when you make your list of 25 top people in the market at a certain position.&amp;nbsp; When you host a developer Meetup, anyone who attended is a name--a potential recruiting target.&amp;nbsp; Names are what you pull off of LinkedIn.&amp;nbsp; An intern can get you names, because they don't need to vet them other than very basic criteria like, "Find me every developer who has been at Google in NYC for over 4 years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leads&lt;/strong&gt; - Leads are qualified.&amp;nbsp; You've learned something about them and they've also done something to indicate interest in you or at least in new offers.&amp;nbsp; It could be something so simple as checking a box when you host a meetup that says "Yes, I'm willing to be contacted about employment opportunities."&amp;nbsp; You have a very short window with leads.&amp;nbsp; Typically, people don't actively stay "in market" for new opportunities for very long, so make sure someone is attending to real leads quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews&lt;/strong&gt; - You don't want to tie up your staff in constant interviews all day, but everyone should realize they're going to have to jump on the phone for 20 minutes with someone maybe as often as once a day.&amp;nbsp; If you're a 5 person dev team going to 10, it's not too much to ask for 25 minutes a day from everyone to do a 20 min call with 5 minutes to share notes with the team after and make a recommendation.&amp;nbsp; Key decision makers should be easily accessable for qualified phone interviews that make it to the next cut.&amp;nbsp; It might even be worth blocking out some time for it.&amp;nbsp; If you know your team is doing 3-5 phone interviews a day, have a half hour or an hour blocked out each afternoon or right after work as the CTO that can be booked by others for interviews.&amp;nbsp; This way, your team can raise the flag on a good candidate and be comfortable saying, "Hey, if you'd be willing to come in at 6, our CTO would love to meet you."&amp;nbsp; Strike while the iron is hot, but make sure you know where you keep your iron and have a constant flame going, even if its on low.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offers&lt;/strong&gt; - Create a standard offer for certain levels of experience and certain positions--and make sure the person hiring knows exactly who needs to approve a hire.&amp;nbsp; Keep it to a small number of people.&amp;nbsp; Be quick to hire, and quick to fire.&amp;nbsp; I've heard that you can tell whether or not an employee is going to work out within the first week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hires&lt;/strong&gt; - Touchdown!&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that retention is just as important.&amp;nbsp; If you keep hiring people and they leave within three weeks, you have an entirely different problem on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you actually track these metrics, you can zero in on how to improve overall conversion, and reverse engineer problems.&amp;nbsp; Are you having trouble moving your offers to hires?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do you interview a ton but never pull the trigger--maybe not willing to take enough risk?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, unless you measure the situation, there's no way you're going to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chantelchloe"&gt;Chantel Waterbury&lt;/a&gt; walked into First Round's New York City office and told me all about jewelry, empowering women entrepreneurs in the fashion space, and what it means to design inspiring accessories.&amp;nbsp; She expounded on the completely missed opportunity to combine offline and online direct selling into a singular complementary vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a powerpoint deck, 15 years of jewelry industry experience, and I couldn't have been more excited by the &lt;a href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com"&gt;chloe + isabel&lt;/a&gt; story..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I wondered whether or not she had accidently met with the wrong VC.&amp;nbsp; She saw the sneakers, right?&amp;nbsp; I think I might have been wearing my Android robot walking the dog t-shirt.&amp;nbsp; I'm quite possibly the least fashionable person in the entire venture capital industry.&amp;nbsp; Lucky for me, she didn't seem fazed, and we hit it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of months, &lt;a href="http://www.firstround.com"&gt;First Round Capital&lt;/a&gt; and Floodgate led a round that included SV Angel, Kirstin Green/Forerunner, Mike Duda/Consigliere, Ashton Kutcher, and others to enable her to build a great team, &lt;a href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com/shop-our-jewelry"&gt;create amazing product&lt;/a&gt;, and recruit an initial group of merchandisers.&amp;nbsp; Six months later, they had accomplished all of these milestones and began to ramp up for a full public launch.&amp;nbsp; I cannot tell you how hard they've been working this summer.&amp;nbsp; Like good ducks, you might not have heard a lot of noise from them (until now--&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/08/29/with-impressive-backers-chloe-isabel-offers-women-a-new-direct-sales-platform/"&gt;check out this awesome NextWeb article&lt;/a&gt;), but they've been paddling like the dickens underneath.&amp;nbsp; (The duck analogy is quickly becoming a favorite of mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wednesday night, the &lt;a href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com"&gt;chloe + isabel&lt;/a&gt; team will be putting together a very special launch event.&amp;nbsp; If you're an innovator in the fashion space, in the flow of fashion influencers, cover ecommerce/fashion tech/retail for the media, or just generally blanket your social media presence with your uber fashion-forwardness &lt;a href="mailto:charlie@firstround.com"&gt;e-mail me&lt;/a&gt; and I'll see if I can get you an invite--we're pretty tight already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to finally be able to talk about working with the company more extensively now that they're public.&amp;nbsp; Chantel has been amazing to work with, as has my fellow board member &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/annimaniac"&gt;Ann Miura-Ko&lt;/a&gt; from Floodgate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's pretty clear how Chantel was able to become the top selling CutCo rep on the west coast--paying her way through college with her earnings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She has an infectious personality and is a natural sales leader.&amp;nbsp; Chantel has extraordinary intuition about people, knows her audience and what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's exciting about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com"&gt;chloe + isabel&lt;/a&gt; is that they're working on a modern version of a proven direct model "for today's social web"--but they have both the jewelry and direct selling DNA to build it off of a solid base.&amp;nbsp; I've been continuously impressed with Chantel and her team's understanding of how the social web can empower their merchandisers to create great businesses of their own, and we've only scratched the surface of building a platform that will enable them to do that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is going to be a great ride that empowers thousands of up and coming female leaders in entrepreneurship and fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be clear about what I'm writing about here.&amp;nbsp; There are people out there who tell great stories--who make me think about the world in different ways and those who bring light to new and interesting information that I wouldn't have known about.&amp;nbsp; These are really great journalists and they'll be around for a long time, because we will always need great storytellers and tenacious investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you have people paid to tell me more about what's going on outside my window--reporters, if you will.&amp;nbsp; These people, and the industry behind them, failed this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 17, 1994, the whole country was interrupted by broadcast news&amp;mdash;us New  Yorkers were watching Patrick Ewing and the Knicks in the NBA Finals.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was  the beginning of the biggest media spectacle we had ever seen.&amp;nbsp; All that needs  to be mentioned is &amp;ldquo;White Bronco&amp;rdquo; and anyone born on the other side of the  1980&amp;rsquo;s knows what is being referred to.&amp;nbsp; National news of a single celebrity  wanted for murder&amp;nbsp;taking cops on a slow speed chase dominated the airwaves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not we wanted to watch, there was nothing else on.&amp;nbsp; We didn&amp;rsquo;t have  a choice.&amp;nbsp; There were no other sources, no other feeds,&amp;nbsp;so we turned out and got  sucked in.&amp;nbsp; Never had their been so much coverage of something that impacted the  life of the average American so little.&amp;nbsp; That was the day that mainstream,  broadcast media decided&amp;nbsp;it was in the entertainment industry&amp;mdash;and that ratings  and the &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; mattered more than the delivery of relevant information.&amp;nbsp;  It was the start of a 17 year journey through countless spectacle after  spectacle, each preying on the worst and weakest parts of us&amp;mdash;our capacities for  fear, gawking, superficiality, and misplaced senses of righteousness.&amp;nbsp; We  watched trials, murders, wars, terrorism, heartbreaks, the rise and fall of  D-list celebrities&amp;mdash;all while we were told this was important.&amp;nbsp; We had to pay  attention because these were the events of the day, and if we didn&amp;rsquo;t, we  wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the know.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;ldquo;miss out&amp;rdquo;, because the news was  going to tell you about the danger lurking in your house that could kill your  kids&amp;mdash;at 11 after the movie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never liked being force fed the national car accident of the day, and kept  waiting for the cycle to break.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, we watched again&amp;mdash;for hours and hours&amp;mdash;expecting the news to  inform us&amp;mdash;to convey relevent facts,&amp;nbsp;well researched predictions, and timely  reports&amp;mdash;about Hurricane Irene.&amp;nbsp; The news broadcasted, for sure, and we  watched&amp;mdash;but we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually get informed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m ready to say that this weekend was the last straw&amp;mdash;the peak of mainstream  media news coverage.&amp;nbsp; It couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more obvious that&amp;nbsp;mainsteam news had  completely and utterly failed.&amp;nbsp; By overdramatizing the leadup and missing the  real threats presented by the storm&amp;mdash;the flooding&amp;mdash;the news media dropped the ball  on its responsibility to inform its audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the &amp;ldquo;cry wolf&amp;rdquo; moment for the news, and from here on in, we will be  tuning out.&amp;nbsp; Forget new business models for journalism.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s done.&amp;nbsp; Over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the covenant that the music industry used to have with the  consumer?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;ll scour the earth for the best talent and give it to you so you  don&amp;rsquo;t have to listen to every last wannabe band&amp;mdash;and charge you a price for that  quality filter and discovery mechanism.&amp;nbsp; When the industry failed to hold up  it&amp;rsquo;s end of that bargain&amp;mdash;instead shoving crappy one-hit wonders down the  channel&amp;mdash;it&amp;nbsp;was only a matter of time before technology enabled consumers to go  around them, and the industry collapsed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, we bemoaned the end of the mainstream media when blogs grew  in popularity, but that was premature.&amp;nbsp; Blogs were just a way for us to comment  about the mainstream.&amp;nbsp; We still needed&amp;nbsp;direct sources&amp;nbsp;at the core.&amp;nbsp; Today, news  broke of &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/26/apple-television-2012/"&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s plans to  go to work on changing our TV experience&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;actually releasing a digital  television with iOS built in.&amp;nbsp; This is only the beginning.&amp;nbsp; From now on, we&amp;rsquo;re  going to be connecting right to direct sources ourselves&amp;mdash;to government newsfeeds  and to citizens broadcasting their own local experiences right from the  scene&amp;mdash;right to our TVs.&amp;nbsp; When it becomes just as easy to click the remote and go  to a direct data feed as it is to watch a talking anchor head, the middlemen  selling stories are in trouble.&amp;nbsp; When there was an earthquake in New York last  week, it was confirmed for me immediately by other people on twitter who lived  in the city, and someone who thought quickly enough to post a link directly to  accurate USGS data&amp;mdash;well before any news outlet caught anything.&amp;nbsp; At the end of  the day, all you have are direct sources and official reports. Those are coming  online fast.&amp;nbsp; Governments are getting online and making every piece of data they  have into a feed.&amp;nbsp; Individuals already have discoverable feeds on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way the filesharers revolted against the music industry&amp;mdash;we will see  society&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;backlash against being scared into watching.&amp;nbsp; Here in NYC, we spent  almost a whole 24 hours on the couch&amp;nbsp;in advance of the actual arrival of the  storm waiting for something to happen&amp;mdash;waiting for the brimstone.&amp;nbsp; Instead, we  got hours and hours of nothing.&amp;nbsp; Even the field reporters seemed frustrated by  the utter lack of&amp;nbsp;carnage to cover around the city.&amp;nbsp; We witnessed live shot  after live shot of lone reporters either covering nothing at all&amp;mdash;the lack of  rain, wind, damage&amp;mdash;or featuring obvious acts of human stupidity.&amp;nbsp; There were  kayakers off Staten Island that had to be rescued, beach front residents that  didn&amp;rsquo;t want to evacuate.&amp;nbsp; Occasionally, you&amp;rsquo;d get the store owner torn right out  of a Spike Lee movie&amp;mdash;complete with white tank top, chest hair, and the requisite  story of how he&amp;rsquo;d been in that location for 30 years and was tougher than any  storm.&amp;nbsp; Beaches that had flooded before in heavy rains were flooding again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking, &amp;ldquo;Where is the actual news?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news&amp;mdash;the information I needed, cared about, and found relevant&amp;mdash;as it  turned out, was on the internet.&amp;nbsp; The internet was pretty much the only way to  find out whether you had to be evacuated.&amp;nbsp; I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know about all the  flood zones until I found the online maps.&amp;nbsp; I found &lt;a href="http://apps.coned.com/weboutageinfo/stormcenter/default.aspx"&gt;power outage  maps&lt;/a&gt; powered by&amp;nbsp;Bing map APIs and real data feeds.&amp;nbsp; I found enough photos of  mudslides across railroad tracks and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtaphotos/6090385894/in/photostream"&gt;flooded  stations taken by the MTA itself&lt;/a&gt; to make it obvious that Monday&amp;rsquo;s commute  was going to be hellish for anyone who couldn&amp;rsquo;t bike or walk to work.&amp;nbsp; And what  were the&amp;nbsp;reporters doing?&amp;nbsp; Asking each other when the MTA might be willing to  give a &amp;ldquo;Guesstimate&amp;rdquo; and suggesting that the PATH trains make for a good subway  alternative for the few blocks where they go up 6th ave.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;also had&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/hurricanes/"&gt;this  handy&amp;nbsp;map&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; At any given time, I could check out where the hurricane was and  what the winds were like, with no spray tanned Lee Goldberg hogging up the  airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were the tweets.&amp;nbsp; Twitter was ablaze with a constant stream of  commentary, firsthand reports, tips, discussion, and yes, irreverent&amp;nbsp;humor.&amp;nbsp; It  was&amp;nbsp; a friend on Twitter that reminded me that my mobile data feed might go out  before cell service would, and that switching from Google Voice to regular SMS  for texts might be a good idea.&amp;nbsp; Useful!&amp;nbsp; Twitter kept me informed by the right  sources, in good spirits, and instilled a sense of community with others  nearby&amp;mdash;even if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach them by subway.&amp;nbsp; What was fascinating to me was  watching reporters who were friends waffle back and forth between being  conveyers of news and first hand fellow experiencers of it.&amp;nbsp; Where they &amp;ldquo;on  duty&amp;rdquo; or just one of us?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite a contrast to sitting alone&amp;mdash;and feeling alone&amp;mdash;on 9/11.&amp;nbsp; Ten  years ago, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a community online to turn to the way we do know.&amp;nbsp; In  the ten years since the worst tragedy the city has ever seen&amp;mdash;an event intended  to tear our society apart&amp;mdash;we used technology to invent more&amp;nbsp;ways to bring us  together than ever before.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more and more television and major media outlets became a spectical&amp;mdash;like  a child acting out to try to get attention&amp;mdash;the more I turned to&amp;nbsp;the internet&amp;nbsp;for  information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The mainstream news coverage&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;a mockery&amp;mdash;an over-the-top little  production of community&amp;nbsp;theater quality that we had seen so many times before  (&lt;a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/26/al-roker-cnn-weather-channel-and-more-crazy-hurricane-stand-ups.html"&gt;hilarious  wind-blown reporters from hurricanes past right here&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I got more useful  reports from &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dpstyles/6087648166/in/photostream"&gt;Dennis  Crowley&lt;/a&gt; than from the &amp;ldquo;CNN guy standing in water when he could be standing  on the pier right next to him,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/jeffjarvis/status/107540795279679489"&gt;as Jeff  Jarvis pointed out&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take anything away from the army of reporters who toiled away  for 12-24 hour stretches on location.&amp;nbsp; They were doing their jobs&amp;mdash;but even they  seemed to grow weary of their own coverage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Inland flooding, as it turned out,  was the real danger.&amp;nbsp; Yet,&amp;nbsp;these crews were originally dispatched to  waterfronts&amp;mdash;many of which typically flooded several times a year&amp;mdash;seemingly&amp;nbsp;in an  effort to get some gripping footage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it really a surprise to anyone that the Long Beach lifeguard house&amp;mdash;a wood  framed building on a beach&amp;mdash;floated off its foundation?&amp;nbsp; The anchor commented,  &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;nbsp;worried about that, because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing holding that building  together.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was worried about the people who thought this was a good idea to  put&amp;nbsp;it right back where it was after the last time this happened&amp;mdash;yup, this  wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time flood water&amp;nbsp;carried this place away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about is where I&amp;rsquo;m going to get information should  Eyewitness News become economically non-viable and disappear&amp;mdash;especially if they  fail to provide relevancy and keep me informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlets we trusted completely missed out on telling us what we actually  should have been worried about: small, inland rivers and lakes in suburban towns  north and west of the city.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s where the worst flooding and damage occurred,  and where people were taken most by surprise, like the 20 year old New Jersey  girl who drowned in her car early Sunday morning after being overtaken by  floodwaters from a local creek.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if someone had done some  thoughtful&amp;nbsp;research and tried to figure out&amp;nbsp;the story that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; being  told, warnings to residents about local inland waterways might have come  earlier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/08/27/how-we-could-cover-storms/"&gt;Jeff  Jarvis confronts the issue head on&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;So the question the journalists should ask is how they can add value to  [all the new sources of direct information]. That is the the question must ask  constantly now that information can be exchanged so easily and instantly from  officials to citizens, data sources to users, and witnesses to witnesses. It&amp;rsquo;s  an everyday question, not just one for emergencies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journalists don&amp;rsquo;t add value by repeating themselves endlessly, but  standing in front of random but ultimately uninformative sites where their  cameras and trucks happen to be set up (or worse, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wesh.com/video/28984605/detail.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the  water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), by alarming more than informing  people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;storms of another sort are still &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/107546486304276480"&gt;&lt;em&gt;overcoming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Syria and Libya, both of which might as well not exist on supposed news networks  today. Is that journalism?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, the clear&amp;nbsp;answer was &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/Tr9kYme2NqA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12658894.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/8/29/irene-brings-rain-flooding-and-end-of-news-as-we-know-it-ire.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>10 Things for Startups to Do in August While Everyone Else is on Vacation</title><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 14:30:21 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/N-FvpExTN2Y/10-things-for-startups-to-do-in-august-while-everyone-else-i.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12622432</guid><description>&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was running Path 101, I'd laugh when people asked me if I was taking vacation.&amp;nbsp; First off, I couldn't actually afford to go anywhere on a startup salary.&amp;nbsp; Second, there was way too much to do.&amp;nbsp; Third, I'm not sure I could have successfully unplugged anyway.&amp;nbsp; The issue was that for the last two weeks in August, there were no VCs around to pitch, no distribution partners to meet with for biz dev deals, and seemingly no one else around actually working for me, the non-technical co-founder to push ahead toward milestones.&amp;nbsp; Even launching new product seemed like a waste of time because no one was paying attention anyway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's a startup to do during these two weeks?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get out of the office for an all-day offsite.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Unplugging to think strategically about product direction, new ideas, or just overall team building can leave you inspired, refreshed, and get you moving in exicting new directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run an internal hackathon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Put aside the Pivotal Tracker.&amp;nbsp; Get your teams building new features with the intention of pushing them to production in 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build up the top of your hiring funnel&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Spend a day combing LinkedIn, Github, Stackoverflow, Twitter, Blogs, etc just building a 50-100 person list of people that look interview-worthy.&amp;nbsp; Chances are, they're not on vacation if they're thinking about leaving, or if they're at another startup that just isn't going anywhere.&amp;nbsp; Start reaching out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have each member of the team queue up a bunch of blog posts.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; It's important to get all the parts of your company talking to the public--to get feedback on strategy, to increase awareness for hiring, and to help promote the company's message.&amp;nbsp; When things are busy, you don't really have a lot of time for this, so get working on it on an off day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your PR pitches out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; If you reach out now, you could see interviews and stories in September.&amp;nbsp; Reporters are always connected, so they might have more time to check out what you're doing now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://www.crunchconnect.com/"&gt;CrunchConnect&lt;/a&gt; to record the sales calls and business development of your whole team, so that you can highlight best practices and spot trouble areas.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Most startups don't do nearly enough sales training, and even less review once someone is onboarded.&amp;nbsp; Taking the time to review what's working and what's not is integral to making sure everyone on your team has the chance to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a designer to class up all your materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; I'm stunned at how few entrepreneurs take the time to get a graphic designer to do their pitch deck for them.&amp;nbsp; You're putting something together that could mean millions in investor capital, and you don't want to spend a couple of hundred bucks to make it look like you didn't just do the deck on the car ride over?&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build up your analytics capability.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; You're probably recording everything, but you've never spent the time to build a real analytics dashboard.&amp;nbsp; Walk into September knowing all your funnels and key metrics after a good two weeks of getting serious about your numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look ahead to the conference schedule.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Where should you be speaking?&amp;nbsp; When will the call for panels be due?&amp;nbsp; Plan your conference calendar and get your speaker pitches done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record some video.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Stock footage of founders talking about company culture, satisfying customers, or CTOs chatting about their philosophies on code can go a long way--for recruiting, for marketing, or even for getting yourself on TV for PR now that everyone knows you can speak so eloquently and that you show well on video.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commented to him that it's too bad that Foursquare couldn't have capitalized on that transaction somehow--and it made me think about the nature of that referral.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't actually the geolocation aspect that created the conversion--although it helped that packet pickup wasn't too far from his office.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't even really the social thing, becuase we didn't try to run together.&amp;nbsp; The overriding piece of data that facilitated that conversion was that Dave was free to do the run yesterday morning.&amp;nbsp; He had an open spot in his calendar, combined with a previously indicated interest in running.&amp;nbsp; To me, there's definitely a business in not just making suggestions for things to do, but helping people make more productive use of their time.&amp;nbsp; Getting Dave's time Sunday morning was a revenue generator not just for the people organizing the race--but perhaps for any number of ancillary businesses.&amp;nbsp; A local brunch place might have suggested a 10am special after he was done--and a smart calendar could have told him who he knew in Park Slope that was also free at that time.&amp;nbsp; The booked race on his calendar in Brooklyn could have been a lead to Uber--since he lives in Manhattan.&amp;nbsp; All that potential revenue was tied to calendar data, and from what I can tell, no one has even come close to the potential value creation here.&amp;nbsp; Few entrepreneurs even have a vision for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I think about it--the way that Facebook owns social, someone should own time--to be the largest depository of data about what I like to do with my time, what my options are, and smartly manage it across the people that show up on my calendar for a myriad of reasons.&amp;nbsp; Moreso than Foursquare or any other geolocation network, my calendar knows where I am at all times and who I'm with--especially when the same events and invitations show up across calendars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current and past efforts in this space have been about calendar sharing--something that nearly no one wants to do.&amp;nbsp; Even worse is the attempts to help me organize my friends.&amp;nbsp; I really don't have any issues asking two close friends to go to the movies--so building your app around a way to "manage" that is never going to achieve any traction.&amp;nbsp; What entrepreneurs really need to start getting keyed in on is the single user proposion--how do you make my calendar smarter, full of more information, and make sure I'm not missing anything I should be.&amp;nbsp; I thought that app might have been Plancast, but signal to noise there is low and it's not a place I wind up spending a lot of time.&amp;nbsp; I send it data, but it's not clear what kind of improved and more valuable data I get back in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever does get this close to how I manage my time is going to build a multi-billion dollar business--because time is money.&amp;nbsp; Nearly every event on my calendar can somehow be tied to a potential revenue transaction.&amp;nbsp; It's just a mattter of figuring out what the initial value prop and how to you create smart time data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/r3sLI_HO_4M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12581897.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/8/23/time-is-money-there-is-a-multi-billion-dollar-business-to-be.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>GroupMe + Skype #frc</title><category>First Round Capital</category><category>Venture Capital &amp; Technology</category><dc:creator>Charlie O'Donnell</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2011 03:24:37 +0000</pubDate><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~3/p8R39GcrqqE/groupme-skype-frc.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">480536:5679911:12585954</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ceonyc/5421698000/" title="Winter @groupme by ceonyc, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5298/5421698000_ffe67060a4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Winter @groupme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GroupMe, a &lt;a href="http://www.firstround.com"&gt;First Round&lt;/a&gt; portfolio company,&lt;a href="http://blog.groupme.com/post/9226372737/dearest-groupme-groupies-we-have-very-exciting"&gt; just announced its acquisition&lt;/a&gt; by Skype.&amp;nbsp; (&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/21/skype-to-acquire-year-old-group-messaging-service-groupme/"&gt;Techcrunch story here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110821/skype-buys-groupme-for-text-based-chatting-services/"&gt;AllThingsD here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/08/21/groupme-acquired-by-skype-for-more-than-50-million/"&gt;Betabeat here&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp; What's cool is that they'll be staying in NYC--a win for the Big Apple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, GroupMe built the very best team in the space, never stopped  iterating, and still has a very big vision for the service.&amp;nbsp; Through Skype,  they&amp;rsquo;ll have a huge distribution channel, so this will be only the beginning for  the company.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to have gotten a chance to work with the Steve,  Jared, and the team there from the very very beginning (&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/26/inception-a-hackday-dream-the-story-of-groupme/"&gt;see  Jared&amp;rsquo;s story of how the company got started&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s exactly the kind of  thing we want to be taking a look at here at First Round&amp;mdash;two people who hack a  compelling product together with a lot of passion and a big vision.&amp;nbsp; I still  contend (&lt;a href="http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2010/8/25/announcing-first-rounds-investment-in-groupme.html"&gt;original investment post here&lt;/a&gt;) that as between blasting out a tweet, telling everyone where you are  with a location checkin, or connecting on a daily basis to a small important group, more  people want to do the latter&amp;mdash;and the sky is the limit for this team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting to be able to see an exit this early in my venture capital career from start (literally) to finish.&amp;nbsp; It was great working with  &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/hlmorgan"&gt;Howard Morgan&lt;/a&gt; with the support of the First Round team on this investment.&amp;nbsp; Steve and Jared run a mile a minute and it was often  tough to keep up with them&amp;mdash;turning around new features everytime we saw them and  closing partners and investors left and right.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me at all  that, within a year, they built a team and a product that one of the marquee  communications companies of our generation&amp;mdash;Skype&amp;mdash;felt was strategically  important to their roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t some kind of talent flip.&amp;nbsp;  A great offer was made that included enough of a shared vision of the future  that it was obvious that Skype was the best place where their ideas could win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats Team GroupMe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thisisgoingtobebig/~4/p8R39GcrqqE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12585954.xml</wfw:commentRss><feedburner:origLink>http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/8/21/groupme-skype-frc.html</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
