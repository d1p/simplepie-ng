      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andredenham.com/Andre_Denham/Blog/Entries/2010/4/14_On_my_soapbox_files/rbhh_0053B.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.andredenham.com/Andre_Denham/Blog/Media/object001_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:420px; height:200px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.my-pastor.com/church-jokes.html&quot;&gt;The Perfect Pastor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From what I’ve seen in many churches, this church joke is only a slight exaggeration!&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Pastor preaches exactly 10 minutes. He condemns sin roundly, but never hurts anyone's feelings. He works from 8 a.m. until midnight, and is also the church janitor.&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Pastor makes $40 a week, wears good clothes, drives a good car, buys good books, and donates $30 a week to the church. He is 29 years old and has 40 years' worth of experience. Above all, he is handsome.&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Pastor has a burning desire to work with teenagers, and he spends most of his time with the senior citizens. He smiles all the time with a straight face because he has a sense of humor that keeps him seriously dedicated to his church. He makes 15 home visits a day and is always in his office to be handy when needed.&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Pastor always has time for church meetings and all of its committees, never missing the meeting of any church organization. And he is always busy evangelizing the unchurched.&lt;br/&gt;The Perfect Pastor is always in the next town over!&lt;br/&gt;If your pastor does not measure up, simply send this notice to six other churches that are tired of their pastor too. Then bundle up your pastor and send him to the church at the top of your list. If everyone cooperates, in one week you will receive 1, 643 pastors. One of them should be perfect.&lt;br/&gt;Have faith in this letter. One church broke the chain and got its' old pastor back in less than three months.&lt;br/&gt;I am going to take a departure from my usually blog topics to get on my soapbox a little bit. I realized recently that I have a LOT of friends who are in the ministry. Because of this I have been privileged to see Pastor’s from the perspective of a church member and the perspective of being a friend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has helped me to have a deeper appreciation for the lifestyle that they have chosen to live. I mentioned this last night on Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/taramiller8/&quot;&gt;@TaraMiller8&lt;/a&gt; responded with what the life of a pastor is in less than 140 characters. Here’s her unedited response “yeah, they have very few friends, lots of critics, are expected to be super human and then chastised for not being human enough.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now I know that pastor’s have a higher calling, and have chosen all on their own to minister to God’s people, but that still doesn’t negate the fact that they are still human. Instead of making life easier for our pastor’s, the majority of us make it harder with our unrealistic expectations of them, back biting, gossiping, power tripping, and overall lack of participation in church ministries. Everyone whose been in a church of any denomination long enough know that 20% of the church members are doing 80% of the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know that all pastor’s aren’t perfect and there are some pastor’s who have no business being behind a pulpit let alone leading a congregation. These types of pastor’s are in the minority. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there was one thing that I want you to leave with as I get off my soapbox it is this:&lt;br/&gt;If you have a pastor that’s doing their best appreciate him/her. &lt;br/&gt;Support them and their family (I don’t even have the time to get into the struggles of pastor’s         spouses and their children)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’m speaking to myself when I right this. </description>

Denham Reading Series. What does reading have to do with becoming a better writer? Well the way I figure, the best way to become successful at something is to either emulate people who are good at that particular thing or analyze people who are terrible a that particular thing in order to figure out what not to do. I’m going to go with the emulating people who are good at it route. I am going to start reading the tons of books that I have sitting on my desk at work and at home and summarize each chapter as I complete it. Hopefully by doing that I will be able to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) finish reading all of these books!&lt;br/&gt;	a)	learn to be concise in my writing &lt;br/&gt;	b)	pass on the information that I have learned to all of you &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book that I have decided to kick this series off with is called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Progress-Paradox-Better-While-People/dp/0679463038&quot;&gt;The Progress Paradox: How life gets better while people feel worse&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregg Easterbrook. I’m really looking forward to where this takes and I hope that you come along for the ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andre</description>

      <description>In reading for one of my classes in the fall,  I came across an interesting neurological phenomena. It’s called “emotional contagion”. In brief &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_contagion&quot;&gt;emotional contagion&lt;/a&gt;  is the tendency  to catch and feel emotions that are similar to and influenced by those of others. What made me do a double take were these statements from the book: “ If you want to accomplish something that demands determination and endurance, try to surround yourself with people possessing these qualities. And try to limit the time you spend with people given to pessimism and expressions of futility. Unfortunately, negative emotions exert a more powerful effect in social situations than positive ones.” “Anger and resentment are the most contagious of emotions; If you are near a resentful or angry person, you are more prone to become resentful or angry yourself.” (The New Brain Restak, R.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that there is scientific, empirical proof for a saying that I have heard since childhood was exciting to me. It helped to reinforce what I already knew. While success cannot be quantified into a simple equation or recipe, you can help yourself greatly by surrounding yourself with the right people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to be the best surround yourself with people who are either the best or wanting to be the best. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to ignorant surround yourself with ignorant people. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to be happy surround yourself with people who are happy. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to be bitter and resentful, surround yourself with bitter and resentful people. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to lose weight surround yourself with people who workout all the time and watch what they eat.&lt;br/&gt;If you want a good relationship/marriage surround yourself with people who want or have the same thing. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to be smart, hang around smart people. &lt;br/&gt;If you want to run a marathon, join a running club. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD START BY LOOKING AT THOSE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever it is that you long for make sure that you at least give yourself a leg up by being around  like minded people. &lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>I know I am being lazy by doing things in this format but if you saw the workload I was under you would understand. That and I want to keep things going in terms of my blog. This Video is 18 MINUTES LONG, but you need to watch the whole thing to get what he’s talking about. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here’s the video. Same instructions as the last one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	1)	Watch the video&lt;br/&gt;	2)	Comment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
