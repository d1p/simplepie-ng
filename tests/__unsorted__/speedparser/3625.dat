<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ETS 118: Survey of American Literature Since 1865</span></strong><br />
<em>ETS 118 is a general survey of U.S. literature, geared at providing students with a cultural and historical context for the major literary movements after the Civil War. The course gives particular attention to relationships between major authors and movements, and identifies predominant aesthetic concerns and modes of representation</em></p>
<p>During each semester I have taught this class—<strong>Fall 2007, Spring 2009, Fall 2009</strong>, <strong>and Spring 2010</strong>— my focus has been on helping students understand major literary movements and writers within the social and cultural contexts that they produced their work. Texts like Abraham Cahan’s immigration stories set alongside Jane Addam’s <em>Twenty Years at Hull House</em> allowed students to think through the relationship between fictional and nonfictional treatments of major social issues, for example. My students also read <em>Fire!!, </em>a literary magazine produced during the Harlem Renaissance, in its original entirety, and developed a sense of how the stories, poems, essays, and advertisements work together to articulate a political stance that exceeds any of the individual texts on its own. Ultimately, as students placed major texts in a sociohistorical context they came to understand how the larger social conflicts and upheavals of the period prompted writers to become dissatisfied with inherited forms of literary representation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ETS 119: Modernity and Geography in American Fiction, 1890-1940</span></strong><br />
<em>ETS 119 is a lower-division course with a specialized thematic and historical focus that is designed to teach students to place literature within its historical context. Students study United States literary and cultural texts in the context of American history, culture, and politics of a specific historical period.</em></p>
<p>During the <strong>Fall 2008</strong> semester students in this class read only four novels, but I assigned a wealth of contextual material to help students make sense of each the novels as its original readers would have. For example, we read Edith Wharton’s House of Mirth for two class sessions, and then paused to read a late-nineteenth-century etiquette manual, Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class, and to examine architectural blueprints and decorating conventions for country manors in the Gilded Age. We then returned to the novel for two class sessions before pausing again, this time to read historically-focused literary criticism about it. We then took a final class session to finish reading and discussing the novel. This approach meant that students moved through the plot of a novel very slowly, taking nearly a full month to progress from beginning to end, all the while immersing themselves in cultural artifacts and related primary texts from the same period as the novel, thereby enhancing their ability to understand the novel as a historically and culturally situated product. This approach was very exciting to my students, who responded with enthusiasm and requested that I provide additional materials that would further explain the cultural and historical contexts surrounding our course texts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ETS 153: Interpretation of Fiction</span></strong><br />
<em>ETS 153 is an introductory literature course that teaches students to develop analytical and interpretive strategies for understanding literature from multiple historical periods, with particular focus on formal, theoretical and interpretive issues.</em></p>
<p>I developed different thematically-focused syllabi for each semester I taught this course. My <strong>Fall 2006</strong> course, subtitled “American Fears and Obscenities,” focused on fiction that has been understood as socially dangerous in the United States, including historical texts like Kate Chopin’s <em>The Awakening</em> which grapples with the nature of women’s roles as wives and mothers, and much more recent texts like <em>Forever, </em>Judy Blume’s controversial novel for adolescents<em>.</em> In <strong>Spring 2007 </strong>I focused the course on the literary movements of romanticism, realism, modernism, and postmodernism, and students read a variety of novels and short stories ranging from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <em>The House of the Seven Gables</em> to Don DeLillo’s <em>White Noise</em>. During <strong>Summer 2007</strong> I focused the course on the concept of the “American dream” and students traced articulations of American “success” and “failure” through their various iterations from Horatio Alger’s 1867 rags-to-riches novel, <em>Ragged Dick,</em> to the 2006 film <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ETS 181: Class and Literary Texts</span></strong><br />
<em>ETS 181 is a lower-division course that encourages students to engage with a particular topic through theoretical engagement with the thorny social issues associated with economic and social class. It asks students to develop an understanding of the construction and representation of “class,” especially as it affects the production and reception of literature, film, and other cultural texts.</em></p>
<p>I taught this course in <strong>Spring 2008</strong> and focused on literary representations of economic and social class in the United States, from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Students who had self-selected into this elective course were highly motivated and strongly invested in the issues with which the course grappled. We examined cultural representations of class in novels like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and Mike Gold’s <em>Jews Without Money</em>; in television shows like <em>Roseanne</em> and <em>All in the Family</em>; and in documentaries and photographs about present-day Appalachia. Throughout the semester students grappled with resolving the economic stratification depicted in these cultural texts and the commonplace assumption that America is a “classless” society.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WRT 104: Introduction to College-Level Writing</span></strong><br />
<em>WRT 104 is a remedial course for first-year students whose writing skills are deemed insufficient for university-level work. This course functions as an introduction to college-level reading and writing practices, particularly learning to compose for college audiences, to read challenging texts actively, to make interpretations and claims, and to collaborate with others. Its goal is to prepare students to enter WRT 105.</em></p>
<p>When I taught this course in <strong>Summer 2006</strong> I found that students needed to spend quite a bit of in-class time developing very specific skills, like summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting, so I began holding class in a computer lab at least once each week. In the lab, students split their computer screens into two windows: one for word processing where they could compose individually, and one for internet chatting where they could instantaneously share a few sentences with the entire class. I simultaneously projected the chat window onto a screen at the front of the lab. Students used the chat room to collaboratively revise sentences and paragraphs in which they were practicing specific writing skills. This use of technology was very productive for the whole class, because it changed both the degree and the nature of our collaborative work. Students gained a palpable sense of being involved in a collective and collaborative endeavor, which I believe dramatically increased the quality of their individual written work.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WRT 105: Practices of Academic Writing</span></strong><br />
<em>WRT 105 is the university’s standard introductory course to college-level academic research and writing. Students enroll in the course during their first semester and focus on the study and practice of writing processes, including critical reading, collaboration, revision, editing, and the use of technologies. The course focuses on the aims, strategies, and conventions of academic prose, especially analysis and argumentation.</em></p>
<p>During <strong>Fall 2004</strong> I taught two sections of this course using the department-wide shared syllabus. Students developed their writing skills through learning the basic conventions of research, analyzing texts and cultural formations, and arguing for their understanding of events. In <strong>Fall 2005 </strong>I again taught one section of WRT 105 and began by using the shared syllabus for freshman composition courses. However, this was a difficult semester for the SU campus, as students forced out of New Orleans universities by Hurricane Katrina began to arrive on our campus, and somewhat later in the semester the SU campus itself exploded in debate over whether bigoted jokes on a student-run comedy show on a campus television station warranted disciplinary action from the administration. I altered my syllabus halfway through the semester to begin dealing extensively with these current events that were profoundly impacting our campus climate. Using the most recent newspaper articles, chancellor’s statements, and other media covering the unfolding events in live time was a tremendously rewarding experience for students as they began to understand the work of a composition course as fundamentally related to the work of being a participating member of their local community.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WRT 205: Critical Research and Writing</span></strong><br />
<em>WRT 205 is an intermediate level course for sophomores that focuses on research in academic writing. It includes the study and practice of critical, research-based writing, including online research techniques, bibliographies, evaluating sources, identifying assumptions and bias, and developing researched expertise in a field.</em></p>
<p>I taught this course during <strong>Spring 2005</strong> and focused on issues of community, geography, and local engagement. Students identified research topics that were specific to the city of Syracuse, and collaboratively built an online database of research articles, archives, and other materials that were specific to the course issues. Students individually located 5-7 sources each, developed summaries of key issues and findings, and posted the information in our class’s collective database. Students then developed informal working groups based on shared sources, and collaborated on assessing and evaluating the quality, biases, conclusions, and intended audiences of the sources they would use for their own writing. This was particularly important because they were working with many nontraditional sources in their quest to engage with the local Syracuse community, and needed to carefully consider issues that would not have come up if they had restricted their research to academic journals.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WRT 670: Graduate Teaching Practicum</span></strong><br />
<em>WRT 670 is a year-long pedagogy practicum for first-year Teaching Assistants in composition. It focuses on developing basic pedagogical skills as well as troubleshooting and brainstorming the practical day-to-day events new TAs face in teaching.</em></p>
<p>In <strong>Fall 2006</strong> and <strong>Spring 2007</strong> I taught beginning instructors how to teach the composition curriculum at SU. I care deeply about teaching, and so in many ways this was one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taught. I worked very closely with each new teacher to prepare their syllabus, formulate daily classroom heuristics, and to develop appropriate writing assignments. As I mentored each new teacher through the semester I focused on helping them calibrate their daily class plans to work toward the semester-long goals for each course.</p>
