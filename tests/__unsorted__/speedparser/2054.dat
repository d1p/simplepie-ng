<blockquote>
  <p>Filming starts on new BBC Two comedy The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff
  Date: 03.10.2011
  Category: TV Ent; BBC Two</p>
  
  <p>BBC Two announces that production is underway on The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff, a new four-part comedy adventure set in the Dickensian world of Jedrington Secret-Past, the up-standing family man and owner of The Old Shop of Stuff, Victorian London&#8217;s most successful purveyor of miscellaneous odd things.</p>
  
  <p>The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff is a BBC In-House production comprising a one-hour Christmas Special followed by three 30-minute episodes to air early next year. It is produced by Gareth Edwards (That Mitchell And Webb Look) and written by Mark Evans, who penned Radio 4 comedy Bleak Expectations, a Victorian adventure about a different set of Dickensian characters.</p>
  
  <p>The series has an impressive ensemble cast led by Robert Webb (That Mitchell And Webb Look) in the role of Jedrington and Katherine Parkinson (The IT Crowd) who plays his wife Conceptiva.</p>
  
  <p>The Christmas special will feature Stephen Fry as the evil lawyer Malifax Skulkingworm alongside David Mitchell (That Mitchell And Webb Look), Celia Imrie (Nanny McPhee), Pauline McLynn (Father Ted) and Johnny Vegas (Ideal). The episode sees Jedrington&#8217;s family incarcerated by Skulkingworm in London&#8217;s infamous prison The Skint, until they can repay a mysterious and vast debt. Will Jedrington rescue his family in time for Christmas or lose them forever? And is there more to the name Secret-Past than meets the eye?</p>
  
  <p>The rest of the series will feature Tim McInnerny (Blackadder), Kevin Eldon (Nighty Night), Sarah Hadland (Miranda) and Derek Griffiths (West End&#8217;s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and sees Jedrington team up with a seemingly charming new business partner Harmswell Grimstone (McInnerny). As the Secret-Past family&#8217;s fortunes rise, it looks like they are built on crumbling foundations indeed, especially when it is revealed that Conceptiva too has a secret that turns out to be even darker than Jedrington&#8217;s own.</p>
  
  <p>Mark Freeland, Head of In-House Comedy, says: &#8220;Mark Evans&#8217;s already well-loved Victorian comic world is a wonderful way to celebrate the bicentenary of Dickens&#8217; birth. He probably wouldn&#8217;t have agreed, but I am very excited.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>Robert Webb adds: &#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to working with my all-time hero David Mitchell. Apparently Stephen Fry is in it too, which is nice.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff has been commissioned by Cheryl Taylor, Controller of Comedy Commissioning and directed by Ben Gosling Fuller (Ideal).</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/09/02/broken-but-in-a-different-way/"><![CDATA[<p>So, no, this isn&#8217;t another in a series of Ltl&#8217;s mental and emotional inventories. This is just a quick update that I fractured my distal fibula when I tripped and fell as I stepped off a curb and into a slight pothole. I spend the next three days hoping I&#8217;d just twisted it and it would get better, but the nature of the pain the the swelling finally brought me to see a doctor on yesterday. A quick x-ray and it was off to the Orthopedics department to be seen and fitted with a boot that I need to wear for the next 3 weeks (fortunately I can take it off to sleep and shower).</p>

<p>This has diverted much of my attention away from the first week of school, as well as being frustrating because I&#8217;d lost 5 lbs from the last time I was at the doctor&#8217;s and now I&#8217;m worried about gaining it all back since I&#8217;ll be doing considerably less exercise. But it could be much worse and I&#8217;ll just need to be more careful with my diet (which I should probably do anyway &#8211; not that I eat poorly, I just have problems with portion control).</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s an update on the physical. Here, you want to see some pics? Click through. I&#8217;m not a big fan of pictures of feet so I&#8217;m not going to put them up on the main page.<span id="more-2189"></span><img src="http://livingtheliminal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sprained_1.jpg" alt="Sprained 1" /><br />
That was when I thought it was sprained. Taken on Monday night.</p>

<p><img src="http://livingtheliminal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/broken.jpg" alt="Broken" /><br />
This is at the doctor&#8217;s office before finding out there was a fracture on my distal fibula. (Fractured Fibula&#8217;s would be a decent band name.)</p>

<p><img src="http://livingtheliminal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/boot.jpg" alt="Boot" /><br />
And this is the boot I&#8217;ll be wearing for the next three weeks.</p>

<p>For the first time in nearly 34 years, I am utterly disappointed and disconnected from the television show <em>Doctor Who</em>. After watching &#8220;Let&#8217;s Kill Hitler&#8221; the other night I have pretty much written off the rest of the season.<sup><a href="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/08/30/why-i-dont-like-steven-moffats-doctor-who/#footnote_0_2185" id="identifier_0_2185" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This must be what older viewers felt like when Colin Baker became the Doctor. I like Colin Baker, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, but from what I&amp;#8217;ve read, many people had a strong reaction against his Doctor and the direction that John Nathan-Turner was taking the show.">1</a></sup> Oh, I&#8217;ll continue to watch, grumbling as I do because if <em>Doctor Who</em> is on, I&#8217;ll watch. But I have such lowered expectations that I&#8217;ll be happy if there are a handful of moments that I enjoy.</p>

<p>Why? Why this negative reaction when so much of the world had finally come to the show and the Doctor is, for the first time, a genuine international hit with a larger fan base than ever before? Am I just being pissy because &#8220;my&#8221; show has become popular? I don&#8217;t think so. Ultimately, my problems are with Steven Moffat&#8217;s running of the show as its current producer and they stem from his weaknesses as a writer. Last night I had a running commentary on Twitter about my reactions and while this metaphor is a bit facile, I think it makes some sense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RTD&#8217;s #DoctorWho was like a decent if impetuous 12 yo scotch. Moffat&#8217;s is like one of those new, flavored vodkas in a fancy bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moffat certainly knows how to be clever and make flashy shows and design intricate story arcs that are detail oriented and that are like jig-saw puzzles and that, when they come together, provide a sense of completion and a bit of awe at just how clever he was. What he cannot seem to do, and I&#8217;ve been waiting for a season and a half for him to get past his &#8220;oh look I have a new toy&#8221; phase to do this, is write complex and interesting characters with any semblance of depth.</p>

<p>This is not new. Neither is it a surprise to those who have followed, and thoroughly enjoyed, some of Moffat&#8217;s shows in the past. Take <em>Coupling</em> for example. One of the funniest comedies done on British television. The timing, the plotting, the dialogue are all pitch-perfect for the genre. Basically Moffat brought back elements of farce to the television comedy that had been lacking in many shows: the intricate plotting and attention to the details of timing and character interactions were breathtaking and hilarious. He moved his characters around a complex, three-dimensional chess board with clarity, intention, and grace. What he did not do, is create deep characters or give them genuine story arcs that changed them over the course of the series. Oh, sure, they changed, to some degree, and there were a few moments here and there that were genuinely human and compassionate moments, but for the most part we knew characters had changed because of something they said or did: we rarely saw the process by which they experienced growth.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, that&#8217;s not a <em>bad</em> thing for the show. It was doing some very specific storytelling and it did it well.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look, for a moment, at his series <em>Jekyll</em>. Compelling to watch, to be sure. But that is almost entirely due to James Nesbitt&#8217;s performance of the Jekyll character. Overall the story is a bit clunky, <em>none</em> of the other characters are compelling or memorable, and if <em>Coupling</em> could be forgiven for some of its stereotyping of women because the men were equally stereotypes, <em>Jekyll</em> demonstrates quite clearly just how bad Moffat is at writing women. Which is bad. Seriously bad. When you can take someone of Gina Bellman&#8217;s talent and turn her into a boring, cardboard cutout of a character who has no depth and no complexity, you are showing a serious shortcoming as a writer.</p>

<p>Actually, now that I think of it, I wonder if one of the reasons the Jekyll character worked so well, was so damned interesting in that series was, beyond Nesbitt&#8217;s performance, the fact that the sociopathic tendencies of Jekyll actually perfectly match Moffat&#8217;s sociopathic attitude toward his characters? Think about it. Moffat deploys characters almost always as a means to a plot end. They are tools to move story and plot and comedy along. Characters don&#8217;t, in the end, <em>mean</em> anything to Moffat. Just as sociopaths don&#8217;t see other people as anything more than a means to their own ends, Moffat treats his characters as functions of a plot, instantiations of a theme, nodes that interact with other nodes to create a flashy narrative and a clever, oh-so-clever plot.<sup><a href="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/08/30/why-i-dont-like-steven-moffats-doctor-who/#footnote_1_2185" id="identifier_1_2185" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is also apparent in Moffat&amp;#8217;s recreation of Sherlock Holmes: none of the secondary characters mean a damn or have any complexity to them.">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But he doesn&#8217;t care about them. Not in the way a good dramatist cares about his/her characters. Say what  you will about Russell  T. Davies (overly sentimental, bombastic plots, overuse of the word &#8220;impossible&#8221;, too much in love with the Daleks, allowing &#8220;Daleks in Manhatten&#8221; and &#8220;The Doctor&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; to exist, etc), you never doubted that he cared, deeply and genuinely, for each and every character that crossed paths with the Doctor and his companions.</p>

<p>Another problem I have with Moffat is just how little agency and action the character&#8217;s seem to have. This is, in large part, because they are cogs in a machine. However, one of the results of this is that they don&#8217;t actually <em>do</em> anything but react to the variables around them, spinning one way only because another cog has spun them in that direction. There was a time when, if the Doctor had been seriously poisoned by the kiss of a beautiful woman and had 32 minutes to live, he would have used his vast knowledge and scientific genius to work up an antidote rather than let himself die, with only the mildest of protestations and just &#8220;hope for the best.&#8221; There was a time when, instead of waving a magic wand around, the Doctor would learn and interact with people and machines, struggling to gain some mastery of a situation that was barely containable, even for him. There was a time when character&#8217;s choose their fates, when their decisions meant something and had consequences. Moffat&#8217;s universe is one of destiny and fate rather than individual choice and the struggle between those choices and how they affect other people.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Doctor may spout off beautiful sounding words, but he doesn&#8217;t act curious, he doesn&#8217;t seem to take an interest in other people. Even at his most self-involved (and the Doctor&#8217;s arrogance is not the issue here—from the beginning, the Doctor has always been arrogant), the Doctor has always been genuinely curious about people and about the worlds he finds himself in. In fact, what made the Doctor&#8217;s arrogance work, was precisely that it was <em>not</em> seen as always justified. Various companions would challenge the Doctor (Sarah Jane Smith, Ace, Donna), while others would simply not accept his world-view completely (Leela, Romana). <em>Yes</em>, they and we knew that the Doctor was special and braver and smarter than we would ever be, and that he had certain kinds of wisdom and that he had lived a long life and that he had seen things in the universe we could only dream of. However, the people around him did not, continually and loudly insist that the Doctor was the greatest, the best, the most awesomest person in the galaxy with near godlike abilities to overcome the greatest of odds by simply being brilliant and ohmygoddon&#8217;tyoulovehimbecauseheisjustsocompletelythegreatestbeinginthewholeuniverseSWOON.</p>

<p>Because the Doctor seems to know all, he is not curious about anyone around him. Not even his companions. Because he already has every angle covered, every contingency planned for, there is no need for curiosity. No need to learn more. No need to grow. Moffat has created a completely self-perpetuating and self-sustaining character. In fact, growth and change would undermine everything that Moffat is working toward with the Doctor: turning him into a kind of god. All powerful deities are not, in the end, all that interesting.</p>

<p>The more powerful you make a character, the less interesting they are. Batman will always be more interesting than Superman because he doesn&#8217;t have superpowers. The Doctor is a man. With 2 hearts and the capacity for a long and varied life and the ability to travel in time. While all that gives him considerable power, he is <em>not</em> a god. He is not a superhero. Throughout most of his existence, he has been a curious, well-intentioned man who makes mistakes, who tries his best to make the world a better place (and does not always succeed), and who has considerable flaws, shortcomings, and blind spots. He is always complemented by companions who do not accept him at his word. Moffat (and, to a lesser but still somewhat culpable degree, Russell T. Davies) is so damned in love with the concept of the Doctor, and is so busy creating an entire universe that spends all its time worshiping or hating the Doctor that there is gradually no room for anyone else to be anything else but a reflection of that glory or hatred. Good guys adore and bad guys hate. Simple, all-encompassing, and, ultimately, boring.</p>

<p>The more times you say &#8220;look at me, I&#8217;m cool&#8221;, no matter how &#8220;ironic&#8221; you are, the less cool you are.</p>

<p>The more times you say &#8220;the Doctor is brilliant&#8221; the more times I wonder why you need to <em>tell</em> me that instead of just letting his actions and compassion and brilliance speak for itself.</p>

<p>Moffat insists on calling out the Doctor&#8217;s brilliance and specialness time and time and time and time again: look how clever and look how brilliant and look how powerful the Doctor is. But as every freshman in a writing seminar knows, the more you tell something the less dramatically interesting that something is. Moffat, with each and every repetition of &#8220;the Doctor is special&#8221; is draining all the narrative interest from the Doctor and replacing it with glibness, godhood, and a flashy exterior.</p>

<p>Like I said, I&#8217;ll still watch, because the show is woven deeply into the fabric of my life, but I&#8217;m not really looking forward to the rest of the season and I don&#8217;t expect to see much that will be genuine or true.<sup><a href="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/08/30/why-i-dont-like-steven-moffats-doctor-who/#footnote_2_2185" id="identifier_2_2185" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Compare the first season&amp;#8217;s meditation on fatherhood in &amp;#8220;Father&amp;#8217;s Day&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;The Curse of the Black Spot&amp;#8221; for an indication of how RTD was concerned with making Doctor Who a truly decent dramatic program and how Moffat just throws in themes glibly and with no attention to the truly complex human emotions that he plays with.">3</a></sup> Oh yes, it&#8217;ll be clever and witty, but it will be hollow and empty as well. While I know Moffat will be with us for several more years, I am already looking forward to his replacement and I just hope that whoever comes next, they will help create a show with compassion, curiosity, and one that genuinely cares about the characters we encounter. Such a show can still be adventurous, dark, scary, silly, and <em>fun</em>. In fact, I would argue that until Moffat&#8217;s tenure, <em>Doctor Who</em> has, on balance<sup><a href="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/08/30/why-i-dont-like-steven-moffats-doctor-who/#footnote_3_2185" id="identifier_3_2185" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I&amp;#8217;m not ignoring the fact that there have been HORRIBLE episodes all throughout its history.">4</a></sup> been all those things and more, but only because we cared about the characters as people and not as pieces on the complex chess-board of Moffat&#8217;s intricate plots.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://livingtheliminal.com/2011/08/26/the-parable-of-the-lovers/"><![CDATA[<p>As part of my schedule, I am writing at least 500 words each morning, Monday through Friday. This morning I was thinking about the hurricane and the title &#8220;The Parable of the Lover&#8217;s&#8221; came to me (partly because of a future PodCastle story and partly because I&#8217;ve been reading Borges). So I wrote this. It&#8217;s not really a story, but it is, I believe, self contained and, but for some small tweaks here and there with word choice, complete. It&#8217;s not really something I could send for publication, so I&#8217;m sharing it here.</p>

<p><strong>THE PARABLE OF THE LOVERS</strong></p>

<p>They held each other as the walls of their small house were assaulted by the winds and rain and general furiousness of a hurricane. They were naked, young, and, if not quite beautiful, had a health and vitality to their bodies that made them, if indeed they were to be observed at a moment like this, quite glorious. They had recently made love loudly and with a passion that was surprising even to them. It must be the storm, they thought, licking sweat from each others bodies and tasting the future of their lives together. Now, they lay in the bed, the wine-red comforter thrown to the floor, the gray sheets tangled near their feet. It was as if they needed to be naked and exposed to this moment, this storm, each other. The wind howled and beat at the windows. Branches, plucked from the weaker trees like so many insect legs pulled off by cruel children, struck the sides of the house, the roof as well, and threatened, if not directly at least by implication of their very being, the welfare of the windows, even with the large x of tape that crisscrossed each pane of glass.</p>

<p>He lay on his back, on the right side of the bed, his right arm tucked back and under his head, his left under her head and curled up, so he could stroke her hair. His naked body was not particularly strong, muscles not particularly defined, but the thick shock of black hair on his head, the sensual lips, and flat belly gave an overall impression of strength. His eyes were slightly too close, and his chin was a bit weak, but these only slightly marred his attractiveness and were more than made up for by the shining intelligence in this brown, too close eyes. His toes were, to be honest, more delicate than usual on a man, and he took a strange pride in this aspect of his body, while at the same time finding such pride vaguely distasteful. He had yet to tell her about this particular constellation of feelings.</p>

<p>She curled against his left side, head on his moderately hairy chest, left arm reaching across his body. She was almost as tall as he, with long, auburn hair that nearly always threatened to go wild and tangled, like it was constantly faced with the gale force winds, no matter how much product she used or how often she brushed it. After reading the works of the Bronte sisters, she had decided, at the age of fifteen, to refer to her hair as &#8220;the tangled heath&#8221;, which she rarely did in front of anyone nowadays, though she had told him this fact after their third time making love and he would sometimes come up behind her in the bathroom in the morning and embrace her and bury his head in her hair and breathe deeply and murmur, my tangled heath, my tangled heath, always saying it twice and always in a low voice that made her shiver and want him deeply inside of her. She had gray eyes, flecked with green. Her skin was pale, and her body sensual: heavy breasts with very pink aureolas, a belly that, while far from fat, was not slender in the least, and thick thighs on long legs.</p>

<p>Sweat and semen cooled, then dried as the storm raged outside. They felt languorous after their lovemaking, lazy. Yet, the winds and the fury outside could not help but make them a little afraid as the power of nature is wont to do when it unleashes itself upon the flimsy constructs of out lives. And this fear, as fear is wont to do, kept the spark of hunger for each other and for the acts of sex burning like an ember in their bellies. But for the moment, they were content to lie together, in silence, she listening to his heartbeat that was, she thought, probably a bit too fast for a resting heartbeat, and he stroking her forehead and hair as he contemplated telling her how he felt about his toes.</p>

<p>All but the first image have been altered through using the the quartz composer&#8217;s film stock effect and I like how they have an almost painterly aspect to them. Since my point &amp; shoot camera has limited zoom, and I tend to push it to the max, often the focus on far away objects seems a bit blurry when you look at the photo full-size. Instead of fighting it, I&#8217;m trying to do some post-production that works with the images limitations to create a dramatic and interesting effect.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think. And constructive criticism is always welcome!</p>
