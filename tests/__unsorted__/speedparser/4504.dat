<description><![CDATA[
<p>Riboflavin or vitamin B<SUB>2</SUB> is one of the constituents of energy drinks. Although this compound is known to be absorbed in the intestine and that it circulates throughout the body and is excreted in urine, the transporter(s) responsible for the process was only recently identified. Yamamoto <I>et al.</I> identified this transporter through functional expression of rat orthologues of a putative bacterial riboflavin transporter.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases by reversible oxidation]]></title>
<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/345?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Oxidation of the catalytic cysteine of protein&ndash;tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), which leads to their reversible inactivation, has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism linking cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and signalling by reactive-oxygen or -nitrogen species (ROS, RNS). This review focuses on recent findings about the involved pathways, enzymes and biochemical mechanisms. Both the general cellular redox state and extracellular ligand-stimulated ROS production can cause PTP oxidation. Members of the PTP family differ in their intrinsic susceptibility to oxidation, and different types of oxidative modification of the PTP catalytic cysteine can occur. The role of PTP oxidation for physiological signalling processes as well as in different pathologies is described on the basis of well-investigated examples. Criteria to establish the causal involvement of PTP oxidation in a given process are proposed. A better understanding of mechanisms leading to selective PTP oxidation in a cellular context, and finding ways to pharmacologically modulate these pathways are important topics for future research.</p>

<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/357?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>G protein-mediated signal transduction can transduce signals from a large variety of extracellular stimuli into cells and is the most widely used mechanism for cell communication at the membrane. The RhoGTPase family has been well established as key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and cell shape changes. Among G protein-mediated signal transduction, G12/13-mediated signalling is one mechanism to regulate RhoGTPase activity in response to extracellular stimuli. The alpha subunits of G12 or G13 have been shown to interact with members of the RH domain containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho (RH&ndash;RhoGEF) family of proteins to directly connect G protein-mediated signalling and RhoGTPase signalling. The G12/13&ndash;RH&ndash;RhoGEF signalling mechanism is well conserved over species and is involved in critical steps for cell physiology and disease conditions, including embryonic development, oncogenesis and cancer metastasis. In this review, we will summarize current progress on this important signalling mechanism.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>We tested the capsid targeted viral inactivation method as an anti-HBV strategy. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with HBV expression plasmid and the plasmid encoding fusion protein of either Core-A3C or Core-humanized renilla GFP (hrGFP). Core-A3C had substantial effect on HBV DNA levels. In the HepG2 cells expressing Core-A3C, the number of G-to-A mutations increased dramatically, whereas other nucleotide substitutions were rare. In addition, Core-A3C substantially inhibited HBV production intracellularly and in culture supernatant. These results suggest that Core-A3C may be a candidate as a novel antiviral agent against human HBV infection.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Molecular cloning of a Pinguiochrysis pyriformis oleate-specific microsomal {Delta}12-fatty acid desaturase and functional analysis in yeasts and thraustochytrids]]></title>
<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/375?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>We isolated a putative desaturase gene from a marine alga, <I>Pinguiochrysis pyriformis</I> MBIC 10872, which is capable of accumulating eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5<sup>5,8,11,14,17</sup>). The gene possessed an open reading frame of 1,314 bp encoding a putative 437 amino acid residues showing high sequence identity (37&ndash;48%) with fungal and nematode 12-fatty acid desaturases. Yeast cells transformed with the gene converted endogenous oleic acid (C18:1<sup>9</sup>) to linoleic acid (C18:2<sup>9,12</sup>). However, no double bonds were introduced into other endogenous fatty acids or exogenously added fatty acids. Flag-tagged enzyme was recovered in the micosome fraction when expressed in yeast cells. To express the gene in thraustochytrids, a construct driven by the thraustochytrid-derived ubiquitin promoter was used. Interestingly, exogenously added oleic acid was converted to linoleic acid in the gene transformants but not mock transformants of <I>Aurantiochytrium limacinum</I> mh0186. These results clearly indicate that the gene encodes a microsomal 12-fatty acid desaturase and was expressed functionally in not only yeasts but also thraustochytrids. This is the first report describing the heterozygous expression of a fatty acid desaturase in thraustochytrids, and could facilitate a genetic approach towards fatty acid synthesis in thraustochytrids which are expected to be an alternative source of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Identification of a 42-kDa Group IV cPLA2-activating protein, cPLAP{gamma}, as a GTP-binding protein in the bovine brain]]></title>
<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/385?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Brain tissue contains multiple forms of Phospholipase A<SUB>2</SUB> (PLA<SUB>2</SUB>) whose activities are involved in intracellular and intercellular signalling related to normal functions such as long-term potentiation, neurotransmitter release, cell growth and differentiation. Among them, we focused on regulatory mechanism of cPLA<SUB>2</SUB>&alpha; (Group IVA cytosolic PLA<SUB>2</SUB>) in brain tissue. In the present study, we report the identification of a cPLA<SUB>2</SUB>-activating protein (cPLAP) in the bovine brain. cPLAP activity appeared as two major peaks with molecular masses of 200 and 42 kDa in a Superose 12 gel filtration FPLC column. The 42-kDa form of cPLAP, designated cPLAP, was further purified using a Mono S FPLC column to near homogeneity and characterized to as a GTP-binding protein (G protein). Metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that cPLAP associates with cPLA<SUB>2</SUB> <I>in vitro</I> and co-immunoprecipitates with [<sup>35</sup>S]-cPLA<SUB>2</SUB>. Notably, cPLAP rendered cPLA<SUB>2</SUB> fully activated at submicromolar concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These results suggest that cPLAP may act as a G protein, activating cPLA<SUB>2</SUB>&alpha; prior to reaching full intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Role of Asp187 and Gln190 in the Na+/proline symporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli]]></title>
<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/395?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Asp187 and Gln190 were predicted as conserved and closely located at the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site in a topology and homology model structure of Na<sup>+</sup>/proline symporter (PutP) of <I>Escherichia coli</I>. The replacement of Asp187 with Ala or Leu did not affect proline transport activity; whereas, change to Gln abolished the active transport. The binding affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> or proline of these mutants was similar to that of wild-type (WT) PutP. This result indicates Asp187 to be responsible for active transport of proline without affecting the binding. Replacement of Gln190 with Ala, Asn, Asp, Leu and Glu had no effect on transport or binding, suggesting that it may not have a role in the transport. However, in the negative D187Q mutant, a second mutation, of Gln190 to Glu or Leu, restored 46 or 7% of the transport activity of WT, respectively, while mutation to Ala, Asn or Asp had no effect. Thus, side chain at position 190 has a crucial role in suppressing the functional defect of the D187Q mutant. We conclude that Asp187 is responsible for transport activity instead of coupling-ion binding by constituting the translocation pathway of the ion and Gln190 provides a suppressing mutation site to regain PutP functional activity.</p>

<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/403?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The small heat shock protein (sHsp), categorized into a class of molecular chaperones, binds and stabilizes denatured proteins for the purpose of preventing aggregation. The sHsps undergo transition between different oligomeric states to control their nature. We have been studying the function of sHsp of <I>Sulfolobus tokodaii</I>, StHsp14.0. StHsp14.0 exists as 24meric oligomer, and exhibits oligomer dissociation and molecular chaperone activity over 80&deg;C. We constructed and characterized StHsp14.0 mutants with replacement of the C-terminal IKI to WKW, IKF, FKI and FKF. All mutant complexes dissociated into dimers at 50&deg;C. Among them, StHsp14.0FKF is almost completely dissociated, probably to dimers. All mutants protected citrate synthase (CS) from thermal aggregation at 50&deg;C. But, the activity of StHsp14.0FKF was the lowest. Then, we examined the complexes of StHsp14.0 mutants with denatured CS by SAXS. StHsp14.0WKW protects denatured CS by forming the globular complexes of 24 subunits and a substrate. StHsp14.0FKF also formed similar complex but the number of subunits in the complex is a little smaller. These results suggest that the dimer itself exhibits low chaperone activity, and a partially dissociated oligomer of StHsp14.0 protects a denatured protein from interacting with other molecules by surrounding it.</p>

<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/411?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Some intracellular proteins involved in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system have microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domains and bind to ESCRT-III protein family members named charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs) at their C-terminal regions containing MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs). While two types of MIMs (MIM1 and MIM2) have been reported, CHMP1B has MIM1 and IST1 has both MIM1 and MIM2. Previously, we demonstrated that CHMP1B and IST1 directly interacted with a tandem repeat of MIT domains of calpain-7 (CL7MIT) and that autolytic activity of calpain-7 was enhanced by IST1 <I>in vitro</I> but not by overexpression of IST1 in HEK293T cells. In this study, we detected enhancement of autolysis of mGFP-fused calpain-7 by coexpression with CHMP1B and observed further activation by additional coexpression of IST1 in HEK293T cells. We found that CL7MIT interacted with the second &alpha;-helical region of CHMP1B but not with the canonical C-terminal region containing MIM1 <I>in vitro</I>. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the interaction between CL7MIT and CHMP1B and between CL7MIT and IST1 became stronger when IST1 or CHMP1B was additionally coexpressed, suggesting formation of ternary complex of calpain-7, IST1 and CHMP1B. Moreover, subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increase of calpain-7 in membrane/organelle fractions by concomitant overexpression of these ESCRT-III family member proteins.</p>

<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/423?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>To study the relationship between translation and replication of encephalomyocarditisvirus (EMCV) RNA, we established a cell-free RNA replication system by employing a human cell extracts-based <I>in vitro</I> translation system. In this system, a <I>cis</I>-EMCV RNA replicon encoding the <I>Renilla luciferase</I> (R-luc) or GFP and the viral regulatory proteins efficiently replicated with simultaneous translation of the encoded protein. To examine how translation of the replicon RNA, but not the translated products, affected replication, a <I>trans</I>-EMCV RNA replicon encoding R-luc and the RNA replication elements was next constructed. The <I>trans</I>-replicon RNA replicated only in the presence of the regulatory proteins pre-expressed in <I>trans</I>. Incubation with cycloheximide, puromycin or a dominant-negative eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A following expression of the regulatory proteins almost completely inhibited not only translation of the <I>trans</I>-replicon RNA but also replication of the RNA, suggesting that EMCV RNA translation promotes replication of the RNA. In conclusion, the cell-free RNA replication systems should become useful tools for the study of the viral RNA replication.</p>

<link>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/150/4/431?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p><I>Candida albicans</I> is a commensal organism, but causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Certain factors such as yeast-hyphae transition and hydrolytic enzymes are suggested as virulence attributes of <I>C. albicans</I>. Among them, 10 types of secreted aspartic protease (<I>SAP</I>) genes have received particular attention as a major virulence gene family. However, their full functional repertoire, including its biochemical properties, remains to be elucidated. Hence, we purified all Sap isozymes using <I>Pichia pastoris</I> and comprehensively determined and compared their biochemical properties. While optimum pH of Sap7 was 6.5 and that of Sap8 was 2.5, presence of other Sap isozymes functioning within a broad range of optimum pH could allow <I>C. albicans</I> to survive and cause infections in various tissues. The substrate specificities of Sap isozymes were analysed by using FRETS-25Xaa libraries. Sap7 and Sap10 showed high substrate specificity, while other Sap isozymes had broad substrate specificities. Principal component analysis revealed that the 10 Sap isozymes were clustered into 3 distinct groups in terms of their substrate specificities. Interestingly, Sap4&ndash;6, which are coproduced in the hyphal form, were clustered as the same group, indicating that they may target similar host proteins. These results will lead to further understanding of <I>C. albicans</I> pathogenicity.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>We previously isolated phage antibodies from a phage library displaying human single chain antibodies (scFvs) by screening with a mannotriose (Man3)-bearing lipid. Of four independent scFv genes originally characterized, 5A3 gene products were purified as fusion proteins such as a scFv-human IgG1 Fc form, but stable clones secreting 1A4 and 1G4 scFv-Fc proteins had never been established. Thus, bacterial expression systems were used to purify 1A4 and 1G4 scFv gene products as soluble forms. Purification of 1A4 and 1G4 scFv proteins from inclusion bodies was also carried out together with purification of 5A3 scFv protein in order to compare their Man3-binding abilities. The present studies demonstrated that 1A4 and 1G4 scFv proteins have a higher affinity for Man3 than 5A3 scFv protein, which may determine whether scFv-Fc proteins expressed in mammalian cells are retained in the ER or secreted. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of anti-Man3 1G4 scFv and anti-Tn antigen scFv proteins on MCF-7 cell growth were evaluated. Despite the fact that no obvious difference was detected in cell growth, microscopic observations revealed inhibition of foci formation in cells grown in the presence of the anti-carbohydrate scFv proteins. This finding provides a basis for the development of cancer therapeutics.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Neural-restrictive silencer (NRS) has been well characterized in SCG10 and many other neuron-specific genes; it is, however, unknown whether the promoters of the SCLIP and RB3 genes (two other SCG10 family members) share basal transcriptional mechanisms with SCG10 or not. To explore how NRS-mediated neural-specific gene transcription has evolved, we determined the genomic and promoter structures of the SCLIP gene, and found that the gene retained an NRS-like element that functioned as a negative regulator in non-neuronal cells. However, unlike the NRS in the SCG10 gene, this NRS<sup>SCLIP</sup> was located downstream of the transcription start site, and showed a position-dependent repressing activity. Further gel-shift and NRS factor (NRSF) co-transfection experiments revealed that NRS<sup>SCLIP</sup> was bound and regulated by NRSF. Such an element was not found in the gene promoter of RB3, suggesting that the NRS&ndash;NRSF regulatory system evolved once SCLIP had diverged from RB3 or stathmin.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Cerium oxide (CeO<SUB>2</SUB>) is an important metal oxide used for industrial products. Many investigations about the cellular influence of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles have been done, but results are contradictory. It has been reported that CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles have an anti-oxidative effect in cells, but it has also been reported that CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles induce oxidative stress. We investigated the potential influence on cells and the mechanisms induced by CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles <I>in vitro</I>. We prepared a stable CeO<SUB>2</SUB> culture medium dispersion. Cellular responses in CeO<SUB>2</SUB> medium-exposed cells were examined. Cellular uptake of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles was observed. After 24-h exposure, a high concentration of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles (~200 mg/ml) induced an increase in the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS); a low concentration of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles induced a decrease in the intracellular ROS level. On the other hand, exposure of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticle for 24 h had little influence on the cell viability. Exposure of CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles increased the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and also Calpain was activated. These results suggest that CeO<SUB>2</SUB> nanoparticles have a potential to induce intracellular oxidative stress and increase the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, but these influences are small.</p>
