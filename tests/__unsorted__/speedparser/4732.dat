&lt;p&gt;Here is an update on how I&#039;m doing on http//&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.empireavenue.com/sbushfan11&quot;&gt;www.empireavenue.com/sbushfan11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stock price is 79.19 my dividends is 0.74/share and I have 3 million in net wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stock has it&#039;s up&#039;s and downs of late mostly staying up as for my dividends it&#039;s been going down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been doing a lot of social media action of late to help get my dividends up and I have not given up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My earnings have been good up to now and I will make sure they stay good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been on empire avenue since May and my stock has gone from 10.00 all the way to 79.19 as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would to thank all of my stock holders for staying with me through the up&#039;s and downs my stock has been through lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so happy I bought 200 shares of Chris Pirillo I have made a lot of eaves on empire avenue I never sold not one share of Chris Pirillo ever and it has paid off big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I have 410 stock holders and I own 465 stocks on empire avenue as of right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my stock one day will hit 100.00e some day until then you never know what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway I hope to get my dividends and my stock going back up again and make people some eaves to spend on other stocks and I hope to make some eaves too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so happy that my stock got this far from when it first started to where is now at 79.19e and it will hit 100.00e one of these days can&#039;t until that happens so thanks everyone who bought shares in my stock and good luck to you all.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Many consider cars synonymous with freedom. Cars allow you to go places and have experiences that you otherwise wouldn’t. That’s why it’s so exciting that cars are now being equipped with lots of new features, including technology that can essentially meld your car with the Internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford recently unveiled the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/12/ford-evos-cloud-connected-concept-car-unveiled-at-frankfurt/&quot;&gt;Evos&lt;/a&gt;, a car that learns your driving preferences and uses its Internet connection to provide traffic information and other useful details. It can tailor the suspension and driving modes based on your driving style and ability. It can also detect the driver’s heart rate. The Evos is a concept car, but Ford plans to release a similar model within the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnStar offers “RemoteLink,” an application for your iPhone or Android, which allows Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, or GMC owners to view real-time data including fuel range, gallons of gas remaining, and lifetime MPG, lifetime mileage, remaining oil life, tire pressure, and account information. Chevrolet Volt owners can view their car’s electric range, electric miles, MPG, and the battery’s state of charge, as well. Users can also remotely perform certain commands, such as unlocking doors, with this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/science/10google.html&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google “has been working in secret but in plain view on vehicles that can drive themselves, using artificial-intelligence software that can sense anything near the car and mimic the decisions made by a human driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this technology is the potential for Internet-connected vehicles to communicate through the cloud, working in tandem to prevent accidents, conserve fuel, and facilitate a more efficient flow of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a big stretch from my heavy old 1970 Chevy Impala!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for security &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvDFHgTHth0&quot;&gt;evolved with the Internet&lt;/a&gt; as more companies developed internal and external networks. That was the network security era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as companies leverage the power of the web, information security has evolved yet again: We are in the application security era. And as big companies get better at locking down their software and protecting their data, criminals are targeting the little guy. Ordinary citizens’ every day digital lives are at risk via infected web pages, instant messaging, phishing, Smartphone viruses, text message scams and now hackers are targeting Macs in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 20 years, e-commerce and social media have taken over. The numbers behind the explosive growth of cybercrime are astounding. In a little over two decades, we’ve gone from less than 500 pieces of malware to over 55 million annually. Cybercrime has evolved from nothing to a multibillion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, 8069 unique pieces of malware were detected. One out of 20 emails were spam, and the Melissa virus infected hundreds of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, 56,342 unique pieces of malware were detected, mostly on PCs, but some began spreading to Macs. Then smartphones got the Cabir virus. The “I Love You” worm slithered its way onto millions of PCs, and the MyDoom worm slowed down the entire Internet by 10%, resulting in loses totaling 38 billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, 164,000 unique pieces of malware were detected, including the first virus for Mac OS X and another 83 mobile viruses. 57 million U.S. adults fell for phishing scams via 17,877 different spoof websites. 80% of all email was spam. The Conficker worm, Zeus Trojan, Koobface, Applescript.THT, Storm botnet, and Ikee iPhone virus all made their debuts this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2010, 54 million unique pieces of malware were spreading to tablets, too. More than 90% of all email was spam. 27% of teens infected their families’ PCs with viruses in 2010. Almost 420,000 phishing sites were discovered. OpinionSpy, Boonana, and MacDefender infected Macs. Hackers commandeered Skype’s instant messaging service to deliver malware. The Gemini and Zitmo Trojans gathered location data and stole financial transaction information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that’s not enough. In 2010, more than three million malicious websites were created, any one of which could infect your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is are you protected? Are you using some free download by an unknown company to protect yourself? Or do you have a comprehensive multi layer approach to digital security protecting all your devices?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertsiciliano.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-blog-sep-fake-profiles.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-5066&quot; title=&quot;img-blog-sep-fake-profiles&quot; src=&quot;http://robertsiciliano.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-blog-sep-fake-profiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social fakes” are invented profiles on social media (often referred to as profile misrepresentation), which can be used to harass or mock victims anonymously. But the more lucrative fake profile is one that imitates a legitimate business, damaging that business’s online reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposters’ ultimate goal? Spam leading to scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social-web security provider &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.impermium.com/2011/08/31/debut-impermium-index-reveals-surprising-trends-in-social-web-spam-attacks/&quot;&gt;Impermium&lt;/a&gt; published the results of their recent analysis of the cost of social spam. “Online ID signup fraud” is an emerging trend, with fraudulent accounts ranging from a low of 5% to 40% of users. “Scammers are registering accounts by the millions as they perpetrate fake “friend requests,” deceptive tweets, and the like, while the black market for bulk social networking accounts is growing exponentially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also warned about social web abuse, describing current “sleeper cells” as “a ticking time bomb.” Last month, more than 30,000 fraudulent accounts coordinated an attack, in which attackers submitted more than 475,000 malicious wall posts in one hour. According to Impermium, “Even accounts you’ve had for years could be lying in wait for just the right moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple issues stem from fake accounts, such as brand damage for both the website and its users, scams being perpetrated on existing or potential customers, and for social networking websites, an inflated, incorrect summation of active subscribers—to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media sites can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iovation.com/online-retail&quot;&gt;iovation’s device reputation&lt;/a&gt; service to help identify fraudsters at account setup. When a device (or related group of devices) signs up for more than your allotted number of accounts, you can receive alerts on this behavior. When multiple countries are logging into the same accounts within a specified timeframe, you can set alerts on this activity. When users are constantly changing their device attributes between multiple online registrations (to look like new, legitimate consumers), you can know this immediately—and automatically deny the new accounts outright or send them to your fraud review queue. If 1,000 accounts were just set up from the same machine, one after another, wouldn’t you want to know that while it’s happening so you can do something before the scams start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on information provided by the user, which may not be honest or accurate, device reputation technology goes deeper, identifying the computer being used to register an account. This exposes negative behaviors right away, allowing a website operator to deny access to threatening accounts before your business reputation is damaged and your users are abused.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The neighbors were quoted as saying stuff like “we never see a police car around” etc and the police respond by saying “the government can’t do everything anymore, the chief said. “We simply need more help from the communities we serve. Most of it is eyes and ears, and picking up the phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief suggested everyone pay attention and even start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/neighborhood-works-together-to-fight-crime.aspx&quot;&gt;neighborhood watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of these posts know I’m all about taking personal responsibility. And while law enforcements role is to serve and protect, it is impossible to have a police car parked in every driveway. The fact that this neighborhood doesn’t even have a neighborhood watch in place is telling. These are people who simply aren’t proactive. Windows and doors are unlocked, and it seems residents don’t have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;home security alarms&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ll be they are installing them now.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Iron Skull- Effect, If you die you restart the level&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Iron Skull” is located at the very end of the first level, “Sierra 117″. It is located behind the building where Sgt. Johnson is being held captive, up on the roof. You can gain access to the roof on the far right side of the building. Travel all the way over to the left side of the roof, and the Skull will be concealed in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;

Gold Skulls (you get acheivments for these)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iron Skull- Effect, If you die you restart the level&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Iron Skull” is located at the very end of the first level, “Sierra 117″. It is located behind the building where Sgt. Johnson is being held captive, up on the roof. You can gain access to the roof on the far right side of the building. Travel all the way over to the left side of the roof, and the Skull will be concealed in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Black Eye- Effect, The only way th gain health is to melee and enemy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This Skull is located in the beginning of the second level “Crow’s Nest”, the very room you start in. Hanging down from the ceiling is some piping. On top of this piping, on the side nearest to the large display (the one that Hood appears on) lies the “Black Eye Skull”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tough Luck- Effect, Your enemies are stronger&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Catch Skull” is found on the third level, at the point in the level when the huge covenant cruiser flies overhead. On your left is some large piping following the road you are walking on. Underneath this piping are some support beams that extend out over a cliff. Jump onto the first of these beams, and travel to the end of it. Look to your left, and the Tough Luck Skull will be sitting on a rock extending from a cliff edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Catch- Effect, Your Enemies throw A LOT of grenades&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Catch Skull” can be found on the fourth level, in the first area where you need to destroy the Wraith Tanks. When you enter this area, do not eliminate the Wraith Tanks (The skull appears when the tanks appear, and disappears when the tanks are destroyed). The Skull is located on top of the circular building next to the Anti-Air Tank. You can access the roof using a grenade jump, or jumping on the back of a hog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fog- Effect, no motion sensor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Fog Skull is found on the level “Floodgate“, at the very beginning of the level. As you are walking down from the anti-air gun you destroyed in the previous mission, you encounter a ramp (next to a missile launcher). Around this ramp, you hit a checkpoint. At this point, you should also hear a marine yelling, “There! Over There!”.&lt;br /&gt;
You have a small window of opportunity at this point, but it is fairly easy to get the Fog Skull. Look up, and to the right, directly at the roof of the building next to the missle launcher. There is a single flood form (not to be mistaken with the two other flood forms jumping in front of you) which is holding the skull. Kill him before he jumps, and he will drop the skull down to the ground where you can retrieve it. Too early, and the skull will get stuck on the roof though, so just time it carefully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Famine-Effect, Enemies drop half of the normal amount of ammo&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This skull requires a bit of grenade jumping skill/luck.&lt;br /&gt;
You can find the “Famine Skull” on the sixth level, near the point where the path you follow branches off into two sections (one leading to the area where you need to let the tanks across the bridge, and the other leading towards the area where you meet up with the frigate). Take the right path, as you would if you were completing the mission, and you’ll notice a structure above you / to the left of you (near the area where you encounter a few ghosts).&lt;br /&gt;
You need to scale the rocks to the right of the structure, and then travel across it so that you pass 3 of the large support beams extending into the cliffs. Inside of the fourth support beam, lies the Famine Skull. A well placed grenade should have you up there in no time!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thunderstorm-Effect, Enemies rank up&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Thunderstorm Skull” can be found on the level, “The Covenant”, after you take command of one of the Hornet vehicles. Fly towards the second force field generator (the one the Arbiter disabled), and land. The skull is waiting at the very top, at the end of the ramp extending over the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tilt-Effect, Gives Enemies stronger armor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Tilt Skull” is found on the level “Cortana”, in the circular room where Cortana mentions that she “Likes to play games too…”.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a bit difficult to get to, as it requires getting on top of the ceiling of the room. Upon entering the room, head towards the left side where you will see some mushroom shaped extrusions along the wall. Get on top of these, and then look up and towards the right for another set of extrusions. Jump to these. From here, you should be able to jump on top of the ceiling of the room, where the Tilt Skull lies in the center.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mythic-Effect,Enemies have double health&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is probably the easiest Golden skull in the game to get. It is located in the very beginning of the final level in Halo 3. Begin by heading into the canyon, but hug the right wall. Very soon, you will notice that there is a turn to the right that is off the normal trail. Head a bit down this path, and the “Mythic Skull” will be sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Silver Skulls (no acheivments)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blind-Effect, You lose your HUD (you won&#039;t see your gun radar etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Blind Skull” is the first of the Silver Skulls in Halo 3, and can be found in the first mission, “Sierra 117″. It is located relatively close to the beginning of the mission.&lt;br /&gt;
After your first encounter with the Gold Armor Brute, Two enemy dropships will appear a bit further down the stream. Go towards the dropship that is furthest away, and stay on the right side of the stream. Continue along the right (towards the cliff edge), and a rock will jut out a bit over the large lake. The Blind Skull is located on this rock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Grunt Birthday Party-Effect, When you get a headshot on an enemy Grunt, they will explode into confetti, and you’ll hear children cheer, “Yay!” in excitement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is one of the more fun Silver Skulls in Halo 3. The “Grunt Birthday Party Skull” is located on the second mission, “Crow’s Nest”, just before the area where you team up with the Arbiter (it’s the piping area where you see Drones buzzing in and out of an array of pipes). Just before you jump down the pipe to meet up with the Arbiter, stop at the ledge, and look directly below you. Along the wall that you drop down, there is a small ledge with a green arrow pointing backwards. Jump onto this ledge (rather than all the way down), and go inside this secret room. The skull is in the dead center of the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cowbell-Effect, You do more damage to you enemies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “Cowbell Skull” is found on the level “The Ark”, and marks the third Silver Skull found in the game. It’s fairly far into the level, so it takes a bit of time to find it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Begin by heading all the way to the part of the level where you battle the Scarab. After defeating it, look in the middle of the desert area which you battled it in for a fairly large structure (it’s the building you see if you are at the bottom of the ramp you are supposed to go up, and turn to look in the opposite direction). Inside of this structure are several Gravity Lifts (shown below). Take one of these for later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IWHBYD- Effect, Unlocks hidden dialogue throughout Halo 3’s campaign&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IMPORTANT! START FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION, ON NORMAL, HEROIC, OR LEGENDARY IN ORDER TO GET ANY SKULL!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Skull is located in the level, “The Covenant”. After defeating the Scarabs, and going inside, get to the location with all 7 Ring Holograms. You must jump through the rings in a specific order. That order is as follows (1 is at the entrance, 7 is at the end):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Update: Max Fightmaster pointed out that only about the last half of the sequence is needed. Thanks! Now it’s been confirmed that only the last 7 notes are needed.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4 6 5 4 5 3 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These rings also produce the notes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E G F# E F# D E&lt;br /&gt;
After jumping through them in this sequence, you will be awarded the “I Would Have Been Your Daddy Skull”. It will be right next to the bridge that brings you over to the Prophet of Truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: YOU MAY NEED TO KILL THE PROPHET OF TRUTH, AND THE FLOOD BEFORE DOING THE RING JUMPS!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great work Everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Special Notes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This skull was found with the help, investigation, and research of the entire community, not just a few people. We’d like to thank everyone for their participation in the Skull Hunt!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you jump through the final halo, the rings will start lighting up in a linear fasion. Go grab the Skull over at the Bridge that connects to the Control Panel. When you grab the skull, all of the rings will start playing the main Halo Theme Song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can work as a team in co-op with 2-4 players jumping through the rings to speed up the process. Just make sure that the rings are jumped through in the correct order as a team. It really speeds things up this way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you mess up, you can start the sequence over without restarting the mission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some people believe that you may need to finish the level to get the skull. It’s worked both ways according to reports.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here is a video. It’s very long, and we messed up the sequence once on accident, but this is it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank You for reading&lt;br /&gt;
GT Gregnstich&lt;br /&gt;

NOTE: These skulls only work in campaign, not xbox live</content>

&lt;p&gt;Many consider cars synonymous with freedom. Cars allow you to go places and have experiences that you otherwise wouldn’t. That’s why it’s so exciting that cars are now being equipped with lots of new features, including technology that can essentially meld your car with the Internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford recently unveiled the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/12/ford-evos-cloud-connected-concept-car-unveiled-at-frankfurt/&quot;&gt;Evos&lt;/a&gt;, a car that learns your driving preferences and uses its Internet connection to provide traffic information and other useful details. It can tailor the suspension and driving modes based on your driving style and ability. It can also detect the driver’s heart rate. The Evos is a concept car, but Ford plans to release a similar model within the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnStar offers “RemoteLink,” an application for your iPhone or Android, which allows Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, or GMC owners to view real-time data including fuel range, gallons of gas remaining, and lifetime MPG, lifetime mileage, remaining oil life, tire pressure, and account information. Chevrolet Volt owners can view their car’s electric range, electric miles, MPG, and the battery’s state of charge, as well. Users can also remotely perform certain commands, such as unlocking doors, with this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/science/10google.html&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google “has been working in secret but in plain view on vehicles that can drive themselves, using artificial-intelligence software that can sense anything near the car and mimic the decisions made by a human driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this technology is the potential for Internet-connected vehicles to communicate through the cloud, working in tandem to prevent accidents, conserve fuel, and facilitate a more efficient flow of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a big stretch from my heavy old 1970 Chevy Impala!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/082511-banks-business-fraud-250120.html?fsrc=netflash-rss&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, “The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) polled 77 financial institutions and asked how many account takeovers occurred in 2009 and during the first six months of 2010. The FS-ISAC consists of a group of banks that shares threat information and interacts with the federal government on critical infrastructure issues. Its members include Citi, Prudential, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, among others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account takeover occurs when thieves infiltrate your existing bank or credit card account and siphon out your money. This typically occurs after your account has been hacked or your credit card or personal identity has been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 of the institutions polled reported a total of 108 commercial account takeovers during the first six months of 2010, compared to 86 for the full year of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, 36% of fraud attempts were successfully thwarted, whereas 2009, fraud was only prevented 20% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously referenced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javelinstrategy.com/news/1170/92/Identity-Fraud-Fell-28-Percent-in-2010-According-to-New-Javelin-Strategy-Research-Report/d,pressRoomDetail&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Javelin Strategy: “When examining account takeover trends, the two most popular tactics for fraudsters were adding their name as a registered user on an account or changing the physical address of the account. In 2010, changing the physical address became the most popular method, with 44 percent of account takeover incidents conducted this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, FS-ISAC’s study failed to disclose what methods were used to thwart the account takeovers. Many financial institutions are protecting their users and themselves by incorporating device identification, device reputation, and risk profiling services to keep scammers out. Oregon-based iovation Inc. offers the world’s leading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iovation.com/rm-360/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;device reputation service&lt;/a&gt;, ReputationManager 360, which is used by leading financial institutions to help mitigate these types of risk in their online channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Also I have met great people from the USA and all over the world, and made great friends too like all of the Op&#039;s like Kat and Chris Pirillo too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first joined the chat room I was scared and I thought I was crazy but I stayed and have never looked backed since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I enjoyed all of my great four years in the chat room watching Chris do stuff that I would never do like wearing a dress not once but twice and also hit 50,000 and 100,000 YouTubers I can&#039;t wait until Chris hits 200,000 YouTubers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway what will happen next who knows all I know is it will be recorded by Kevoc2008 or me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have joined many great communities like &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeks.pirillo.com&quot;&gt;http://geeks.pirillo.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;http://www.twitter.com&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; and http://www/empireavenue.com &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen it all on the live stream from Chris wearing a dress to pretty much everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chat room  has help me a lot and I thank everybody in the chat room for all of their help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed being in the chat room on Fridays when Chris gave away the web cams  I never won any of the give away&#039;s for the webcams I did come very close at times but never won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always look forward to New Years Eve you never know what might happen and it has happen like Chris having to wear makeup and a dress to who knows what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed all of my four years here and to many more great years to come from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&#039;t wait until the next big thing in tech who knows what it will be but you know that we will all be there to see it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://live.pirillo.com&quot;&gt;http://live.pirillo.com&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway thanks everyone for last four years I have been here and hope to many more :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently Nicolas Cage at one time didn’t believe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/home-security&quot;&gt;home security systems&lt;/a&gt;. He recently filmed a movie called “Trespass” about thieves’ who con their way into the opulent mansion where Cage’s character lives with his unhappy wife (played by Nicole Kidman) and their daughter, Reuters &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/14/us-toronto-trespass-idUSTRE78D7RY20110914&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The tagline for the title is: “When terror is at your door, you can run, or you can fight.” I recommend running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cage was quoted saying “It was two in the morning. I was living in Orange County at the time and was asleep with my wife. My two-year old at the time was in another room. I opened my eyes and there was a naked man wearing my leather jacket eating a Fudgesicle in front of my bed,” he told reporters. “I know it sounds funny … but it was horrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t sound funny to me at all. Luckily the man was capable of being talked to and Cage talked him out of the house. Police arrived and arrested him. The man was relatively harmless, he was mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cage was also quoted saying that after the incident he could no longer stay in that home and has since moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People whose homes are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/articles/how-to/dealing-with-home-burglary.aspx&quot;&gt;burglarized&lt;/a&gt; or homes invaded often feel a constant sense of un-ease in a home that has been violated like that. Your home is your castle and is supposed to be a place of relief, solitude, safety and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; from the sometimes big, bad, ugly, world. When it’s “soiled” like that, the stink never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The burglar apparently sauntered up her driveway and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/book-recalls-serial-killer-massachusetts-home-invasion.aspx&quot;&gt;jiggled the door&lt;/a&gt; of an unlocked car in the driveway. The door was open and of course the keys were in the ignition along with the garage door opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all the burglar needed to open the door, head inside and make himself a tasty snack (pastries, I love pastry, I’m Italian you know.). Meanwhile as he’s munching away he drew himself a nice warm bubble bath. I’ll bet Celine Dion has nice bubbles and a nicer bath. Must be as big as my whole first floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celine actually had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/home-security&quot;&gt;home alarm&lt;/a&gt;, but apparently it doesn’t have a siren, I don’t know. Or maybe the burglar was hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monitored home &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; system can be as little as $99.00 installed then a dollar a day for monitoring. Celine Dion probably makes $99.00 in a matter of seconds when she’s headlining and performing at the Coliseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the short money that a home alarm costs, she should have one that has a siren. Ya think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the Dion’s, they were traveling. If you travel away from your home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t leave your keys in your unlocked car in your driveway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use timers on indoor and outdoor lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let a trusted neighbor and the police know you are traveling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unplug garage door openers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If grass is still growing where you live and if you’re gone for a bit have a landscaper mow your lawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t share your travel plans on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/your-status-is-important-to-others.aspx&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; or on a voicemail outgoing message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock everything of significant value in a safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a home security camera system and home security alarm system.&lt;/li&gt;

Than its most greasy and very high on salt, flour, carbs, red meat, ect. By eating all this kind of food most likely we are not evacuating very well. And if we are not, where all that food goes or were is it? it still in your stomach, yes you might be holding food from years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guns, guns, guns. Americans love their guns. Guns definitely are a layer of security. They can save your life and they can also be used against you and they can also get you in lots and lots of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elderly man is now facing two counts of armed assault with intent to murder, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building for shooting 2 people outside of his home. He believed they were trying to get in, and his belief was affirmed when one of them tossed a boulder through one of his windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attorney &lt;a href=&quot;http://itemlive.com/articles/2011/09/08/news/news01.txt&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; “This is the victim here, an 82-year-old man with no criminal record. He defended life and property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Assistant District Attorney was quoted saying “We don’t live in a place where you can just fire from a window. It is fortunate no one died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely isn’t a good idea to shoot someone outside of your home even on your property. However in some states the laws side with homeowners when shooting trespassers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appeared on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhBA17l_cxQ&quot;&gt;Maury Povich show&lt;/a&gt; to discuss weaponry and self defense. The premise was the shows subjects were facing jail time or in jail because they killed their attackers, which almost happened in the above scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the subjects were victims of domestic violence where others were victims of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/5-tips-to-help-prevent-a-home-invasion.aspx&quot;&gt;home invasions&lt;/a&gt; or stalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe the guy “jumped the gun”, maybe he was legitimately at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first layer of protection should always be locked secure doors and windows. A monitored &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/home-security&quot;&gt;home security&lt;/a&gt; alarm should run parallel to a secure perimeter. In the above situation with a proper alarm that included glass break sensors, law enforcement would have been alerted the moment the glass broke. The piecing alarm may have also made the burglars think twice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertsiciliano.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-blog-sep-auto-scams.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-5060&quot; title=&quot;img-blog-sep-auto-scams&quot; src=&quot;http://robertsiciliano.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-blog-sep-auto-scams.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online auction and classifieds websites are unwittingly participating in car sale scams. Ads gain credibility by appearing on eBay, Craigslist, and other online automobile sales websites, but some are either completely phony or have been copied and pasted from other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 14,000 complaints from 2008 through 2010, from consumers who have been victimized, or at least targeted, by these auto sale scams. Of the victims who lost money, the total dollar amount is staggering: nearly $44.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2011/august/car_081511/car_081511&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; how the scam works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consumers find a vehicle they like—often at a below-market price—on a legitimate website. The buyer contacts the seller, usually through an e-mail address in the ad, to indicate their interest. The seller responds via e-mail, often with a hard-luck story about why they want to sell the vehicle and at such a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the e-mail, the seller asks the buyer to move the transaction to the website of another online company….for security reasons….and then offers a buyer protection plan in the name of a major Internet company (e.g., eBay). Through the new website, the buyer receives an invoice and is instructed to wire the funds for the vehicle to an account somewhere. In a new twist, sometimes the criminals pose as company representatives in a live chat to answer questions from buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the funds are wired, the buyer may be asked by the seller to fax a receipt to show that the transaction has taken place. And then the seller and buyer agree upon a time for the delivery of the vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers should watch out for the following red flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars are advertised at too-good-to-be true prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sellers want to move transactions from the original website to another site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sellers claim that a buyer protection program offered by a major Internet company covers an auto transaction conducted outside that company’s website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sellers refuse to meet in person or allow potential buyers to inspect the car ahead of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sellers who say they want to sell the car because they’re in the U.S. military about to be deployed, are moving, the car belonged to someone who recently died, or a similar story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sellers who ask for funds to be wired ahead of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online classified and auction websites could work together, and share information on the devices running these scams, through the device reputation service provided by iovation Inc. Their fraud detection service, called&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iovation.com/rm-360/&quot;&gt;ReputationManager 360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is a B2B SaaS solution incorporating complex device identification, device reputation and real-time risk profiling. It is used by hundreds of online businesses to prevent fraud and behavioral abuse in real time by analyzing the computer, smartphone, or tablet connecting to their online properties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iovation’s “living shared database” is used by fraud analysts daily and shares the reputations of devices from literally every country in the world. This reputation is a combination of fact-based evidence (such actual chargebacks, identity theft, online scams and account takeovers), plus what risk can be inferred at transaction time. Fraud analysts take this fight seriously and submit 10,000 events of fraud or abuse into the shared database each day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iovation.com/online-retail&quot;&gt;device reputation check&lt;/a&gt; on a scammer attempting to create a new account at a sale or auction website would stop him before he has a chance to post advertisements for scams, preventing damage to the business and its customers. And when one of your good customers has been scammed, you can submit that evidence back into the iovation database to make sure it does not happen again, whether from the same device, or a related device.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Whether getting out of high school and entering college, or if you’re a veteran starting another year of college, there are 2 absolutes remain true: 1.

&lt;p&gt;Whether getting out of high school and entering college, or if you’re a veteran starting another year of college, there are 2 absolutes remain true: 1. You will more than likely get into a situation where your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; will be at risk and 2. You aren’t fully prepared to react or respond to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? First, life can be hard and a hard life makes people a little nutty and they do bad things to other people. Second, your mom and dad really didn’t get a formal education on personal security so they sent you off into the world with the limited information they had. Most people regardless of age aren’t prepared. Throw lots of alcohol into the mix and it gets even dicey-er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September is National Campus Safety Awareness Month. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=297%3Aclerysummary&amp;amp;catid=64%3Acleryact&amp;amp;Itemid=60&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (20 USC § 1092(f)) is the landmark federal law, originally known as the Campus Security Act, that requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your research into the crime climate of the learning institution you plan on attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t sit idly back and hope everything will be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational institutions aren’t meant to be secure fortresses, which makes them vulnerable to predators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly call the institutions security office and get statistics for on and off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/safety-and-security-on-college-campuses.aspx&quot;&gt;campus crimes&lt;/a&gt;. You want to know exactly what has taken place in the last 3-5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the campus have an onsite meeting with the security office. It is in your best interest, and required by law for colleges to offer personal security training for their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine what campus security personnel and technology systems are in place to head off danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether living on or off campus invest in your personal security. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/articles/security-trends/wireless-home-security-101.aspx&quot;&gt;Wireless home alarms&lt;/a&gt; and portable home security systems are cost effective and add an additional layer of protection. Security cameras are inexpensive and can greatly enhance your security too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live on the east coast, right on the coast, and battened down in anticipation of getting whacked. Well that day never came because the storm missed us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local and national news channels continued to spout out information that devastation was on the way even though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; kept telling me the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm. I’ve had 75 mile an hour winds here and that’s not devastation. But it definitely means you need to remove anything from your porches and yard that can be flung through a glass window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the days after the event many people locally complained to me that the media exaggerates things and in the future they will not pay any attention to the boy who cried wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat: Hurricane Irene killed over 40 people, did millions to billions in damage and left millions without power for over a week. While the media definitely sensationalizes things it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/16-must-have-home-emergency-kit-items.aspx&quot;&gt;better to be over prepared&lt;/a&gt; than underprepared. Further it is even better to get the FACTs from NOAA and get a local perspective with a grain of salt when watching what’s going on in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.53fabf6cc033f17a2b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=537b218c37752210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;amp;currPage=e507d7aada352210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&quot;&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; along with NOAA have great tips on how to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The Register &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/14/skimmer_arrests_in_nsw/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, “After investigations that began in 2009, the police executed three search warrants in metropolitan Sydney, retrieving EFTPOS terminals, computers, cash, mobile phones, skimming devices, and several Canadian credit cards. Other seizures in the two-year investigation have included 18,000 blank and counterfeit credit cards, stolen EFTPOS terminals, and skimming devices. The men arrested are Malaysian and Sri Lankan nationals, and are accused of coordinating the fraud operation in Australia, North America and Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “a Brooklyn man has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/12/identity_theft_guilty_plea/&quot;&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to aggravated identity theft for his role in an operation that defrauded credit card issuers of almost $800,000 in bogus charges. FBI and Secret Service agents recovered data for 2,341 stolen accounts on his computer and on the magnetic stripes of cards, according to court documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperation between U.S. law enforcement agencies and international governments can be credited in taking down these thieves. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/07/bsa_survey_pirate_software/&quot;&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; there are plenty of other criminals involved in fraudulent acts from countries like China, Nigeria, Vietnam, Ukraine, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea to take their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an anti-fraud company in Oregon, called iovation Inc., that helps online businesses connect the devices used in fraud rings across geographies, by associating them with the accounts they access. Whether the device is a PC, smartphone, tablet or other Internet-enabled device, iovation’s device identification technology recognizes new and returning devices touching their client’s sites within multiple industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals with a history of fraud or abuse are obviously flagged by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iovation.com/&quot;&gt;iovation’s ReputationManager 360 service&lt;/a&gt;, but even more interesting are the real-time checks that happen within a fraction of a section as the user is interacting with the website. This might include assessing risk for activities such as setting up an account, logging in, changing account information, or attempting to make a purchase or transfer funds. Real-time checks differ for each website integration point as businesses customize and continually fine-tune them to detect fraudulent and risky behavior so that they can identify and keep bad actors off their site for good.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;A quick break here from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and security solutions to include you in on a little secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People all over the world, in addition to people I know and love spend money (sometimes mine) on “readings” thinking they are getting inside information on something such as an unforeseen life event or drummed up answers to questions about the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the motivations behind a “normal” person going to a fortune teller or psychic are purely for fun. I have been to a few in the past, often pulled in while walking a boardwalk at a touristy event or when someone brings a psychic to a party to bring the party up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally the psychic provides a degree of information that when told, gets the listeners attention because the “inside info” couldn’t possibly be known otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that inside information is often generic, or standard. Meaning chances are “there is a family member you are having a very difficult time with” and “you love them and have tried to patch things up but can’t” and “they just don’t understand you”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO ISN’T IN THAT SITUATION???!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One psychic told me she saw “red blood” in my future “from a type of accident”. I was wearing a leather vest with a long leave shirt that said “Harley Davidson” and carrying a helmet. She was insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when people get sucked into this they will often get rolled into spending more money to get more information so the fortune teller can solve all their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/psychics-james-randi-offers-million-james-van-praagh/story?id=14382858&quot;&gt;news of an educational foundation&lt;/a&gt; of sorts offered up a million dollar challenge to anyone who could prove they are a psychic. Nobody has taken the bait. Know why? Because anyone who takes the challenge would be discredited on a national stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this week in Florida a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1189334.ece&quot;&gt;family of multi million dollar fortune tellers&lt;/a&gt; were arrested for using magic tricks claiming they were talking to the dead, and curing disease. Victims were giving up luxury cars, cash and gold coins to have the scammers fix all their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homesecuritysource.com/blogs/scams-setting-record-pace.aspx&quot;&gt;scam&lt;/a&gt; for everyone. Everyone is a mark, it’s just a matter of finding that persons scam spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS, there is no such thing as UFO’s or ghosts either. Since billions of people now carry smartphones that record pictures and videos we have yet to see a ghost or UFO on camera.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    <summary type="html">
                        &lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agencies consider single-factor authentication, as the only control mechanism, to be inadequate for high-risk transactions involving access to customer information or the movement of funds to other parties. Account fraud and identity theft are frequently the result of single-factor (e.g., ID/password) authentication exploitation. Where risk assessments indicate that the use of single-factor authentication is…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agencies consider single-factor authentication, as the only control mechanism, to be inadequate for high-risk transactions involving access to customer information or the movement of funds to other parties. Account fraud and identity theft are frequently the result of single-factor (e.g., ID/password) authentication exploitation. Where risk assessments indicate that the use of single-factor authentication is inadequate, financial institutions should implement multifactor authentication, layered security, or other controls reasonably calculated to mitigate those risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are in 2011, six years later, and well over half a billion records have been breached. And while it is true that not all of the compromised records were held by financial institutions, or were accounts considered “high-risk transactions,” many of those breached accounts have resulted in financial fraud or account takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2005, you might have had two to five accounts that required you to create a username and password in order to log in. Today, you may have 20 to 30. Personally, I have over 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem today is people most often use the same username and password combination for all 20 to 30 accounts. So if your username is &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:name@emailaddress.com&quot;&gt;name@emailaddress.com&lt;/a&gt;, and your password is abc123 for one website that ends up getting hacked, it will be easy enough for the bad guy to try those login credentials at other popular websites, just to see if the key fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick and simple solution is to use a different username and password combination for each account. The long-term solution is for website operators to require multifactor identification, which may include an ever-changing password generated by a text message, or a unique biometric identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until that time, the three best tips to create an easy to remember but hard to guess string password are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong passwords are easy to remember but hard to guess. “Iam:)2b29!” consists of ten characters and says, “I am happy to be 29!” (I wish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the keyboard as a palette to create shapes. “%tgbHU8*” forms a V if you look at the placement of the keys on your keyboard. To periodically refresh this password, you can move the V across the keyboard, or try a W if you’re feeling crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun with known short codes or sentences or phrases. “2B-or-Not_2b?” says, “To be or not to be?”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;All this preparation is so that if there ever is a fire, I can reduce or eliminate any risks to lives and valuables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most documentation is replaceable, but certain things are not. Sometimes, when documentation is replaceable, getting duplicates can be a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mementos:&lt;/strong&gt; Photos, love letters, children’s drawings, and so on. You probably have a box full of things that you like to browse through every ten years or so. Or photo albums on a shelf. If these items were incinerated, you’d be very unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance papers:&lt;/strong&gt; Home, auto, life, health, and business insurance papers should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health related information:&lt;/strong&gt; if you have health issues and multiple files, records, and prescriptions, they should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financials:&lt;/strong&gt; Documentation regarding investments, bank account numbers, stocks, bonds and coins should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet:&lt;/strong&gt; Photocopy everything in your wallet front and back and put the copy and extra credit cards and cash should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification:&lt;/strong&gt; Birth certificates, passports, driver’s licenses, Social Security cards, insurance cards, and any other identifying documents should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Titles:&lt;/strong&gt; Deeds, boat, and automobile titles should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wills:&lt;/strong&gt; Any and all documentation related to a will should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry:&lt;/strong&gt; Most insurance providers require a safe in order to obtain insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extras:&lt;/strong&gt; I have an extra passport, extra credit cards, extras set of keys, extra emergency cash, and extra identification, all protected in my safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;I downloaded the&lt;br/&gt;developer preview of Windows 8 to see how things would work out with&lt;br/&gt;the Metro interface on a laptop, I get that it was designed from the&lt;br/&gt;start to be used with touchscreens but most people will be using this&lt;br/&gt;with the traditional mouse and keyboard or, given the purchasing&lt;br/&gt;habits of the modern consumer, a laptop keyboard and trackpad.  I&lt;br/&gt;installed Windows 8 through VirtualBox on a Core 2 Duo…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;I downloaded the&lt;br/&gt;developer preview of Windows 8 to see how things would work out with&lt;br/&gt;the Metro interface on a laptop, I get that it was designed from the&lt;br/&gt;start to be used with touchscreens but most people will be using this&lt;br/&gt;with the traditional mouse and keyboard or, given the purchasing&lt;br/&gt;habits of the modern consumer, a laptop keyboard and trackpad.  I&lt;br/&gt;installed Windows 8 through VirtualBox on a Core 2 Duo MacBook&lt;br/&gt;running Lion, being on a virtual machine I will forgive any graphical&lt;br/&gt;glitches and speed issues as being the fault of my laptop and the&lt;br/&gt;virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;The first thing you&lt;br/&gt;come across is that the Metro UI, which has been described by some as&lt;br/&gt;beautiful or elegant, is really just a bunch of boxes or rectangles&lt;br/&gt;which, while different from the traditional system of icons, don&#039;t&lt;br/&gt;allow very many programs on the screen at once.  I tried to scroll to&lt;br/&gt;the left and right on my trackpad but it was for naught.  You have to&lt;br/&gt;scroll up and down in order to go left and right, hopefully this is&lt;br/&gt;something Microsoft will fix before they release the end product. &lt;br/&gt;The screen resolution on my virtual machine was set to 800 by 600&lt;br/&gt;which was too low so I set about trying to up the resolution.  I went&lt;br/&gt;to settings but found nothing there, it did give me an option at the&lt;br/&gt;bottom to get more settings, I clicked on that and was immediately&lt;br/&gt;dumped into the Windows 8 desktop mode, which looks an awful lot like&lt;br/&gt;Windows 7 but without the benefit of the start menu – something&lt;br/&gt;that Windows users since Windows 95 have become very familiar with. &lt;br/&gt;In desktop mode, I was presented with a more traditional settings&lt;br/&gt;windows where I could updated the resolution. It seems strange to&lt;br/&gt;give an operating system 2 control panels, almost as if the first one&lt;br/&gt;were thrown together as an afterthought. Again, I would assume that&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft will fix this before the final product ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;While I was in the&lt;br/&gt;desktop, I decided to check out what software came preloaded, click&lt;br/&gt;on the Start menu and I&#039;m back to Metro.  The Start menu is gone and,&lt;br/&gt;from what I&#039;ve read, it isn&#039;t supposed to come back.  You can bring&lt;br/&gt;it back with third party software and registry hacks but they disable&lt;br/&gt;the Metro interface and are not supported by Microsoft.  In order to&lt;br/&gt;get to your programs now, if they aren&#039;t pinned to the Metro home&lt;br/&gt;screen, you have to start typing the name of the program you want.&lt;br/&gt;Once you start typing, you are ripped from the Metro interface and&lt;br/&gt;into a Metro-style search screen.  If you don&#039;t know the name of the&lt;br/&gt;program but want to scroll through a list, you have to start typing&lt;br/&gt;something and then delete what you searched for in order to get a&lt;br/&gt;list of all the installed programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;So far the&lt;br/&gt;experience has been one non-intuitive mess after another but maybe&lt;br/&gt;people won&#039;t use all these features, maybe they&#039;ll get a computer&lt;br/&gt;with the resolution already correctly never need to access the&lt;br/&gt;control panel, maybe they&#039;ll never need to access programs that&lt;br/&gt;aren&#039;t already pre-installed and on the Metro home screen.  Maybe&lt;br/&gt;people will just turn on their computer, check their stocks on the&lt;br/&gt;home screen, play on Twitter and browse the web.  On to the Metro&lt;br/&gt;version of Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;I should say that&lt;br/&gt;this was my second attempt at Internet Explorer, the first attempt&lt;br/&gt;failed because my screen resolution was too low for it to load.  When&lt;br/&gt;you bring up IE you see a much different interface than you are used&lt;br/&gt;to from virtually every web browser ever made.  They put the URL bar&lt;br/&gt;at the bottom of the screen and if you click on the web page to&lt;br/&gt;follow a link or to do anything, the URL bar disappears and leaves&lt;br/&gt;you no obvious way of getting it back.  There is also no obvious way&lt;br/&gt;of getting out of the program.  You have to right click in order to&lt;br/&gt;get the URL bar to reappear and hover the mouse in the bottom left&lt;br/&gt;hand corner to get the start button to show up.  While this is easy&lt;br/&gt;to remember once you have done it a few times, it will be very&lt;br/&gt;frustrating to the average computer user who decides to skip over the&lt;br/&gt;instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;I attempted to bring&lt;br/&gt;up the new version of IE along with a word processor so I could use&lt;br/&gt;the web and type at the same time but you can&#039;t.  I know that you can&lt;br/&gt;hover the mouse in the middle left side of the screen and a tiny pop&lt;br/&gt;up window will appear showing another program that was running, drag&lt;br/&gt;it to the left or the right of the screen and it is supposed to&lt;br/&gt;“snap” into place so you can do rudimentary multitasking with&lt;br/&gt;only 2 programs. This apparently works on computers with higher&lt;br/&gt;resolution screens but my virtual machine would only support 1024x768&lt;br/&gt;which, is plenty of resolution to run multiple programs at the same&lt;br/&gt;time. Microsoft seems to have arbitrarily broken multitasking in the&lt;br/&gt;Metro UI. The new system is fine for tablets but it has no place on a&lt;br/&gt;desktop or laptop computer. I hear lots of praise for the Metro&lt;br/&gt;interface and for their decision to “re-imagine” Windows but&lt;br/&gt;honestly, this new operating system is a disaster in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;On October 29 1981 the 80&#039;s sitcom Gimme A Break! premiered on NBC and lasted 6 seasons from 1981-1987.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here is some info about the sitcom Gimme A Break! from the website &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sitcomsonline.com/gimmeabreak.html&quot;&gt;http://www.sitcomsonline.com/gimmeabreak.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A rotund black housekeeper maintained order in the home of a portly white police chief in this old-fashioned comedy set in the fictional town of Glen Lawn, California.  Policeman Carl&#039;s beloved wife Margaret had died only months before, leaving him with three, winsome daughters, ranging in age from cute grade-schooler to troublesome teen.  Wisecracks and fat jokes abounded, but there was a lot of love as Nell tried to be friend and surrogate mother to the clan.  Officer Simpson was a dopey police officer who was frequently seen, and Joey was a six-year-old orphan and junior-grade hustler who joined the household in the third season.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;As the 1985-1986 season opened the chief had passed away (actor Dolph Sweet had died), and Nell became both mother and father to the Kanisky brood.  The man of the house was now Jonathan, who had married Julie at the end of the previous season and moved in.  By 1986, with the Kanisky girls grown and/or college-bound, Nell and her best friend Addy decided to leave Glen Lawn for New York City, with Grandpa and little Joey in tow.  There they discovered Joey&#039;s irresponsible father Tim, who turned over Joey&#039;s younger brother Matthew (played by Joey Lawrence&#039;s real-life brother) and departed, adding a second child to the shifting household.  Marty was Nell&#039;s nutty New York landlord, who also owned the restaurant El Gaspacho downstairs, where he put on a phony Spanish accent and called himself &quot;Esteban&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; Also the show dealt with all kinds of subjects and it went there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Everybody who watched the show had Crashes on the three girls on the show their names are&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kari Michaelson (Michaelsen) who played Katie Kanisky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lauri Hendler who played Julie Kanisky Maxwell &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lara Jill Miller who played Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Kanisky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put up a YouTube video titled A Gimme A Break! Opening By sbushfan11 and video has  191,565 video views.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Murmur (album)&quot;&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio&quot; title=&quot;Campus radio&quot;&gt;college radio&lt;/a&gt;. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_I_Love_(R.E.M._song)&quot; title=&quot;The One I Love (R.E.M. song)&quot;&gt;The One I Love&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The group signed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records&quot; title=&quot;Warner Bros. Records&quot;&gt;Warner Bros. Records&lt;/a&gt; in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Time_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Out of Time (album)&quot;&gt;Out of Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (1991) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_for_the_People&quot; title=&quot;Automatic for the People&quot;&gt;Automatic for the People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (1992), which veered from the band&#039;s established sound. R.E.M.&#039;s 1994 release, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(R.E.M._album)&quot; title=&quot;Monster (R.E.M. album)&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar&quot; title=&quot;United States dollar&quot;&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a three-piece. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot; title=&quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. R.E.M. disbanded in 2011, announcing the split on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway many of their fans of R.E.M. are in shock and have been posting comments saying we&#039;re going to miss you and It&#039;s The End of the World As We Know It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey isn’t known for having many solar paneled hospitals but there are a few panels on certain locations.  The 2.1-megawatt project will go on the record boards as the largest solar panel installation of any hospital in the state of New Jersey.  Of course, this could eventually be broken on record in years to come........&lt;/p&gt;
