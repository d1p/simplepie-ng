			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-28073" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/10/nina-berman-at-occupy-wall-street/nina-berman-10-1-copy/"><img class="widescreen aligning wp-image-28073" title="nina berman 10-1 copy" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/10/nina-berman-10-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="629" /></a></p>
<p>Nina Berman sent me this photo immediately after I read Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s post last Wednesday titled: <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/09/28/protests_21/singleton" target="_blank">What’s behind the scorn for the Wall Street protests?</a></em> The photo was taken Sept 20th, Day 4 of the &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; action, just before the pepper spray incident and before the encampment downtown had taken root. Below, I&#8217;ve cherry-picked some of the Greenwald&#8217;s lines which I thought most applicable to the photograph:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Any entity that declares itself an adversary of prevailing institutional power is going to be viewed with hostility by establishment-serving institutions and their loyalists&#8230;. the more effectively adversarial it is, the more establishment hostility it’s going to provoke. </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Indeed, the loyalists of both parties have an interest in marginalizing anything that might serve as a vehicle for activism outside of fealty to one of the two parties.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But much of this progressive criticism consists of relatively (ostensibly) well-intentioned tactical and organizational critiques of the protests: there wasn’t a clear unified message; it lacked a coherent media strategy; the neo-hippie participants were too off-putting to Middle America; the resulting police brutality overwhelmed the message, etc. etc.  That’s the high-minded form which most progressive scorn for the protests took: it’s just not professionally organized or effective.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Given the costs and risks one incurs from participating in protests like this — to say nothing of the widespread mockery one receives –  it’s natural that most of the participants will be young and not yet desperate to cling to institutional stability.  It’s also natural that this cohort won’t be well-versed (or even interested) in the high arts of media messaging and leadership structures. Democratic Party precinct captains, MBA students in management theory and corporate communications, and campaign media strategists aren’t the ones who will fuel protests like this; it takes a mindset of passionate dissent and a willingness to remove oneself from the safe confines of institutional respectability. </em></p>
<p><em>So, yes, the people willing to engage in protests like these at the start may lack (or reject the need for) media strategies, organizational hierarchies, and messaging theories.  But they’re among the very few people trying to channel widespread anger into activism rather than resignation, and thus deserve support and encouragement — and help — from anyone claiming to be sympathetic to their underlying message.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>These words, of course, are offered to insulate the photograph as I can&#8217;t imagine anyone looking at this street scene &#8211; progressives included &#8212; without at least some amount of eye-rolling. What I would ask you to do, however, just as an experiment, is to:</p>
<p>&#8230;Close your eyes for a second and try and look at this photo again as if the 60&#8217;s had never happened.</p>
<p>&#8230;Take another look at this photo without a shred of irony.</p>
<p>&#8230;Think about how much this marketing age has so divorced us from our own bodies and so turned us into objects &#8212; whether objects of obsession or objects of manipulation &#8212; that the sight of too much skin (beyond our own intimates, and outside the billboard, magazine, video or movie screen) can be downright terrifying.</p>
<p>&#8230;Look at this photo as if &#8220;game playing&#8221; was widely understood as a clever intervention that, in the discomfort induced, successfully shakes people out of their Stepford-like stupor for a moment.</p>
<p>If you can manage to do all that, what you&#8217;ll see &#8212; in a society that has otherwise shunned freeform demonstration &#8212; is not randomness, frivolity, disorganization or nostalgia, but rather the hip-shaking arrival of New York City&#8217;s &#8220;first responders&#8221; to the utter collapse of economic justice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27999" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/10/%e2%80%9cout-damn-spot%e2%80%9d/erik-de-castro-reuters-2011-09-25-at-10-48-17-pm/"><a rel="attachment wp-att-28005" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/10/%e2%80%9cout-damn-spot%e2%80%9d/erik-de-castro-reuters-2011-09-25-at-10-48-17-pm-3/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-28005" title="Erik-De-Castro-Reuters-2011-09-25-at-10.48.17-PM" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Erik-De-Castro-Reuters-2011-09-25-at-10.48.17-PM2-600x359.png" alt="" width="600" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Fighting a war against terrorism is one thing.  But apparently there’s no good reason not to maintain personal hygiene. And what better way to do that than to brush one’s teeth after a  tasty MRE while on duty?  What is striking about the photograph,  however, is not just the fact that we have a U.S. soldier massaging his  gums while poised in a bunker between two machine guns, but that he  seems somewhat—but only somewhat—nonchalant while doing so.  Leaning  relaxed against a wall of sandbags, his right hand comfortably in his  pocket, he seems to be without a care in the world.  But of course he is  wearing a vest and a helmet, which suggests that the risk to his safety  might be a little more serious than gingivitis or bad breath.</p>
<p>And so the question is, what exactly is  the point of this photograph?  I must admit that in some ways I don’t  have a clue.  He is part of the “No Fear” task force of the 2-27  Infantry in Kunar, and so there might be something here about looking  death in the eye and laughing.  But there is also this:  If you work  your way through the very many slideshows of the U.S. military stationed  at outposts in faraway places like Afghanistan or Iraq you are bound to  come across more than a few photographs of U.S. personnel washing or  shaving or cutting their hair in what might otherwise be understood as  primitive field conditions.   “Cleanliness is next to godliness,” and we  should not ignore the sense in which the display of such behavior even under the harshest of conditions subtly visualizes a cultural commonplace that gestures to an Americanized, Christian sensibility.   But more than that, it points to something more subtle still.  Yes, such  soldiers might be stationed far from home and under less than normal circumstances, their lives may be at risk and they might even be called upon to kill or die in the name of God and country, but for all of that  the basic habits of a civilized people abide.</p>
<p>Put differently, such photographs in  general serve as a reminder that war is dirty business even as they  feign to suggest that one can fight a war and still maintain clean  hands.  The presence of the guns that frame the scene above, and to  which the soldier is destined to return, make this photograph unique in  this regard, for they stand as a reminder that, as with Lady Macbeth,  one cannot completely avoid the tragic stain of war’s inevitable  shame.</p>

I am especially interested in this photo &#8212; and the opportunity for us to study it and think about it &#8212; since the Administration &#8220;predator-droned&#8221; Anwar al-Alwaki into the ground last Friday. (Yes, going forward, I recognize &#8220;predator drone&#8221; as a verb.)
First, let&#8217;s consider the caption from TIME&#8217;s &#8220;Anwar al-Awlaki in the United States&#8221; slideshow [...]]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="al Awlaki 2001.jpg" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/10/al-Awlaki-2001.jpg" border="0" alt="Al Awlaki 2001" width="600" height="396" /></p>
<p>I am especially interested in this photo &#8212; and the opportunity for us to study it and think about it &#8212; since the Administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/world/middleeast/anwar-al-awlaki-is-killed-in-yemen.html?ref=world" target="_blank">&#8220;predator-droned&#8221; Anwar al-Alwaki into the ground</a> last Friday. (Yes, going forward, I recognize &#8220;predator drone&#8221; as a verb.)</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s consider the caption from TIME&#8217;s <strong>&#8220;Anwar al-Awlaki in the United States&#8221;</strong> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2095806,00.html#ixzz1ZYboRULT" target="_blank">slideshow</a> (keeping in mind &#8212; regardless of any ambiguity in that title &#8212; that al-Awlaki was born and raised an American). The caption reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Dar al Hijrah Mosque, Falls Church, Virginia</strong><br />
Patricia Morris, left, and Imam Anwar al-Awlaki stand inside Dar al Hijrah Mosque in Falls Church, Virginia in 2001. In Virginia, al-Awlaki served as imam of the mosque from 2001-2002, while pursuing a doctorate at George Washington University and serving as the school&#8217;s Muslim chaplain. Morris organized a vigil of solidarity at the mosque, in the weeks following the September 11 attacks.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In considering the photo, a critical thing to think about is exactly <em>when</em> it was taken. Unfortunately (but maybe not surprisingly, al-Awlaki now reduced to one more<a href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/05/whats-wrong-with-times-bin-ladin-cover/" target="_blank"> X-ed out</a> evil-doer), the TIME caption leaves this ambiguous, as we have no idea if the photo was taken before or after 9/11/2001. The caption says <em>Morris</em> organized a vigil after the attacks, but by referring only to her (he had no involvement in it?), there is a  subtle intimation that the photo was taken earlier in the year &#8212; leaving us to imagine what kind of face al-Awlaki might have presented to the WAPO photographer, Tracy. A Woodward, after the terror attack. &#8230;In point-of-fact, though, if we check <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/97116568/The-Washington-Post" target="_blank">GettyImages</a>, we find out that the photograph was made on October 4th, 2001, three weeks after the attacks.</p>
<p>That being the case, how are we to account for the warmth and the normalcy here amidst the children, the soft and direct expression of the man in the khakis, open shirt and sports jacket, the relaxed shoulders, the only-loosely crossed arms and the sense of affinity and collegiality between the Iman and the WASP woman? Would you say that Al-Awlaki&#8217;s expression &#8212; the photo captured in that one-month period of national soul-searching prior to attacking Afghanistan, filled with compassion and gestures of goodwill and a desire for dialogue with America&#8217;s Muslim community &#8212; reflects the mood in the U.S. before America, too, became alienated by <em>the Bush Administration&#8217;s</em> radicalism and America experienced a progressively raw, building up of generalized hate toward the Muslim world incubating in that seventeen month stretch of time preceding the actual launch of the misguided war on Iraq?</p>
<p>Al-Awlaki&#8217;s story is full of contradictions. He father was a Fulbright scholar, an American academic but then, also, a member of the Yemeni government. Al-Awlaki lived in the U.S. till he was seven, returned to Yemen, then came back to the U.S. to go to college. In that stretch, he spent one summer against the Russians with the Afghan mujahideen in the pre-Taliban days.</p>
<p>Preaching in a mosque in San Diego after receiving an M.A. in education, it is alleged that Al-Awlaki had contact with several of the 9/11 hijackers. But then, showing no signs of radicalism, he actually moved East to make a life for himself in the DC area in January 2001, becoming the Imam at the Virginia mosque shown in the photo and also becoming the Muslim chaplain at George Washington University. After the 9/11 attacks, he even had meetings with Pentagon officials to discuss cross-cultural relations, and in 2002, he was the first imam to carry out a prayer service at the U.S. Capitol. It wasn&#8217;t till the end of 2002 that Al-Awlaki left the U.S., citing an increasing hostile climate for Muslims in the U.S. This was amidst a prosecution for passport fraud &#8212; because in 1990, he stated he was from Yemen to qualify for college scholarship money.  To emphasize, much has been written about Al-Awlaki and his possible roots to terrorism, but the story is ambiguous. FBI officials claim al-Awlaki had prior knowledge of 9/11, yet it wasn&#8217;t until he arrived in Britain that his actions become demonstrably radicalized.</p>
<p>Which leads us back to the photo &#8212; and that ambiguity.</p>
<p>Now ten years beyond 9/11 and three years into Obama&#8217;s term, what does it mean, really, the idea of &#8220;looking back&#8221; and understanding? There was no inclination to look back and examine the Bush Administration&#8217;s prosecution of the so-called &#8220;terror war&#8221; and the law-breaking actions to justify the war on Iraq. At the same time, America has failed to bring the terror suspects held at Gitmo into and under the sphere of the criminal justice system. Today, the same goes for how we deal with our persistent, if aging Muslim antagonists. If anything is shocking about what happened Friday, it&#8217;s how much America&#8217;s relationship with those that hate us (against a backdrop of a Middle East, and a Muslim core, most notable now for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/world/middleeast/arab-debate-pits-islamists-against-themselves.html?ref=todayspaper" target="_blank">wrestling</a> with political freedoms) falls into the knee-jerk bucket of cowboy justice, pulverization, and targeted killings &#8212; this one, historic for the first ever of an American.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m interested in who the man is in this picture, what happened to the man in this picture, and, above all, what exactly is going on in this picture &#8212; as we all, naturally, should be. Those questions, and the ultimate <em>answers</em> to those questions, I would go so far as suggest, are not only vital to our American democracy but to also recovering our sense of humanity &#8212; even if this government, caught up in its warrior technology and bloodlust, could hardly give a damn.</p>

<p><img title="cheney protest vancouver.jpg" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/cheney-protest-vancouver.jpg" border="0" alt="Cheney protest vancouver" width="600" height="377" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the caption:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Demonstrators protest Dick Cheney appearing at the Vancouver Club to promote his controversial personal and political memoir, “In My Time,” on Monday, Sept. 26, 2011. Protestors, calling for the former U.S. vice-president to be barred from Canada for his stance on interrogation tactics such as waterboarding during the Iraq War, tried to block access to the event. Police responded with pushing and shoving.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>If you assumed and got the venue wrong, however, it&#8217;s no surprising &#8212; given the parallels. And that&#8217;s not to say there is anything formal or organized between the stirring in Lower Manhattan and these goings-on in Vancouver, except that a more collective push back from &#8220;the 99%&#8221; against &#8220;the club&#8221; &#8212; at least, here in North America &#8212; is mostly a surprise in how long its been in coming.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Chris Christie Nancy Reagan.jpg" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Chris-Christie-Nancy-Reagan.jpg" border="0" alt="Chris Christie Nancy Reagan" width="594" height="475" /></p>
<p>Now that Rick Perry has transitioned though stage one of the MMSG (Media Messiah Stages of Grief) &#8212;  past &#8220;bright shiny object&#8221; to straddling the line between &#8220;sinking like a rock&#8221; and &#8220;flash in the pan,&#8221; we citizens get to enjoy another interlude of &#8220;find the savior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently basking in the glow of &#8220;no is just another way of being coy,&#8221; the corpulent one is at least going through the motions, which means, depending on the day, either an excursion to the border; a huge Tea Party Express Rally (in other words, a truck-stop BBQ with dozens of photographers in front of a throng at least equal in size to the headcount at the #OccupyWallStreet encampment on a rain-drenched night), or else, if it&#8217;s the middle ground he&#8217;s seeking (currently Mitt&#8217;s left flank), it&#8217;s securing an official Reagan Library photo with the ossified former First Lady, but really, touchstone to the Gipper himself. (No &#8220;just say no&#8221; jokes, please!)</p>
<p>Fearing I could get myself in trouble if I say more, I&#8217;m just going to sit back, enjoy the Christie interlude and, certainly, think on the meaning of that neon pink tie.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After reading the comments by LT and Momly, I realize I completely ducked the striking (maybe the word is, terrifying) apparition of Nancy Reagan here. The best that could be said is that Nancy (prepped for a photo produced and distributed by the library foundation) certainly seems &#8220;made up for posterity.&#8221; Speaking &#8220;less fancy,&#8221; though, what this photos touches on (as much or more than the campaign dance) is America&#8217;s denial of death &#8212; Nancy, almost literally a ghost.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><span>(<strong>photo</strong>: handout/via Getty Images <strong>caption</strong>: In this handout provided by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (L) poses for a portrait with former first lady Nancy Reagan after Christie delivered remarks during the Perspectives on Leadership Forum at the Reagan Library on September 27, 2011 in Simi Valley, California. Influential Republicans are urging Christie to run for president and are prepared to raise money. Christie is on a Republican Party fund-raising tour with stops in Missouri and California including a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum..)</span></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>I have to admit, the aesthetics of this pic from Tuesday&#8217;s Obama photo-op got me. And though I know it&#8217;s just one photo of kids at one high school in Colorado (with probably a fairly large Latino population), it strikes me how brown America has become and how a dwindling portion of our electorate refuses to accept this.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Jefferson-Siegel-pepper-spray.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27992" title="Arrests at Occupy Wall Street March" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Jefferson-Siegel-pepper-spray.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="362" /></a></p>
<p>Many websites are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/27/occupy-wall-street-reconstruct-pepper-spray" target="_blank">reconstructing</a> the Occupy Wall Street &#8220;Pepper Spray Incident. &#8221; The particulars are that on Saturday, September 24, participants in the 11-day-old un-permitted and disorganized protest were hauled out of their contained area and accosted by police.  The images from this confrontation reveal more than police brutality and over-reaction &#8212; they specifically capture the active participation of <em>high-ranking</em> police officers in the fray.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Occupy Wall Street_ help us reconstruct the _pepper spray_ incident | World news | guardian.co.uk-1.jpg" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Occupy-Wall-Street_-help-us-reconstruct-the-_pepper-spray_-incident-World-news-guardian.co_.uk-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Occupy Wall Street help us reconstruct the  pepper spray incident | World news | guardian co uk 1" width="403" height="223" /></p>
<p>1. Immediately before the pepper spray attack, a young man is pulled out of the crowd and thrown to the ground.</p>

2. Another protester is pulled down to the ground.<br />

3. One officer reaches into the barricaded area and appears to pull the hair of a protester.</p>

4. Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna, a veteran commander in Manhattan, arrives at the scene and pepper sprays the young women protesters by spraying directly in one woman&#8217;s face before making a spraying sweep of her companions. His arm is seen at the extreme right of the video capture.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Occupy Wall Street | NYC Protest for American Revolution.jpg" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Occupy-Wall-Street-NYC-Protest-for-American-Revolution.jpg" border="0" alt="Occupy Wall Street | NYC Protest for American Revolution" width="600" height="321" /><br />
5. Look at the hand gesture of the bald uniform street cop charged with holding the orange barricade up.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/09/27/1020600/-Union-Square-Pepper-Spray-Full-Story-Officer-to-Balogna:-Thats-Not-Procedure!-You-F!ng-Maced-Us!?via=siderec">video of the incident</a> records that street cop saying to Inspector Bologna: <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s not procedure. You fucking maced us!&#8221;</em> His is not the only objection, the ambivalence of the street cops to the actions of the higher ups is in nearly all of the photos and screen grabs printed here.  In gestures and looks, the body language suggests the street cops were taken aback. (You might take another look at the Daily News photo leading off this post.)</p>
<p>Of course, street cops participated in the violence. And given these photos and video clips, one might suppose that kind of violence has procedural approval of the command structure. But is it procedure to publicly call out your senior officer on his or her behavior? What does it say about the mindset, not to mention the preparation of the Department, that a week-and-a-half into this protest officials at the command level lost control?</p>

These are young people, victimized by the recession, willing to publicly dissent and, as importantly, stand up against conventional wisdom. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27951" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/glow-of-laptops/110927_6178/"><img class="widescreen alignnone size-full wp-image-27951" title="110927_6178" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/110927_6178.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="630" /></a><br />
<em>An organizing meeting of activists to discuss the next day&#8217;s activities.</em></p>
<p>Late at night in Zucotti Park, also known as Liberty Plaza, across the street from the World Trade Center site, several hundred demonstrators remain camped out into their second week of the Occupy Wall Street protest. They are largely young, white, and many appear, at first glance, to fit a derogatory stereotype of &#8220;hipsters&#8221; or &#8220;hippies&#8221; or any hardhat epithet of choice. As such, they have been branded by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/nyregion/protesters-are-gunning-for-wall-street-with-faulty-aim.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and other news outlets as being incoherent or worse.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27953" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/glow-of-laptops/110927_3866/"><img class="widescreen alignnone size-full wp-image-27953" title="110927_3866" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/110927_3866.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="630" /></a><br />
<em>A young woman fields phone calls in the &#8220;media cluster&#8221; of laptops constantly live-streaming video, Twitter, Facebook, and other feeds.</em></p>
<p>Certainly it&#8217;s easy to make fun of them this way: There are few totems of the old working and middle-class Left here, no visible labor unions, church groups, student organizations, or any of the other signs of a broad based movement that we saw as recently as last winter in Wisconsin. But what the mainstream media seems to have missed entirely is that neither coherence nor the traditional political calculus are the first priority here. Organs of record ignore the enormous elephant in the room &#8212; the Republican Party &#8212; driving this protest. It&#8217;s painfully obvious that the Obama administration fails to effectively address the Great Recession and the increasing divide of rich and poor, and that the consequent hijacking of the political system by the Tea Party is extreme and radical by historical standards.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27954" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/glow-of-laptops/110927_6161/"><img class="widescreen alignnone size-full wp-image-27954" title="110927_6161" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/110927_6161.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="630" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27954" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/glow-of-laptops/110927_6161/"></a><em>Protesters rest and sleep on air mattresses, sleeping bags, and yoga mats.</em></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27952" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/glow-of-laptops/110927_6190/"><img class="widescreen alignnone size-full wp-image-27952" title="110927_6190" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/110927_6190.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="630" /></a><br />
<em>Garbage cans are emptied out and the area swept with brooms by volunteer activists.</em></p>
<p>Many pundits have thus noted that the lack of greater protest is an interesting, if not surprising, aspect of our current moment. They would be well served by visiting the encampment in Lower Manhattan. The park is kept spotlessly clean, the disparate demonstrators field skeptical inquiries from hecklers and passerby with humor and patience, and their low numbers are steadily supplemented by people that join them for an hour or two at a time.</p>

<em>To the right is a video projection on a white sheet of a live Twitter feed covering the protest.</em></p>
<p>Neither explicit legislative targets nor negotiating points are the goal in Liberty Plaza. Rather, it is to give voice to the brooding discontent that so many Americans feel so inchoately, instead of allowing the far right to monopolize populism. Despite mass arrests reminiscent of the 2004 Republican National Convention, the sit-in has extended beyond the initial one-week plan to an indefinite protest. Each day and night that they remain is a testament to their resilience and creates a new fact on the literal ground of Wall Street. Their presence, however modest, proves that a few are willing to publicly dissent and stand up against conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>I photographed Tiananmen, and more recently Tahrir, and all the mass demonstrationss against the Iraq invasion, the Million Man March, the huge crowd for Obama&#8217;s inauguration, the disappointing John Stewart and Stephen Colbert Rally to Restore Sanity/Fear, and this doesn&#8217;t merit comparison in scale to anything like that, even remotely. But it is a beginning, more than anyone else has managed to express. And for that, credit and respect must be awarded, disdain and contempt discarded. Time will tell if this will snowball, or if forlorn prophets cry in the wilderness alone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27902" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader1_border-2/"><img class="widescreen aligning wp-image-27902" title="Tama_World_Leader1_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader1_border1.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="629" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These pictures might not be as titillating as the  note George Bush wrote to Condi Rice during a General Assembly speech asking if he could have a bathroom break. These edits Netanyahu made to his speech last Friday, however, revealed via telephoto lens by Getty&#8217;s accomplished photographer, Mario Tama, are interesting for what they suggest about the Prime Minister&#8217;s tactical state of mind.</p>
<p>Though I can&#8217;t say with absolute certainty, I&#8217;m assuming &#8212; given that Netanyahu&#8217;s speech to the General Assembly followed Mahmoud Abbas&#8217; speech by about forty minutes &#8212; that these edits were motivated by Netanyahu&#8217;s attempt (we might even say, his <em>desperation</em>) to somehow offset Abbas&#8217; powerful, warmly-received and historic declaration formally petitioning the UN for Palestinian statehood. Alternately statesmanlike and conciliatory, mixed with passages of acrid hostility and resentment toward the Palestinians, Arab countries, and <em>also</em> the U.N., it&#8217;s hard not to see Netanyahu&#8217;s speech, at least the goodwill, as something more than pandering. But let&#8217;s take a look at the photos starting with the one above, and see what Bibi&#8217;s doing with the kind gestures as well as the defensive arguments.  (Each photo is followed here with the original, and then the revised text. In some cases, for context, there is more of the delivered text which appears in parentheses.)</p>
<p>Photo 1.Original text (left page):</p>
<p><strong> Thousands of missiles have rained down on our cities.</strong></p>
<p>Revised text (as delivered):</p>
<p><strong> Thousands of missiles have already rained down on our cities.</strong></p>
<p>Citing Palestinian missile strikes in historical terms, an event that might be relegated to the past, Netanyahu changes hist text to frame these strikes as a an ongoing and continuous threat.</p>
<p>Photo 1.Original text (right page). Original text:</p>
<p><strong>Our major cities are 30 to 40 kilometers away from Gaza. But they&#8217;re only a few hundred meters away from the West Bank.</strong></p>
<p>Revised text (as delivered):</p>
<p><strong>See, most of our major cities in the south of the country are within a few dozen kilometers from Gaza. But in the center of the country, opposite the West Bank, our cities are a few hundred meters or at most a few kilometers away from the edge of the West Bank.</strong></p>
<p>In the first sentence, Bibi felt the need to make the distance between Israel and Gaza sound that much closer, from &#8220;30 to 40 kilometers&#8221; to &#8220;a few dozen.&#8221; Though the distinction is negligible, the need to make the perceived danger even a half-dozen kilometers closer, after hearing Abbas&#8217; speech, seems to demonstrates how pressured Netanyahu is feeling over the prospect of Palestinian statehood to try and elevate the potential threat of the Palestinians that infinitesmal-bit more. At the end of the paragraph, conversely, he is mindful not to shrink the distances beyond what is factual &#8212; although that doesn&#8217;t stop him from leaving the shorter &#8220;a few hundred&#8221; meters in the text. Finally, as regards territorial politics, notice how the West Bank is now aligned with the country&#8217;s center.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-27913" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader2_border-4/"><img class="size-full wp-image-27913 aligncenter" title="Tama_World_Leader2_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader2_border3.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Photo 2. Original text:</p>
<p><strong>(In the last few weeks, American officials have put forward ideas to restart peace talks. There were things in those ideas about borders that I didn&#8217;t like. There were things there about the Jewish state that I&#8217;m sure the Palestinians didn&#8217;t like.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But with all my reservations, I showed my willingness to move forward.</strong></p>
<p>Revised text (as delivered &#8212; including the preceding couple of lines):</p>
<p><strong>But with all my reservations, I was willing to move forward on these American ideas.</strong></p>
<p>The written text wants to suggest that Netanyahu was fully open to recent proposals, even if he had his reservations &#8212; although <em>a show of willingness</em> is actually less constructive or convincing that actually willingness itself. In the revision, Netanyahu changes the tone from a passive voice, demonstrating more intention. (Notice also, by the way, how he feels the need to make attribution again (to reduce his own responsibility, perhaps?) to the Americans.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27918" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader3_border-3/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27918" title="Tama_World_Leader3_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader3_border2.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Photo 3. Original text:</p>
<p><strong>(Must this conflict continue for generations,) Or will we enable our children and grandchildren to speak in years ahead of how we found a way to end it?</strong></p>
<p>Revised text (as delivered):</p>
<p><strong>(Must this conflict continue for generations,) Or will our children and our grandchildren speak in years ahead of how we found a way to end it? That&#8217;s what we should aim for, and that&#8217;s what I believe we can achieve.</strong></p>
<p>In this paragraph, we not only see how Netanyahu makes the tone more declarative and more active/aggressive (the removal of “enabling” emphasizes action and insistence over <em>process</em> &#8212; to be able to &#8220;create the conditions for&#8221; versus having seen it through), but we see how he makes the message that much more unilateral and demanding, adding “THAT’S WHAT WE SHOULD AIM FOR!” in all caps — with an exclamation mark, too.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27919" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader4_border-3/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27919" title="Tama_World_Leader4_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader4_border2.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Photo 4. Original text (left-side page):</p>
<p><strong>We share the same land.</strong></p>
<p>Revised text:</p>
<p><strong>We dwell in the same land.</strong></p>
<p>In the revision, Netanyahu eliminates the word &#8220;share.&#8221; Sure, &#8220;share&#8221; and &#8220;dwell,&#8221; on one level, are virtually synonymous. At the same time, however, the word &#8220;share&#8221; connotes something cooperative and personal vs. &#8220;dwell&#8221; is more incidental, a cold statement of fact. If there is any edit that captures Netanyahu as insincere about friendship and &#8220;joining hands,&#8221; it&#8217;s this one.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27909" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader5_border-2/"><img class="widescreen aligning wp-image-27909" title="Tama_World_Leader5_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader5_border1.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="629" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Photo 5. Original text:</p>
<p><strong>President Abbas, I am extending my hand &#8211; the hand of Israel &#8211; in peace.</strong></p>
<p>Revised text:</p>
<p><strong>President Abbas, I extend my hand &#8211; the hand of Israel &#8211; in peace.</strong></p>
<p>Same as in photo #2 above, we see in such trifling edits the sense of immediacy. This passage is now in the more active, present voice versus the gerund form (using -ing). Right at the end of the speech, the passage illustrates just how much Netanyahu feels the need to make something happen (even if that something is simply to more sharply and immediately  <em>look the part</em> of an eager and willing partner).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-27920" href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2011/09/analysis-of-netanyahus-u-n-speech-edits-following-abbas-palestinian-statehood-application/tama_world_leader6_border-3/"><img class="size-full wp-image-27920   aligncenter" title="Tama_World_Leader6_border" src="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/2011/09/Tama_World_Leader6_border2.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Photo 6.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the way into a speech which begins and ends as an exercise in peace, love and vigorous olive-branch waving, Netanyahu turns prosecutorial and rueful. This hand-written passage shows up at the end of the passage below from the revised version Netanyahu delivered. Notice how he draws a specific comparison between the Palestinians and the Nazis as regards the proposal for the Palestinian state:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Jewish state of Israel will always protect the rights of all its minorities, including the more than 1 million Arab citizens of Israel. I wish I could say the same thing about a future Palestinian state, for as Palestinian officials made clear the other day &#8211; in fact, I think they made it right here in New York &#8211; they said the Palestinian state won&#8217;t allow any Jews in it. They&#8217;ll be Jew-free &#8211; Judenrein. That&#8217;s ethnic cleansing. There are laws today in Ramallah that make the selling of land to Jews punishable by death. That&#8217;s racism. And you know which laws this evokes.Israel has no intention whatsoever to change the democratic character of our state. We just don&#8217;t want the Palestinians to try to change the Jewish character of our state. We want to give up the fantasy of flooding Israel with millions of Palestinians.</em></p>
<p><em>President Abbas just stood here, and he said that the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the settlements. Well, that&#8217;s odd. Our conflict was raging for nearly half a century before there was a single Israeli settlement in the West Bank. So if what President Abbas is saying was true, then the &#8211; I guess that the settlements he&#8217;s talking about are Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jaffa, Be&#8217;er Sheva. Maybe that&#8217;s what he meant the other day when he said that Israel has been occupying Palestinian land for 63 years. He didn&#8217;t say from 1967; he said from 1948. I hope somebody will bother to ask him this question because it illustrates a simple truth: The core of the conflict is not the settlements. The settlements are a result of the conflict.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>It would be interesting to know how many pages of hand-written notes coincide with that section of the speech, and with this attacking voice (especially where the letters get even larger and the voice more sarcastic &#8212; the right-side page here containing only seven words). If Netanyahu, as he scribbled away at the rhetorical edges, was feeling a sense of urgency about the opportunity for peace, its seems more motivated out of fear that the Palestinians had scored a coup with their statehood application than anything else.</p>
