		<title>Holiday Cards</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Had a great time block printing my holiday cards this year and loved playing with different inking techniques. Thought this texture created by reusing the ink from an already used block was pretty cool. Sorry if I wasn&#8217;t able to mail you one.

		<title>Not a Hand Turkey</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Thanksgiving is my absolute favorite holiday of the year for the sheer fact that it forces us to do nothing but eat, drink, and hang out with family, but it&#8217;s also a reminder that there are two sides to every story, and the one we&#8217;re all accustomed to may not be the most realistic version.

		<title>Things I Like: &#8220;The Nine Eyes of Google Street View&#8221;</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Artist Jon Rafman has one of the best collections of images found in Google Street view, and they&#8217;re definitely worth checking out. The photos range from artistic and beautiful to bizarre and sad, but all are captivating and left me happy to live in such a strange world. Read Rafman&#8217;s essay on the project here.
