			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent post in Gothamist <a href="http://gothamist.com/2011/03/12/city_facing_crippling_bodega_shorta.php">laments</a> the slow death of New York City bodegas, pointing to high rents as part of the reason for their demise. The following quote was included in the eulogy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kurt Cavanaugh of the East Village Community Coalition said, &#8220;We have an interesting, unique community here and we don’t want to lose that to Starbucks and McDonald’s and the same old things you’d see from here to Topeka, Kansas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_824" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px auto 15px;"><img src="http://temporaldisruption.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/jimmy_mcmillan1.jpg" alt="" title="Jimmy McMillan" width="240" height="179" class="size-full wp-image-824">
<p class="wp-caption-text">The Rent Is Too Damn High</p>
</div>
<p>As an East Villager, I agree wholeheartedly with the goal of maintaining the artistic and aesthetic character of our neighborhood and prefer the charm of hole-in-the wall bodegas to Starbucks and McDonalds. But Mr. Cavanaugh needs to reexamine the mission of his <a href="http://www.evccnyc.org/">EVCC</a> if this goal has any chance of reaching fruition. As stated on the EVCC <a href="http://evccnyc.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=1&#038;Itemid=27">about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The East Village Community Coalition works to recognize, support, and sustain the built and cultural character of the East Village. This character includes a diverse population; <strong>low-rise, human scale blocks and affordable buildings</strong> with historic and architectural significance.</p></blockquote>
<p>By inhibiting the up-zoning of East Village buildings, the EVCC is limiting the supply of commercial real estate, making space a scarcer commodity and causing rents to go up. With less living units per building, there are less people to support local businesses, such as a bodega. Increasing the density of the East Village would go a long way towards keeping bodegas around.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Senator Schumer,</p>
<p>I am a registered Democrat in New York state who has voted for you in the past and will, in all likelihood, vote for you again in the future. Both your stellar voting record and your leadership as a Senator make me proud to be one of your constituents. I have no doubt that you will successfully articulate the goals and policy platform of our party in your new role as Chair of the Democratic Policy Committee. However, I am very disappointed and concerned with your recent efforts to dismantle the Prospect Park West bike path.</p>
<p>Rather than argue the economic, environmental, and health benefits of protected bike lanes, of which there are many, I would like to ask you the following two questions. Do you support the PlaNYC goal of reducing global warming emissions by 30%? If so, how do you propose achieving this goal without discouraging excessive automobile use through the implementation of protected bike lanes?</p>
<p>As a senator, you have shown a commitment to promoting alternative energy use and reducing carbon emissions, most clearly evidenced by your recent co-sponsorship of the &#8220;Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act&#8221;. It would seem like reducing New York City&#8217;s carbon emissions by 30% would be a goal that you support as well.</p>
<p>I understand you have a very busy schedule, especially with ongoing budget negotiations in congress. But I would appreciate it if you could spare a moment to answer my questions on this local issue. I can be reached via email at bpackman@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bryan Packman</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine is hosting a New Year&#8217;s Eve party here in Manhattan.  When I asked a mutual friend of ours if he and his fiance, who live in Long Island, would be attending, he voiced his ambivalence, explaining how driving on New Year&#8217;s Eve is not always safe.  I offered, &#8220;Why not take the train?&#8221;, as traveling from Long Island to NYC via the LIRR is quite convenient, affordable, and completely safe from drunk drivers.  He again showed ambivalence, saying that &#8220;the train is not exactly part of my repertoire&#8221;.  Turns out, he&#8217;s going to bear down and &#8230; make the drive. Sigh.</p>
<p>Giving him the rundown on urbanism, environmentalism, and livable cities would have been fruitless.  No amount of pleading would ever make the train part of his &#8220;repertoire&#8221;.  As long as driving remains a cheap and relatively easy option, people who can afford it will choose driving as their preferred mode of transportation.  So, in areas like Long Island, where the infrastructure already exists to make mass transit a viable option, there are plenty of laws, taxes, projects, etc that can make driving seem a lot less attractive to my non-eco-friendly friend (which is still better than an eco-friendly non-friend).  Here are a few, in no particular order, with varying degrees of political attainability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated bike lanes.</li>
<li>Dedicated bus lanes (camera enforced).</li>
<li>No building height restrictions.</li>
<li>Higher prices at parking meters.</li>
<li>No mandates as to how much parking must be made available per residential unit.</li>
<li>In fact, let&#8217;s completely privatize the parking industry.  No parking on the street, only in private lots.  The number of available lots, and the price of parking is something that can be completely determined by market factors.  There are no quotas to fill as far available spaces go.</li>
<li>End all tax subsidies to oil companies.</li>
<li>Additional surtax on gasoline, especially in metro areas where other modes of transportation are available.</li>
<li>Congestion pricing.</li>
<li>Higher baseline price for toll booths entering a metro area.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty more.  Most of these things will have to happen on a local/state level before they become politically possible on a national level.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ezra Klein does a much better job explaining the tax cut compromise then I ever could.  <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/12/an_imperfect_but_not-that-bad.html">Read the whole thing</a>.</p>
<p>An extension of middle class tax cuts without extending the cuts above $250K was just not politically possible.  As much as I would have liked to see that happen, as much as the liberal base would have liked to see that happen, as much as President Obama would have liked to see that happen (and I believe he is sincere when he says that he did), it was just not politically possible.  So, the choice was to extend all of them, or let all of them expire, which would have been pretty de-stimulative in our current economic climate.  Given this choice, the president held his nose and made the necessary one.  But aside from just swallowing this bitter pill, he coupled these temporary tax cuts with an extension of unemployment benefits, an extension of refundable tax credits, a 2% cut in payroll taxes, and an investment write-off for businesses.</p>
<p>If this compromise passes, it will be something of an economic stimulus.  A stronger economy with a lower unemployment rate in 2012 increases Obama&#8217;s chances for reelection and creates a better political environment for him to end the tax cuts permanently than the one he currently has.  The president is much more concerned with governing than he is with earning points from the base.  Ultimately, I think that will lead to a successful presidency.</p>

The tsunami that hit Democrats last month — as large as it was — was remarkably precise and orderly, all things considered: given that the Democrats lost more than 60 seats, they lost almost exactly the 60 seats that you might have expected them to lose based on the overall partisanship of the districts. That did not include seats similar to Massachusetts, where Democrats in fact held on to all 10 congressional districts, even though several of the seats had been considered vulnerable&#8230;.</p>
<p>Perhaps this implies that Mr. Brown is more vulnerable than the Public Policy Polling survey suggests. Certainly if the 2012 elections resemble 2010, in terms of Congressional voting being aligned very strongly with Presidential voting, he could be in some trouble if the Democrats rebound to any extent at all.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I propose Mike Capuano as the Democratic nominee:</p>

<blockquote><p>The fundamental problem with football in an urban setting is that the NFL plays very few games. You’ve got 8 regular season home games. Throw in a bit of preseason and playoff appearances and you’re still looking at a facility that’s empty on 95 percent of days. That’s an inherently low-intensity land use and like other low-intensity land uses—farms, airports, etc.—it belongs to be way out somewhere where land is cheap and space is plentiful.</p></blockquote>
<p>And tailgating is a big part of the football experience, making a large parking lot a necessity.  All the more reason not to build a football stadium in a city center.</p>

<p>Before anyone starts screaming about Nazi Socialists, these are not death panels in the way Sarah Palin tried to present them during the looooooooong health care debate.  There is not, and never will be, a panel of government bureaucrats giving an up or down vote deciding whether an individual is worthy of life or death.  Instead, this is a pragmatic realization that in order to seriously control our country&#8217;s growing debt, the government is going to have to stop paying for certain treatments currently covered by Medicare.  The low-hanging fruit in that department are <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/05/60minutes/main6747002.shtml">the massive costs accrued during the last two months of patients&#8217; lives</a>.</p>
<p>Because policy is ultimately shaped by public beliefs and sentiment (and it usually lags the public, just look at DADT repeal), coming to terms with this financial issue won&#8217;t make it through congress until the American people collectively change their views on life and death.  Given the Terry Schiavo debacle that happened only a handful of years ago, I think we&#8217;ve still got a ways to go.</p>
