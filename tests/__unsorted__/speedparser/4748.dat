<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi guys, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Your friendly admin here. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Yes Twitter is down and it is semi official. We are unable to publish our feed on Twitter, the connection is timing out over and over again. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So if you are trying to log in to Twitter but unable to do so, you are more than welcome to post some free ads on our main site at http://www.bonsoni.com ...yeh I know it is a shameless plug:)
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;when I am going to twitter from my browser it try to connect to the twitter site then after a minute or it shows this message: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;The connection has timed out&#60;br /&#62;
The server at www.twitter.com is taking too long to respond&#34; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So definitely twitter is down today. And oh if any visitors come to this page and wonder when this is happening then today is: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Date: 14 September 2011&#60;br /&#62;
Time: 11:12 pm British Summer Time&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hopefully it is not a cyber attack or something on twitter!
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi I can't get in to twitter either. Probably it is down. Twitter status page isn't showing anything. So I am guessing their service status page is down too! lol &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;you can see if twitter down or not on this link http://status.twitter.com/

<description>&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why you are forgetting about facebook and twitter?&#34; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What are you talking about? facebook is for friends and family and certainly you will not add anyone you don't know in real life. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Although I am regular on twitter but this is the one of the most pathetic places I found online! Nobody listens to anyone, everyone  speaks to themselves without knowing who is reading their tweets! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;facebook and twitter will never be an alternative to any dating sites. There is a clear boundary between dating and socialising. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And it will stay like this in our lifetime. So don't say that fb and twtr are the alternatives to meet people!

<description>&#60;p&#62;Well gumtree took out the personal dating section from the site only because they had have spam problem. Also there were reports that most of the ads were posted by fake people and this and that. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Why you are forgetting about facebook and twitter? You can meet people from there if you are regular

<description>&#60;p&#62;Oh forgot to add- it is really hard to meet likeminded people in London now after all of the free community sites become &#34;empty your pocket&#34; style paid services.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Once upon a time a site called Gumtree.com was the place to meet people and even from the local area. Now gumtree is dead and full advertisements and it is very hard to meet new people! Well I also posted an ad on bonsoni.com the gumtree alternative casual ad now see who replies my ad  &lt;img src="http://www.bonsoni.com/forum/bb-plugins/bb-smilies/default/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" class="bb_smilies" /&gt;

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey found this by googling:) Yeh I just posted my first post on the personal dating section on bonsoni.com  &lt;img src="http://www.bonsoni.com/forum/bb-plugins/bb-smilies/default/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" class="bb_smilies" /&gt;  &#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;I second la-femme's comment. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Apparently Brat and Suzie paid £20 per illustrations. Although I am not in a position to justify the rate but I can say that there are plenty of good designers are in Asian countries those who are more than happy to provide designs in this rate. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also - if a designer can create hundreds of designs (guessing he is a good one) then what is the problem with the £20? It seems lot to me if you count the number of clients each designers have! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lastly - If I were a dragon, I wouldn't invest to their company as they sounded like they are taking this as a lifestyle business.
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;To be honest I didn't like the Brat and Suzie name as a brand. It just didn't fit their range. It seemed their target market was trendy arty-farties from East London but the name didn't judge that. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As jess_rab mentioned, some graphics designer were claiming on twitter that the design belong to them, and if it is true then they have to find other way or make a contract with those &#34;designers&#34; to waive the Intellectual Rights on the designs. Or it will not be long they will be on hot water

<description>&#60;p&#62;Yeh watched them. I had a look at Brat and Suzie website after watching dragons' den. The collection seemed quite good and trendy. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But some other designers claimed that the designs are belong to them and this and that and everyone was discussing on Twitter about this. So not sure if they are stealing other people's design and selling as their own design!

<description>&#60;p&#62;Have you watched Brat and Suzie pitch on dragons' den? I think their pitch was really good! but unfortunately Dragons didn't invest. Also I checked their collection and they seemed to have really cute collection! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But unfortunately the price is a bit high for me at the moment, I will wait for the price to go down  &lt;img src="http://www.bonsoni.com/forum/bb-plugins/bb-smilies/default/icon_wink.gif" title=";)" class="bb_smilies" /&gt;

<description>&#60;p&#62;I read an article about Bikram yoga but don't find any review about them. Apparently which helps you to lose weight as well as makes you look younger! I had a look at their site and it looks pretty intense but its a shame that they are too too expensive!!! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have been trying to shed some weight for over a year now but so far no luck  &lt;img src="http://www.bonsoni.com/forum/bb-plugins/bb-smilies/default/icon_sad.gif" title=":(" class="bb_smilies" /&gt;  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So would appreciate if anyone share their experience using them. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!!

<description>&#60;p&#62;There are few places to play tennis in East London. There are four courts inside the Victoria park, it will cost you £4.70 per hour per court regardless how many players are playing. There is also few courts in Bethnal green park but I am not sure if it is free or not

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have been looking for a tennis court for quite a while but haven't found any. It will be ideal if I can find a free one, probably sponsored by the local council? I found a free gym near victoria park and a place to practice cricket but not a tennis court yet!  &lt;img src="http://www.bonsoni.com/forum/bb-plugins/bb-smilies/default/icon_sad.gif" title=":(" class="bb_smilies" /&gt;

<description>&#60;p&#62;They lie, lie and lie. They will post phantom job ads just to collect CVs and if you inquire about it they will not give any information about those job roles, employers etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Last time I dealt with them it was quite intimidating and misleading. They sneakily instructed me to change my CV to make me more suitable for an opening and said on the interview they will not ask any questions about them. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But in the interview I was grilled by the interviewers and gave me impression that &#34;they caught my lie on the CV&#34; - it was like the apprentice situation of &#34;Stuart Baggs the brand&#34;. The next thing I have done was, started to deal with the employers directly

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Got the ticket for Ghost Story on west end this weekend. I found mixed reviews for the show, some says scary some said not! have you watched it? I am prone to be scared on horror films! so how is it? Given the fact that Women in Black was pretty scary for me, do you think it is scarier than WiB?? cheers!
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;It may be worth contacting the manufacturer as it sounds like a design fault,  A friend had a similar problem and the dealership were no help at all - until she complained to the manufacturer.  Suddenly they couldn't do enough!!!&#60;br /&#62;
In her case it was a design fault and was sorted for nothing.
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;I work for a training company and we recommend that a c.v. is one side of A4 accompanied by a covering letter if appropriate.&#60;br /&#62;
It is important to sell yourself in an eye catching and succinct way.
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If it was an advert for a free laptop then I presume someone already collected the laptop and the ad has been removed. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think there is another ad for an iMac. You can keep an eye on the computer section for bargains or perhaps you can subscribe for email alerts, which will send you daily email when a new ad is posted. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks
&#60;/p&#62;

<description>&#60;p&#62;Well it is still under &#34;consideration&#34;, but I do believe they are planning to sneaking in a new tax to internet users to be able to browse in larger online territory. I will not be surprised if I see them to apply few more unjustified taxes. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Ps: This month Oyester card renewal costed me £106+ !! A whopping £7 more than last month. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;PSS: Any Mongolians fancy to swap their passport with my British one?

<description>&#60;p&#62;Firstly DON'T worry about this. You are very thoughtful by asking this question. Being short is not bad and there is no reason to worry about it. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;However, since she is only 14 she can easily overcome that fear. But she has to start it asap. Althoguh there is no right wrong way to &#34;become&#34; tall but there is a significant possibility that swimmers, basketball players, cricket players are taller comparing with others. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The reason is, they &#34;strecth&#34; their body a lot and eat healthy food i.e. sea food, vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, rice, curry etc &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So from tomorrow tell her to start doing some exercise where she has to stretch jer body. i.e. playing basketball, swimming, or simply by hanging from a ring or something. but she has to do it at least 5/6 times in a week for next few years until see the result.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And make her to stay AWAY from fast food (chicken and chips, cola etc)
&#60;/p&#62;
