<p>Meet Rinske van Noortwijk and Corian Hugenholtz-Sasse  &#8211; they make wishes come true.</p>

<p>I met them both in Rotterdam, invited through the wonderful <a title="Maurice Specht blog" href="http://www.spechtindestad.nl/">Maurice Specht</a> to speak to the <a title="Linkedin group" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=3668135&amp;trk=myg_ugrp_ovr">Association of Initiative Brokers</a> ( @<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/Inimakelaar" target="_blank">inimakelaar</a> )  in Holland, <a title="Their blog post on this event" href="http://www.greenwish.nl/nieuws/bottom-up-inspireert-tijdens-netwerkbijeenkomst-638.html">organised by Rinske</a>.</p>
<p>Two days before, <a title="Tessy Britton blog" href="http://thrivingtoo.typepad.com">Tessy Britton</a> and I had been in The Hague speaking to senior civil servants from Dutch central government.  <span id="more-4661"></span>They kept asking us what they could do to help citizens do the simpler things that made sense  in their communities. Scale-ability was constantly on their lips.</p>
<p>I was urging them to be careful.  Stepping back, getting out of the way is one way government can help citizens just get things done.  Find simple ways to give people small amounts of no string attached help was the other &#8211; what I call &#8220;learn how to slip someone a quiet tenner&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #888888;">Militant Optimists and New Radicals<br />
</span></h2>
<p>Tessy wanted something more practical.  She wanted government to support the people who have the skills to nurture community, to connect people, to amplify what is possible in communities.  The people David Barrie calls <a title="David Barrie on Militant Optimists" href="http://davidbarrie.typepad.com/david_barrie/2010/09/militant-optimists-urban-development.html">Militant Optimists</a>, the sort of people who appear on the <a title="Grassroost Channel Podcast of communiti activists mostly from Birmingham" href="http://podnosh.com/grassroots">Grassroots Channel </a>and Tessy brings together through <a title="Hand Made the book from Tessy Britton" href="http://www.socialspaces.org/#1092022/Blogs-about-Hand-Made">Hand Made</a>.</p>
<p>She wants government to recognise and support the people who follow here 12 rules for <a title="Tessy britton new radicals" href="http://thrivingtoo.typepad.com/thriving_too/2011/04/big-society-rules-for-new-radicals.html">new radicals</a>. here are the first three compared with older form of community organising:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>RULE 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alinsky (Old/Conflict):</strong> &#8220;Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.&#8221; Power is derived from 2 main sources &#8211; money and people. &#8220;Have-Nots&#8221; must build power from flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>Britton (New/Collaborate):</strong> “Power involves creating spaces where ideas, energy and people are connected together from within all sections of the community and local government to create positive communities” This involves careful facilitation and creating safe spaces where everyone can share their opinions and contribute positively.  There is no enemy in a community.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alinsky (Old/Conflict):</strong> &#8220;Never go outside the expertise of your people.&#8221; It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Britton (New/Collaborative):</strong> “Always reject ignorance in favour of building skills and knowledge.” There are many new ideas and methods that result in creative solutions that make people and communities stronger.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alinsky (Old/Conflict):</strong> &#8220;Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.&#8221; Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Britton (New/Collaborative):</strong> “Whenever possible, instigate dialogue, so that everyone shares the same knowledge base to design solutions.” Look for ways to increase security, trust and responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rinske and Corian are just those sort of people: militant optimist, new radicals:</p>
<p>For nearly a decade they have been running <a title="Greenwish in Netherlands mission statement, active citizens social media" href="http://www.greenwish.nl/over-greenwish/missie">Greenwish</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenwish means more space for sustainable initiative. We encourage people to implement their sustainable ideas. If people do what they really care about, people are very passionate. It is this force that will really accelerate sustainable development.<br />
Greenwish promotes the interest of government, civil society and business in social initiatives. We want to see more cooperation and more is learned from social initiative.<br />
Greenwish support promoters with advice and contacts. We represent the interests of promoters to policymakers and politicians. Greenwish advises government, civil society and business in what they can do for initiatives and vice versa</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://podnosh.com/files/2011/05/GreenWish.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4663" title="GreenWish" src="http://podnosh.com/files/2011/05/GreenWish.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="118" /></a>Originally they were funded to connect community ideas to the people who can help make those ideas happen.  Sometimes they might connect a citizen to a government programme, sometimes to a private supporter, sometimes to another citizen &#8211; often to all three.   Each year these brokers make around 200 things happen that would otherwise have gone by the wayside.  They know people, have ideas, are networked and like finding the easiest ways to get things going.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #888888;">The First First Followers </span></h2>
<p>They call themselves the <a title="First followers" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-1_-P016Ns">first followers</a> &#8211; the first people to stand beside someone and say &#8220;that&#8217;s I good idea, I&#8217;m on your side&#8221;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #888888;">&#8220;Society is buzzing with ideas&#8221;</span></h2>
<p>Listen to them talk about it here:</p>

<p>Key points form the interview are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We met many people with good ideas to contribute to the community who need a little bit of help. We ask them waht do you need to make your next step and can we help you.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re interested in what gets people enthusiastic and why they are doing it.</li>
<li>Government funded for some time, now in transition.</li>
<li>Value is being known and trusted by people government wants to work with, it is still difficult to find government that works that way.</li>
<li>It can take patience to make an idea real. Over time enthusiasm builds</li>
<li>200 initiatives supported, health, food, energy, participation</li>
<li>Common currency is passion, it is always a struggle.</li>
<li>People in places always have ideas &#8211; we get ideas easily. &#8220;Society is buzzing with ideas.&#8221;</li>
<li>We are the first believers for anyone with a crazy idea to help society</li>
<li>Looking for new concepts for making our added value clear to the government, Tessy Britton gave me new ideas of how we should make that more clear.  Big Society is a new way for government to stop thinking for citizens, instead allow citizens to think for themselves.</li>
<li>There are so many ways to make what is happening visible through social media without having to push the information. Ask them to make themselves visible.</li>
</ul>

Meet Rinske van Noortwijk and Corian Hugenholtz-Sasse  – they make wishes come true.

I met them both in Rotterdam, invited through the wonderful Maurice Specht to speak to the Association of Initiative Brokers ( @inimakelaar )  in Holland, organised by Rinske.
Two days before, Tessy Britton and I had been in The Hague speaking to senior civil servants from Dutch central government.  They kept asking us what they could do to help citizens do the simpler things that made sense  in their communities. Scale-ability was constantly on their lips.
I was urging them to be careful.  Stepping back, getting out of the way is one way government can help citizens just get things done.  Find simple ways to give people small amounts of no string attached help was the other – what I call “learn how to slip someone a quiet tenner”.
Militant Optimists and New Radicals

Tessy wanted something more practical.  She wanted government to support the people who have the skills to nurture community, to connect people, to amplify what is possible in communities.  The people David Barrie calls Militant Optimists, the sort of people who appear on the Grassroots Channel and Tessy brings together through Hand Made.
She wants government to recognise and support the people who follow here 12 rules for new radicals. here are the first three compared with older form of community organising:
RULE 1
Alinsky (Old/Conflict): “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood.
Britton (New/Collaborate): “Power involves creating spaces where ideas, energy and people are connected together from within all sections of the community and local government to create positive communities” This involves careful facilitation and creating safe spaces where everyone can share their opinions and contribute positively.  There is no enemy in a community.

Rinske and Corian are just those sort of people: militant optimist, new radicals:
For nearly a decade they have been running Greenwish:

<p>It&#8217;s odd how when you look away your friends seem to go and do some really interesting stuff. I first met Willem Guizeman in 2005 when he was in Birmingham planning some work on the Residents university for the Residents for Regeneration.  Then he was fronting a Europe wide organisation which was working with the EU.</p>
<p>Last month we saw each other again in The Hague,  his home town.  Now Willem is doing something much more <span id="more-4629"></span>modest.</p>
<p>Because he is close to retirement and doesn&#8217;t need to earn big money he and his friend Nol are simply spending time in what they call the <a href="http://stagehuisschilderswijk.nl/" target="_self">Stagehuis Schilderswijk</a> &#8211; an apartment they rent on a street corner in a poorer and multi racial area of the city.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #888888;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a great way to become an old man..&#8221; </span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Listen to what he has to say:</p>

<p>Tessy has written about Willem&#8217;s thinking <a title="Tessy Britton" href="http://thrivingtoo.typepad.com/thriving_too/2011/04/big-society-emotion-contagion-presence-and-social-objects.html">here</a> and hopefully he will write a chapter for a new version of the Hand Made book.  Tessy says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As well as doing activities, their presence is clearly having other effects.  I am currently very focused on side-effects – ones that we measure, but also ones that we don’t think to pay much attention to.  It is one of the reasons I am so intent on developing new creative and collaborative methods (see some further discussion on this on <a href="http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/socialbrain/opposing-creating-bonding-and-bridging/" target="_self">Matthew Taylor’s blog)</a>, rather than conflict driven ones.  Conflict has a negative wake, often fracturing communities regardless of the results.</p>
<p>I suggest that Willem’s and Nol’s benign presence is creating bridging social capital and a contagious and soothing balm in this neighbourhood.  The position of their building is literally forming a bridge between 2 faiths.  Nick Booth described their presence as ‘taking the tensions away’.  They are certainly changing how the neighbourhood &#8216;feels&#8217; &#8211; their gentle approach to leadership is having an impact &#8211; one that emerges slowly from the connections and relationships that their social space has created.</p></blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #888888;">Grey Man Bald Man.</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>The locals call Nol Grey Man and Willem Bald Man &#8211; a sign of the affection they have garnered by simply Being There.  I want to share some of things I picked up from talking to Willem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Willem and Nol just plan to be in the neighbourhood.  they just want to be there &#8211; nothing more.  They are not concerned about funding (they are both ok money-wise) so that means they don&#8217;t need to be concerned too much about what funders might want.   For Willem this is the calm culmination of a career spent working in regeneration and community.</li>
<li>They build trust through conversation and being helpful.  Their apartment has big windows and a table where people can sit and drink tea together.  They take their time and help when people ask for it.</li>
<li>The outcomes are very personal. For Willem seeing two young women from different backgrounds laughing together is an outcome &#8211; a success.  Certainly bigger things ahppen &#8211; but he doesn&#8217;t bank on them happening.</li>
</ol>
<p>His approach chimes with the one we have <a title="social media surgery recipe" href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2009/08/12/recipe-how-to-make-a-social-media-surgery/">learnt to adopt</a> for <a title="Social Media Surgery Plus" href="http://socialmediasurgery.com/">social media surgeries</a> &#8211; encourage people to be patient and have low expectations &#8211; high expectations lead to disappointment and a sense of failure.  Being patient and taking your time allows people ina  community to get used to your work being there.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a title="Maurice Specht blog" href="http://www.spechtindestad.nl/">Maurice Specht</a> for organising our trip over  (we have been many times <a title="Residents for regeneration" href="http://r4rrotterdam.wordpress.com/">before</a>) &#8211; more stories from Holland to come.</p>

	<itunes:summary>Nol and Willem - Gray Man Bald Man
It’s odd how when you look away your friends seem to go and do some really interesting stuff. I first met Willem Guizeman in 2005 when he was in Birmingham planning some work on the Residents university for the Residents for Regeneration.  Then he was fronting a Europe wide organisation which was working with the EU.
Last month we saw each other again in The Hague,  his home town.  Now Willem is doing something much more modest.
Because he is close to retirement and doesn’t need to earn big money he and his friend Nol are simply spending time in what they call the Stagehuis Schilderswijk – an apartment they rent on a street corner in a poorer and multi racial area of the city.
“It’s a great way to become an old man..” 


Listen to what he has to say:

Tessy has written about Willem’s thinking here and hopefully he will write a chapter for a new version of the Hand Made book.  Tessy says:
As well as doing activities, their presence is clearly having other effects.  I am currently very focused on side-effects – ones that we measure, but also ones that we don’t think to pay much attention to.  It is one of the reasons I am so intent on developing new creative and collaborative methods (see some further discussion on this on Matthew Taylor’s blog), rather than conflict driven ones.  Conflict has a negative wake, often fracturing communities regardless of the results.

Grey Man Bald Man.


The locals call Nol Grey Man and Willem Bald Man – a sign of the affection they have garnered by simply Being There.  I want to share some of things I picked up from talking to Willem:

The outcomes are very personal. For Willem seeing two young women from different backgrounds laughing together is an outcome – a success.  Certainly bigger things ahppen – but he doesn’t bank on them happening.

His approach chimes with the one we have learnt to adopt for social media surgeries – encourage people to be patient and have low expectations – high expectations lead to disappointment and a sense of failure.  Being patient and taking your time allows people ina  community to get used to your work being there.
Thanks to Maurice Specht for organising our trip over  (we have been many times before) – more stories from Holland to come.

<p>This is the story of Dolores Pinkney who runs <a href="http://www.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=16172">the Dojo project in Handworth</a>. She has been working tirelessly for her community since she moved to Birmingham with her family in the 1960s, and now she has been nominated by Kevin Duffy for Birmingham City Council&#8217;s Local Hearts Awards in the active citizen category.</p>
<p>She says her parents were her inspiration &#8211; they opened up their home to everyone in the area and it became a focal point of the community. Now with her brother Hector, who works at Handsworth Library, Dolores has continued her parents&#8217; legacy with the Dojo project.   It ranges from jogging sessions on Tuesdays &amp; Sundays to securing the lease to build a community play centre on the derelict site of the Hockley flyover.</p>
<p>Dolores says her motivation is &#8220;encouraging everyone that we meet, enabling and empowering,&#8221; and if someone is there who needs help, she cannot turn them away. Here&#8217;s her story.</p>

<p>As a former nurse, Erma had seen the problem of people being unable to leave hospital for want of a wheelchair.  She began to think that if she was able to find and ship old wheelchairs to the Caribbean then perhaps she could also provide them locally.  Now the idea is a registered charity and a team of volunteers repair wheelchairs at a workshop in Harborne.</p>
<p>This podcast was recorded just before the Local Hearts Awards in Birmingham in October 2009 &#8211; where she was shortlisted in the category of female active Citizen.</p>

<p>Four years ago, after running an Islam and the Environment Week, Maud Grainger decided looking at climate change with faith communities would be a great way to take action. The group <a href="http://faithandclimatechange.wordpress.com/">Faith and Climate Change </a>was set up by Maud Grainger with help from Keith Budden, who has nominated the group for Birmingham&#8217;s Local Hearts Award, in the community group category.</p>
<p>Birmingham has over one million of the population belonging to a faith, and this was too big a group not to help with combating climate change, said Maud. The programme has now been replicated across the UK &#8211; looking at climate change in terms of values regardless of faith. Why else would a group a young muslim men from Small Heath meet some old Quakers in Bournville? To look at how they installed solar water heater in the Friends Meeting House. Looking at climate change has brought these communities together. Here, they tell their story.</p>

<p>Nicole White and Rourke Holmes have been training adults.  They  volunteer with different organisations in the<a title="Erdington on the city council website" href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/erdington" target="_blank"> Erdington Constituency</a> of the City of Birmingham to help they appreciate how young people view the world.</p>
<p>The aim is very simple, to improve the relationship between government services and the young people who use them in Erdington.</p>
<p>The Forum began in 2005 when the Erdington Constituency asked a group of young people to set up a consultation in the form of a questionnaire which asked about issues which affect them and their peers. One of the questions was, &#8220;Who would you prefer to ask you questions &#8211; children, or adults&#8221; &#8211; and all the children said adults. But it became clear adults lacked knowledge and how to engage with kids in the decision making process.</p>
<p>So the Children&#8217;s Forum made a training package for the adults looking at the benefits and barriers of involving children. The Children&#8217;s forum then tracked the progress made following the training every six months. They also ran a second training session. Over four years ECCF have reached over 258 adults and 486 children.  This podcast, with Tom Sandars,  was recorded just before the Local Hearts Awards October 2009 &#8211; where the group was shortlisted for the award for Young People&#8217;s Group.</p>

Nicole White and Rourke Holmes have been training adults.  They  volunteer with different organisations in the Erdington Constituency of the City of Birmingham to help they appreciate how young people view the world.
The aim is very simple, to improve the relationship between government services and the young people who use them in Erdington.
The Forum began in 2005 when the Erdington Constituency asked a group of young people to set up a consultation in the form of a questionnaire which asked about issues which affect them and their peers. One of the questions was, “Who would you prefer to ask you questions – children, or adults” – and all the children said adults. But it became clear adults lacked knowledge and how to engage with kids in the decision making process.
So the Children’s Forum made a training package for the adults looking at the benefits and barriers of involving children.

<p>Linda Hines is a remarkable woman (who&#8217;s nerves I can understand but they might surprise some) who first became an active citizen when the council told her they would have to demolish her house.

If you have a stinking brook in your front yard what do you do? Margaret Bannon of the Bordesley Green North Neighbourhood Forum took advantage of the Neighbourhood Performance Reward Grant (NPRG) – a £10,000 pilot programme – to allow residents groups more control over money. This youtube video shows you briefly what happened in Margaret’s neighbourhood and the audio podcast expands on what was done and what was learnt.

The NPRG was created by the Birmingham Community Safety Partnership and is currently being evaluated by the Digbeth Trust.

<p><a title="National Endowment for Science Technology and Arts." href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/" target="_blank">NESTA</a> was in Birmingham today to entice us into innovating. The <a title="Big Green Challenenge Website" href="http://www.biggreenchallenge.org.uk/" target="_blank">Big Green Challenge</a> is a two year climate change project with a £1 million pound prize at the end. Any community group (or similar) can win if they find a communal and repeatable way to cut CO2 emissions by 60%. Easy then!</p>
<p>There were queries/criticism at the launch (which you&#8217;ll hear in the podcast), some on the blog post of the <a href="http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/scienceandtech/mikeswain/october07/green.htm" target="_blank">media partner</a> for the prize and also <a href="http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/?p=366" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I approve of ideas with ambitious targets. Too often public life offers mediocrity born of easy targets.</p>
<p>As one Brummie told us (if anyone remembers who please tell me) at today&#8217;s regional launch it may well work best if people collaborate on ideas. Indeed I was wondering of the prize fund could have been split to reward a winner and reward those who collaborate to innovate &#8211; something on the lines of that audacious <a href="http://www.innovationexchange.net/" target="_blank">open source bid</a> for the Third Sector Innovation Exchange.</p>
<p>Listen to our podcast at the bottom of this post, watch <a title="Big Green Challenge launch Video on Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmmlRtU1CQg" target="_blank">Sarah Beeny&#8217;s video</a>, read the website, subscribe to the <a href="http://www.biggreenchallenge.org.uk/blog/2007/10/24/join-us-at-a-big-green-challenge-event/" target="_blank">blog</a> and let us know if you apply.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmmlRtU1CQg</p>
<p>By the way I heard interesting ideas from Jerome Baddley of <a title="Nottingham Energy Enterprise" href="http://www.nottenergy.com" target="_blank">Nottingham Energy Enterprise</a> &#8211; so hello Jerome. The prize is also on partnership with <a href="http://www.unltd.org.uk" target="_blank">Unltd</a>. Birmingham was the first launch, <a href="http://www.biggreenchallenge.org.uk/blog/2007/10/24/join-us-at-a-big-green-challenge-event/" target="_blank">more dates</a> in other cities throughout November.</p>

NESTA was in Birmingham today to entice us into innovating. The Big Green Challenge is a two year climate change project with a £1 million pound prize at the end. Any community group (or similar) can win if they find a communal and repeatable way to cut CO2 emissions by 60%. Easy then!
There were queries/criticism at the launch (which you’ll hear in the podcast), some on the blog post of the media partner for the prize and also here.
I approve of ideas with ambitious targets. Too often public life offers mediocrity born of easy targets.
As one Brummie told us (if anyone remembers who please tell me) at today’s regional launch it may well work best if people collaborate on ideas. Indeed I was wondering of the prize fund could have been split to reward a winner and reward those who collaborate to innovate – something on the lines of that audacious open source bid for the Third Sector Innovation Exchange.
Listen to our podcast at the bottom of this post, watch Sarah Beeny’s video, read the website, subscribe to the blog and let us know if you apply.

By the way I heard interesting ideas from Jerome Baddley of Nottingham Energy Enterprise – so hello Jerome. The prize is also on partnership with Unltd. Birmingham was the first launch, more dates in other cities throughout November.

<p>Not to a group in Small Heath in Birmingham. Clean Medina says that Muslim neighbourhoods in the city are far too messy and they want to change that. So they’ve launched a “struggle’ against rubbish and waste, and whilst they’re at it they also want to reclaim Jihad as a positive force. The <a href="http://www.cleanmedina.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">campaign</a> kicks off this weekend (23rd september 2007):</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Inner city Muslims and friends will be taking to the streets of inner city Birmingham on 23<sup>rd</sup> September to launch a jihad (struggle) against waste. Rappers, drummers, flag wavers with litter pickers to hand will converge on Small Heath’s Somerville Road to clean up the district.</span></p>
<p>Tired of rubbish-strewn streets, Muslims have decided to clean up and recycle, going from mosque to mosque, starting with Noor ul Uloom mosque, Birmingham’s oldest. TheClean Medina Campaign will be launched with a big push, a shout (Allahu Akbar!) and a (movie) shoot (cast of thousands, mujahidin all). We’re also making a film: Smallywood Heath in Brum!</p></blockquote>
<p>Listen to the podcast to hear rapper Omar Hassan (foregound in the picture), campaigner Assed Baig (behind Omar) and film maker Ayman Ahwal (see picture <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/podnosh/1401499123/" target="_blank">here</a>) explain why they&#8217;re so fed up with the dirty streets that give Muslim neighbourhoods a bad reputation.</p>

<p>This is the story of Chris Hoare: a grandfather who&#8217;s worked for years to clear prostitution from the Waterworks Estate on the borders of Edgbaston and Ladywood in inner-city Birmingham. His neighbours were so fearful of the pimps that they asked Chris to step up and take action. To find out why he did it this way please listen to the podcast.</p>
<p>The tower over Chris&#8217;s shoulder is Perrott&#8217;s Folly &#8211; a building with links to Tolkien. He worked with the <a href="http://www.birminghamconservationtrust.org/finished_perrotts.htm" target="_blank">Birmingham Conservation Trust</a> (declaration &#8211; I&#8217;m a trustee!) to prevent the building&#8217;s collapse. Next steps are to use it as a tourist draw, turning what was once a neighbourhood riddled with vice into an international family attraction.</p>
<p>The residents have also transformed many of their communal areas. Chris is standing in front of Anderton Gardens, a new garden named after a police sergeant who worked with them. (created with help from <a href="http://www.groundwork-birmingham.org.uk/">Groundwork Birmingham</a>)</p>
<p>The pragmatic approach of Chris and others in the Birmingham South West residents group reminds me of so many others we&#8217;ve spoken to on the <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/category/gcpodcast2/">Grassroots Channel</a>, especially the people of <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2006/07/27/does-no-pay-make-you-more-powerful-grassroots-channel-programme-21/" target="_blank">Perry Common</a> and <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2006/07/11/become-a-decision-maker/" target="_blank">Masood Yasin</a> in Washwood Heath.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Active citizens do it all the time, but what does it take to lobby effectively? This programme hears from two people about their experience of lobbying politicians and councillors. David Babbs works for <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Friends of the Earth</a> and belongs to their group in <a href="http://hackneyfoe.gn.apc.org/v1/index.htm" target="_blank">Hackney</a>.   Georgie Bigg lobbys as part of the <a href="http://www.cpre.org.uk/home" target="_blank">Campaign for the Protection of Rural England</a> &#8211; expecially in their <a href="http://www.nobristolairportexpansion.co.uk/" target="_blank">efforts to resist</a> the expansion of Bristol Airport.</p>
<p>Please scroll down to listen first. Here is a list of their most important tips in the order they emerged in the conversation:</p>
<p><strong>1 Understand who has what power.</strong> Lobby the people who can make a difference and aks them to do things they have the power to do.</p>
<p><strong>2 Find out what people think.</strong> The first step of lobbying is to ask those in power what their position is.  They may already agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>3 Work out what&#8217;s in it for them.</strong> What incentive might they have to help you? Do they have a personal passion which may be relevant?</p>
<p><strong>4 People in power don&#8217;t always appreciate where public opinion is.</strong> If you believe the public is forging ahead of those in power tell them so, and most importantly prove it, perhaps with a petition?</p>
<p><strong>5 Know what you want to achieve.</strong> This should probably be number one on the list. Be clear about what change you want to see before you meet someone.  Stay focussed on that in the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>6 Facts are critical.  They persuade.</strong> Politicians are usually generalists so provide them with the information and ammunition to be experts in your subject.  If you win their support show them how to act – give them the tools to be on your side and make your case.</p>
<p><strong>7 Link the lobbying to a wider public campaign.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 Don’t get angry </strong>– use the right tone of voice.</p>
<p><strong>9 Try and get any commitments make in public</strong> – either in the press, at a public meeting, perhaps in parliament or on the minutes of a council meeting.</p>
<p><strong>10 Be human</strong> &#8211; they are (I added that one &#8211; you may not agree!).</p>

<p>OK so a slightly dramatic headline as you can see from the smiling photo. This programme is one of those occasional episodes when we manage to bring an active citizen together with the politician who&#8217;s thwarted their efforts (you might like to <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2006/07/11/the-worst-slum-in-europe/" target="_blank">listen to</a> Albert Bore and Natalie Brade).</p>
<p>For four years Simon Baddeley (the tall one) has campaigned with other <a href="http://www.ted.rudge.btinternet.co.uk/id42.htm" target="_blank">Friends of Black Patch Park</a> to protect this urban green space which is in Sandwell but sits just on the boundary with Birmingham.  Sandwell Council had zoned some of the land for industrial development. The friends campaigned widely &#8211; including making their <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2007/01/29/youtube-black-patch-park/" target="_blank">own media</a> on youtube and using <a href="http://www.flickr.mud.yahoo.com/photos/sibadd/sets/72157600007065188/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Patch_Park" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> to keep tabs on facts and images &#8211; until finally something moved. Earlier this year <a href="http://www.councillor.info/sandwell/bbadham/0/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Councillor Bob Badham</a> (cabinet member for Transport and Regeneration) said the council would review those plans, with the aim to preserve the park as a park.</p>
<p>This podcast is the first time the politician and the campaigner have had a chance to really talk, and I have to say that is part of what we try and do from time to time, create a space where relationships can grow a little.</p>
<p>We also mention a event coming up to explore neighbourhood policing in Birmingham. The <a href="http://www.cforum.org.uk/blog/index.php" target="_blank">Chamberlain Forum</a> is hosting the Chief Constable of the West Midlands and Bishop of Birmingham to explore how policing is responding to what communities want.  You are welcome to come to the free event in Digbeth on the morning of June 13th. Details of how to book can be found <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/blogs.dir/14/files/2007/05/june13event.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The programme has just seen it&#8217;s funding cut for this year, with not guarantee of funding after September 2007.</p>
<p>Speaking at yesterday&#8217;s conference &#8220;Thriving In Diversity&#8221;, the Rt Reverend David Urquhart said that the work already done to establish networks in Birmingham must not go to waste.   He says &#8220;The diversity networks are making a real contribution to the decisions that are made (in the city), so that we get a better quality of life for everyone,&#8221; adding that if the city is to continue benefiting from the networks &#8220;there will need to be some serious commitment from those in power&#8221;.

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.bcen.net/" target="_blank">B:cen</a> (in a report called Thriving in Diversity, summary <a href="http://www.bcen.net/uploads/diversity%20report%20summary.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) said that for Diversity and Community networks to continue to benefit Birmingham,  the city (through the <a href="http://www.bhamsp.org.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Stategic Partnership</a>) would need to find at least £1.4 million pounds a year.</p>

The Bishop of Birmingham has thrown his weight behind the community networks run by the Birmingham Community Empowerment Network.   The programme has just seen it’s funding cut for this year, with not guarantee of funding after September 2007.
Speaking at yesterday’s conference “Thriving In Diversity”, the Rt Reverend David Urquhart said that the work already done to establish networks in Birmingham must not go to waste.   He says “The diversity networks are making a real contribution to the decisions that are made (in the city), so that we get a better quality of life for everyone,” adding that if the city is to continue benefiting from the networks “there will need to be some serious commitment from those in power”.  To listen to more of the bishop’s comments please click on the play button below.
Yesterday B:cen (in a report called Thriving in Diversity, summary here) said that for Diversity and Community networks to continue to benefit Birmingham,  the city (through the Birmingham Stategic Partnership) would need to find at least £1.4 million pounds a year.

<p>This programme is presented by two teenagers from Highgate in Birmingham.  Earlier this month Stephen Hughes and Gareth Deeming spent a day in London talking to ministers and senior civil servants about young people and the communities where they live.</p>
<p>They had a few minutes with <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1122769" target="_blank">Baroness Andrews</a> and recorded their conversation on a mobile phone (they had left for London with a digital recorder &#8211; which failed on them!).

This programme is presented by two teenagers from Highgate in Birmingham.  Earlier this month Stephen Hughes and Gareth Deeming spent a day in London talking to ministers and senior civil servants about young people and the communities where they live.
They had a few minutes with Baroness Andrews and recorded their conversation on a mobile phone (they had left for London with a digital recorder – which failed on them!).   This forms the core of the podcast, but in it they also explain how they want support to work with a group called SCAWDI to develop a new apprenticeship for young people.
The community apprenticeship is being designed to get young people learning through working in their community, and also expose them to a much wider range of experiences and aspirations. The plan is to lift their lives to the point where they can once again fulfill their full potential.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beth Kanter of the <a href="http://www.sharingfoundation.org/">Sharing Foundation</a> explains how they used the internet to raise $100,000 for children in Cambodia. I&#8217;ve known Beth through blogging for a few months now, but finally met her in Birmingham earlier this month.</p>
<p>She is an expert on the internet and non-profit organisations and in this podcast she talks about how you combine online tools such as widgets with the power of your networks, whether real or virtual, to encourage people to give money to support to your cause. She also writes about how they raised the money <a href="http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2007/01/sharing_foundat.html" target="_blank">here</a> on her blog and an earlier experiment with ChipIn <a href="http://widgetfundraising.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.<span id="more-124"></span></p>

<p>This also represents a bit of a first for the Grassroots Channel because we have figured out how to add documents to our podcast feed &#8211; pdfcasting? (<a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2007/01/22/technobabble-a-short-list-of-home-words/" target="_blank">ouch</a> <a href="http://partnerships.typepad.com/civic/2007/01/home_truths_abo.html" target="_blank">ouch</a>). So with this comes a <a title="pdf, 365kb" href="http://podnosh.com/files/2007/01/bcenpdf070124onlinefundraisingguide.pdf" target="_blank">beginners guide to online fundraising</a> (pdf, 365kb) written as one of a series of briefings we have done for the <a href="http://www.bcen.net" target="_blank">Birmingham Community Empowerment Network</a>. It is aimed at groups who are not charities and offers basic tips on how to raise funds using the internet through donate buttons, selling and buying online. If you&#8217;ve never used the net in this way before this is the guide for you!</p>
<p>In the podcast Beth talks about widgets, so I thought I would show you what she means. This one is for Kate Chapman, a friend of mine who will soon be running to raise money for <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/cucumber" target="_blank">Marie Curie Cancer Care</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone can add these widgets to their blog or website and they update as the fundraising progresses. It is the same technology <a href="http://podnosh.com/Grassroots/badge/" target="_blank">we use</a> to allow you to put the <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/category/gcpodcast2/" target="_blank">Grassroots Channel Podcast</a> on your own website. (Be carefully not to overload your website with widgets or it will slow down the time pages take to load).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Play is a every child&#8217;s human right&#8221;</em></p>
<p>After a decade or more working with after school clubs and play schemes Laura Watts established a new organisation in Birmingham called Dens of Equality. She wanted to help the families who found their children effectively barred from the pleasure of full blown play because they had some form of disability.</p>
<p>Dens of Equality is a central hub which helps groups of parents create their own autonomous organisations. With these the families can apply for funds and also approach play workers directly, encouraging them to find new ways to include all children in their play schemes. They create tight new relationships which work for professionals, parents and children, all using a system which hands power to the people closest to each child.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a couple of things I wanted to mention.  Thanks a bundle to <a href="http://www.peteashton.com/06/12/05/brum_blog_7.html" target="_blank">Pete Ashton</a> of Bournville (the place where we make chocolate) who wrote this about the Grassroots Channel:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://podnosh.com//">Podnosh</a> is a podcast station based in Birmingham that I stumbled across recently. I like that this pretty established outfit with high aims exists outside of my awareness &#8211; it implies there&#8217;s even more happening online in the city for me to discover. I&#8217;m particularly taken with the <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/category/gcpodcast2/">Grassroots Channel</a> which &#8220;is here to provoke and inspire anyone who thinks they just might want to change the world around them&#8221;.

	<itunes:summary>Just a couple of things I wanted to mention.  Thanks a bundle to Pete Ashton of Bournville (the place where we make chocolate) who wrote this about the Grassroots Channel:
Podnosh is a podcast station based in Birmingham that I stumbled across recently. I like that this pretty established outfit with high aims exists outside of my awareness – it implies there’s even more happening online in the city for me to discover. I’m particularly taken with the Grassroots Channel which “is here to provoke and inspire anyone who thinks they just might want to change the world around them”. For a quality sample check out this interview with Soweto Kinch, a jazz saxophonist and rapper from Handsworth who recently released an CD set in a tower block in B19, samples of which can be found on his MySpace page. Given what he says in that interview I intend to investigate Mr Kinch further.
Pete come and talks to us – I bet there’s loads I’ve yet to discover. Perhaps together we can get dear old web 1.-1 Digital Birmingham listening?

His efforts have helped revive George’s park in Handsworth and he’s become a street champion for his road in Lozells.  Sounds like a goody-two-shoes? Well he isn’t and if you listen to this week’s Grassroots Channel podcast you’ll find out why.

<p>The University lasts from Sept 13th to the 16th and there are still a few places left (you don&#8217;t have to go for the whole time!).

<p>I&#8217;ve just spent a wonderful morning with two women who are both directors of <a href="http://www.wittonlodge.org.uk" target="_blank">Witton Lodge Community A</a><a href="http://www.wittonlodge.org.uk" target="_blank">ssociation</a>. Linda Hines has been involved for 15 years while Michelle Ashmore got stuck in just two or three years ago.</p>
<p>The Association has been working really closely with Birmingham City Council and other partners to drive through a huge regeneration project for Perry Common in the north of the city. It began with the bombshell that hundreds of homes were so structurally unsound they would have to be demolished.</p>
<p>The association is really central to its success for two reasons. First the 14 unpaid (and mostly resident) directors have a common sense idea of how to help the community thrive. Secondly the council was unable to raise the money for rebuilding on its own. The finance was only possible because of the association. Their hard won expertise is now being shared through the governments <a href="http://civilrenewal.communities.gov.uk/civil/about-civil-renewal/civil-renewal-unit/guide-neighbourhoods/">Guide Neighbourhoods</a> programme (along with Balsall Heath and Castle Vale)</p>
<p>If you scroll down you can listen to their lively (and sometimes tearful) conversation and find out why both directors are convinced that much of their power derives from them being unpaid. So much so that wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way. Oh and please leave any comments here on the blog.</p>

The Church of England in Birmingham thinks it may make a huge difference. In fact it seems Lent is a good time for us all learn something about generosity – including the church and its congregation. The weeks running up to Easter in the Christian Calendar have long been seen as a time of self denial. But the Anglican Church in the city is trying to turn that notion upside down and make lent the time of generosity. It has printed 60,000 books full of generous actions designed to strengthen communities and it wants people across the city to channel the discipline of self denial into a festival of giving.
The Director of the city’s Forum for Community Regeneration, Fred Rattley, tells us more about  Love life, live lent.
