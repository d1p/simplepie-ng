			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://citygardeningonline.com/wp-content/uploads/StooksPunes7_269x178.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1730" title="StooksPunes7_269x178" src="http://citygardeningonline.com/wp-content/uploads/StooksPunes7_269x178.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="178" /></a>If you go into the woods today, be sure to mind your &#8220;stooks and punes&#8221;! Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s easy to do, and only a tiny bit scary. Nestled next to a lightly wooded area of Edwards Gardens, the &#8220;Stooks and Punes&#8221; art installation at the <a title="TBG" href="http://www.torontobotanicalgarden.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto Botanical Garden </a>(TBG) is made for exploration by the young &#8212; and the young at heart. Wondrous structures, crafted from branches and grasses and bundled into shapes and forms that would make Tim Burton look twice, the &#8220;stooks&#8221; (an agricultural term referring to stacks of cut grain) and &#8220;punes&#8221; (a made-up word from designer <a title="WGarySmith" href="http://www.wgarysmith.com" target="_blank">W. Gary Smith&#8217;s </a>childhood to describe his cowlicks) arranged in circles invite discovery and play. TBG Director of Education Liz Hood describes them as at once, &#8220;edgy, magical, disturbing and exciting&#8221; .</p>
<p><a href="http://citygardeningonline.com/wp-content/uploads/StooksPunes10_269x178.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1731" title="StooksPunes10_269x178.jpg" src="http://citygardeningonline.com/wp-content/uploads/StooksPunes10_269x178.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="178" /></a>The Stooks and Punes installation at the TBG is the first Canadian project by renowned landscape designer W. Gary Smith who celebrates plants and their connections between people and nature. Now a resident of Toronto, Smith has worked extensively in the USA and is currently master planning a garden design for the new <a title="SanteFeBotanicalGarden" href="http://www.santafebotanicalgarden.org/" target="_blank">Santa Fe Botanical Garden</a>; the Children’s Garden at the <a href="http://http://www.wildflower.org" target="_blank">Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center </a>in Austin, Texas; new children’s features in <a href="http://www.bryantpark.org/" target="_blank">Bryant Park </a>in New York City; the Discovery Garden at the <a title="BBG" href="http://www.bbg.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>; a therapeutic garden for the <a href="http://www.bbgardens.org/index2.php" target="_blank">Birmingham Botanical Gardens</a>, Alabama; and the John C. Wister Rhododendron Garden at <a href="http://www.tylerarboretum.org/" target="_blank">Tyler Arboretum </a>in Media, Pennsylvania. He is the ongoing restoration landscape architect for <a href="http://www.winterthur.org/" target="_blank">Winterthur Museum </a>and Country Estate in Delaware.</p>
<p>For the sake of child&#8217;s play, we can only hope this is the first of many of Smith&#8217;s projects in Toronto.</p>

<p>Jeff Lowenfels travelled all the way from Alaska to Canada Blooms to dish the dirt on soil to Toronto gardeners &#8212; and I&#8217;m glad he did. His lecture on Wednesday afternoon was all about mycorrhizal fungi, protazoa, nematodes and bacteria. Yes, I&#8217;ve heard about these micro-organisms but never in such an entertaining way. Somehow, he pulled together what I&#8217;d learned as a bunch of disparate information and made sense of it all. Did you know:<br />
1.) 96 percent of plants form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi<br />
2.) There are 2 kinds of nitrogen: NO3 (nitrates) and NO4 (ammonia)<br />
3.) NO3 is bacteria-dominant and is beneficial to annuals, bulbs and crops<br />
4.) NO4 is fungi based, which aids perennials, shrubs and trees<br />
5.) Slugs are good guys (especially if you&#8217;re not fond of hostas&#8230;), which live underground as well as on hosta leaves. In the soil, they help break down fungi and bacteria, and that&#8217;s a good thing.<br />
6.) Birds are taxi cabs for protazoa (that&#8217;s another good thing)<br />
7.) Rototilling is bad for soil health (but you knew that, right?)<br />
8.) Soil depleted of microbes can be rejuvenated by adding compost, using compost tea, mulching and adding mycorrhizal fungi<br />
9.) Mulch with green organics to attract bacteria (to benefit annuals, bulbs and crops)<br />
10.) Mulch with brown organics to attract fungi (to help perennials, shrubs and trees)</p>
<p>Hooked on soil? Buy Jeff&#8217;s book, Teaming with Microbes. It&#8217;s the best thing you can do for your plants!<br />

<p>Those of you who have been following my Facebook posts know that I was lucky enough to be invited by the Tourism Authority of Thailand to visit some of that amazing country’s gardens and attractions. Fresh from that trip, I’m all agog with ideas for adding a touch of Thai to my own garden.</p>
<p>Once I got over seeing beds planted with amaryllis, bromeliads and cycads (okay, the truth is, I never did get over seeing these “houseplants” grounded in the earth…) I noticed that every garden seemed to have a little house on stilts or pillars nestled into a nook or corner. Often built of sturdy teakwood, each house was laden with fresh, colourful floral “offerings” made of marigolds, orchids and roses. Many of these houses held pots for smoldering sticks of incense while others were even fitted with little electrical lights. Our guide Tippie told the story of a recent lottery winner who extravagantly outfitted his garden house with air conditioning!</p>
<p>What was this distinctive Thai landscaping custom all about? Too small (and impractically high) to be tool sheds and too large for bird feeders, it was clear these little houses were important garden structures. They often stood at the end of well-trodden pathways where they commanded a certain amount of attention.</p>
<p>These, explained several guides on the trip, were spirit houses. A remnant of a form of spirit worship that predates Buddhism and that endures to permeate everyday life in modern, religiously tolerant Thailand, spirit houses are meant to placate the gods of the land, and if you care about your property, you’ll take great pains to site your spirit house where it can offer the best protection.</p>
<p>Rituals, often elaborate and involving the help of a Brahmin priest or a monk as well as consultations with the landowners’ horoscopes, guide the placement, colour and design of the spirit house. There are some basic rules: never place one under the eaves of the house and never point it towards a toilet (or “happy room” as our guide Tippie calls it!). Once erected, daily offerings ensue, to charm, entertain and otherwise placate the gods of the land in the belief that contented spirits will bring prosperity, health and happiness to the land and its owners.</p>
<p>Although I might forego the ritual (it’s difficult to find a saffron-robed monk in Toronto), the idea of constructing a spirit house in my garden is appealing. I would gladly bedeck it with offerings in the hope that my lovely double bloodroot will bloom for another season; that the mature tree peony I brutishly moved last spring regains its former vigour; and that the Zone 7 erodium adapts to my Zone 6 garden.</p>
<p>And anyway, a spirit house would be a handy place to tuck away a trowel…</p>
