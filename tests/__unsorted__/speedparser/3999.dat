		<title>At least the pig in Artus gives me something to look at.</title>

	Hey there, kids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a while since I've had something to grouse about.  You see, I realized something important when I was doing this blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I avoided playing new games and only played games that I knew that I would enjoy, then I would have a better time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find that fewer than one out of ten new games that I play really give me a lot of pleasure.  Those are pretty low odds.  Instead, I know I have shelves full of games that I chose to not sell, and the chance is much better that I'll have a good time than one out of ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, I've not been playing a lot of new games.  I did play one the other week that got my blood a'boiling - Artus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can sum up the problem with this game quickly: &lt;b&gt;You can't plan your turns.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not a good tactician in games.  I know this, so I tend to avoid games that require significant last-minute decision-making.  I get pleasure in games when I can make longer-term strategies and then work on carrying those out, with small adjustments as time goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a game is tactical, I need time to think about what I'm doing.   So, a game that has a game state that changes significantly, then offers a wide space of possible choices that you can't analyze until your turn comes up really gets my goat.  And I like my goat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Artus is one example of games that do this - there are many games that have the same problem.  Thurn and Taxis, for example, has this problem with the &quot;flushing&quot; mechanism.  I'd like to flush that mechanism!     This is also a frustration with Through the Ages, as the track of cards disappears so quickly that I don't feel I can plan very well until my turn comes around. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Artus really bugged me as the game went on.  See, there's this wheel-of-meaningless-points that the game centers around (with a pig on it).  The wheel awards different amounts of points based upon how close you are sitting to the king (and on what side).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img border=0 src=&quot;http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971590_md.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you play 2 out of 6 cards, which can move individual pieces, can change who is the King, or can score points for your people.  The frustration comes in that when the King moves or changes, the wheel spins, which can greatly change the effects of your cards.  So, in many cases, I found myself at the start of the turn trying to re-figure out what combination of 2 cards would work the best because Mr. King Switcher before me just pulled a smarty-pants trick and flushed my plans down the toilet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, there I am, panicking and sweating while the other players glare onward, having given up trying to plan their turns as I'll surely do something that will cause havoc.  In a panic, I grab randomish cards from my hand just to keep the game moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a feature I don't like in games.  If you are a game designer and are going to have the game state change dramatically, then reduce the decision space so there is less to re-analyze when the world shifts, or make it so the world doesn't shift as dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you choose to make a game like this one where I'm bored for 75% of the time as I can't do anything but look at the pointless pig, and panicked for 25% of the time, then that's not a fun play experience for me, and I'll be telling your game to Get Off My Lawn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now scram, kids.  You all need a shower!  And next time, don't bring a game.  I've got enough good ones here.
