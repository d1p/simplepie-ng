 <title>What is the Future of Network Culture? </title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/blog/what_is_the_future_of_network_culture</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;One of the central tenets of the &lt;a href=&quot;/network_culture&quot; class=&quot;alinks-link&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Network Culture&lt;/a&gt; book is that we live in an atemporal condition, a paradoxical time in which we no longer understand the world in historical terms. The sort of historical narratives that were crucial to modernism and postmodernism did not accompany us into the new millenium. My position on atemporality requires a long argument so you&amp;#39;re better off reading the chapter in the network culture book if you want to find out more. Purposefully, however, atemporality (and the concept of network culture as a whole) is a broad generalization, ridden with exceptions and fault lines. Rather than flaws in my argument, I understand these as flaws in the system to be exploited in order to undo the worst parts of network culture. In the case of atemporality, the most pernicious parts are our inability to map ourselves historically in order to take stock of our condition and the lack of alternative temporalities together with the possibility of rupture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;Still, its becoming clear that there is a kind of early network culture that came before the economic crisis of 2008 and a late (or high? middle? its too early to tell yet, we&amp;#39;ll call it late for now, in hopes of something better coming down the pike in a decade) network culture that follows. So, too, we could well also speak of a first phase, a proto-network culture that began in the mid-1990s and ended prior to the dot.com crash of 2000, the millenium, and 9/11.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;Is periodizing network culture not a contradiction? Of course it is, in the terms I outlined above but only to a point. These periods are scarcely felt. They are not periods with which, generally speaking, we mark our time, but each marks an intensification of network culture, accompanied by a higher level of atemporality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;Proto-network culture is both postmodern and not. It is marked by the overwhelming sense of the end of history, of the millennium as postmodernism itself was. Yet it is also marked by the sense that postmodernism has come to an end. Symposium after symposium on the end of history and the end of theory consumed academe at this point. But the unimaginable future was nigh, no longer the product of the nuclear bomb (that future had not come to pass) but rather of the information bomb, the explosive promise of the dot.com boom. Soon, it seemed, a new economy would take hold. Everything would change. Everything did change, but it wasn&amp;#39;t just a matter of the spread of e-commerce, broadband, and endless connectivity. The dot.com crash itself established the boom and bust nature of network culture, with its heady optimism about a revolutionary, but even more highly capitalized future and its ability to throw away that future seemingly overnight in a panic. If unable to consider the past, this phase of network culture, then, was still obsessed with a future, an endlessly deferred proximate future of technological promise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;Early network culture was marked by this constantly receding event horizon. The moment it was reached another, generally mobile technology promised a revolution in everyday life. Urban wireless networks, mobile broadband, smart phones, geolocative smart phones, tablets, and ubiquitous computing; each of these, their prophets suggested, would crank us into a world of unprecedented, shiny newness. Smart cities would be just around the corner, as bright and promising to us as Corbusier&amp;#39;s Contemporary City must have seemed in the mid-1920s. But there was already a notion that everything had changed, that a new economy had taken hold, as demonstrated by the impossible rise of the housing market and the endless profusion of easy credit. We lived, it seemed to many, in a newly globalzied, urban wonder-world dominated &amp;nbsp;by creative city-states, liberal science fiction wonderlands in which architecture and technology would be wedded together to create places that would be nothing less than a great deal of fun.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;Its only with the collapse of the housing bubble, the onset of the prolonged recession and the proliferation of that last promised technology, the tablet, that network culture has entered more fully into a condition of not only a suspended past but also a suspneded future. The housing bubble itself was a crisis of the future. As history had ended, so now the future ended. Ezra Pound&amp;#39;s old cry &amp;quot;Make it new!&amp;quot; could now only be uttered by tired characters in a thought bubble in a New Yorker cartoon. And just as the days after 9/11 gave us a war without end, we are now given a recession without end. The new stationary economy seems punctuated by mini-booms that will buoy markets and epochal crises (like the impending collapse of the Eurozone, the second leg of the Great Recession, and of course everyone&amp;#39;s great terror, the collapse of the massive Chinese property bubble). But the Great Recession is itself no longer even something that finance fears. The canny will make billions as before. Everyone else will be poorer, their futures more exhausted, less full of promise than ever. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cke_pastebin&quot;&gt;My interest in all this, as before, is to ask what sort of fissures the edifice of network culture might have. How do we find ways not to get out of the cycle but to get out of the system itself? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Books and the Problem with their Future</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/blog/books_and_the_problem_with_their_future</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The fall of old media and the maturing of new is a key aspect of &lt;a href=&quot;/network_culture&quot; class=&quot;alinks-link&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;network culture&lt;/a&gt;. Never before have the forms of media and the means by which they have been distributed and read changed so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But speaking as a historian, designer, and author (not to mention as media review editor of &lt;em&gt;the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians&lt;/em&gt;), I am concerned about the future of media. In particular, I worry about how the formats being developed in media are evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books and periodicals have proved robust over time. It&amp;#39;s easy to pick up a book from the sixteenth century and read it. The publications of our day, on the other hand, are posing a problem to future readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we have PDFs. Nobody seems to like PDFs and their capabilities are rather limited. They are hard to protect and easy to disseminate, making publishers wary of them (the vast majority of book piracy is in PDF). PDFs maintain the format of the printed page, which is great when you need it, but also a limitation (for example, older readers can&amp;#39;t make the text larger). eBooks such as found on the Kindle and on Apple&amp;#39;s iBooks stores seem to have more robust digital rights management protection but can also be hacked and freely distributed (never underestimate the book pirates: they will win in the end just as they did with music). But these eBooks are even more limited than PDFs. Formatting is quite limited and adding rich media such videos as to the text hasn&amp;#39;t proved possible yet. These eBooks are, if anything, a step back from the PDF and even the book, becoming nothing less than some kind of weird intermediary between the scroll and the codex.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are app books for the iPad, Android, and other tablet computers, such as Wolfram&amp;#39;s the Elements or Phaidon&amp;#39;s Design Classics. As librarian John Dupuis points out on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2011/08/on_the_evilness_of_the_emergin.php&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, these are visually compellling but an outright disaster for users in the long run. The model of book ownership that prevailed for so many years is now replaced by a model of licensing. Yes, it appears that you purchased Design Classics, but can you resell it? Can you give it to a friend for a birthday present? Can you take the pages in it and cut them up for an art project? Can you check it out from a library? Will you be able to take it with you if you tire of your iPad and want to move to an Android? Generally speaking, all of these are impossible. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dupuis suggests, some kind of open access and standards based authoring environment needs to be developed for the book world. How long will this take to emerge? When I first saw Apple&amp;#39;s Hypercard authoring environment in 1987, I was certain that the future of the book had arrived. But now, that future has gone into the past, almost irretrievably so (go ahead, just try to open a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard&quot;&gt;Hypercard&lt;/a&gt; stack from 1987 such as the incredible&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Zaum Gadget&lt;/em&gt;). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is the Web immune to these problems. HTML is limited so Web owners turn to authoring environments like Flash or content management systems like Drupal, (which serves this site). But if I stop updating this site, even if I continue to pay the bills for the hosting and the domain name servers, one day the PHP programming language or the MySQL database on which Drupal run will be updated to the point that an update to Drupal will be required. Drupal has this mantra called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/65922&quot;&gt;the drop keeps moving&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; which basically means any module or extension involved in this site (and there are many) as well as the theme (or graphic layout) will break unless it is updated too. Even if someone was able to log into my site and update it, they would have to update the modules and the theme. Now, I am sure my readership would rather that I write more and update the architecture to my site less (unless that update is necessary for functionality) so I try to update as little as possible but when I do a major update, I generally devote two to three weeks to update all of my sites (audc.org, networkarchitecturelab.org, docomomo-us.org, networkedpublics.org and so on). Now I could export everything to HTML and forget about updating the site ever again. That could last a long time (for example, my friend Derek Gross died in 1996 but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elh.org/derek.html&quot;&gt;his site &lt;/a&gt;is still up) but that conversion process too is likely to take at least a week and would require a Drupal developer. Is that going to happen? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is new. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/&quot;&gt;Institute for the Future of the Book&lt;/a&gt; has been talking about this for years now. But this is a crisis of major proportions for anyone involved in thinking about human culture in the long term and we need to make all the noise about it we can. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Regarding the Euro</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/blog/regarding_the_euro</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest story of the last two decades has not been the opening up of China, rather it&amp;#39;s been the creation of the Eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;wiki media map of eurozone&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Eurozone.svg/560px-Eurozone.svg.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 428px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, take the size of the combined economy of the Eurozone. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)&quot;&gt;In terms of GDP&lt;/a&gt;, it is larger than China, second only to that of the US (the European Union, which also includes the United Kingdom and much of Eastern Europe would be the world&amp;#39;s largest economy, except that it quite doesn&amp;#39;t function as one economy).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I write about architecture, networks, and economy, the reason I am interested in the Eurozone is that it was an unprecedented construction of a single smooth space&amp;mdash;to use Deleuzean terms&amp;mdash;on a planetary scale. With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991, it seemed to confirm Deleuze&amp;#39;s suggestion that the old regime of enclosures was giving way to a new world of modulations. Seemingly overnight, national currencies and border controls, the most familiar artifacts of modern nationhood, disappeared to get out of the way of the rapid circulation of capital and increased worker mobility. For Eastern Europe the delight in national independence at last swiftly faded, giving way to the rush to be subsumed into a larger union again, albeit voluntarily this time, without the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s tanks and guns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What struck me during this period was the incredible openness of Europeans, both to each other and to those of us whose primary residence was abroad. As borders opened, so did minds. The development of the Internet went hand in hand with this opening up, allowing Europeans to go beyond the traditional boundaries of their national languages and literatures to share their ideas and learn from others at remarkable speeds. This is not to say that this wasn&amp;#39;t going on everywhere, but it was particularly in evidence in Europe where the growth curve was very fast, a stark contrast to what was going on in the United States where thought often seemed stuck in the dark ages. For a time, Europe seemed to regain its status as the world&amp;#39;s center of culture&amp;mdash;as much as such a thing could exist&amp;mdash;from the United States. Who would have thought, in 1991, that two of my books would be published by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://actar.es/&quot;&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona, that I would publish as much in European periodicals as in the United States, or that I would be teaching in Ireland part time?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the August crisis&amp;mdash;and the last three years teach us&amp;mdash;that growth curve got ahead of itself and Europe now faces a grave economic crisis. The economies of European countries were at different places when they joined the Eurozone and there&amp;#39;s no way that in a few years everyone could be at the same place as Germany. Where it seemed to happen, as in the last half of the Celtic Tiger, this was largely done on debt, a condition that has now been demonstrated as impossible to sustain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the collapse of the Euro is being talked about as a real possibility, what sort of impact will this have on &lt;a href=&quot;/network_culture&quot; class=&quot;alinks-link&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;network culture&lt;/a&gt;? Is the Eurozone like the League of Nations, a great idea whose time has not yet come but will arrive, bigger and better soon? Or is it a historical anomaly? Even if globalization is a dominant economic force today, will a decade of economic stagnation couple with a collapsed eurozone lead to renewed calls for nationalism? Is the dialectic of smooth and striated space (remember, for Deleuze it was always a dialectic) about to shift again?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the biggest questions for all of us this fall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hurricane Morning</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/microblog/hurricane_morning</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like we’ll be ok. Local weather stations suggest that we got some 4 inches of rain. At 4 we were woken up by some vicious winds and moved to a lower room that seemed safer. We did lose the top of a tree but it landed on the woodpile. Nevertheless, there are still hours to go. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Storm Starts</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/microblog/the_storm_starts</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The storm is starting even though it is still a very long way off. I know this is only a taste of what we’re going to get later in the night and tomorrow morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern we have is the amount of water we’re going to get. We are on a hillside and we have concerns about how saturated the soil is on that hillside. That said, I think this is a safe place to live, likely the safest I’ve ever lived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still surprising how many people fervently believe that the augmented city will get them out of this no matter what. So many individuals seem so used to that condition that they forget just how fragile those networks are and don’t have any backup plans for when they fail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>We’ve completed our preparations for Hurricane Irene and...</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/microblog/we%E2%80%99ve_completed_our%C2%A0preparations%C2%A0for_hurricane_irene_and</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve completed our preparations for Hurricane Irene and are getting periodic waves of rain, some of it light, some of it heavy, from the outer arms. Although we’ve taken this as seriously, I’m concerned about the number of windows we have at the new house. I haven’t boarded them up. For one, nobody has suggested doing that around here yet. Second, they’re double paned tempered glass and should resist breakage well and, if they do break, shouldn’t pose a threat. Third, holes in the exterior walls of this house would pretty much ruin the exterior. Still, although I’ve cleared the yard as much as I can, and we’re both on the side of a hill and inland, anything is possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll report in as I can. In the meantime, here’s one of my favorite songs. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>On August Disasters</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/blog/on_august_disasters</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When the collective wisdom is unquestioned, it is a good sign that it is wrong. Take the collapse of the housing crisis, for example, which caught a generation of architects, businesspeople, politicians and economists unawares even though to anyone who bothered to look at the situation, the inevitability of the outcome was plain as day. Unfortunately, its a facet of modern society that people learn little from such mistakes. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;#39;s events have me thinking again about some of the gaps in our collective wisdom. We started off with another market crisis triggered by political stalemate, mounting global debts, and reports that economies have run out of steam. None of these are new and should have come as no surprise. Rather this is the sort of stationary state that Gopal Balakrishnan diagnosed as the new status quo back in 2009 in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newleftreview.org/A2799&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. In this condition, the market winds up exploited by profiteers who have little interest in actual investment but rather only in profiting off the swings as this Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2011/08/09/high-frequency-traders-win-in-market-bloodbath/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; reports. Capitalism itself is being fundamentally altered under such conditions. Even if, quite obviously, capitalism remains based on investment, when the origin of that investment is increasingly relegated to individually funded pensions (in other words to a class that a scant generation ago was not directly associated with large investment) while the capitalist elite is playing an entirely different game, we have to ask ourselves if &lt;a href=&quot;/network_culture&quot; class=&quot;alinks-link&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;network culture&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#39;t breeding an economic mutation that we can scarce appreciate yet. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my concern today isn&amp;#39;t economics, its the uncritical urban ideology that now dominates thinking in architecture, politics, and urbanism. With the development of network cities in the 1990s and the apparent recovery of cities like New York, Los Angeles, and London, it&amp;#39;s easy to be confident that we live in the urban millennium, the age of &amp;quot;the endless city,&amp;quot; powered by the net, jet travel, finance, and conspicious consumption of architecture, clothing, and technology. Of course we have reminders like Detroit and New Orleans, but these are supposed to be indicators of the sort of rigid thought that we&amp;#39;ve left behind long ago. Network culture is supposed to be totally different, right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August is traditionally the month that most people in the Northern hemisphere who have the luxury of taking time off depart on vacation. But as Russians know, it is also the month of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/08/russia-august-putsch.html&quot;&gt;the August Curse&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; the month when people go away to the dacha only to find that the country has collapsed or unthinkable acts of terrorism have taken place. So this year we have another crisis in the market, but we also have Hurricane Irene barrelling toward the East Coast, due to land almost six years to the day after Katrina hit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re lucky, Irene will turn out to be a non-event, it&amp;#39;s greatest harm being making a populace that is convinced nothing will happen to them since they are armed with iPhones feel invincible. But if we&amp;#39;re unlucky, it will hit hard. When the city suffered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/12908/&quot;&gt;direct strike in 1893&lt;/a&gt;, Manhattan south of Canal Street was flooded and waters rose thirteen feet in an hour where Battery Park City now stands. There&amp;#39;s nothing the city has done since then to mitigate this in any serious way so if a storm hits, expect lower Manthattan to look worse than Katrina. Water, of course, seeks the lowes point so a storm surge into the subway system will follow, rapidly overwhelming the system&amp;#39;s pumps and&amp;mdash;apart from extending service disruptions (at this stage, the MTA expects to shut down in advance of the storm Saturday an noon and not reopen until Monday) will damage and corrode the aged equipment, leading to repairs that might takes months or even years to finish. Commuter rail lines will do little better and perhaps, given the state of Amtrak&amp;#39;s lines into Penn Station, even worse, thus crippling commuting into the city for some time to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-25/hurricane-irene-threatens-u-s-east-coast-with-up-to-13-9-billion-damage.html&quot;&gt;One analyst suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the hurricane may cause up to $20 billion in direct damages, but the indirect costs of such an event could be much higher, leading to a final death blow for the city&amp;#39;s struggling financial industry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/nyregion/nyc-bank-layoffs-prompt-worries-of-double-dip-recession.html&quot;&gt;already in trouble&lt;/a&gt; as the second dip of this decade-long recession gets underway. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity that we have built into our urban systems is profoundly dangerous. Urban systems are extremely interdependent today and we are less able to operate outside of them than ever. But this applies to our personal lives too. Those who have gotten rid of land lines for cell phones got a little reminder during this week&amp;#39;s earthquake of how rapidly such systems are overwhelmed during times of crisis. But even land lines aren&amp;#39;t the same anymore, with voltage-carrying copper replaced by cable and fiber and phones that plug into the wall replaced by cordless phones. We are more and more dependent on electricity and on such systems continuing to run. How many of us even have battery-powered radios anymore? Or maps and compasses to evacuate if data communications are down? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw earlier this year in Japan, modern life can come to a halt rapidly and take a long time to recover. A direct hit by a Category 3 storm on New York or a disaster of similar scale on a major metropolis like Tokyo or London would have major repercussions on the model of high density living that we accept without question today. In that case, this may yet be a century known for urban collapse and reruralization in the developed world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Rise and Fall of New Media</title>
 <link>http://varnelis.net/blog/the_rise_and_fall_of_new_media</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My essay &amp;quot;the Rise and Fall of New Media&amp;quot; can be found in the twentieth anniversary issue of Frieze and online their site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/down-the-line/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s paired with an essay by Lauren Cornell of Rhizome and the New Museum. Together, both deal with the issue that far from being a niche interest, as Cornell writes, &amp;quot;every kind of artistic practice has been touched by the Internet as both a tool and as something that affects us in a broader sense&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posting has been light this summer as I&amp;#39;ve moved into a new house (modernism, even!) but things have been moving behind the scenes. With the new semester coming up, expect more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
