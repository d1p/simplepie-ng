Eli had to choose a lucky girl to dance with throughout the night. Since Eli wasn’t my ultimate bias in U-Kiss, I didn’t bother to frantically raise up my hands hoping to be chosen, like other fangirls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;I, on the other hand, was laughing my ass off with my friend. We were making a joke out of the whole situation. I jokingly said that Eli would pick me. And we started laughing loudly. We laughed too loud till I caught Eli’s attention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Eli looked at me, giving a devilish smile. His smile really complimented his ugly coloured hair. Then, he stretched out his arms and I blushingly held his hands. He chose me. I was the chosen one! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Suddenly, I felt as if the whole world stopped and as though Cinderella’s fairy god-mother was there. Because, out of nowhere I was wearing this very beautiful white dress, almost like a wedding dress while Eli was in a very manly white tux. He looked dashing, well, except for his hair. We then started dancing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;I didn’t know ballroom dancing so Eli led me to it first. Such a gentleman he is. Half way through dancing to the classical music, the music tempo fastened. Everyone in the room including the fangirls started cheering for the both of us. We started dancing like how we all danced during HMS FOC. It was crazy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;I was too excited that i hugged Eli. And that was the best part! I could even feel his muscles as I hugged him. I did have some problems hugging him since he was way taller than me. Nonetheless, I was really happy I get to hug him ^^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/567818410</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/567818410</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2010 17:19:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>YOUNG SAENG OPPA AGAIN!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;SS501 was in Singapore. I was lucky enough to go for their fan meeting with Alida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there I was in a function room, looking at SS501. As soon as the fanmeet was over, all the fangirls ran crazily towards the carpark to send SS501 off. However, they were too excited that they didn’t realize that SS501 was still in the function room. Alida and I were smart(actually more like I’m the smart one), we waited for all the stupid crazy fangirls to evacuate the function room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, the function room was empty. There were only us and SS501. Soon, SS501 started walking out. Alida, suddenly plucked tremendous courage and ran towards Hyun Joong(leader) and hugged him. I was freaking shocked. Damn stunned. I was jealous. I wanted to hug Young Saeng oppa too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ran towards Young Saeng oppa. I couldn’t hug him straight because he was tying his shoelaces. What rotten luck. BUT! THEN.. SUDDENLY! HE STOOD UP, AND HUGGED ME! He hugged me not once, but twice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time he hugged me, he even carried me! I shouted for Alida but she didn’t hear me. Therefore, she didn’t see that Young Saeng oppa carrying me. After having so much fun in Young Saeng oppa’s arms, we parted ways and I finally caught up with Alida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t the end! Young Saeng oppa came out of nowhere and asked for my number! Unfortunately, I didn’t have a phone): Young Saeng oppa then told Alida to remember his phone number and instructed me to contact him. After which, he walked back towards his SS501 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we got so excited, and wanted to call Young Saeng oppa straight away. We dialed the number in a public phone, and…. ALIDA JUST HAD TO FORGET THE LAST DIGIT OF HIS NUMBER! I was so pissed at her that I wanted to kick her to Africa. What a waste. But at least, Young Saeng oppa hugged me, TWICE! ^^&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/460357577</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/460357577</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2010 13:26:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>MINHO'S HAND SHAKE</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Kylie, Alida and I failed at sending SHINee off to Korea, so we decided to visit KL. Once we reached KL, we went to a stall full of sweets and cookies and sat down on the table of the shop. We laughed and joked like no one’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, SHINee appeared. I was so excited. “ Annyong Haseyeo!” I shouted at them. Taemin was the first one to turn and greet us. Next was Minho. Minho was wearing the same shirt that he was wearing when he first came to Singapore. He looked really awesome though he was dressed really simple. I really love his hair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minho was all smiles. He approached us and held out his hand to me. We shook hands. I could feel the strong grip of his. It was so manly, that I could even dive into his arms. Slowly, Alida and Kylie greeted Onew. No one bothered about Taemin, Key and Jong Hyun. I could see Taemin feeling rather down. But I didn’t bother to cheer him up because I was too busy shaking Minho’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing I know, I was sitting in a room filled with people. Minho and Jia Hao were sitting behind me. They were bickering that they are taller than the other. But they are of the same height! BOTH VERY TALL! I was just laughing at them the whole time. A tall person calling another tall person short. How absurd! HAHAHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, SHINee was so tired that they went into my brother’s room and slept. However, I wanted to take pictures with Minho. I really wanted to. I slowly opened the bedroom door. From where I was standing, I could see Minho almost falling asleep. He looked really handsome. I was totally mesmerized. I love Minho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called for Minho to come out for a bit. He wasn’t too pleased at first, but slowly he went out of the room, trying not to wake the others up. After which we started taking pictures. When he stood beside me he was so tall! I had to stand on a stool to take a picture with him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome. The picture taken will forever be in my heart! HAHAHHA!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/368688033</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/368688033</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2010 20:34:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>MIN HO AND ONEW</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Eight years old Zahin was sitting on my shoulders as he wasn’t able to see Onew. Onew was sitting rather far away from us. He was alone, and I swear his freaking pimple was so freaking visible, even from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahin was Onew’s fan boy. He kept shouting ‘I LOVE YOU’ to Onew but sadly, Onew didn’t notice. Zahin decided to stop shouting to Onew. Suddenly, Onew shouted, ‘I LOVE YOU TOO ZAHIN!’. Zahin was so excited and satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed him back on the floor and we walked into a store. Without thinking, I went straight to the counter and guess who I saw? CHOI MIN HO! He was the cashier there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was wearing the air steward shirt that he wore during the filming of Dream Team, in the aeroplane, going to Vancouver. He looked so charming, his hair was awesome, and he is so tall! He greeted me as he saw me, this time, he communicated in Korean. Surprisingly, I could understand what he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when he greeted me, he didn’t dare to have an eye contact with me. But his smile killed me! Plus his flawless skin! He was wrapping a box of sushi for me. As he wrapped, he said “Dou, bogo bali okay” meaning, you have to eat fast okay. He also told me to eat well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was so caring. It was like he was my husband! I really liked the way he wrapped the sushi box. I could feel his love in everything he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIN HO OPPA! SARANGHAEYO!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/360686141</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/360686141</guid><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2010 11:43:28 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SHINee</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I entered the lift with Taemin. The lift was so small that it could only fit the two of us. We were talking non-stop and laughing like idiots. He was really like a younger brother to me. Once we got out of the lift, the lift next to ours also opened. Out came Onew and Minho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked straight into my grandmother’s house in Bedok, which is now demolished. Minho sat on the chair while I was sitting 2 feet away from him, on the floor. He was wearing that big sports jacket. His hair was as sexy as ever. His smile was enough to kill me. He was just so cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We starting talking and drank tea together. We talked and talked and talked and talked and we spoke in English. While we were happily talking, Taemin and Onew were using the laptop while Key was in the kitchen wearing an apron. Suddenly Onew and Taemin called of Minho and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onew asked Minho, “You can understand her?” and Minho replied with a very Singaporean singlish accent, “ Yah lah, can lah. You cannot?”. It really cracked me up! Onew was speaking in a very perfect English tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were then so bored that we decided to go to 7-11. In there, Minho and I saw an otter in a cage we stared at it and laughed hysterically. I wasn’t sure myself what was so funny about it. But seeing Minho laugh, truly made my day or rather, night.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/344265200</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/344265200</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2010 20:52:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>LEE JOON, MIR, JONG HUN</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was in a function room, filled with endless rows of humans queuing. There were so many people queuing that it looked like a human labyrinth. I was dumbfounded. I did not know what to do or where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, Lee Joon came out of nowhere. He was wearing his Christmas special stage performance attire with his sexy head band and he truly look good in it. He stretched out his hand gentlemanly. I blushed. I took his hand and we squeezed each other’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel the warmth and the sweat from our hands. He held my hand for a long time and I felt really safe and assured. We started walking, with our hands still glued, into the human labyrinth. Since it was narrow, he walked in front of me and his back kept on facing me. He knew that his back was facing me so he turned his head around occasionally and smiled. He was just so sweet. Through the labyrinth he held my hand and led the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the other end of the maze, he held both my hands and winked at me. Next thing I knew, he was gone. Swiftly, Mir appeared. He too wanted to lead me and show me that he could be as cool as Joon. But of course he wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He held my hand but kept on letting go once in a while. I felt a million and trillion times safer when Joon was holding my hand. Seeing my scared expression, Mir left me alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was alone, again, in the function room. Unknowingly, standing in front of me was Jong Hun in tuxedo with lights shining on him. He looked dashing. There was a microphone on his hand. I smiled widely at him. He complimented my smile. I was not flattered by his compliment as I told him that I am sure he said that to other girls too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He denied. He started singing a song as reached for my hand. I told him, “If you meant what you said, prove it to me”. He then held my hand tightly and led me in the labyrinth as he sang. My heart fell for his voice and his eyes. I felt way secure when I was with him than with Mir. But in my heart I still wanted it to be Joon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can never forget the feeling of holding Joon’s hand. It was incredible, totally unforgettable!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/333668681</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/333668681</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2010 13:57:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>2AM, JIN WOON</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was walking towards Sky High and i just had the urge to look back.The moment I turned, I saw Jo Kwon. I was damn bloody surprised. I thought it was impossible that it was really him. Why on earth would he be on Sky High? So, I told myself that it was just someone who looked like Jo Kwon. Besides, there were no fanatic wild fans crowding around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But then, since I was a fangirl myself, I couldn’t resist but just stare at him. Suddenly, behind him, Jin Woon appeared followed by the other members of 2AM. I was freaking speechless. Only then, I believed that he was Jo Kwon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;After staring at Jin Woon, Ga In appeared out of nowhere. Next thing I knew, Brown Eyed Girls were also there. It was truly a sight. There were floating balloons all over and I felt like time stopped for me. It was like I was the centre of attention, like I was the only one there staring at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, the school bell rang, and I had to assemble. I sat down with Zhi Jun at the carpark, also known as our assembly ground, and was telling her who I met earlier on. The moment my story ended, I realized that the 2AM and Brown Eyed Girls were sitting exactly opposite of us. And what’s best was that I could see Jin Woon so clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At the corner was Jo Kwon and Ga In and Narsha. Jo Kwon seemed to not able to make a decision between the two pretty girls. He was, I must say, flirting. Tsk, Dirty Eyed Jo Kwon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I continued staring at Jin Woon. He was laughing sincerely. As he laughed, his eyes were smiling. When he laughed, his hair, though really ugly like the one in Magnae Rebellion, moved and jumped on his head. He was really sexy and cheerful. I couldn’t stop staring at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It was the best day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/332240539</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/332240539</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:33:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>CHOI JONG HUN OPPA</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Someone was ringing the bell outside my house. I was too lazy to open the door, so my dad opened it. I took very little interest to see who it was. I just ignored and continued doing my work. Suddenly, I just felt like turning. I was extremely shocked to see FT. Island going up my stairs, my home’s stairs! I waved frantically but I was too late. Only Seung Hyun saw me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began going crazy. I was running all over my house perimeter. I was jumping like an idiot and smiling like a pervert! I couldn’t stop myself from behaving like that. I was just so excited. Then, Hong Ki came down and talked to my dad. I wasn’t really interested in him, so I just as watched him talk to my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was waiting anxiously for my Jong Hun oppa to come down, but he didn’t. I went up to Hong Ki and pleaded him to persuade Jong Hun oppa to come down. But all Hong Ki did was smile at me with those Dracula-ish teeth of his. I was upset so I went to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, Jong Hun oppa was there, at the sink! I was damn excited but I didn’t show it. I observed him from far. He was trying to take out this very big ring on his finger. Yes, the ring was stuck. He used so much soap; still, the ring was stubborn and refuses to slide out from his finger. I giggled to myself and approached him, fast. As I came nearer I panicked. I was afraid that the ring would be stuck forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oppa! STOP!” I shouted. Then, I told him I’d help him. I held his smooth soft fair hand and gently pulled out the ring. The ring was no longer stuck! He smiled sweetly at me. My heart melted! And when I touched his hands I could really feel the softness of his hands. That hand that played the wonderful guitar. WOW. I LOVE CHOI JONG HUN OPPA!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/297933151</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/297933151</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2009 12:53:11 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>YOUNG SAENG OPPA</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was with Xiao Xuan, in NP’s shuttle bus to school. We were talking and joking like we used to. Suddenly, we looked behind us, and we saw HEO YOUNG SAENG AND KYU JONG! We were damn excited. We wished Qiu Mei was there, unfortunately, she wasn’t. When I saw Young Saeng, I realized that he used hair extension. So I just called out to him, “ Young Saeng ahhhh~”. But after I called out his name, the rest of SS501 members were laughing at me because I treated Young Saeng as though he was my best friend(I should call him Young Saeng sshi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I asked Young Saeng the obvious. I asked if he was using hair extension, and Kyu Jong turned around, putting Young Saeng’s hair extension on his hair. Their actions made Xiao Xuan and I crack up like shit! Hahaha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, all the people in the bus alighted. And we all sat around a basket ball court, talking to SS501. We played, talked, joked, smiled and blushed. Suddenly, Young Saeng heard a noise and felt a tremble. He told all of us that there’s going to be a volcano eruption. Upon hearing that, we all ran like crazy bitches trying to save our own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was running, I looked back to get a final glimpse of Young Saeng. But then, I saw him faliing down to the ground laughing and winking to his fellow SS501 members. From that wink I realized that it was all meant to be a joke. They wanted to get away from the crazy fans. Well, they actually succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it was time for them to head for their concert. And I was damn damn damn lucky. Because, SS501 invited me to their concert and offered me a ride with them! What else, I followed! I was really damn excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we got on the bus and I was the last one to aboard the bus. Young Saeng was the first one to enter. So he sat down first. Hyun Joong wanted to sit with Young Saeng but Young Saeng  was saving that seat for me. So all of the members walked past Young Saeng . As soon as I stepped into the bus, Young Saeng called me to sit beside him. I was damn happy! My heart could explode any minute! And the other members were laughing at us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course I sat right beside him! The moment I sat down, I laid on Young Saeng’s shoulders.After doing so, I was damn shy of my actions, so I looked at him and asked permission to put my head on his sexy shoulders. And he allowed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Young Saeng a Styrofoam tile and he kept it save in a file as he said it was precious to him since it was a gift from me! And then,  I was extremely happy that I touched his chest!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/267620954</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/267620954</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2009 20:26:48 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>FIGHT FOR LOVE</title><description>&lt;p&gt;i was standing on one of the many tables found at the roadside. many people were occupying the seats. they were all waiting for their lunch. at the same time, i was obliged to get support from everyone, for i had to fight the demon and save the world. initially i tried to rally the support of the people single handedly, but, i sucked. no one wanted to listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suddenly, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; appeared and helped me to convince people to believe me and support me. i was really touched. when everyone agreed to support me, i went on for my fight. so i crossed the bridge. before i walk right straight into the forest, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; stopped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“is there anything else that i can do for you?” &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, i replied,”wait for me here, as i want to be with you.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/254324337</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/254324337</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2009 21:27:49 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>HELD CAPTIVE, TWICE</title><description>&lt;p&gt;there i was at the beach, with fiany and the others, who are unfamiliar to me. we were playing with sand peacefully when suddenly the destructive waves were crashing harshly against the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thinking that it was fun, fiany and i went nearer to the shore, and into the deadly waves. when we got in, we were pushed backwards by the strong waves. thus, landing flat on the wet sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suddenly while we were having fun fighting the waves, a humongous wave was streaming in. fiany started shouting tsunami, and in my heart i was chanting prayers, since i was freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out of nowhere, a tall rock appeared. fiany and i held tight onto the rock as the rock continued protruding towards the sky. i thought i was safe, but i thought wrong. the rock started shrinking as the tsunami waves drew nearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next thing i knew, i was locked up in a cell with my ‘mother’, and my other young three siblings. when we asked why we’re being held captive, the guards said we set a false alarm regarding tsunami. BULLSHIT, i thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we were all in the cell trying to figure out how on earth we are going to escape. there and then, i had a brilliant plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don’t know how i did it, but soon i was outside the cell and had the key to all cells. i freed my family members as well as an old stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this old stranger wasn’t any old stranger. he brought us to his home and punished us, for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we were in his big two storey high house, he forced us all to be his maid, even my younger brother, who was only 1 year old! i couldn’t do anything, but agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;soon after, the old man took a nap. that was when we decided to escape. we tip toed towards the door, unfortunately, we were caught by the maid in the house. i begged her to let us go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;surprisingly, she did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, my family and i ran fast to the direction of the lift. my siblings and i were fast enough and we got into the lift. however, my mother was caught by the old man, who was awaken by the running foot steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then on, we didn’t what to do. so we just went down and walked home. shockingly, we heard our mother’s voice calling out for us. our mother was freed! i don’t know how she did it, but she was freed! and that matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally we were all free. i looked my younger brother, a year old, and his eyes reflected strong hope which lifted up my spirits. i cuddled him and gave a peck on the chubby cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/213370950</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/213370950</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2009 10:10:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>FOUR STRANGERS</title><description>&lt;p&gt;there i was, sitting on the chair with no one other than myself. i was in a huge room, with 4 very tall beige walls. there was only one big office like table right in the middle of the room. the table occupied the empty spaces, taking up a large area in the room. there were chairs tucked into the table, except one, the chair i am in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was using my laptop happily, when suddenly, another three strangers came in, two of which were guys and the other was a girl. the two guys sat beside me, making me the middle person. while the girl, sat in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we talked like we knew each other so well. one of the guys was advising me on school. i could fall asleep that instant! the other guy was rather quiet, i liked it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suddenly, the girl in front of me, stood up. she was wearing an extremely tight yellow mini, mini skirt. the moment she stood up, she had to pull down her skirt with a lot of force. i could only afford to giggle to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after which the four of us went out together. we travelled by van. when we halted, we reached a place from a scene in Lady Castle and we just commented on our preferred couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was a volunteer for a certain orphanage. i had to help prepare food and set the table for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suddenly there were so many cockroaches! obviously, we all freaked out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/186666331</link><guid>http://dreammares.tumblr.com/post/186666331</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2009 12:59:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title>PILOT</title><description>&lt;p&gt;FIRST POST!&lt;/p&gt;
