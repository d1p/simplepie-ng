<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a great time presenting my talk at the <a href="http://playjurisms.wordpress.com/">Play-jurisms conference</a> this last Saturday.  I stayed up late until 3:30 am to finish the slides for the talk.&#0160; Considering that I was typing away in bed while my wife slept, she was very understanding.&#0160; The talk didn&#39;t suffer for the fact I was up so late writing it, but no doubt I can improve it.&#0160; I did end up changing the title from what I had originally envisioned, but  I felt the new title better matched the spirit of the conference.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.masspirates.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PlayJurismsTalk.pdf">view the slides as a pdf</a> if you want.&#0160; Comments are most welcome.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EverythingsJok/~4/VXnzDdDmDA8" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Reposting an article I put up at the <a href="http://www.masspirates.org/blog/2011/05/12/coica-is-dead-protect-ip-act-rises-in-its-place/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Pirate Party blog</a>.&#0160; I did change the title though.</em></p>
<p>The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) bill  is dead it seems.  However, the entertainment industry and their <span style="color: #111111;"><del>lackeys</del></span> supporters in Congress have introduced the Preventing Real Online  Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of  2011 or PROTECT IP Act for short.  It isn’t out on <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/">Thomas</a> yet so we do not know who is  sponsoring it, but <a href="http://www.dontcensorthenet.com/">Don’t  Censor the Net</a> obtained and <a href="http://www.dontcensorthenet.com/full-text-of-the-protect-ip-act-of-2011">released  a copy</a> of it for everyone to read in all its pro-censorship glory.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110511/00115314234/full-text-protect-ip-act-released-good-bad-horribly-ugly.shtml" target="_blank">Techdirt</a> and <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-to-introduce-draconian-anti-piracy-censorship-bill-110511/" target="_blank">Torrentfreak</a> have good write ups on what we know  about it, but here is a summary of the odiousness of this bill:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Attorney General of the US can obtain a court order to censor an  infringing website without due process.&#0160; It can then serve  the court  order on specified U.S. based third-parties to censor the website or  stop doing business with the website.&#0160; Third-parties include search  engines, payment processors, online advertising network providers, and  internet service  providers.&#0160; Third-parties would now be held liable if  they do not censor the specified website.&#0160; Websites could be held liable  for simply linking to an infringing website;</li>
<li>additionally, the act would extend most of the tools the Attorney  General has to&#0160; private copyright holders. They could obtain a court  order against a website without due process.&#0160; The copyright holders  could then  serve  the court order on specified U.S. payment processors  and online advertising network  providers to force them to stop doing  business with the website;</li>
<li>court orders would not be limited to the specified domain, but would  include all domains linked to the website that were created after the  court order was issued;</li>
<li>service providers which voluntary censor websites that they deem to  be  infringing would be protected from liability.&#0160; Should a service  provider choose to censor a website, there appears to be no recourse for  the owner of the censored website;</li>
<li>the bill is directed at “Internet site dedicated to  infringing  activities”, a definition which is rather loose and very much in the eye  of the beholder.<em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the seeming pluses of the PROTECT IP Act when compared to  COICA is that it does not appear to directly target domains.&#0160; However,  domain registrars would be encouraged to take down infringing domain  names voluntarily.&#0160; We hope that ICE’s attempts to seize domains via  Operation In Our Sites does not hold up in court.</p>
<p><strong>We need your help!</strong></p>
<p>The PROTECT IP Act is an enormous leap towards censoring the  internet, and we need your help in fighting it.&#0160; Please join us on  Sunday, May 29th, for our monthly meeting / social.&#0160;  The meeting starts  at 2pm.&#0160; We will start the grill around 4pm and go  until 6pm.&#0160; It will  be at 25 Moore St., Somerville, MA.&#0160; Please tell us whether you will  attend by signing up at our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=102255399862111" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> or via <a href="http://tweetvite.com/event/MPMay11Soc" target="_blank">Tweetvite</a>.&#0160;  Thanks!</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EverythingsJok/~4/xKxxsts2iO0" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a long-time Palm user (though not for over a year - anyone want a used Verizon Treo 600?), I am happy that HP will be releasing a new webOS tablet computer, the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/pads/touchpad/index.html" target="_self">TouchPad</a>, and <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/index.html" target="_self">two new phones</a>.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/09/the-hp-touchpad/" target="_self">articles</a> <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/02/09/hp-announces-the-palm-touchpad/" target="_self">on it</a> look positive, though none of them mention the devices&#39; battery life.&#0160;</p>
<p>With any luck the TouchPad is faster than the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which was increadibly slow when I tried it at Bust Buy.&#0160; However, the phones are not out until the Spring and the TouchPad won&#39;t be out until the Summer, so my guess is that HP&#39;s plans to be the next Apple will get dashed when Apple releases the iPad2 in the next few months.</p>

Strassler</a>, it is a welcome summary of the war.&#0160; Not as complete as <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Peter_Green_%28historian%29" target="_self">Peter Green</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520083493" target="_self">Alexander to Actium</a>, though, but then that book is a tome.</p>
<p>After that it is on to the other book I got for the holidays: <a href="http://www.iain-banks.net/us/surface-detail/" target="_self">Surface Detail</a> by <a href="http://www.iain-banks.net/" target="_self">Iain M. Banks</a>.&#0160; Another Culture novel.&#0160; I almost cannot wait.</p>

<p>Eventually, I will finish <em>The Landmark Thucydides</em>, if only to say I did.&#0160; However, after reading Hanson&#39;s rant, some Marx might be a welcome change, either Karl or Groucho<em>.<br /></em></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EverythingsJok/~4/8xA68D8djic" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris Hedges over at <a href="http://www.truthdig.com" target="_blank">TruthDig</a> has a well thought out <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/2011_a_brave_new_dystopia_20101227/" target="_blank">article</a> on our transition from Huxley's Brave New World to Orwell's 1984.&nbsp; Corporate/Governmental domination R Us.&nbsp; A few exerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The façade is crumbling. And as more and more people realize that they  have been used and robbed, we will move swiftly from Huxley’s “Brave New  World” to Orwell’s “1984.” The public, at some point, will have to face  some very unpleasant truths. The good-paying jobs are not coming back.  The largest deficits in human history mean that we are trapped in a debt  peonage system that will be used by the corporate state to eradicate  the last vestiges of social protection for citizens, including Social  Security. The state has devolved from a capitalist democracy to  neo-feudalism. And when these truths become apparent, anger will replace  the corporate-imposed cheerful conformity. The bleakness of our  post-industrial pockets, where some 40 million Americans live in a state  of poverty and tens of millions in a category called “near poverty,”  coupled with the lack of credit to save families from foreclosures, bank  repossessions and bankruptcy from medical bills, means that inverted  totalitarianism will no longer work.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Those who do not comply with the dictates of the war on terror, a war  which, as Orwell noted, is endless, are brutally silenced. The draconian  security measures used to cripple protests at the G-20 gatherings in  Pittsburgh and Toronto were wildly disproportionate for the level of  street activity. But they sent a clear message—DO NOT TRY THIS. The  FBI’s targeting of antiwar and Palestinian activists, which in late  September saw agents raid homes in Minneapolis and Chicago, is a  harbinger of what is to come for all who dare defy the state’s official  Newspeak. The agents—our Thought Police—seized phones, computers,  documents and other personal belongings. Subpoenas to appear before a  grand jury have since been served on 26 people. The subpoenas cite  federal law prohibiting “providing material support or resources to  designated foreign terrorist organizations.” Terror, even for those who  have nothing to do with terror, becomes the blunt instrument used by Big  Brother to protect us from ourselves."</p>

<p>On the face of it I don't buy that high government deficits mean that the US government will be crippled.&nbsp; The Fed can easily print money to pay those deficits and we could inflate our way out of our debts albeit slowly and reasonably.&nbsp; A bit of inflation tends to improve the situation better than the deflation we are approaching.</p>
<p>That all said, the one and half parties of the wealthy will attempt to convince us otherwise, cut the deficit by imposing austerity on the poor and middle class, not the wealthy or the military.&nbsp; They never willingly impose austerity on the wealthy or the military.&nbsp; Chris' suggestions of our path looks true to me.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A friend suggested that Chris Hedges' article reminded her of this Barbara Ehrenreich talk, put to cartoons - Smile or Die!</p>

<p>With the iPad 2, palmPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Blackberry PlayBook, and any number of other tablet computers to be unveiled next year, 2011 looks like it will be the year for the tablet computer.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EverythingsJok/~4/jCm3EVrtwsE" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>
