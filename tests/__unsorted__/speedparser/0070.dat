<p>sometimes i am wondering if the moving process lately has changed my perspective on things. the things in the house are not all mine, like the washing machine, the fridge and the sofa, the nice lamp lighting the table where i&#8217;m typing now. these things i&#8217;ll have to give up once i move again. other things i can see that i probably should get rid of, not being the nicest and having way too many of them (dining chairs, this means you). why do i necessarily want to keep everything forever? in a really bad example, if i had to keep ikea furniture forever i think i would scream.</p>
<p>and yet also why would i want to keep the &#8220;744 artists, 30 days, 75.01 GB&#8221; of songs in itunes until my hard drive died? blah. maybe the absolute out of print, can&#8217;t find a download anywhere kind i would backup somewhere like that <a href="http://apcmag.com/the-icloud-faq-top-five-qas-to-clear-the-air.htm">icloud</a> concept, apart from the spare hard drive.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve been trying on <a href="https://booki.sh/">booki.sh</a> as an online e-book reader, since i don&#8217;t have an actual e-reader or an ipad. the interface looks cute enough and the fonts and spacing are just as adjustable as an e-reader, and i can read books bought from <a href="http://ebooks.readings.com.au/">readings</a> straight away, or upload ones i bought (but broke the drm, shhhh). because i can&#8217;t stand clunky adobe digital editions&#8230;</p>
<p>online music has got me hooked too. copyright notwithstanding, i am currently indebted to <a href="http://www.patestapes.com/">pates tapes</a>. right now i&#8217;m listening to the &#8220;cafe: music to dine talk and read to&#8221; tape (click the ye olde analog tapes on the menu) and have a series of js bach concertos harpsichording away. besides being effective to write a blog entry, to, it made me get up and finally do the dishes too. a lot of the stuff he has uploaded there i would never download to listen to separately in a hundred years, but that&#8217;s where mix tapes win, right?</p>

- toy piano looped and reversed through a loop pedal looks like the way to go for next saturday&#8230;<br />
- these <a href="http://www.ecco.com/au/en/collection/women/casual/220523/01001/detail.do">ecco boots</a> i bought are well worth the money, a few weeks on. comfortable as anything and warm, hooray! i&#8217;ve been wearing them everywhere and feel about an inch taller, haha.<br />
- time to move some pictures around the house again.<br />
- see told you i&#8217;d been playing around with instagram. on some things it works, on others it just makes it look hackneyed and lazy. in two minds about it, although i don&#8217;t have an iphone anyway.</p>

<p>next saturday aka june 25th i&#8217;m playing solo at <a href="http://www.scitech.org.au/featured/analogue-to-digital-25-june.html">analogue to digital</a>, an event curated by claire pannell and held at scitech. besides listening to experimental music acts in the theatre you can also play with the exhibits at night, no kids allowed! also i am looking forward to checking out the awesome sounding (literally) <a href="http://soundchamber.abc.net.au/">sound chamber</a>. as per usual i leave preparation for these kinds of things to the last minute, and basically it will be me making as much noise as possible and hoping it will annoy the less hardcore kind of people. that is the usual theory i stick to anyway. </p>

<p>not much to report other than i am sick of the computer, and want to read some more. i need a media purge! having said that i have been staring at a screen for a couple of hours. the cinema that is. dragged boyfriend to see bridesmaids, but under my influence of watching saturday night live, that was easy. kristen wiig is much less of an overactor in this film than on snl, that when it came time to do the over the top ripping the engagement party to shreds, i fully enjoyed that moment. it is exactly what i want to do when i&#8217;m faced with such a situation. oh sorry, spoiler alert. i just realised i&#8217;ve watched too many judd apatow movies, and this one i could recommend without cringing. so please let kristen wiig write some more films. </p>

Also to relax and celebrate getting a smiley face note from the real estate agent after the rent inspection yesterday. Also my first day back at work after two weeks holiday. So relaxed&#8230; and tired&#8230; </p>

<p>around the streets, spotted (and scared) this poor cat:</p>

<p>it was a bit frozen with fear, sniffing my hand but not letting me pat it but yet not quite bolting away&#8230;</p>
<p>there&#8217;s a house on the corner with lemon trees out the front loaded with fruit. i really wanted some for cakes or something like hollandaise sauce, so picked a few off the tree. behind us was the guy walking his two nice siberian husky and shiba inu dogs (first person i&#8217;ve seen who actually owns a shiba). he said to me, &#8216;you can get a bag or box and take as many as you like!&#8217; and turned the corner into the front door&#8230; hahaha. glad he approves.</p>

<p>a haw haw haw, glorious historical cultural practice carried through thousands of years, going in the bin after your meal.</p>
<p>last night was up until 2am after playing a launch gig at the bakery. that venue often has support acts a mile long, so we found ourselves playing after the headliners, about a quarter to one. eep. was worried that most people would shuffle out quickly and leave after that, but there was still a decent crowd about. highlights included being blasted out of oblivion by matt&#8217;s new fuzz pedal, and chris pinching the &#8220;ghost&#8221; sheet from the stage and draping it over his own head whilst drumming. i love my band.</p>
