			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, I need to update my main blog more often to make the most of the money I used for its domain name. Well, technically, my mom paid for it. I used her credit card and promised her I&#8217;d pay her but I still haven&#8217;t. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11a.png' alt='=)' class='wp-smiley' />  This blog is also in dire need of redesigning.</p>
<p>Okay. Moving on, <a href="http://rainbowscraps.net">Tin</a> joined the 2NE1 MYX Promo. She asked me to watch MYX and look out for the keyword. I almost forgot to watch it if she hadn&#8217;t mentioned me on Twitter. The winners of the contest will get 2 tickets to The Party: 2NE1 Live in Manila along with two albums of 2NE1. She promised to give the albums to me if she wins. I wasn&#8217;t actually expecting that she&#8217;d win because I was thinking that a lot of kpop fans would join the contest too. The next day, she told me that she WON! I was like &#8220;OMG! Take pictures of 2NE1 for me!&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t watch the concert because I don&#8217;t live in Manila. It sucks having to live in the province. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11p.png' alt='&gt;_&lt;' class='wp-smiley' />  She got to see 2NE1 and I'm happy for her! She sent the albums to me as promised and they just arrived yesterday. I was in the bathroom when my mom told me the package was already here. Due to my excitement, I went out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel and covered with soap bubbles. LOL.</p>
<p>Here are some of the pictures I took of the album. I still haven't taken photos of the pictures in the photobook. I'm gonna send the pictures to Tin as soon as possible.</p>
<p><img src="http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8466/editimg0880.jpg" alt="" width="520" /><br />
2NE1&#8242;s &#8220;To Anyone&#8221; album. I love all the songs in this album and what I like about this album is the lyrics were written in 2NE1&#8242;s handwriting. (LOL, I don&#8217;t know if you understood what I said.)</p>
<p><img src="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/9310/editimg0830.jpg" alt="" width="520" /><br />
2NE1&#8242;s First Mini Album (Repackaged Version)</p>
<p><img src="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/3219/editimg0832.jpg" alt="" width="520" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy! I was actually planning to buy 2NE1&#8242;s albums before Tin tweeted me. I just saved myself a few bucks. Fangirling is such an expensive hobby! <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11q.png' alt='XD' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I no longer have to wake up early just to get to school, I&#8217;ve been spending late nights watching some Korean series. I finished watching Baker King and Secret Garden. Both are really good, but I love Baker King more simply because its plot was consistent from start to finish and it was not as predictable as any other soap operas. It was one of the most entertaining Korean series I have watched so far. Hats off to all the people who behind this series and the actors who played the roles. They really deserved the 50+% rating. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Secret Garden was not as remarkable as Baker King. But it was&#8230;amusing. I admit, the only reason why I watched and loved the series is because Hyun Bin was in it. If not, I wouldn&#8217;t even bother watching it. The story was too dragging I almost decided to just drop it if it weren&#8217;t for my beloved husband (a girl can dream) playing the lead role. Some may disagree with me but that&#8217;s just me, I prefer movies or dramas with mind-boggling conflicts, consistent plot and action.  </p>
<p>Recently, I started watching My Princess out of curiousity and because Kim Tae Hee was playing the lead female role. I used to hate her so much in Stairway to Heaven because her role was the evil stepsister and she did a great job portraying the role that I was convinced that she was really evil in real life. LOL. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/3424/95870182.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/158/83042917.jpg" alt="" /></center><br />
In My Princess, Kim Tae Hee plays the role of Lee Seol, an ordinary student who found out that her late biological father was actually the last emperor and she was the long lost royal princess. Okay, the plot is a little shallow and predictable but it feels refreshing to watch a feel-good series from time to time.  </p>
<p><center><img src="http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/849/82479901.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/7342/82089625.jpg" alt="" /></center><br />
Song Seung Hun as Park Hae Young, the heir to a large conglomerate company, finds himself in trouble when he learns that his grandfather had plans of giving away all of his inheritance so Lee Seol can live as a princess.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img src="http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/4752/99553399.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/6926/37021722.jpg" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only watch a few episodes, so far I have no negative comments about it&#8230;yet. All I can say right now is the plot is fairly predictable. I&#8217;ll let you all know when it gets to draggy or too cheesy. </p>

Oh yeah~ After all those sleepless nights, the excruciating hell week and the dreadful oral defense, I&#8217;m now done with college. Well, I still have to wait til after the graduation before I can finally say &#8216;I&#8217;m no longer a student, I&#8217;m now a bum.&#8217; LOL After the oral defense, three of my classmates and I decided to have a sleepover at my house to celebrate for a job well done on our project! We spent the night with a movie marathon and a karaoke session. Oh, and BTW, I got a hair cut, in case you didn&#8217;t notice in the picture above. I decided to cut my hair short because I tend to sweat a lot during the summer and I&#8217;ve always had the same long hairstyle for 9 years already, I just thought it&#8217;s about time I change my hairstyle. I love change. </p>

This picture is taken a week ago and I decided to share it with you all, even though I feel slightly embarassed about it. It&#8217;s fun to do something spontaneous sometimes. I was hanging out at someone&#8217;s photo studio and saw the blonde wig tucked under a table. I put it on just for fun and took a bunch of pictures with it on. I was having so much fun that I almost didn&#8217;t want to take it off. Some of my friends were a bit surprised when I uploaded the pics on my Facebook account. They all know I&#8217;m a very uptight person and goofing around is not my specialty or at least not something I normally do. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna try to revive this blog by posting some photos from a couple of months ago. I just renewed my domain on March 4 and I feel like I&#8217;m wasting my money I spent on the domain if I don&#8217;t update often. Planning to move to a new host and redesigning my blog soon.</p>

This is the mug I bought as a gift for a dearest friend of mine, Nica. I also have one but in pink and instead of cat, mine was a rabbit mug. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11q.png' alt='XD' class='wp-smiley' />  BTW, thanks to <a href="http://rainbowscraps.net">Tin</a> for helping me get the mugs. Thanks Tin~!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so desperate to bring this blog back to life. </p>
<p>Random Thought of the Day:<br />
Yes, I am uptight and I know I need to loosen up a bit. I&#8217;m aware of that so no need to remind me. I&#8217;m working on it.</p>
<p>Shameless Plug of the Day:<br />
Say hello to my brand new <a href="http://blog.daum.net/angelimarie/">photoblog</a>. I&#8217;ll be posting random pics, videos (music videos, etc) and I&#8217;ll try to update it as often as possible.</p>

It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s nothing to blog about coz my life is terribly boring at the moment. Hopefully, I will be able to update more often this summer. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><a href="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_07791.jpg" rel="lightbox[768]"><img src="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_07791.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0779" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-778" /></a></center></p>
<p>I finally got my copy of 3rd Wave Music&#8217;s &#8220;I Will Be There&#8221; album. I ordered from their site some time in November. I was already starting to panic because it&#8217;s been more than two weeks and it still haven&#8217;t reached my home. They&#8217;re currently having a Christmas sale. I got my copy for only $12 plus it&#8217;s free shipping. Yay~! I used my mom&#8217;s credit card and I still have to pay her. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11q.png' alt='XD' class='wp-smiley' />  I must say, it really is an awesome album, totally worth every single penny and the mini-poster is so cute. My favorite songs from this album are Everything to Me (coz Vanness is in it and I&#8217;m a big fan of his, kidding aside, it&#8217;s a really great song), Awesome God and I Will Be There (the song which was dedicated for the kids in Africa).</p>
<p>Those who bought a copy are eligible to win some amazing handpicked prizes from Vanness Wu, Choi Siwon and Brian Joo. Well, I&#8217;m not looking forward to winning because the chances are really slim. But I&#8217;m really glad that I was able to help with their cause. You see, all financial gains will be donated to a charitable institution to help African students. </p>
<p>If you want to order a copy or get to know more about 3rd Wave Music, visit <a href="http://3rdwavemusic.org">http://3rdwavemusic.org</a> or visit their Facebook fan page: <a href="http://facebook.com/3rdWaveMusic">http://facebook.com/3rdWaveMusic</a> where you can preview the songs from the album.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_07901.jpg" rel="lightbox[768]"><img src="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_07901.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0790" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-779" /></a></center></p>
<p><center><a href="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Untitled-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[768]"><img src="http://cameraderie.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" title="Untitled-1" width="449" height="63" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m really glad to be a volunteer for 3rd Wave Music!</center></p>
<p>Ok, now that I have 3rd Wave&#8217;s album, next thing I want to buy is Jaeson Ma&#8217;s Glory album and a DVD copy of 1040 Movie.<br />

<p>I just want to add these two videos in this post. The first one is the official music video for Jaeson Ma&#8217;s single &#8220;Glory&#8221; and the second one is a video made by my friend, Danelle (a big shout out to you, dear). It&#8217;s a video of Vanness&#8217; personal testimony of his faith. Vanness saw this video and even posted it on his blog. Go Danes~! </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end this super random post now. God bless you all!</p>

<p>Surprise! Surprise! I&#8217;m back. I would like to say sorry to my future self for not updating this blog. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11q.png' alt='XD' class='wp-smiley' />  Well, I got too obsessed with watching animes. I&#8217;m currently watching Prince of Tennis and K-On! I was also gone for almost 2 weeks. I went to Manila to visit my brother and sister. The trip was long and tiring. We traveled by land for 18 hours. T____T I missed 2 weeks worth of lessons but what the heck, I had a great time in Manila. I came back it was already the last week of our 1st semester. Teehee. But I managed to ace a very long quiz and I got exempted for the finals exam for that subject. And I worked on a project in just one night. Anyway, here are some pics which I took on our trip to the Manila Ocean Park. I kinda edited it a bit (I just made the background darker) because if I didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll see my reflection and that&#8217;s not pleasing to the eyes. <img src='http://cameraderie.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/smilieset11q.png' alt='XD' class='wp-smiley' />  Enjoy.</p>

I assume that most of you have seen the Disney movie âMulanâ at least once in your life. As for me, Iâve seen it for at least 20 times, Iâm not sure because I already lost count. This is one of my favorite Disney movies because I can relate to Mulan in some ways. If youâve seen it, youâd know of the scene where Mulan decided to take her fatherâs place in the army, stole her fatherâs armor, cut her hair short and made herself look like a man. This is my favorite scene in the movie and I also like the score used in that scene. A few days ago, Iâve watched the movie again, and I saw these two videos on Youtube.</p>
<p><center><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eLQsZL5j0_k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eLQsZL5j0_k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WHYUlrpK0kI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WHYUlrpK0kI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></center></p>
<p>After hearing the other two scores, I was glad they ended up using the one thatâs on the movie. Even though it has a more modern beat, I think itâs the one that fits the scene the most. It sounds like youâre in a desperate situation and you have no other choice. Everytime I listen to it, I imagine myself lying on a hospital bed, rosary in hand, while being wheeled to the operating room for a life threatening surgery. The other two scores have a more Asian beat but I donât know, it sounds strange for that particular scene. I didnât get carried away. Maybe I was just used to the original score.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my random post about the movie âMulanâ. ^^ Kamsahamnida.</p>
