<title>Desert Castles, Jordan - 14.05.2011</title>
<link>http://annakowalik.multiply.com/photos/album/42/Desert_Castles_Jordan_-_14.05.2011</link>
<description>The Desert castles consist of a number of minor castles and fortresses scattered over the desert in eastern Jordan. Most of the remaining castles are situated east of the capital Amman.
The castles were built between the 7th century and 8th century, roughly between 660 and 750, under the caliphs of the Umayyad dynasty who had made Damascus their new capital in 661. The majority of the castles lie on the ancient trade routes towards Medina and Kufa.</description>

<title>Dead sea, Jordan, 13.05.2011</title>
<link>http://annakowalik.multiply.com/photos/album/41/Dead_sea_Jordan_13.05.2011</link>
<description>lso called the Salt Sea, is a salt lake bordering Jordan to the east and Israel and the West Bank to the west. Its surface and shores are 423 metres (1,388 ft) below sea level,[2] the lowest elevation on the Earth&#x27;s surface on dry land. The Dead Sea is 377 m (1,237 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 33.7% salinity, it is also one of the world&#x27;s saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazk&#xF6;l and some hypersaline lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond) have reported higher salinities. It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean.[4] This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is 67 kilometres (42 mi) long and 18 kilometres (11 mi) wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan</description>

<description>Mount Nebo (Arabic: &#x62C;&#x628;&#x644; &#x646;&#x64A;&#x628;&#x648;&#x200E;, Jabal Nibu. Hebrew: &#x5D4;&#x5B7;&#x5E8; &#x5E0;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5B9;&#x200E;, Har Nevo, ) is an elevated ridge that is approximately 817 meters (2680 feet) above sea level, in what is now western Jordan. The view from the summit provides a panorama of the Holy Land and, to the north, a more limited one of the valley of the River Jordan. The West Bank city of Jericho is usually visible from the summit, as is Jerusalem on a very clear day.
According to Jewish and Christian tradition and the Bible, Moses was buried on this mountain by God Himself, and his final resting place is unknown. Scholars continue to dispute whether the mountain currently known as Nebo is the same as the mountain referred to in the</description>

<description>Jerash, the Gerasa of Antiquity, situated in the north of Jordan, 48 kilometres (30 mi) north of the capital Amman towards Syria. Jerash is known for the ruins of the Greco-Roman city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as the &#x22;Pompeii of the Middle East or Asia&#x22;, referring to its size, extent of excavation and level of preservation (though Jerash was never buried by a volcano). Jerash is considered one of the most important and best preserved Roman cities in the Near East. It was a city of the</description>

Dahab can be divided into three major parts. Masbat, which includes the bedouin village Asalah, is in the north. South of Masbat is Mashraba, which is more touristic and has considerably more hotels. In the southwest is Medina which includes the Laguna area, famous for its excellent shallow-water</description>

<title>Luxor East Bank - Egypt - 03-04-11</title>
<link>http://annakowalik.multiply.com/photos/album/30/Luxor_East_Bank_-_Egypt_-_03-04-11</link>
<description>There are the two big attractions of the Luxor Temple and the Karnak Temples, of course, plus the fabulous Luxor Museum and the Mummification Museum.

The Luxor Temple is an astonishing sight from the corniche. It is particularly attractive when subtlety lit in the evening. Dating from the time of Amenhotep II and Ramses II, it is dedicated to the god Amon Ra and his wife Mut. You enter it from an entrance facing north, at the point where at one time it would have been connected to the Karnak Temples via a causeway. 
The Karnak Temples are the largest ancient religious site in the world, the complex takes its name from the village of Al-Karnak and, in fact, comprises three distinct</description>

<title>Luxor West Bank - Egypt - 02-04-11</title>
<link>http://annakowalik.multiply.com/photos/album/29/Luxor_West_Bank_-_Egypt_-_02-04-11</link>
<description>Luxor (Arabic: &#x627;&#x644;&#x623;&#x642;&#x635;&#x631;&#x200E; Al Aq&#x1E63;ur) is a city in Upper (southern) Egypt and the capital of Luxor Governorate. As the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes, Luxor has frequently been characterized as the &#x22;world&#x27;s greatest open air museum&#x22;, as the ruins of the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples and tombs on the West Bank Necropolis, which include the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens.
The west bank at Luxor is one of the most important archaeological sites in the world. It is much more than what we refer to as the Valley of the Kings, though many have called the whole of the area by that name. In fact, many good books on the west bank at Luxor (ancient Thebes) are titled, &#x22;Valley of the Kings&#x22;, even though they cover the entire area. It can be a bit confusing for the novice, particularly considering the actual conceptual scope of the religious concept. If one looks at ju...</description>

It is famous for its exquisitely detailed yet monumentally scaled temple ruins of the Roman period, when Baalbek, then known as Heliopolis, was one of the largest sanctuaries in the Empire.
