	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WASHINGTON (AP) </strong> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he&#8217;s &#8220;still hopeful&#8221; the league will be able to test players for human growth hormone this season.</p>
<p>After giving a speech to neurological surgeons Monday, Goodell told reporters: &#8220;I think the science has proven there&#8217;s a valid (HGH) test, and we&#8217;re hoping we&#8217;ll get the green light from the union.&#8221;<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>When the NFL and the players&#8217; union agreed to a new labor contract in August, the sides said they would institute blood testing for HGH, but only after the union agreed to the methods. The union has questioned the safety and reliability of testing.</p>
<p>Two members of Congress invited Goodell and union head DeMaurice Smith to meet about HGH testing. Goodell expects that to happen in the next two weeks.</p>

<p><strong>WAXAHACHIE (CBSDFW.COM)</strong> &#8211; As a result of a chemical fire in Waxahachie the Ellis County Office of Emergency Management has issued an evacuation order. The Civil Emergency Message advises, &#8220;<strong>People in the area of Highway 287 and Interstate 35 East in Waxahachie should evacuate immediately</strong>&#8220;.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Firefighters continue to battle the fire and explosions at the <a href="http://www.magnablend.com/" target="_blank">Magnablend</a> chemical warehouse.</p>
<p>The fire started just before 11 a.m. Magnablend Environmental Health and Safety Manager Donald Golden talked about the immediate reaction at the scene. “Our first priority obviously when we got to the location was to ensure that everyone was out of the building and accounted for,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Once we were sure that was the case the fire spread very rapidly. Fire departments were on the scene pretty quickly but it [the blaze] just seemed to take off and accelerate pretty quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flames and fumes from the blaze are so intense that fire crews have decided to let the fire burn itself out. “All firefighters have been pulled back because of the severity of the situation,” explained Amy Hollywood, with the City of Waxahachie.</p>
<p>Candon Birdwell, with the Waxahachie Fire Department, said of the fire, “They have four different buildings… I would say it’s pretty large.”</p>
<p>According to the company website, Magnablend houses various organic and inorganic chemicals.</p>
<p>Lisa Wheeler, with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, says the company also uses sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric, and phosphoric acids.  Wheeler says Magnablend has a clean safety record with the agency.</p>
<p>The warehouse is located just off of the Highway 287 Bypass, near Interstate-35E. As a result of the fire, smoke and fumes both directions of Highway 287 have been shut down in the area.</p>
<p>Fire departments from multiple cities have been called in to combat the blaze.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency is sending teams to monitor the air quality around the fire. &#8220;It’ll be some time later this afternoon before we have monitoring data from those air monitors, but the agency is on the way and will support the emergency responders at the scene of the fire,” explained Dave Bary, with the EPA.</p>
<p>State officials are also lending a hand. Terry Clawson with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said they too are sending air monitoring teams. &#8220;We will do whatever needs to be done,&#8221; said Clawson.</p>
<p>The Navarro College Waxahachie campus, which is just adjacent to Magnablend, has been evacuated.</p>
<p>Initially administrators at nearby Wedgeworth Elementary were just keeping kids inside but the decision was made to evacuate. Video shot from Chopper 11 showed students being loaded onto school buses to be taken to another school.</p>
<p>So far, there have been no reports of injuries.  On its Facebook page, Magnablend says all of its employees are safe and accounted for.</p>
<p>CBS 11 News has crews on the ground and in the air and will have more information as it becomes available.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>AUSTIN (AP) -</strong> Texas senior safety Christian Scott is out indefinitely with a right wrist injury.</p>
<p>Texas athletic trainer Kenny Boyd says Scott was hurt in Saturday&#8217;s win over Iowa State. Boyd says Scott will continue to be evaluated but is out indefinitely.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The injury further hurts Texas&#8217; depth in the secondary as the No. 11 Longhorns (4-0) prepare to play No. 3 Oklahoma (4-0) on Saturday. Another safety, Nolan Brewster, recently gave up football because of concussions and migraine headaches.</p>
<p>Scott missed the first three games due to suspension after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor assault charge.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NEW YORK (AP) -</strong> The Big 12 Conference says school leaders have agreed to equally share first- and second-tier television money if its members agree to give the league their TV rights for at least six years.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The revenue-sharing model had been proposed by Texas several weeks ago, but was waiting for a vote by league presidents. School leaders, who make up the Big 12 Board of Directors, voted Sunday and said each school must still approve the granting of TV rights.</p>
<p>The move is believed to be a way to keep the nine remaining members of the Big 12 intact after a summer of turmoil. Texas A&amp;M is leaving for the Southeastern Conference.</p>

P. Pogue)" title="wpid-changing-a-filter_1.jpg" />Ultimately, the decision to clean air ducts comes down to a homeowner's own judgment. Now, find out what the experts are saying.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dfw.cbslocal.com&amp;blog=15909545&amp;post=101885&amp;subd=cbsdallas&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Linda Wetzel of Shaker Heights, Ohio, says she was skeptical about air duct cleaning until a friend told her it had improved her allergies. “I figured common sense said, if there’s dust on the table, there has to be dust in the vents,” Wetzel says.</p>
<p>After hiring a highly rated cleaner, Wetzel was very pleased with the results. She says she noticed an immediate improvement in air quality — everyone in the house suffered fewer allergies afterward — and the entire HVAC system worked more efficiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used our air conditioner less in the summer because it had so much more airflow,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And we used the heater less during an incredibly cold winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite such anecdotal experiences, there&#8217;s no scientific evidence that regular duct cleaning improves air quality, according to a 1997 brochure published by the Environmental Protection Agency. Laureen Burton, senior scientist in the EPA Indoor Environments Division, says that while the document is more than a decade old, the science hasn&#8217;t changed and the agency stands by its recommendations.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Checking and changing filters, keeping systems maintained, having regular inspections, and ensuring moisture doesn&#8217;t get in are more important,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>However, both EPA and the National Air Duct Cleaners Association – which represents more than 1,000 cleaning companies nationwide – agree that there&#8217;s some value in the work.</p>
<p>Buck Sheppard, NADCA president and duct cleaner in Portland, Ore., says the association consulted on the EPA pamphlet and agrees with all but one of its findings. &#8220;Where we differ is on how often it should be done,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The EPA does not recommend that air ducts be cleaned routinely, but only as needed — such as when mold, pests or excessive debris clutter the system. According to a recent online poll, 13 percent of Angie&#8217;s List members have their ducts cleaned routinely, but 60 percent do so only if serious problems develop.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision to clean air ducts comes down to a homeowner&#8217;s own judgment. &#8220;Get a screwdriver, open up the register and look in there yourself,&#8221; Schulte says. &#8220;Most can make up their mind at that point.&#8221;</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Three highly rated carpet cleaners weigh in on what homeowners need to know before cleaning home carpets:</em></p>
<div class="basicsection fifty50_rw divider">
<ul>
<li><strong>James Marsh</strong>, owner/operator, Top Notch Carpet Cleaning, Portland, Ore.</li>
<li><strong>Rick Taylor</strong>, president, The Red Carpet Company Inc., Framingham, Mass.</li>
<li><strong>Nathan Norman</strong>, owner, 1 Year Warranty Carpet Cleaners, Mableton, Ga.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="basicsection fifty50_rw divider">
<h3><strong>Q: What kinds of carpet are more difficult to clean than others?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Marsh: </strong>When you buy a carpet, choose nylon. Acrylic carpets are made from recycled plastic such as soft drink bottles. They&#8217;re stain resistant, but traffic patterns will crush the carpet within its first year. Wool carpets wear the best, but they have to be cleaned differently, and in my opinion, it&#8217;s not worth the extra cost.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Norman:</strong> Wool carpets are always tricky to clean. If you&#8217;re not careful and use the wrong solution, they tend to shrink.</p>
</div>
<div class="basicsection fifty50_rw divider">
<h3><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the best product for pet stains?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Taylor: </strong>We use a protein-based stain spotter on pet and beverage stains. We use foam to coat and get deep into carpet fibers.</p>
<p><strong>Marsh:</strong> I trust Biokleen&#8217;s Bac-Out, found in health or high-end grocery stores. It works well on stains from pets or kids who have wet the bed.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p><strong>Norman:</strong> In extreme cases, where the carpet is soaked with urine and it&#8217;s gotten into the pad and subfloor, you&#8217;re never going to get rid of the odor. The only thing to do is wash the surface, dispose of and replace the pad, treat the subfloor, and clean the surface again.</p>
</div>
<div class="basicsection fifty50_rw divider">
<h3><strong>Q: What are the advantages to hiring a professional rather than renting a carpet cleaner and doing it myself?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Norman:</strong> You&#8217;re not breaking your back doing it. It might sound easy, but it might take you the whole day to get it done. Professionally cleaned carpets tend to last longer because we don&#8217;t use harsh solutions to clean it.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Our carpets dry within three to five hours, rather than two or three days.</p>
</div>
<div class="basicsection fifty50_rw divider">
<h3><strong>Q: What other useful carpet care tips can you offer?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Taylor: </strong>Red dye found in Kool-Aid and copy machine toner ink are brutal on carpets. The longer the stain sits there, the harder it is to remove it. Most people wait too long. But if you call us before too long, we have had success removing such stains as red wine.</p>
<p><strong>Marsh: </strong>Scotchgarding is a waste of time on polyester/plastic carpets, since it can&#8217;t penetrate the fibers. It&#8217;s a gimmick. Nylons are the only carpets you should Scotchgard.</p>
<p><strong>Norman:</strong> Vacuum regularly, especially if you have kids or pets. Make sure you&#8217;re using a good vacuum that&#8217;s not emitting dust back into the air.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many great reasons to install hardwood flooring. It matches well with almost any décor. It can reduce dust and other allergens. Cleaning is relatively quick and simple.</p>
<p>But even with these benefits, hardwood flooring is not maintenance-free. Installation errors, wood&#8217;s natural tendency to swell with changes in humidity and long-term wear and tear can all cause unsightly conditions that detract from a hardwood floor&#8217;s appeal.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>If you own a home with hardwood floors, look out for these common issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buckling and crowning.</strong> This is caused when the original installer did not provide enough space between the wood planks for expansion with humidity. Eventually, the planks may swell into each other and become raised. These raised areas not only look uneven compared to the rest of the floor, they also attract more wear and tear.</li>
<li><strong>Scratches, dents, and dings.</strong> These are some of the most common hardwood flooring issues and they generally occur over time as the floor is used and its protective finish wears off. This can be avoided by not wearing shoes in the house and by installing protective pads on furniture legs.</li>
<li><strong>Fading.</strong> A floor&#8217;s exposure to UV rays from sunlight can cause noticeable differences in the floor&#8217;s color over time. Blocking sunlight by lowering the shades or closing shutters can help prevent this fading.</li>
<li><strong>Warping.</strong> When exposed to or saturated in water, wood can swell and warp. Prevent water from coming in contact with wood floors by using area rugs below sinks and near entry doors, and by placing houseplant pots or containers on top of water-collecting dishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your hardwood floors display any of the above characteristics, it&#8217;s likely that only a skilled hardwood flooring contractor can help you resolve the issues.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many residents have a long list of small household repairs that need attention, but they often have too little time or insufficient skill to address them. Hiring a handyman can be an affordable way to tackle multiple projects at once, but finding the right one isn’t always easy.</p>
<p>The following tips can help ensure you hire a high quality handyman that’s suited for your needs:</p>
<p><strong>1. Define the scope of the project, and evaluate the skills needed to complete it.</strong> A handyman is best utilized for small jobs such as installing light fixtures, cleaning gutters and fixing leaky faucets. If the job requires a permit, you should consider hiring a professional contractor.</p>
<p><strong>2. Interview at least three candidates.</strong> Ask about years of experience and areas of specialization, and request references from homeowners who had similar work done. Make sure the potential handyman is a good match for your project.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Stay away from the handyman who asks for money in advance.</strong> Reputable handymen don’t expect to get paid before the project is completed. Don’t hire handymen who contact you with an unsolicited phone call or visit, and avoid workers who do not guarantee the price of the job.</p>
<p><strong>4. Insist on a written agreement laying out the job, the cost and the fee schedule in detail.</strong> Be clear about the times you expect the work started and completed. Get guarantees in writing.</p>
<p><strong>5. Inspect the completed work before making payment.</strong> Make sure that everything has been done to your satisfaction.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to painting the inside of your home, the first step isn’t making sure you pick the right color. Prepping the inside of your home is imperative to ensure the paint job lasts and you protect your belongings in the process.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Move and/or cover furniture. This will ensure you don’t get paint on them and allow plenty of room to work.</li>
<li>Wash walls with an all-purpose household cleaner. This eliminates dirt and dust and allows the paint to properly adhere to the wall. You&#8217;ll want to wash from the top down to avoid streaks.</li>
<li>Patch any holes or abnormalities on the wall. Drywall compound can fill a hole. For cracks, you need to get a little more in depth. Use fiberglass mesh to prevent the crack from returning, and then put a few thin layers of drywall compound over it. You&#8217;ll then have to sand it down until the wall is smooth and even.</li>
<li>Caulk/spackle seams, gaps, cracks and holes, as moisture can penetrate through them.</li>
<li>Remove all electrical switch plates, cable outlets and phone jack covers. Masking tape can be used to cover electricity outlets and things of that nature.</li>
<li>Trim needs to be sanded to remove sheen. Remove any flaking paint and smooth with the sand paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;re now ready to begin painting. Start with the ceiling, then the walls and finish with the woodwork.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -</strong> David Price is thankful to have another shot at Texas in the playoffs.</p>
<p>A postseason disappointment a year ago when he lost twice in the opening round to the only AL opponent he&#8217;s never beaten, the young Tampa Bay pitcher will get a chance to redeem himself Monday when he goes against right-hander Colby Lewis in Game 3 of the AL division series between the Rays and Rangers.</p>
<p>The teams are tied 1-1 after splitting two games in Texas. The Rays say they&#8217;re comfortable putting the ball in Price&#8217;s hand, even though the hard-throwing lefty hasn&#8217;t won in more than a month and was 0-2 with a 4.97 ERA in a pair of losses at home to Cliff Lee in the 2010 ALDS.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty unique &#8230; a good opportunity for me to have,&#8221; Price said Sunday, conceding that his lack of success against the AL West champions is not easy to shove to the back of his mind.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old is 0-3 with a 5.67 ERA in six career regular season starts against Texas, including a 3-0 loss to Lewis and the Rangers at Tropicana Field on June 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is something that I think about and something that I want to get over with,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;I am not intimidated by this lineup by any means or anything like that. It is a very good offensive lineup, and they make it tough to pitch. But it&#8217;s postseason baseball, and you have to be able to step up and make some pitches for your team.&#8221;</p>
<p>The No. 1 pick in the 2007 amateur draft made an impressive postseason debut as rookie in 2008, making five relief appearances following a September call-up to play a key role in Tampa Bay&#8217;s surprising run to the World Series.</p>
<p>Price won 19 games last season, finishing second in AL Cy Young Award balloting behind Felix Hernandez, but hasn&#8217;t been nearly as consistent since being roughed up in last year&#8217;s playoffs.</p>
<p>He went 12-13 this season and was 0-2 over six September starts for his first winless month in three years as a starter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unacceptable,&#8221; said Price, who will be starting an important game for the second time in less than a week.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The two-time All-Star committed two costly throwing errors and allowed six runs in four innings to New York last Wednesday night, when the Rays entered their regular season finale tied with Boston for the wild card. The Rays overcame the subpar performance when they rallied from a late seven-run deficit to beat the Yankees and clinch their third playoff berth in four years.</p>
<p>Teammates have faith that Price will rebound against the Rangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s the kind of guy that, I think, no matter what kind of knockout blow he takes, he&#8217;s always going to get up and keep going, try to find something from that experience to make him better, something to take away that he can turn into a positive,&#8221; Rays third baseman Evan Longoria said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He took those two (playoff losses last season) and everything that happened to him this year and learned from it,&#8221; Longoria added. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to watching him pitch. I have no doubts about putting him out there against anybody in any situation. I would not put anybody else out there. He just has the desire to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rangers manager Ron Washington selected Price for the AL All-Star team this summer, even though the young pitcher has not had much success against Texas.</p>
<p>He explained why Sunday before the Rangers held a light workout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you look at him you can see he has tremendous competitive spirit. And in the game of baseball that&#8217;s what you have to have. You have to be able to deal with the adversity of what this game entails, and he does a good job at that,&#8221; Washington said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know our hands will be full (Monday), and we just look forward to competiting against him. And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. He will bring his best game, and we certainly better bring ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rangers lost the series opener 8-0 to rookie Matt Moore, but bounced back to beat Rays ace James Shields 8-6 in Game 2. Lewis is 3-0 in four career starts against Tampa Bay, and also worked five scoreless innings of a no decision against the Rays in Game 3 of last year&#8217;s ALDS.</p>
<p>The Rays were ecstatic to return home with a split, and feel good about their chances of wrapping up the best-of-five series without having to head back to Texas for a fifth game. The Rangers won three road games here during the 2010 ALDS and feel good about their prospects, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we can win on any given day. It doesn&#8217;t matter where at,&#8221; Texas third baseman Michael Young said. &#8220;We respect the people we play, but we have a lot of confidence in ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>FRISCO (CBSDFW.COM) -</strong> Andrew Birkenstock yelled, “Ice cold lemonade! Ice cold lemonade!” The 6-year-old’s cry lured customers to his stand in Frisco’s Newman Village neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Would you like to buy some lemonade, some cookies or some cupcakes?” asked Connor Kirkpatrick, Birkenstock’s 6-year-old business partner. More than a dozen neighborhood children stood behind tables pouring cups of lemonade and serving baked goods at their community lemonade stand.</p>
<p>“I think we’re actually doing pretty well,” said 6-year-old Davis Noe, holding a large jug full of cash and coins. The profits will not go to a piggy bank, but rather to help out other kids. “Basically, we’re raising money to buy toys for sick people, and then we’re going to send it to the hospital for them to play with,” Noe explained.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">

<p>The chosen charity is Change for Children’s, which helps entertain patients at Children’s Medical Center. They provide birthday parties, clowns and animals for those kids staying at the hospital.</p>
<p>“We know how it feels,” said 8-year-old Carly Henderson. Like all kids, they have suffered through stomachaches and sore throats. They can relate to being sick. And even though they do not understand the feeling of cancer, they know that any sickness is not fun. “You can’t do much things that regular kids can,” said Henderson. “You miss a lot of things.”</p>
<p>“Like playing – playing football and soccer,” added Birkenstock.</p>
<p>With sweet faces and sweet products, this group of Frisco kids are learning what it is like to make a difference in the world.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FORT WORTH (AP) -</strong> Federal and state weather forecasters and climate experts are getting together to brainstorm about the epic 2011 Texas drought and what weather trends might signal for the future.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">

<p>This year&#8217;s drought already has cost the Texas agriculture and cattle industries more than $5 billion. Intensifying La Nina conditions in the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean signal the approach of another dry winter. That means little to no relief from the drought conditions.</p>
<p>State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon already has told the Austin American-Statesman that the drought could be the beginning of a decade-long dry spell. He will join National Weather Service forecasters and climatologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Monday&#8217;s discussion in Fort Worth.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WASHINGTON (AP) -</strong> As Texas governor, Rick Perry spent tens of millions in taxpayer money to lure some of the nation&#8217;s leading mortgage companies to expand their business in his state, calling it a national model for creating jobs. But the plan backfired.</p>
<p>Just as the largest banks began receiving public cash, they aggressively ramped up risky lending. Within four years, the banks were out of business and homeowners across Texas faced foreclosure. In the end, the state paid $35 million to subsidize it.</p>
<p>An Associated Press review of federal mortgage data, court filings and public statements found that Perry downplayed early warnings of an impending mortgage crisis as alarmist. That&#8217;s even as Perry&#8217;s own attorney general would later investigate whether Countywide Financial Corp. encouraged homeowners to borrow more than they could afford.</p>
<p>As Perry offered $20 million in grants to Countrywide and $15 million to Washington Mutual Inc. &#8212; each blamed for having a major role in one of the country&#8217;s most serious recessions &#8212; he took in tens of thousands of their dollars for his gubernatorial campaign.</p>
<p>Perry, a Republican candidate for the White House, did what any governor would want to do: bring in jobs for his state. He also supported a cap on how much consumers could borrow against their homes, which experts credit for softening the blow of the mortgage crisis in Texas: by the end of 2008, more than 22 states had a greater percentage of foreclosures.</p>
<p>Yet Perry didn&#8217;t appear to recognize that the industry his administration had subsidized was damaging the national economy.</p>
<p>The AP analysis found that Washington Mutual, Countrywide and their subsidiaries boosted risky lending in Texas within a year after receiving grants from the Texas Enterprise Fund. In 2004, only one out of every 100 Washington Mutual loans in the state was originated to homeowners with less-than-perfect credit. The next year, that figure rose to more than one in four.</p>
<p>Countrywide&#8217;s lending volume also boomed. In 2004, 14 percent of the company&#8217;s loans in the state were given to high-risk borrowers, but the following year &#8212; when Countrywide received its first $10 million disbursement from the fund &#8212; the rate of risky loans jumped to nearly one in three, the AP&#8217;s analysis found. Texas ranked No. 3 for the number of risky mortgages underwritten by Countrywide, behind only Florida and California.</p>
<p>In October 2007, as credit-rating agencies continued downgrading hundreds of billions in mortgage-backed assets on Wall Street, Perry&#8217;s spokeswoman described Texas as &#8220;one of the hottest housing markets in the nation&#8221; and dismissed concerns about the looming economic implosion as &#8220;slightly alarmist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The enterprise fund is known in Texas as a signature issue for Perry, and one that has drawn critical scrutiny by the watchdog group Texans for Public Justice in light of subprime mortgage lending in the mid-2000s. The AP&#8217;s review uncovered new details of his economic deals as he seeks the GOP presidential nomination, particularly in how the two lenders engaged in subprime lending in Texas.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The AP&#8217;s analysis examined rates of so-called high-cost mortgages, including subprime loans and those that required less documentation than traditional mortgages. Federal data available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act identifies mortgage transactions that show signs of risky lending.</p>
<p>Texas officials said the fund has an 11-point vetting process, and subsidies are approved by Perry and top state leaders with requirements to create certain numbers of jobs. Between Washington Mutual and Countrywide&#8217;s TEF contracts, officials pledged more than 11,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., which acquired Countrywide in 2007, ended its contract under the fund in early 2010 and returned $8.45 million because it couldn&#8217;t meet the contract&#8217;s 7,500 promised jobs. But since JPMorgan Chase acquired WaMu, as Washington Mutual was called, in 2008 and maintained the contract, it didn&#8217;t have to pay back its predecessor&#8217;s $15 million grant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state&#8217;s contract with Countrywide was specific to creating jobs, and ultimately produced more than 3,800 jobs for Texans,&#8221; Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told the AP.</p>
<p>Countrywide pledged to create thousands of new jobs, but later shed more than that in nationwide layoffs. That came as Countrywide and WaMu gave checks to Perry&#8217;s re-election campaign, including $2,500 from WaMu&#8217;s political action committee as late as March 2008. The companies gave more than $15,000 in total contributions, state records show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Countrywide faced problems in Texas. Perry&#8217;s own attorney general reached an agreement with the lender in 2008 that would give millions to customers who lost their homes to foreclosure. The attorney general&#8217;s office began its investigation that year amid allegations that Countrywide encouraged homeowners to accept loans they could not afford.</p>
<p>But the warning signs came earlier.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2005 &#8212; just as the companies were collecting subsidies from Perry&#8217;s administration &#8212; more than two-thirds of all loans by Countrywide and WaMu had low- or no-documentation requirements, according to a report compiled by a federal commission on the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo told Wall Street analysts that Countrywide intended to dominate the mortgage market and increase its overall market share by 2006 to 30 percent.</p>
<p>Back at its offices, Countrywide subsidiary Countrywide Home Loans Inc. processed more than 150,000 mortgages a month in mid-2004, relying on automated underwriting software to speed up the approval process.</p>
<p>That was a year before the mortgage crisis began to escalate, and six months before Perry announced his Countrywide deal. In a speech at the time, Perry called Countrywide a good employer and said state government subsidies would help other such companies move their businesses to Texas.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>McALLEN (AP) -</strong> Ron Paul, antagonist of the Federal Reserve and advocate for the gold standard, probably won&#8217;t capture the Republican presidential nomination. But with his libertarian leanings energizing a small though growing group of passionate conservatives, the quirky Texas congressman is proving to be a force in the 2012 contest.</p>
<p>Four months before the initial voting, Paul is having such a big impact on the race that some Republican operatives are convinced that he will play spoiler in important states, siphoning votes and attention from his rivals for months to come and helping determine the nominee.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s empowered by unconventional but successful fundraising techniques, a more sophisticated campaign than his two previous attempts at the presidency, and a fiery message he&#8217;s preached for decades but only now is resonating with Americans concerned about the nation&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p>In short, he could prove dangerous for the early front-runners, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea what exactly spoiler means,&#8221; Paul said recently while in New Hampshire. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a participant and you have an influence and you win or come close and you influence the debate, I think that&#8217;s pretty important. So I don&#8217;t put a negative term on that as spoiling anything. Spoiling their fun? Maybe they need a little spoiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear which rival the 76-year-old Texan stands to hurt the most.</p>
<p>Paul&#8217;s most devoted followers have been committed to him for years. But the &#8220;converts,&#8221; as the congressman calls them, seem to be growing with little regard for whether their support of Paul unintentionally helps another candidate.</p>
<p>Kate Baker is among the many die-hard Paul supporters in New Hampshire who shrug off the suggestion that their candidate may play spoiler. She holds out hope of victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ron Paul is doing well enough he has the possibility to win, particularly in key states. This time I can taste success,&#8221; said Baker, the volunteer head of New Hampshire&#8217;s Women for Ron Paul Coalition. She also worked to help Paul get elected four years ago.</p>
<p>But for Baker and others, winning almost sounds less important than spreading Paul&#8217;s message of fiscal discipline and smaller government. That&#8217;s a pitch he&#8217;s made for years and one that others suddenly have adopted, sometimes with more success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at how much the message is traveling right now. He&#8217;s honest and consistent. That&#8217;s the kind of person I can put my money and effort behind,&#8221; said Baker, a 37-year-old Manchester resident. &#8220;I vote for Ron Paul on principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others like her have helped Paul build a grass-roots fundraising network so robust that his team is preparing for a primary campaign that goes the distance, confident Paul will raise enough money to stay in the race as long as he wants.</p>
<p>His fundraising prowess dropped jaws four years ago when, during one cash-grab blitz, he raised more than $5 million in 24 hours. Drawing on thousands of small online donations, Paul has raised at least $1 million in five individual &#8220;money bombs&#8221; this year, according to his campaign.</p>
<p>Overall, he raised $4.5 million this year through June 30 and is expected to report $5 million more through the end of September. That&#8217;s well behind Romney and probably Perry, too. But it&#8217;s far more than most of the second-tier candidates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just money that&#8217;s helped him become a more credible candidate this time around. It&#8217;s also the improved quality of his campaign.</p>
<p>Paul moved more quickly this year to put organizers and experienced workers in important states. He was the first candidate to run television ads in New Hampshire. At the straw poll in Ames, Iowa, a test of campaign organization, Paul finished second to Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann by only 152 votes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we have so many county chairmen and precinct chairmen and all this all through Iowa, we never had that before,&#8221; Paul said recently from his office in Washington.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">

<p>There are signs that Paul is adopting more traditional, and possibly successful, campaign strategies, according to Eric Woolson, who managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee&#8217;s victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. The strong straw poll finish was &#8220;maybe a little more of an acknowledgement that this is the way the game is played,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, the difference goes beyond organization.</p>
<p>Paul still talks freely about some subjects that place him on the fringe, such as ending the fight against drugs. But his early ads in the state seemed to &#8220;recast&#8221; his image, said Richard Killion, an unaffiliated Republican strategist who had advised former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a 2012 race dropout, in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The ads give the impression that Paul is the most electable and best positioned to beat President Barack Obama, going against the conventional wisdom that Paul &#8220;speaks out well on big problems in Washington, but may not be the best messenger to tackle them,&#8221; Killion said.</p>
<p>Paul is working to remedy that perception.</p>
<p>&#8220;I keep thinking maybe how I can improve on saying things so the people can understand what I&#8217;m talking about and make sure that they don&#8217;t misinterpret me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All this suggests Paul is poised to improve upon his 2008 performance, when he grabbed more than 7 percent in the New Hampshire Republican primary and reached as high as 14 percent in Nevada.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that Ron Paul will get somewhere north of 10 percent, possibly even in the high teens, which will have a major effect and impact on the race and who wins &#8212; whether its Perry or Romney &#8212; in New Hampshire,&#8221; said Michael Dennehy, a New Hampshire-based operative who led Sen. John McCain&#8217;s campaign four years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would go so far as to say he will play spoiler,&#8221; Dennehy said. &#8220;I do not see his support waning below 10 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul also seems more willing to mix it up with the other candidates that he was in 2008.</p>
<p>He acknowledges trying to score political points that raise his profile in addition to his standard no-frills discussion of the issues.</p>
<p>A Paul television ad calling Perry &#8220;Al Gore&#8217;s Texas cheerleader&#8221; garnered loads of attention and drew attacks from Perry. That was an unusual reaction from a front-runner who would typically ignore attacks from lesser candidates.</p>
<p>Paul said he wrestles with how to apply the new style.</p>
<p>But as much as other candidates pull Paul&#8217;s ideas into the conservative mainstream, it&#8217;s easy to forget he was the Libertarian Party&#8217;s candidate for president in 1988.</p>
<p>Paul calls for immediate withdrawal of troops around the world, brushes aside concerns about Iran obtaining a nuclear bomb and has suggested Israel be left to defend itself. He would return to the days when the currency was backed by gold. He would eliminate a host of federal agencies and says, &#8220;There is no greater threat to the security and prosperity of the United States today than the out-of-control, secretive Federal Reserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mostly, Paul is pleased that some ideas he&#8217;s hammered for years are echoing all around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ever did this and now it&#8217;s not just me doing this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s all good.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON (AP) -</strong> Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain criticized rival Rick Perry on Sunday as being insensitive for not acting sooner in removing the racially offensive name from a rock outside the Texas hunting camp his family once leased.</p>
<p>Perry&#8217;s campaign countered that Perry&#8217;s father painted over the rock to cover the name, N&#8212;-rhead, soon after he began leasing the site in the early 1980s. While the Texas governor later joined the lease, neither he nor his family ever controlled, owned or managed the property, the campaign said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported Sunday that the origins of the name were unclear and there was no definitive account for when and how the name first appeared on a large, flat rock at the gated entrance to the Throckmorton County property. In recent photos the word is mostly obscured by white paint, the Post reported.</p>
<p>Cain, the only black Republican in the presidential race, accused Perry of insensitivity when asked about the report on a Sunday news programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Gov. Perry has been going there for years to hunt, I think that it shows a lack of sensitivity for a long time of not taking that word off of that rock and renaming the place,&#8221; Cain, a businessman, told ABC television&#8217;s &#8220;This Week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was painted over,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But how long ago was it painted over? So I&#8217;m still saying that it is a sign of insensitivity.&#8221;<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Perry told the Post that the word on the rock is an &#8220;offensive name that has no place in the modern world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother and father went to the lease and painted the rock in either 1983 or 1984,&#8221; Perry told the newspaper in a written response to questions. &#8220;This occurred after I paid a visit to the property with a friend and saw the rock with the offensive word.</p>
<p>&#8220;After my visit I called my folks and mentioned it to them, and they painted it over during their next visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry added: &#8220;Ever since, any time I ever saw the rock it was painted over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Post reported that people interviewed for its story remember seeing the rock with the name at various points during the 1980s and 1990s, the period in which the Perrys had the hunting lease and Perry brought friends to the site. Some of those interviewed said they worried that it could become a political liability for Perry.</p>
<p>Ray Sullivan, communications director for the Perry campaign, said the governor&#8217;s father, Ray Perry, leased the hunting rights in the early 1980s and that Rick Perry was on the lease from 1997 to 2007. Rick Perry has not visited the property since December 2006, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cain is wrong about the Perry family&#8217;s quick action to eliminate the word on the rock, but is right the word written by others long ago is insensitive and offensive. That is why the Perrys took quick action to cover and obscure it,&#8221; Sullivan said.</p>

<p><strong>DALLAS (AP) -</strong> Former President George W. Bush was set to speak Monday at a ceremony marking the placement of the last construction beam for his presidential center in Dallas.</p>
<p>Around 600 people, including former first lady Laura Bush and members of the construction team, were expected to attend the &#8220;topping out&#8221; ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which will include his presidential library and a policy institute.</p>
<p>The nearly 225,000-sq.-foot center is located on about 25 acres on the campus of Southern Methodist University. When completed in spring 2013, it will have an exterior of red brick and limestone and landscaping that includes a restored prairie, a woodland and wildflower meadow.</p>
<div id="attachment_42119" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><img class="size-full wp-image-42119" title="George W. Bush" src="http://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/gw-at-ceremony_106911301.jpg?w=420&#038;h=315" alt="gw at ceremony 106911301 Bush To Mark Progress Of Library Construction" width="420" height="315" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Former President George W. Bush addresses the audience during the George W. Bush Presidential Center groundbreaking ceremony on November 16, 2010 in Dallas. (credit: Getty Images/Tom Pennington)</p></div>
<p>Architect Robert A.M. Stern said that the center has been designed to complement the university&#8217;s Georgian architecture but also has &#8220;its own character.&#8221;<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Laura Bush, who chairs the design committee for the center, told The Associated Press that she wanted the building to have a modern feel since her husband&#8217;s presidency was the first of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Visitors to the museum will enter through Freedom Hall, a large light-filled open space that will tie different aspects of the center together. The museum&#8217;s permanent exhibit includes a replica of the Oval Office as it appeared during the Bush administration and the White House Rose Garden, with a few tweaks for the Texas climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very open and accessible and we hope people will come back again and again,&#8221; Stern said.</p>

<p>Like the Bushes&#8217; ranch in Crawford, the presidential center has incorporated environmentally friendly design elements, including using as many as possible materials from within 500 miles of the site. Also, solar panels will supply hot water and there will be a system to capture and reuse rainwater.</p>
<p>Laura Bush said that the museum&#8217;s exhibit on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will include a giant bent beam from the World Trade Center. &#8220;That is a very somber part of the museum display,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The George W. Bush Foundation has already raised the $250 million needed for the cost of the building and an around $8 million endowment to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, said foundation president Mark Langdale.</p>
<p>The Bushes moved to Dallas after he left office in January 2009.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dfwinternational.org/FiestaLatinoamericana/">5th Annual Fiesta LatinoAmericana! </a>begins on October 9. The AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center is partnering with Guadalupe Cathedral and the Dallas Black Dance Theater to showcase the only cultural festival of the Americas you’ll find in the metroplex. Flora Street will turn into a cultural festival of the Americas to capture the “traditional plaza” feel of a real Fiesta. There will be with mobile musicians, dancers and drummers, clowns and balloon vendors and a Dance Pavilion. There will be food vendors, three stages of music and dance workshops and other hands-on activities for everyone in the family from 9 a.m. – 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Take a tour of the sacred spaces of the arts district on October 27. St. Paul United Methodist Church and First United Methodist Church have more to offer than a Sunday service. Learn about the history and the architecture of some of the oldest buildings in the city.</p>
<p>Aurora 2011, a free public art show, takes place on October 28.</p>
<p>&#8216;Art in October&#8217; ends with the closing celebration on October 30 with costume-themed festivities and the <a href="https://www.dallassymphony.com/season-tickets/subscriptions/family-series/productions/monsters-of-film-music.aspx">Dallas Symphony Orchestra&#8217;s Monsters of Film</a>. Again museum admission will be free to all as will the street performances, tours and activities. The night will end with a &#8220;Zombie Walk,&#8221; and all participants are invited to dress up and join in the march.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COOL NIGHTS, WARM DAYS       </strong></p>
<p>Just as we turned the calendar over to the very fall-sounding month of October, fall nights have been the rule. Overnight lows will again drop down toward the mid-50’s in the urban areas, in the upper 40’s in the Red River counties and low 50’s in elsewhere. These are the coolest nights we’ve enjoyed since last spring. Clear skies and only a slight hint of a southeast wind tonight.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>A GREAT RUN OF WEATHER TO START OCTOBER…UNLESS YOU WANT RAIN</strong></p>
<p>Dry and mild weather will dominate the forecast for the upcoming workweek. We expect the daytime highs tomorrow in the upper 80’s with sunny skies. Same forecast for Tuesday. A few clouds on Wednesday and Thursday but again, very nice and in the upper 80’s. The winds will pick up from the south on Friday, a breezy day (and a possible Fire Watch) with highs around 90 degrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RAIN IN THE FORECAST NEXT WEEKEND…SORT OF</strong></p>
<p>A deep trough will move across the mountain west all week and get into the front range by the end of it. By Saturday strong storms could develop in the panhandle of Texas up through the Midwest. These storms will get into our western counties on Saturday and Sunday. There will be a small chance some of these storms could last long enough to get into the metro area but any forecast this far in advance is destined to be tweaked a few times. We’ll keep you posted. Until then enjoy the great October weather. It’ll be short on rain but at least absent 100 degree weather. After a record 72 of them in the heat wave of 2011 I believe at last we can say they are gone for the year.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) – </strong>When Rhode Island became the 13th state to allow in-state tuition for illegal immigrants at public colleges, supporters heralded the move as one that would give students the kind of advanced education they need to succeed in the workforce.</p>
<p>But students who are not here legally may still face a major obstacle even with the benefit of a college degree: Many have no immediate pathway to legal status and, under current federal immigration law, employers cannot legally hire them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of students who have graduated magna cum laude and top honors in their colleges, but right now they&#8217;re working minimum wage in restaurants,&#8221; said Antonio Albizures-Lopez, 20, who came to the U.S. from Guatemala when he was 1.</p>
<p>Albizures-Lopez, who is pursuing legal residency, says the best solution is passage of federal legislation, known as the DREAM Act, which provides a pathway to legal residency for college students.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, which oversees the state&#8217;s three public higher education institutions, unanimously approved in-state tuition for illegal immigrants last week, effective in the fall of 2012. The General Assembly had failed repeatedly to take action on legislation that&#8217;s been introduced year after year.</p>
<p>Eleven states &#8212; California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah and Washington &#8212; have laws allowing the children of illegal immigrants to receive in-state rates if they meet certain requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Oklahoma allows in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants under a state Board of Regents policy.</p>
<p>Gov. Lincoln Chafee, in urging the Board of Governors to adopt the change, said it would allow more Rhode Islanders to attend college, help build a stronger workforce and boost an economy that is among the nation&#8217;s most troubled.</p>
<p>Research varies on how much resident tuition rates for illegal immigrants increase enrollment. A 2010 paper co-written by Aimee Chinn, an economist at the University of Houston, did not find a sizable increase overall for 18- to -24-year-olds in the 10 states studied, though it did find that Mexican men in their 20s attended at modestly higher rates. It also found that even in-state tuition may still be too expensive, especially since illegal immigrant students do not qualify for federal education aid.</p>
<p>By contrast, a study this year by the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, which looked at an array of research on the issue, said that in-state tuition has led to an enrollment increase among illegal immigrants, on average, of 31 percent in the places it has been implemented.</p>
<p>The Urban Institute has estimated that 65,000 illegal immigrants graduate from high school in the U.S. every year.</p>
<p>But even if more students go on to attend public colleges and universities with the benefit of in-state rates, a big question remains: How will they fare in the workforce after they graduate, even with a degree that traditionally makes it easier to get the kind of high-skill, high-paying job not available to those who finish only high school?</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with a college degree, there hasn&#8217;t been a more general immigration reform that would enable these kids to get a job once they have their degree,&#8221; said Chinn.</p>
<p>Amanda Pereira, 18, came to the U.S. illegally at the age of 6 from Brazil with her family.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>&#8220;In a way, it is going to be another dead end,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But in a way it is a help because at least they got through another four years and got their education, so they can find ways to possibly get legalized through an employer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brandeis University freshman was granted legal status &#8212; after more than a decade pursuing it &#8212; last spring, but is continuing to advocate for illegal immigrant students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do need to continue pushing for the DREAM Act,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That federal legislation &#8212; the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act &#8212; would provide a pathway to legal residency for illegal-immigrant students providing they meet certain requirements. A December study by UCLA estimated that such students could contribute anywhere from $1.4 trillion to $3.6 trillion to the nation&#8217;s economy over the course of their careers, depending on how many ultimately obtain citizenship.</p>
<p>But the bill has failed to win the necessary votes on Capitol Hill despite repeated tries, and its prospects for passage are uncertain.</p>
<p>Albizures-Lopez, a resident of Lincoln who graduated from Blackstone Academy Charter School in 2009, called in-state tuition a &#8220;stepping stone&#8221; to college but added, &#8220;It&#8217;s not complete. It&#8217;s not even halfway complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says he has &#8220;protected status&#8221; while his legal case for residency is pending, so he is able to work a part-time job coaching soccer at a private high school. He plans to apply to college, including the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College, where he could get in-state rates. URI&#8217;s in-state tuition is $9,824, compared to $25,912 for out-of-state.</p>
<p>Terry Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, opposes in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. He cites a 1996 federal law that laid out certain restrictions on illegal immigrant benefits, and says it&#8217;s a violation of that statute to provide in-state tuition to students who came here illegally, on the basis of residence, if the same break is not available to all students &#8212; including those from out of state.</p>
<p>Students paying out-of-state rates at California institutions mounted a legal challenge on those grounds, but the state Supreme Court upheld the in-state tuition policy, saying it did not conflict with federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear the case.</p>
<p>But Gorman also maintains that the policy change offers students in the U.S. illegally a &#8220;false hope&#8221; about their post-graduation prospects.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to be an educated population that can&#8217;t do anything with their education because they&#8217;re illegal aliens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do they do? They can&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco, who conducted the Latino Policy Institute study at Roger Williams, points out that, while that&#8217;s the law, it isn&#8217;t necessarily the reality. She said that under current enforcement practices, many who are here illegally are in fact being hired. That being the case, she said, they may as well be college-educated.</p>
<p>Under the new policy in Rhode Island, in-state rates will be available only to illegal immigrants&#8217; children who have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated or received a GED. Students also must commit to seek legal status as soon as they are eligible, or lose their resident tuition.</p>
<p>Supporters of the policy change say it would affect approximately 140 students in Rhode Island.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NORMAN, Okla. (AP) –  </strong>The Red River Rivalry is back at its best.</p>
<p>For only the second time in the last seven years, Oklahoma and Texas arrive at their annual showdown in Dallas with unblemished records. The Sooners (4-0) have slipped two spots from their preseason No. 1 ranking despite winning all four of their games, while the Longhorns have climbed all the way to No. 11 with four straight wins.</p>
<p>That sets up a high-stakes showdown between the Big 12 powerhouses Saturday at the heart of the State Fair of Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undefeated. Texas-OU. You can&#8217;t get any more bigger than that,&#8221; Sooners linebacker Travis Lewis said. &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to take off our heads, we&#8217;re trying to take off theirs and it should be an exciting game to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sooners and Longhorns have taken turns suffering early losses in recent years, removing just a little bit of the spice from a century-old rivalry that&#8217;s always one of college football&#8217;s fiercest. The annual Cotton Bowl showdown as at its heyday between 2001 and 2004, when the teams were both undefeated and ranked in the top 5 three of those four years.</p>
<p>It happened again in 2008, when top-ranked Oklahoma lost to No. 5 Texas &#8212; but that&#8217;s the only time in the past six seasons both teams made it to early October without losing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s always a big game,&#8221; Sooners defensive coordinator Brent Venables said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had many years where it has been we&#8217;ve both been undefeated and it&#8217;s always a big game. And years when maybe we&#8217;re down or maybe they&#8217;ve been down, it&#8217;s still every bit as big and you want to win every bit as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each team comes in off of a dominating performance fueled by takeaways. Oklahoma turned four turnovers, including three second-quarter interceptions by Tony Jefferson, into 28 points and throttled Ball State 62-6. Texas forced three first-quarter turnovers on its way to a 34-0 halftime lead, then cruised to a 37-14 win at previously undefeated Iowa State.</p>
<p>While Oklahoma, which won last year&#8217;s game 28-20, was the preseason No. 1, the Longhorns started the season unranked for the first time since Mack Brown&#8217;s first season as coach in 1998. Another win, and Texas would likely find itself ranked higher than the Sooners.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really big to be 4-0. I&#8217;m not sure a lot of people would&#8217;ve thought five weeks ago we would&#8217;ve been 4-0 right now,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Guys are playing with a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know a lot more about us now than we did when we started the season.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Longhorns have already avenged two of their losses from last season and are halfway through a stretch of four straight games against teams that beat them in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to get over this one pretty quick,&#8221; safety Blake Gideon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s another notch on our belt, it&#8217;s a win.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We came up here as a business trip, we got the job accomplished, so now we&#8217;re playing a pretty good team next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first glance, the Sooners fixed some of the flaws from a 38-28 victory against Missouri two weeks ago in which they trailed at home for the first time in 21 games. Venables had been disappointed with how his defense lined up incorrectly and provided leverage points for the Tigers&#8217; offense to gain more than 500 yards of offense.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know they&#8217;re a different team from last year, and I know they&#8217;re going to give us their all on Saturday,&#8221; Jefferson said. &#8220;They got better, but we got better also. It&#8217;ll be a great game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always think Texas is good,&#8221; Sooners coach Bob Stoops added. &#8220;It&#8217;s always hard to gauge where we&#8217;re at, where they&#8217;re at. You go into the game, and you&#8217;ve got to play it. You get each other&#8217;s best shot, so it&#8217;s always a little bit different than maybe how you might play against somebody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re having an excellent year here so far, and fortunately we&#8217;ve played pretty decent, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ball State managed just over 200 yards on Saturday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our players recognized we didn&#8217;t play to the level we&#8217;re capable of, and that it doesn&#8217;t take much to be off your game,&#8221; Venables said.</p>
<p>Venables said he was pleased with the chemistry, focus and resolve that returned to his team through a stressful week of practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t come at a better time. Going down to play Texas will be a great challenge for us and one that we&#8217;re really excited about. I know Texas will be looking forward to the stage. It&#8217;s a fabulous stage to play a college football game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unique setup splits the Cotton Bowl half and half between Oklahoma and Texas fans, with a dividing line up the stands at midfield. Even walking down the tunnel to the field has overwhelmed some players.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the intensity&#8217;s going to be a lot higher,&#8221; said Oklahoma running back Dominique Whaley, who will get his first Red River Rivalry experience this year. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big rivalry game. It gets under everybody&#8217;s skin, and they&#8217;re all getting ready and focused.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we all need to just treat it like it&#8217;s another game and execute.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the message being preached by quarterback Landry Jones, who&#8217;ll play in the rivalry for the third time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Texas week, it&#8217;s a rivalry game and it&#8217;s always just the hype around this game is a lot bigger than a lot of other games, so there&#8217;s a lot of emotion going into it,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;I think subconsciously you put a little more into this week than any others.&#8221;</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WASHINGTON (AP) – </strong>The recent listeria outbreak from cantaloupe shows that large-scale occurrences of serious illnesses linked to tainted food have grown more common over the years, partly because much of what we eat takes a long and winding road from farm to fork.</p>
<p>A cantaloupe grown on a Colorado field may make four or five stops before it reaches the dinner table. There&#8217;s the packing house where it is cleaned and packaged, then the distributor who contracts with retailers to sell the melons in large quantities. A processor may cut or bag the fruit. The retail distribution center is where the melons are sent out to various stores. Finally it&#8217;s stacked on display at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Imported fruits and vegetables, which make up almost two-thirds of the produce consumed in the United States, have an even longer journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasingly with agribusiness you have limited producers of any given food, so a breakdown in a facility or plant or in a large field crop operation exposes thousands because of the way the food is distributed,&#8221; says Dr. Brian Currie, an infectious disease specialist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.</p>
<p>The Colorado cantaloupe crop that&#8217;s linked to 84 illnesses and as many as 17 deaths in 19 states, including Texas, has traveled so far and wide that producer Jensen Farms doesn&#8217;t even know exactly where their fruit ended up.</p>
<p>The company said last week that it can&#8217;t provide a list of retailers that sold the tainted fruit because the melons were sold and resold. It named the 28 states where the fruit was shipped, but people in other states have reported getting sick.</p>
<p>A Kansas-based processor that purchased cantaloupes from Jensen, Carol&#8217;s Cuts, didn&#8217;t provide a notice to its customers that it had sold the farm&#8217;s cantaloupes until nine days after the original recall.</p>
<p>&#8220;The food chain is very complex,&#8221; says Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser in the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Office of Foods. &#8220;There are many steps, and the more steps there are the harder it can be to link up each step to identify what the common source&#8221; of an outbreak is.</p>
<p>Fewer and larger farms and companies dominate food production in the country. That has driven some consumers to seek out farmers markets and locally grown produce. Supermarkets now highlight food grown nearby, while farmers markets have soared in popularity.</p>
<p>But many in the produce industry have come together to try and improve the ability to quickly trace food from field to plate.<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">
	<iframe src="http://web.adblade.com/impsc.php?cid=1033-3875056521&output=html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="260" height="410"></iframe>
</div>
<p>This is good business. Large recalls, such as spinach in 2006, peanuts in 2009 and eggs in 2010, tend to depress sales for an entire product industry, even if only one company or grower was responsible for the outbreak.</p>
<p>Recent outbreaks of salmonella in peanuts and eggs, which are ingredients in thousands of foods, have been more widespread and sickened more people than have the tainted cantaloupe.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a laser focus on improving traceability so any recall can identify the affected product immediately and not have an effect on the rest of the entire category,&#8221; says Ray Gilmer of United Fresh Produce Association, which represents the country&#8217;s largest growers.</p>
<p>Gilmer says that larger food companies have no choice but to take food safety very seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stakes for a large company to have a food safety incident are huge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could destroy their company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Listeria, a bacteria found in soil and water, often turns up in processed meats because it can contaminate a processing facility and stay there for a long period of time. It&#8217;s also common in unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, though less so produce such as cantaloupe.</p>
<p>The disease can cause fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms and even death. One in five people who have listeria can die.</p>
<p>A food safety law passed by Congress last year gives the FDA new power to improve tracing food through the system. Food safety advocates say the law will help make the food network safer by focusing on making every step in the chain safer and making it easier to find the source of outbreaks.</p>
<p>For the first time, larger farms are required to submit plans detailing how they are keeping their produce safe.</p>
<p>Erik Olson, director of food and consumer safety programs for the Pew Health Group, says it is critical that those improvements are made to prevent more, larger outbreaks as the system grows more complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the food industry has just changed enormously in the last several decades,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;It would be virtually impossible to sit down and eat a meal and eat food that hasn&#8217;t come from all over the world.&#8221;</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ARLINGTON (CBSDFW.COM) – </strong>Division Street between Dottie Lynn Parkway and West Fork Road remains closed Sunday while Union Pacific employees work to clear a nearby railway of three locomotives and five rail cars <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2011/10/01/at-least-two-train-cars-overturned-during-derailment-in-arlington/" target="_blank">that derailed when an eastbound train slammed into one</a> that was stopped on the tracks Saturday night.</p>
<p>There were no injuries during the derailment, and Union Pacific spokeswoman Raquel Espinoza said the trains were carrying shipping boxes and containers. One had a small load of carpentry equipment, but there was so significant cargo spillage, she said.</p>
<p>In all, Espinoza said heavy machinery is on scene to move the three locomotives and five rail cars and make way for crews to fix the damaged portions of the rail itself.</p>
<p>About 600 were stranded at a Boys and Girls Club charity event Saturday night because the wreckage blocked the only exit from the venue, Howell Family Farms. They were eventually routed through a nearby pasture to a park road and then back onto the streets just east of the incident.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported Sunday that this is the sixth Union Pacific derailment in the area since 1998. The most serious of which injured 22 passengers when an Amtrak passenger train carrying 198 people derailed.</p>
<p>Arlington Police spokeswoman Tiara Richard hoped cleanup would be finished by 6 p.m., although Espinoza warned it could take longer. Authorities are hoping to have the wreckage cleared and Division reopened before Monday morning traffic begins.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ARLINGTON (AP) – </strong>Tony Romo put the Dallas Cowboys ahead by 24 points with his third touchdown pass right after halftime. That lead wasn&#8217;t enough after he followed that with three interceptions.</p>
<p>Two of the picks were returned for touchdowns, and the third set up Detroit&#8217;s game-winning score with 1:39 left as the Cowboys blew their largest lead ever to lose, 34-30 to the undefeated Lions on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts,&#8221; Romo said, not even talking about the still-sore ribs that forced to him take another pregame injection. &#8220;We were obviously in a position to win this game. &#8230; It doesn&#8217;t feel good right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Especially knowing the Cowboys (2-2) are going into their bye week and won&#8217;t play again for two weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating,&#8221; linebacker Sean Lee said.</p>

<p>The Cowboys had won two in a row since a season-opening loss at the New York Jets when Romo had an interception and a fumble at the 3 as Dallas blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>A week after that, Romo threw for 201 yards in the fourth quarter and overtime of a win at San Francisco despite suffering a fractured rib and punctured lung early in the game. They Cowboys were coming off a win over NFC East rival Washington six days earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I view the success we have, I view what he does well and I put the mistakes right in with what he does well and don&#8217;t in any way get discouraged about our future with Tony,&#8221; owner Jerry Jones said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no issue about faith in Romo, any place in this organization, period. &#8230; If you&#8217;re going to try to make plays, then you&#8217;ve got a chance to have some bad plays. But however we go, we&#8217;ll go with Tony. As Tony goes, we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Cowboys led 27-3 after Romo hit Jason Witten for a 1-yard touchdown only 2 1/2 minutes into the second half.</p>
<p>Then came the two interceptions in a span of three throws. Bobby Carpenter, the former first-round pick by the Cowboys and one of Romo&#8217;s good friends, returned the first one 35 yards for a touchdown and Chris Houston took another one back 56 yards for a 27-17 score.</p>
<p>Jason Hanson kicked a 51-yard field goal to get Detroit within 30-27 soon after Cowboys coach Jason Garrett declined a penalty that would&#8217;ve pushed the Lions back 10 yards, but given them an extra down.</p>
<p>On the first snap after Hanson&#8217;s second field goal in his 299th career game, Romo threw while trying to avoid pressure and came up short to Witten. Stephen Tulloch intercepted, setting up the Lions at the 40.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just didn&#8217;t get enough on the throw. &#8230; I thought it was going to be a big play for us, honestly,&#8221; Romo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s disappointing because I thought he was coming open past all the linebackers and there&#8217;s no safety help to that side. I wish I could have that throw back and just throw it further.&#8221;<div class="entry-injected-ad narrow">

<p>Instead, Dallas-born Matthew Stafford led the Lions on a seven-play drive that ended with his second touchdown to Calvin Johnson, a 2-yarder with 1:39 left.</p>
<p>This was a bizarre way for the Cowboys to end an NFL-record streak of nine straight games decided by a field goal or less. The final play was wacky, too, with Felix Jones catching a short pass with no one around him on fourth-and-20, then running out of bounds after only gaining 8 yards.</p>
<p>While Stafford has the Lions off to their first 4-0 start since 1980, and they have won an NFL-best eight in a row, Romo and the Cowboys have another bitter loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s lost faith in Romo,&#8221; said safety Gerald Sensabaugh, who was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in him. He&#8217;s our guy and we&#8217;ll fight through it,&#8221; Witten said. &#8220;We just need to eliminate this roller coaster of a ride, and that&#8217;s the next step for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dallas&#8217; previous biggest blown lead was 21 against Washington on Nov. 28, 1965, when the Cowboys led 21-0 in the second quarter on the way to a 34-31 loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must and we will look ahead,&#8221; Jerry Jones said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take our bye, get well and come back and try to do something very special.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stafford had dozens of relatives and friends in the crowd, including his high school coach.</p>
<p>His first pass to Johnson was intercepted, leading to Dallas&#8217; first touchdown and the defense was constantly in his face. He had a tough first half, but finished 21 of 43 for 240 yards and did a better job of finding Johnson after halftime. The game-winner came against tight coverage on a play when the Cowboys had 12 defenders on the field.</p>
<p>Johnson caught eight passes for 96 yards, and tied Cris Carter&#8217;s NFL record of catching two TDs in four straight games.</p>
<p>Romo was 34 of 47 for 331 yards, with three touchdowns. Dez Bryant caught two TDs before Johnson even had a single grab, and Laurent Robinson had seven catches for 116 yards.</p>
<p>Romo was on a roll of completing 13 of 14 passes, the only incompletion a clock-stopping spike, when Carpenter made a leaping interception and a weaving 35-yard return.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he&#8217;s going to get beaten up by (the media) this week,&#8221; Carpenter said of Romo. &#8220;He&#8217;s the same quarterback he was two weeks ago when he was the hero. He&#8217;s a tremendous player and a top-five quarterback, in my opinion.&#8221;</p>
