Well, it&#8217;s Friday and we needed a break, a perfect time to plug an awesome and awesomely new service: AV by AOL. It&#8217;s so new, in fact, that there&#8217;s a little yellow bar at the top of the page that says &#8220;note: this is for internal AOL use only.&#8221; And this nifty web app is something I thought I&#8217;d never say about an AOL service: it&#8217;s cool. Really cool. It&#8217;s the simplest and fastest video chat you&#8217;re likely to enjoy. Just go to the site, click whatever big button they tell you to, and you&#8217;ll be having a live video chat with up to 4 people within minutes. No signup, no login, nothing. Well done, AOL. Now you should mail everyone in America a CD-ROM telling them about it.

&#8220;No one in this studio was alive yet when Scott Weaver began this astonishingly cool sculpture 35 years ago. We&#8217;d like to believe that anyone could accomplish something amazing like this, given a vision, superhuman patience, two heaping scoops of crazy, a truckload of toothpicks and some glue. Watch the video for a working ping pong ball tour of Toothpick San Francisco.&#8221;

<p>For this week’s post, it’s time to come out from behind the curtain.  This may come as a shock to some readers, but I am not, in fact, an  anthropomorphic restaurant imbued with the power to write weekly blog  posts, but rather a human writer named Zach from (don’t hold this  against me) New Jersey. And recently I had my first BOKX experience, and  let me tell you, it’s even better than I’ve already been telling you it  is.</p>
<p>My three friends and I managed to recall everything we ate and drank  despite the weeklong blissful food coma that ensued. At the risk of  gushing about everything, I’m going to stick to the highlight reel.</p>
<p>First came the drinks. Two of us unashamedly ordered the Graceful  Lady, a delightful mix of SKYY Passion Fruit and cranberry with the  unexpected and welcome addition of rosemary. Total hit. The argument at  the end of the night (fueled by the drinks we were arguing about) was  whether we enjoyed that more than the Double Pear, a wonderfully tart  blend of Double Cross vodka, pear juice, and whatever it is that makes  it wonderfully tart. Though I had to cast a vote for my Jim Beam  Manhattan. It’s my favorite cocktail and I’ve had my fair share of them,  but this one belongs at the top of the list.</p>
<p>For entrees, the scallops were oh-my-good. We all got to try a little  bite because, even though we were all sharing, their orderer tried them  first and then guarded them carefully, rationing pieces like they were  World War 2 steel. My order, the hanger steak Decon 3 got the next-most  attention, so I had to watch for prying forks. And of course we ordered  the duck fat fries and short rib mac and cheese, because, come on.</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about cheesecake and red velvet cupcakes, but I have  to go clean the drool off my keyboard. Seconds please?</p>

We were there, because we designed the logo, worked with them on their Web presence and provided general creative consulting.</p>
<p>HoopFest’s goal is to provide local fans and out-of –town visitors alike with information, activities and services that complement all that glorious basketball. Fans will be greeted upon their mass transit arrival, and everyone can enjoy free shuttle service downtown, to Halsey Street and the Ironbound. Hoops are part of Newark’s DNA, and this season we’re showing it off to the world with more games than all but two arenas in the country.</p>
<p>Need any other reason to check out a game this season? How about this one: Tritonic will be there. And not even because we like seeing our design on a giant LCD screen. Well, not entirely.</p>

There are ghosts among us. Turn on the radio and you might hear them as they try to latch onto their past lives. They are the Ghosts of Record Labels Past, still pushing their zombie businesses to devour the brains of young artists.
Time for a friendly ghost to bring in some new, uh, ghost-blood. Music is as desirable as it ever was, and Ghost City Entertainment, an enterprising new breed of label, is ready to take advantage. They’ve been steadily picking up steam and came to Tritonic to elevate their brand. We delivered their airy, spooky logo, with business cards and a website on its way. Check out how the outlines around the letters form a cityscape. But don’t be scared; it’s only a logo.

		<description><![CDATA[At Tritonic, we love building kids. They comprise our robot child army, and our sinister master plan is about to enter Phase 2 (as long as the ambassador takes his afternoon tea on time).
But we’re not the only game in Newark. There’s another organization also committed to building kids, though they’re a bit more altruistic about it. They’re BRICK Academy, Building Responsible, Intelligent, Creative Kids (y’know, BRICK). Instead of working with robot children, they do most of their work with actual children, the kind that learn. They’ve got an ambitious menu of goals, and we’re happy to check “build a brand” off the list.
We designed their logo and website, just finished up their stationery and next on the queue is the 2011 brochure. We hope it will entice some new students, preferably those who are interested in espionage and intrigue. But now you know too much. Over and out.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Tritonic, we love building kids. They comprise our robot child army, and our sinister master plan is about to enter Phase 2 (as long as the ambassador takes his afternoon tea on time).</p>
<p>But we’re not the only game in Newark. There’s another organization also committed to building kids, though they’re a bit more altruistic about it. They’re <a title="BRICK Academy" href="http://bricknewark.org/" target="_blank">BRICK Academy</a>, Building Responsible, Intelligent, Creative Kids (y’know, BRICK). Instead of working with robot children, they do most of their work with actual children, the kind that learn. They’ve got an ambitious menu of goals, and we’re happy to check “build a brand” off the list.</p>

Move over, Ray’s Pizza. The “I’m the original!” stuff is cute and all, but it’s played out. It’s time to step aside for a real original: Famous Amadeus.
We know they’re original because some of that originality came from the creative minds of yours truly. We designed their slick, modern menu boards to stand out from the crowd of supposed originals, with bright, bold red jumping out in front of the viewer as if to say, “Hey, you’re going to love my 20 varieties of pizza, or 20 choices or wraps, salads and burgers.” And you know what? That talking color is right.

There are some theatrical types in this office, so we’re pretty thrilled when smart, creative people see a higher purpose for our passion. That’s GET, the Global Empowerment Theatre. It’s an educational theatre program that uses acting and playwriting to build English literacy, creativity and confidence in youth living in underserved areas around the world. They have worked in Tanzania and are working on expansion to India, Latin America, and refugee communities in the US.
We’re happy to help them get the look and feel they deserve. We created their logo, using a rough, raw look to represent their reaching students when they’re most impressionable. And fresh from the printer, their stationery just arrived. Next up is their website to turn this global organization into a global brand.

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg donated $100 million to Newark’s public schools. Remember that?
The nation’s attention may have turned to tax cuts and how to get Junior his light-up battery powered Tickle-Me Zhu Zhu Furby for Xbox, but here in Newark, that money’s coming, and someone needs to give it out.
That someone is the Foundation for Newark’s Future, who will be transparently fielding proposals and distributing funds to worthy recipients. To learn more about how the process works, visit their website (which you should also visit because we designed it).  And while you’re there, be sure to enjoy their lovely logo and tagline. For no reason in particular. Wink, wink. Because we worked on those too. Wink.
