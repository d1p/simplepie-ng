<description> I realized today, or maybe I always knew.  I'm really not sure. So we all know about the girl, who was supposed to be my friend and she wasn't. Or whatever. I don't feel like naming her really. Not now. So, we all know who i'm talking about. If you're not sure, then feel free to go back and reread some of my previous blogs.

You know, I keep thinking about everything over and over again. I mean, how did things turn out so wrong? How did they end so badly? I mean, I guess I'm not her... I can't just pretend that none of it ever happened. I can't pretend that we were friends. I can't pretend that none of it was real. I can't just move on. She was my friend and a huge part of my life. I can't lie and say that wasn't true. It hurts, but it happened. Everything happened. I don't know why, but it did. We were close. I gave her money. I trust her. I shared my dreams, my secrets, my everything with her. I did everything for her.

I just can't get over it like she can. For me it was more then just some lie like it was for her. For me, it was real. It was a close friendship, like a sisterhood. For me, it wasn't just some kids playing pretend. It was something special and amazing. Something that only one in a million friends share. You know?

I dunno. She'll probably make this out like I'm obsessive or something. But if being friends and having feelings and loving and caring about someone is called being obsessive, then fine. I'm obsessive. I loved her (not that way, like a best friend and sister). Her friendship was important to me. Losing her, it really was like losing a sister.

Everything we went through, everything we shared. It was real for me. She may have just been playing pretend, but before me, it was real. I experienced real feelings and now I'm going through a real heart break. Whatever she's going through or thinking, I really don't know. I just know what she told me and how she acts and what she tells people. Personally, I don't know how anyone can live with themselves after they do such horrible things to another person. How they can say such nasty things about another human being.

In the end though, I guess it doesn't really matter. Honestly, I'm the stupidest thing alive. I know that. You wanna know why I'm so stupid? Its simple. Its because even after all this, I would be her friend again if that's what she wanted. I wouldn't hesitate to forgive her. I mean, I would still need her to repay the money she scammed me out of but still. But I would forgive her regardless. No questions asked.

No. I would never trust her again. Well... actually... I hate to say it... But I probably would trust her again. I know she would hurt me again, but either way, I would trust her all over again. I'm stupid like that. For me, I promised to always be there for her. I promised to never let her down. I promised to never lie to her. I promised to be her friend forever. I promised, that if she ever needed me, i would be there, no matter what it took. 

I never put any conditions on those promises. I won't put conditions on them now. So its very simple. If she wanted to be friends again, that would be that. I would forgive her. I would be her friend. I would trust her again. I would still keep every promise I made. I mean, yeah, we would have to talk a bit and work everything out, but I would take her back as a friend in an instant.

I promised her I would be her friend forever. So I'll always be her friend. Even if she won't always be mine. The ball is in her court. I guess, like always, its all about what she wants. If she wants to be friends, then we'll end up as friends again. If she doesn't want to be however, then I guess we'll never speak again. As usual, its about what she wants.

I promised though and even if we become friends again and she hurts me again, I'll forgive her. The hurt will never go away, I can guarantee that. But my arms will always be open to her.

And whatever I did to her to make her treat me this way, i'm sorry. I don't know what I did, but I'm sorry.

Like I said though, in the end, I guess it doesn't matter. To her, my feelings never mattered. Because to her, it was all just &quot;a dream&quot;. it was all just pretend, a lie. I'll never forget that or get over it... but... I would still forgive it. Because I promised to be her friend forever. I love her like a best friend, like a sister. She'll always be apart of me.</description>

<title>I'm Not Fine</title>

<description> So, something I've always suffered from is a reading disorder. I never realized it until this past year. It never occurred to me what my problem was. I never understood why I had so much trouble reading. Mum got me tested for things a million times (or so she says) but the doctors said each time that nothing was wrong. But, its my body, and my struggles, would I know better then them that something is wrong? I'm the one suffering. I would know something is wrong. its their job as professionals to figure out whats going on.

Its not so bad if professionals say there's nothing wrong. I mean, you can always find a new doctor. You can always do more research and bring them more evidence. Sure, its frustrating and upsetting and discouraging. But there's so many things you can do. But your parents, your parents are supposed to believe you. They're supposed to be helpful and supportive and understanding. They're not supposed to tell you how you're fine and that there's nothing wrong with you. That's not what they're supposed to do.

For me, when my mum said I was fine and there was nothing wrong with me, I felt like i was back in school. Where I was dealing with my fellow classmates and teachers. They would all look at me like I was some idiotic, stupid, freak or something. I hated it. Like I have no idea what I'm talking about. Parents aren't supposed to make their children feel that way! They're just not supposed to do that!

What's worse, is I don't even think she realizes or cares about how badly she makes me feel. :( I mean, its just like I don't matter or something. How could she even think to say something like that to me? Tell me that I'm fine. I spoke to her about it, about this problem and she acts like she understands. Then today she goes on about how I'm fine. How can she say something like that to me? Doesn't she realize how badly that hurt? I swear, it felt like she had taken a knife and stubbed in in the heart.

It just really hurt. This is something that I don't think i'll get over very soon... if ever. I've never had my mother say something so hurtful. ...Well... actually I have, but this really struck me hard. And she just doesn't understand what I'm upset over. :(</description>

<title>Go Ahead and Tell Me</title>

<description> Well, it seems like its been forever since I last blogged. I don't really get whats wrong with me. I just haven't felt up to blogging. Honestly, i haven't really felt up for anything. I've just been feeling really down and depressed for the past month. Some days, its harder then others. I've really gotten a lot of help and cheering up and advice from Georgina, Shaiann, and Nancy though. I've gotten some help from others, but those three have been the main recently.

I just don't get whats wrong with me. I know the cause of all this, its the break-up between me and my friend, Andy. I mean, she was my best friend and then she just betrayed me. She lied to me and stole money from me. I mean, she scammed me out of $2,000 USD. Then she expects me not to sue? And then she's telling everyone how I'm going to come and murder her in her sleep or some shit like that. How can you say that about someone and know it isn't true? How can you even think of saying that about someone and not have a problem with it?

Sorry, I'm getting off topic... I didn't mean to. Sorry. :( I'm just really upset. All of this has built up over a long time. So now suddenly, she doesn't want to be friends and its like... I don't even know. My feelings about all this are just so jumbled. She was my best friend and I was happy, like really happy when she was around. She meant so much to me, losing her was like losing a sister. Its not something you can just get over; if you ever get over it at all. She used to say that we were sisters, but if anything, she treated me like the shit under her shoe.

When she got upset about something I did, especially recently, i worked to change it. And I succeeded. She said that my anger when she did something wrong, upset her. So I changed it. When i got angry, I would take a deep breath and talk it over with her instead. We got along better and it was a huge plus. Or that's what I thought. When it came to her changing, she couldn't do it.

She could never treat me right. She was always abusive to me... She treated me horribly, but with her, to me, it was okay. She was my best friend. It hurt, but it was okay. I could get over it. I would get upset with her and we would argue. She would say sorry, not mean it, but I would forgive it. I would just accept her apology, knowing it was just a lie. She was my best friend. So her friendship was more important then the lies she often told me. That's just how it felt.

However, I do wish that my friendship with her was more important then herself and her lies. I wish that I was more important then her fears and her lies. She was more important to me then everything else. Her friendship was more important then the lies she told or my fear of being hurt by her again. So why aren't I more important to her? Why aren't I more important then her lies and fears?

I don't understand. I really don't. I don't understand why she treated me the way she did. I don't understand why she blamed everything on me. I don't understand why all I did was love her and care about her, and give things to her, but still, all I was, was hurt and abused. I don't understand why all she did was lie to me. I don't understand why I had to treat her like gold, but she could treat me like dirt under her shoe. I don't understand why she could tell so many lies about me.

There's a lot I don't understand about her. All I wanted was for her to treat me right. She said I was her sister and I was precious to her, but if I was, why did she treat me so badly? I changed for her, why couldn't she do the same? Why did I have to do all the work in our friendship?

I guess in the end, it was all one-sided. I was the only real friend in this friendship. She was just playing pretend. Playing games with my feelings. I guess that's all it was in the end. It was all just a lie.

Wanna know something funny? ...If she came back, I would forgive her instantly. I'll never really move on. Its like saying you can move on after your sister dies. You don't ever really move on. You come to accept the fact that they're gone, but you never really get over it. Some nights, you still cry yourself to sleep. Some nights, you're totally fine. But you never really get over it. I might one day come to terms with all this, but I'll never get over it.

I guess, I don't really know how to deal with it all. I just don't know where I went wrong. All I did was love and try to be there for her. I cared about her and her future. I cared about her safety and her life. She was like my sister and even if we never talk again, she'll always be my sister.

She can call me obsessive, possessive, or whatever she wants. She just doesn't understand. She can twist and turn things into something they're not, like she always has. She can do whatever she feels that she needs to do to justify her lies. She can call her lies &quot;dreams&quot;, but a lie is a lie no matter how you put it.

Yeah, I'm taking her to court for the money she scammed me out of and for slander/defamation of character, but I'll still forgive her. Saying that, I gotta look out for me and for my future. I can't keep putting her first when she doesn't even have me on the list. I'm sorry, but I gotta look out for myself at some point. She doesn't need to understand and I doubt she'll even try to.

Honestly, I still love her. She's like my sister and my best friend. I know what a real friend is and maybe one day she will too. I would never wish anything bad upon her, but I hope that one day, someone smacks some sense into her. Maybe one day it'll all just click and make sense. Saying that, if she ever wants an explanation, I'm here. Even though she refused to give me any explanations, I'd happily give her one. I would never lie, hide, or keep secrets from her. 

A few things I learned growing up is that two wrongs don't make a right and if you're planning revenge, to dig two graves. And finally, an eye for an eye, is stupid, because in the end, you'll just end up with a bunch of toothless, blind fools. I'm gonna live by these. She can treat me wrong, but I won't do that to her. It won't help any.

Right now, I guess all I can really give her is time to work things out with herself. Maybe she'll finally tell her family the truth about me and all I've done for her. Maybe she'll realize what she had. I really don't know. Maybe she just needs time to herself. Whatever the case is, I'm here when she gets back, if she ever comes back. My door will always be open, because that's what love and loyalty is about. Its as simple as that. If she needs me, I'll be there. Just like I promised.</description>

I cared about her safety and her life. She was like my sister and even if we never talk again, she&#8217;ll always be my sister.</p>
<p>She can call me obsessive, possessive, or whatever she wants. She just doesn&#8217;t understand. She can twist and turn things into something they&#8217;re not, like she always has. She can do whatever she feels that she needs to do to justify her lies. She can call her lies &#8220;dreams&#8221;, but a lie is a lie no matter how you put it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m taking her to court for the money she scammed me out of and for slander/defamation of character, but I&#8217;ll still forgive her. Saying that, I gotta look out for me and for my future. I can&#8217;t keep putting her first when she doesn&#8217;t even have me on the list. I&#8217;m sorry, but I gotta look out for myself at some point. She doesn&#8217;t need to understand and I doubt she&#8217;ll even try to.</p>
<p>Honestly, I still love her. She&#8217;s like my sister and my best friend. I know what a real friend is and maybe one day she will too. I would never wish anything bad upon her, but I hope that one day, someone smacks some sense into her. Maybe one day it&#8217;ll all just click and make sense. Saying that, if she ever wants an explanation, I&#8217;m here. Even though she refused to give me any explanations, I&#8217;d happily give her one. I would never lie, hide, or keep secrets from her. </p>
<p>A few things I learned growing up is that two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right and if you&#8217;re planning revenge, to dig two graves. And finally, an eye for an eye, is stupid, because in the end, you&#8217;ll just end up with a bunch of toothless, blind fools. I&#8217;m gonna live by these. She can treat me wrong, but I won&#8217;t do that to her. It won&#8217;t help any.</p>
<p>Right now, I guess all I can really give her is time to work things out with herself. Maybe she&#8217;ll finally tell her family the truth about me and all I&#8217;ve done for her. Maybe she&#8217;ll realize what she had. I really don&#8217;t know. Maybe she just needs time to herself. Whatever the case is, I&#8217;m here when she gets back, if she ever comes back. My door will always be open, because that&#8217;s what love and loyalty is about. Its as simple as that. If she needs me, I&#8217;ll be there. Just like I promised.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description> You wanna know something that I really hate? People who ask why I do something or have something just because I'm homeless. Why should I have to justify what I have or do just because I'm homeless. I mean, you're not in this boat with me, you have NO FUCKING IDEA what its like to be going through what I am.

I need a laptop and I need a cell phone and I need food and my van and my storage. There's a lot of stuff that i need and jut because you may not see it as needed, you really don't know do you? You can't voice your opinion on it can you? You've never gone through this. You may have been homeless before, but you still have no idea what I'm going through. When you were homeless, did you live where I live? Make the money we make? Own the same things we own? No. So you don't know how hard it is. You have no idea.

So just because you don't think you need something, you can't know unless you're in my boat. You'll never be in my boat. I just hate being judged based off what you think people need. It just pisses me off. I mean, how can you judge me and what I have or do when you have no idea what I'm going through. You have no idea what any of this is really like.

I get asked all of the time why I do or have things. Its okay once or twice, but when I get asked 2 million times, then its just like, &quot;don't you have anything better to do?&quot; Just pisses me off. What's worse, is my friends are the ones who ask. Instead of helping or anything, they just wanna judge everything and ask 50 questions. Can't even explain how much is bothers me.

Don't judge until you understand. Simple as that.</description>

<description> I know that I haven't blogged much recently. I mean, there's been a lot on my mind but not really much to blog about. So I haven't replied to comments yet. I don't want to reply to comments and then you come and find a latest blog post that old as fuck. :/ That's not cool. Plus, I just haven't really been up for blogging or returning comments and I'm sorry for that. :( 

So a lot has happened really. I'm not going to cover it all in this blog though. It would be too long and cover too many topics. So I'll wait and post each thing in separate blog posts. You know, spread things out a bit. What I really have on my mind right now though is school. I might seriously be going back this year. I mean, I know I've said this before, but this time we're really working at it.

We're working to get me into South River High School. Its a really good school from what we've heard. Its also the school that I've really, really been wanting to go to. The problem though, is I'll be starting as a senior. I'll also be a year older then everyone. Plus, even worse then all that, I'm so far behind. I've never, in my life, ever been to high school. At all. I've never done well in school before and I doubt that's changed. Plus, I'm sick all of the time. Seriously, if any of you have read my blogs, then you would know that I've been diagnosed with Anemia, heart problems (possibly heart disease), and a possibility of cancer that's going through my spine. So half the time I can't even get out of bed.

I know, you're probably saying, &quot;well if its that bad, then why don't you just get your GED?&quot; the answer is very simple really. I've never been to high school and its for that reason that I so badly want to go. Trust me, one day, your kids will be going into high school and they'll be nervous and they'll ask you &quot;what was high school like?&quot; Well, imagine if you told them &quot;I never went.&quot; I can't only imagine the look I would give them if my parents said that. I mean, in my grandparents time that was normal, but its not anymore.

I know how I look at my mum when I ask her about child birth and prom and she's like &quot;I didn't have a natural birth. I had a C-Section.&quot; and &quot;I never went to prom. It didn't interest me.&quot; and its like, &quot;That's great, but that doesn't reassure me.&quot; I don't want it to be like that with my kids. When they ask, I want to have an answer. Some kind of answer. I don't want to give them some &quot;i don't know&quot; crap. I mean, yeah, my high school experience will be different, but I'll have the basics of it.

Plus, its a big thing to me to go back to school. I mean, even if I do fail and don't graduate, at least I can say that I tried. If nothing else, I tried. To me, that's saying so much. A lot of kids don't appreciate or understand how much a simple - good or bad - high school experience can mean so much. In their future, you'll end up appreciating those experiences, even if they were awful. They taught you things and made you experience something new.

It just means a lot to me. At the same time, its like &quot;maybe I'm dreaming too much. maybe i'm being ignorant to the reality here.&quot; you need credits to graduate and I have none. I have 0 (zero). Plus, I have no high school education. So I'm just so far behind everyone else. Its like... maybe it is impossible for me to catch up. Maybe I can't do it. I'm just having all these doubts and I just don't know what to do.

School starts on August 23rd, that's Tuesday. I may have to start a little late. We're going to have to see. Mum is calling the school today while she's a work to make an appointment to talk to them about everything. I also need to go to the doctors and have them right up a few notes regarding what I need in medication and otherwise.

I also need school supplies. This is DC, the only help they provide is crap. Unless of course, you want a Cars or Barbie book bag. :D ...uh...NO. So I have to get the money for school supplies; at least some of it, and I need some clothes because I have like NONE. It just seems like this is all huge and impossible and just... It can't happen. I don't know what to do. I'm just so nervous.

After I get in school, if I do, I'm not sure how active I'll be online or anything. I mean, I have a lot of catching up to do with my school work. So I'm really going to need to dedicate a lot of my time to that. I'll still get online and everything. There's no need to worry. I'll definitely still be around. Its just a matter of how often and how much. We'll have to see. I'll keep you all informed though. Promise. :)

So, wish me luck I guess.</description>

<title>Be a Mum!</title>

<description> Why can't my mum ever just be a mum? I mean, she throws temper tantrums, all she does is play games on FaceBook, I can and she just sits there and plays her games, I'm angry and she edges me on, etc. I mean, why can't she ever just be there for me? She always turns things into something all about her. I mean, what about me?! I'm the one upset or crying and she just sits there playing her stupid ass game! I need her and she's playing a game.

So then when I finally get upset about her playing her game instead of being there for me, she gets all angry. She starts going on about how she must be stupid or starts blaming me for shit. I'm upset, can't I be? Why can't you just come over and give me a hug. Not say anything, just give me a hug. No. She wants to say &quot;what's wrong?&quot; in a real nasty, not-really-caring, attitude. And that's if she says anything at all. When she does asks what's wrong though and I answer, she gets pissed, and gets really nasty. Its like &quot;so why did you even ask?&quot;

I mean, its not fair. Why can't she ever just be there for me? Half the time, she'll just completely ignore me and go back to playing her games. I'm to the point where I just FUCKING HATE HER GAMES. I hate them so much. I regret ever getting her into those games. That's all she does now is play those god-damn games. She doesn't keep up her website or anything. She just plays her games.

There's nothing wrong with plating games sometimes. We all love games, right? :) But she, it seems like she plays more games then anything else. Instead of being there for me, she's playing a game. Instead of updating her blog, she's playing a game. Instead of giving me a hug or comforting me, she's playing a game. I've tried talking to her about it, she just gets really pissed and nasty over it. Its not fair.

I just want a mum. Everyone else has a mum. I want one too. I don't have anyone else. Why can't she ever just be there for me? Maybe I'm asking for too much...</description>

<title>Its Better Not to Dream</title>

<description> Over the past week, I've really been thinking about my life and where I am, where I'll be in a few years, where I've been already and what I've been through. I've just been thinking over and remembering everything in my life.

One thing that I've come to realize is that some of my dreams are fading. When I was a kid and even as I've grown up, one of my biggest dreams was to have children while I was young. I don't mean while I'm a teenager! lol No, no, no. I mean, having children while I'm in my 20's, preferably before 25. Of course, I'm 18 now. That's only 2 years until I'm 20. And only 7 until I reach 25. So I have between 2 and 7 years to have a child.

I mean, its not something that I have to do. Its just something I've always wanted. I always wanted to have a child young. I want to have a lot of children and I don't want them all around the same age either. I don't want to be like my mum either. She was 41 when she had me and I don't want that. I don't want to be that old. I love her to death and she's a great mother. 

However, I always fear that because she's so old, that she'll die soon. Its my biggest fear. I mean, next year she'll be 60. Everyone in our family dies around 80. When she turns 80, I'll be 38. I don't want her to be that old when I have kids. No. I want her to see my kids, her grand kids to grow up. Like my grandparents did (sorta). My grandparents saw me grow up until I was 16. They died around there. I'm not sure exactly how old I was, but I think I was about 16 years old.

Anyways, the point is, I want children. More then anything else in the world. Saying that though, I don't want to have children with just any old person. I don't wanna be one of those women who have 15 children and they all have different fathers. That's the last thing that I want. I want children all (or most) of the same father. Like, two fathers max. I know sometimes first marriages don't work out, so I'm basing all this on the fact I might end up getting remarried. You never know.

So, my problem is, how am I supposed to start having kids within the time I want. You don't fall in love over night and I don't wanna have kids with some guy I don't really know. I want to him him a while, like a few years, before I do anything serious, like having kids.

Almost all of the girls I know either have boyfriends, serious relationships, kids, are engaged, or married. I can't even get a boyfriend. I've never have one. Like, what have I done wrong? I've tried everything, including being myself. I can't even get an online boyfriend. I feel like some loser. Everyone I know has or does have a boyfriend. Everyone but me. :( What kind of loser am I? Its not fair.

So, considering the situation and problem that I'm currently in, being without a boyfriend, how am I supposed to get a serious relationship and later, kids? Its seriously like a stab right through the heart. Its something I really, really want and its something that, at this rate, isn't going to happen.

I know, it sounds silly and ridiculous. This is what I really want though. My best friends are reaching for their dreams and I'm reaching for nothing. Everything I want is impossible to achieve. :( I either can't achieve it because its impossible or its not something that I can do alone. I feel like such a loser, such a disappointment. Maybe I shouldn't have such stupid dreams, you know? Maybe they're just not worth it.

I don't know... I guess some things don't work out and some dreams don't come true...</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.sugar-baby.org/img/ic28.jpg" alt="icon" class="left_img" /> Over the past week, I&#8217;ve really been thinking about my life and where I am, where I&#8217;ll be in a few years, where I&#8217;ve been already and what I&#8217;ve been through. I&#8217;ve just been thinking over and remembering everything in my life.</p>
<p>One thing that I&#8217;ve come to realize is that some of my dreams are fading. When I was a kid and even as I&#8217;ve grown up, one of my biggest dreams was to have children while I was young. I don&#8217;t mean while I&#8217;m a teenager! lol No, no, no. I mean, having children while I&#8217;m in my 20&#8217;s, preferably before 25. Of course, I&#8217;m 18 now. That&#8217;s only 2 years until I&#8217;m 20. And only 7 until I reach 25. So I have between 2 and 7 years to have a child.</p>
<p>I mean, its not something that I have to do. Its just something I&#8217;ve always wanted. I always wanted to have a child young. I want to have a lot of children and I don&#8217;t want them all around the same age either. I don&#8217;t want to be like my mum either. She was 41 when she had me and I don&#8217;t want that. I don&#8217;t want to be that old. I love her to death and she&#8217;s a great mother. </p>
<p>However, I always fear that because she&#8217;s so old, that she&#8217;ll die soon. Its my biggest fear. I mean, next year she&#8217;ll be 60. Everyone in our family dies around 80. When she turns 80, I&#8217;ll be 38. I don&#8217;t want her to be that old when I have kids. No. I want her to see my kids, her grand kids to grow up. Like my grandparents did (sorta). My grandparents saw me grow up until I was 16. They died around there. I&#8217;m not sure exactly how old I was, but I think I was about 16 years old.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point is, I want children. More then anything else in the world. Saying that though, I don&#8217;t want to have children with just any old person. I don&#8217;t wanna be one of those women who have 15 children and they all have different fathers. That&#8217;s the last thing that I want. I want children all (or most) of the same father. Like, two fathers max. I know sometimes first marriages don&#8217;t work out, so I&#8217;m basing all this on the fact I might end up getting remarried. You never know.</p>
<p>So, my problem is, how am I supposed to start having kids within the time I want. You don&#8217;t fall in love over night and I don&#8217;t wanna have kids with some guy I don&#8217;t really know. I want to him him a while, like a few years, before I do anything serious, like having kids.</p>
<p>Almost all of the girls I know either have boyfriends, serious relationships, kids, are engaged, or married. I can&#8217;t even get a boyfriend. I&#8217;ve never have one. Like, what have I done wrong? I&#8217;ve tried everything, including being myself. I can&#8217;t even get an online boyfriend. I feel like some loser. Everyone I know has or does have a boyfriend. Everyone but me. :( What kind of loser am I? Its not fair.</p>
<p>So, considering the situation and problem that I&#8217;m currently in, being without a boyfriend, how am I supposed to get a serious relationship and later, kids? Its seriously like a stab right through the heart. Its something I really, really want and its something that, at this rate, isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p>I know, it sounds silly and ridiculous. This is what I really want though. My best friends are reaching for their dreams and I&#8217;m reaching for nothing. Everything I want is impossible to achieve. :( I either can&#8217;t achieve it because its impossible or its not something that I can do alone. I feel like such a loser, such a disappointment. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have such stupid dreams, you know? Maybe they&#8217;re just not worth it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; I guess some things don&#8217;t work out and some dreams don&#8217;t come true&#8230;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description> On July 19th, 2011 I woke up early. It was 9:40am or something which is really early for me. Mum wasn't even up yet for work. Well, I woke up to a really dry mouth. It was normal for me, recently I had woken up with a dry mouth fairly often. So it wasn't anything new. I got up, picked up my milk cup from when I had gone to sleep and I headed to the bathroom. I stumbled a few times and walked into the bathroom door frame. I paid it no real mind though and poured what was left of the milk into the sink. I tossed the cup in the trash can and walked back out of the bathroom. I closed the door behind behind me, pretty loudly too, which was unlike me. Usually I could close the door and it not make a sound.

I stared at the door for a minute find that odd, even at the time. I was thirsty though so I started to walk away towards the fridge. About three steps and I stumbled, falling into the wall. I rubbed my eyes a bit, maybe I was still tired? Maybe I just wasn't fully awake yet? That's what I thought. I knew it wasn't too dark in the door, sure, it was dark because of the heavy shade blocking out the morning light, but I could see just fine. Still, I shrugged it off and went over to the refrigerator, stumbling along the way.

I picked up a cup and placed it down on the &quot;counter&quot;. I opened the fridge and got out the milk. I was shaking a bit and my chest was getting tight. I figured it was nothing. I thought maybe I was just dehydrated and needed to sit down. Sometimes in the morning, if I got up too quickly, I would experience this. I didn't think much of it. So I got out of the milk, like I said, and I started to pour it. As I did, I spilled it. I never did this. I frowned some at my shaking at this point. I put the milk away, took a napkin and wiped up the spilled milk. 

I then went to sit down on my bed and drink my milk. I figured that I had just gotten up too quickly or something this morning. I figured that if I sat down and relaxed that the shaking and tight chest would all just go away. I drank some of my milk and sat there. I took a few deep breaths, like I usually did to calm myself. It wasn't helping. As I started shaking more, I had to put my milk down on the night stand. For a few more moments I sat there.

I didn't sit there long though before I started feeling sick. Like really sick. I got up and went to the bathroom where I sat before the toilet. I didn't get sick nor did the nausea go away. Instead all of the symptoms got worse. I had never experienced anything like this before. I didn't feel like myself. I felt... weird. Its like I wasn't all there. Its really hard to explain. It was like a drunk, they think they're acting like themselves, but everyone else sees them acting like a nut. And they're fully aware of what they're doing, but to them, its like &quot;I'm not doing that!&quot; but they are and they know it. Does that make sense? That's how it was for me, sorta.

A few minutes past and I kinda felt a little better. I felt like I could get up. So I got up slowly, stumbling quiet a bit. I remember feeling like the world was spinning. I stumbled slowly into the main room, got my milk, ice pack, cell phone, and stuffed rooster named Chickie (in my world, he's a chicken who just LOOKS like a rooster). I then stumbled back into the bathroom. I felt so dizzy and light headed. I took a deep breath and tried to sit down, well, it was more like I fell down. I put my milk down to the side and my placed my other stuff next to me. 

I leaned back against the bath tub and got my cell. Sometimes, if I was having chest pains, taking my mind off of it helped. It made me less anxious and relaxed me. I tried checking my email, twitter, playing a game, I just felt worse and worse. Finally, I looked up the symptoms. By this point, I knew something was wrong. Something was really wrong. I was starting to drift in and out. Not in and out of contentiousness, just in and out. I felt confused and I can't really explain it.

I finally found that the symptoms were of a heart attack. They run in our family. The symptoms were getting worse too. Finally, at 10;15 am, I called for my mum. I called her two or three times. By this time, I think I was drifting in and our of contentiousness. There's a lot of things that I can't remember. I don't know. She came in almost right away. She had been sleeping. I told her that I couldn't get up. She helped me and I stumbled. She caught me though. I don't really remember what happened after that.

The next thing that I remember was sitting on my bed again. Mum was next to me. I was drinking a bit of milk. She was reading over the symptoms. At some point she called our doctor, but there was no answer. By now, my speech was slurred and I sounded like I drunk. I was kinda-sorta aware of what was going on. Everything with my body was weird. Its like... the thoughts and commands from my brain weren't reaching the rest of my body properly or very slowly.

At some point, mum got me into the van and drove to the hospital. Its actually a health center, but whatever. I don't remember the drive there at all really. I remember driving past the gym by the health center though. And close the the health center I remember seeing a bus. I remember seeing signs that read health center. I remember seeing the emergency entrance sign above the door too as we drove up. I don't remember parking at all though or walking in. It was around 12:30 noon when we got there. After we were inside, I went to the bathroom, I felt sick.

When I came out of the bathroom, the nurse gave me a bracelet with my name and all. After that, we sat around for a while. My symptoms were starting to fade. I was starting to speak normally again too. When I finally saw the doctor, some women who was a weirdo beyond words, my symptoms were just about gone. The doctor looked me over though and ran a few tests. Finally, she came to the conclusion that I had something called anemia. 

Anemia is when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells. So for some reason, my body is either destroying the red blood cells, not recreating them when i lose them, or i'm losing them quicker then they can be replaced.

Since I wouldn't let the doctor do blood work, they couldn't do anymore tests. She didn't give me some medication to take though. They're HUGE. :/ It's awful. The medicine does help. I have to take it every day. If I don't take it, then I can tell a difference in how I feel.

She also informed me that I did, in fact, have a heart attack. It was caused by the drop in my blood pressure due to the lack of blood. or something like that. I could have a heart attack again, so she said that I really need to rest and take my medicine. The medicine is nasty. It tastes (and smells) like cinnamon with a burning sensation on the tongue. Its fucking nasty! It does help though.

She also gave me the name of a cytologist so that I can get over my fear of medical needles. I really need to get some blood work done. So I have to do that. Its been 5 days now and I'm still not back to normal. I'm still suffering from a tight chest and not enough air in the lungs. I'm doing better though. I just really need to rest.

With the fact there, that I had a heart attack, I have to be thankful. I mean, it could have ended a lot worse. I could have lost permanent motor functions or something. I didn't though and she says that I should be fine for the most part. So I can't really complain. It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn't. So I'm pretty thankful. It was really scary though. So I'm taking my medicine and resting a lot. I've found that chocolate helps too.

I'm doing okay now. I just need to rest and I need to get some tests done. This all really needs to be taken seriously on my half. Saying that, it's all still really scary. I don't want it to happen again. So I'm going to be more careful and make sure I take this medicine. No matter how nasty.

What really bothers me, is that this doesn't rule out having heart disease or cancer. It just means that I have one more problem including them (possibly). Which doesn't make me feel any better. It just makes me worry more. Time to get the tests done. I'm ready, I think, to work on getting over this fear. I'm ready to try. That's all I can say. :( I'm ready to try.

I just hope that things get better. I hope I don't ever go through this again. But somewhere in my heart, I have a feeling that I will. :( I guess hope is better then nothing. :)</description>

<description> Apparently, everything I do is wrong. Someone screws me over and I blog about. Then I'm trashing them and I'm wrong. Someone who can never say anything nice to me and only criticizes me, so I just upset, I'm wrong. I voice my opinion and it happens to be different from everyone elses, then I'm wrong. No matter what I do or say I'm wrong.

These past few weeks I've really been trying. I've been trying not to argue with people so much. I've really been trying to walk away from the fights or handle them with a calm attitude. I've really been trying. I guess I was a real fool though, to think it would matter. Either way, people think I'm arguing. Either way, I'm wrong.

It doesn't matter how I try or how I pick my words. There's just something about me that makes people angrily and makes them hate me. My teachers were the same way, everyone offline, everyone online, my family, everyone. Its like I'm a flower and went you see me or catch my scent you fall into complete and utter hate and disgust and anger. That's the best way I can describe it. It happens to everyone who comes near me. They all end up hating me.

I try my very hardest to be the best friend I can. I do everything I can to make others happy. Maybe I should just disappear. No one would miss me. In fact, I'm sure people would be happy without me. After all, they wouldn't have to listen to my complaining and whining anymore. I wouldn't be around to cause any twitter drama like people blame on me. It would be great. Everyone would be happy. So I'll just leave and it'll fix everything.

So, I'm giving up. I can't take it anymore. I'm a stupid, idiotic, pathetic, fool. I should be in the world records book because their can't possibly be anyone as fucking stupid as me. I swear to god. I'm just that stupid.</description>

<description> So we all know the girl from a previous blog. She told me how I wasn't homeless and cussed me out with a bunch of nonsense. Well, me and the girl became friends. She had apologized, after a bit of talking I decided to forgive her. I figured that two wrongs don't make a right. I could move on. So I forgave her and we became friends. :)

Well, a few days ago, said friend asked me if I knew anyone who wanted or needed a domain. I did. So she asked me to ask if my friend would like the domain. I contacted my other friend and she said that she would love to take over the domain. So, perfect situation and real easy-like, this girl gave my friend the domain.

A few days later though, my friend found the domain she had been given was suddenly gone. She contacted NameCheap live support who told her to submit a ticket in the fraud department. Come to find out, the money used to pay for the domain was taken back. So the domain wasn't paid for anymore. So the domain was kind of like &quot;repo-ed&quot;. It was taken back and put as unregistered. 

My friend and I couldn't figure out what had happened until NameCheap told us the domain hadn't been paid for. My friend, who adopted the domain got pretty angry about it. I could understand why. So I contacted the the girl who gave my friend the domain and asked if she knew what had happened. I figured maybe, by accident, she had taken back the money from NameCheap not realizing what it was for. Well, I quickly learned quite the opposite. She said,

I honestly don't really care. I wanted it gone, and its out my hands. Sorry. Not trying to be mean to (friend's name) ya know? But its out of my hands.

I was kind of bothered by the fact that she didn't even care. So I commented on what NameCheap had told my friend. I then added, &quot;So I guess you got your money back?&quot; I was still hoping she didn't do this on purpose. I was still foolishly hoping that she hadn't just stabbed me in the back.

She replied with a very simple, &quot;yes I got my money back.&quot; Now I was hurt. I commented on how she could have at least said something. Just let me know so I could tell my friend. She didn't think it was rude though. She responded with,

Not really, It was my money afterall. I paid for it. I had every right to get it back. Its just a domain.

I replied with,

You don't give something to someone and then take it back. Especially without bothering to say something. Its rude.

She responded with,

I didn't take it back. Namecheap took it back. I don't OWN namecheap.

That comment just made me bust out laughing. Namecheap doesn't take domains away for no reason nor can you keep domains that you didn't pay for! I replied with, as nice as I could possibly put this,

Namecheap took it back because you took back the money. So it happened because of you. You could have said something.

Her rude response was,

Well; it's MY money. NOT (friend's name)'s. I didn't put you in the middle of this. Honestly, if you want to start a war, go ahead. But I'm done. It's Just a stupid domain, and Hell; I can do what I want when I want with MY MONEY. It's NOT (friend's name)'s MONEY. I'm not fighting.

My simple reply was,

I don't get why you just couldn't say something? It was rude.

The girl has since unfollowed me on twitter and removed me as her affiliate. Of course, she was happy to bull shit everyone online giving them all my name. Its hard to believe that this girl is 28. I thought being 28 she would be more of an adult.

I mean, none of you are this dense, are you? You do get what the conversation was about right? If you read it, you would have realized, it wasn't about the domain at all. It was just the fact that she couldn't be bothered enough to say, &quot;Hey look, I'm sorry, I found a way to get my money back. You can't have the domain. I'm sorry.&quot; that's it! Just a little note letting her friend or me know (so I could tell my friend). Just say something! That was the whole issue. She couldn't be considerate enough to just say something!

I guess age really doesn't determine adulthood because if this is being an adult, I don't ever wanna grow up! I'll admit, I can be immature, but at least I know how to respect and be considerate of other people. I mean, if I do something that will effect someone else, I usually try to let them know before hand and directly after, like as soon as I know. That's just what I do. Its the right thing. Its respectful and considerate. She, being 28, doesn't know how to do that.

What was even more ridiculous, is the fact that she likes to give me name and what she &quot;thinks&quot; I did or said. I dunno. Its like she wasn't there for 90% of the conversation above. Here's one of the things she posted on twitter in reply to someone else.

Well; apparently I'm going through the same thing with Jennifer of sugar-baby.org all pissed off cause I got my money back domain that came out of MY pocket.Her friend wanted it, so I got my money back, and she says its rude that I did that with out a warning. Oh well...it's not her money.

Like I said, where was she during our conversation? Is was never about the money or the domain. It was just about why couldn't she say something?! I mean, is it really so hard to send a two second message of &quot;Hey look, I'm sorry, I found a way to get my money back. You can't have the domain. I'm sorry.&quot;? Is that really so hard? Its fine that you wanted your money back! We all understand and can relate. We just don't understand nor can we relate to your rudeness of not saying anything and then pretending you have no idea what happened!

So yeah. I was pissed. It was rude. I guess it was my fault though. Betray you once, its their fault. Betray you twice, its your fault for trusting in them. Lesson learned I guess. Don't give people second chances. If they betray you once, they'll always betray you again. Age is but a number, its not the signature of adulthood. People never change. Give someone, any age, over any amount of time. They betrayed you once, they will do it again. People never change.

Lesson learned.</description>

<title>Stop Giving Away My Food!</title>

<description>Let me warn you now, this blog is going to sound really selfish, but read it through. Thanks!

So, about a week ago, my mum got her tax refund check. it wasn't a lot, but it was enough to pay a few over due bills and get us some food. Well, for the last 2 months, I had been dying, begging for a piece of chocolate cake. They haven't had any cut up pieces though that we could afford. I know, cake isn't the smartest thing to eat when you're homeless. When you're homeless though and sick like I am, you can't eat the same things day in and day out, multiple times a day. It makes me sick. So having cake makes a great snack and I can eat it for lunch instead of eating the &quot;real food&quot;.

Well, with the refund check, I asked mum if I could get a big sheet cake. Whatever bit of the cake that I didn't eat, I would give to Melvin. Melvin is one of the cleaning men at the motel where we're staying. He likes stale cake, so it was no big deal. Then I wouldn't have to worry about eating the entire cake all by myself.

The issue here is, that I have been eating the cake by myself. The cake is less then a week old and I've already eaten half of it. Well, Melvin came over today and mum offered to give him some. She asked me, in front of Melvin, how much he could have. I don't want to sound like the bad guy or anything, so I said &quot;whatever&quot;. Like, as in, &quot;however much you give him is fine&quot;. Well, mum decided to cut out the best piece and give it to him.

I got mad at her last time for doing the same thing. She's always giving away my stuff. All I wanted was a fucking cake for me. I'm homeless. I don't think I'm asking for much! I just wanted a cake! And she just goes giving it away. She's never given away any of her cake or anything. She just gives away mine; my stuff.

Forgive me if I'm upset! You know? And then mum just doesn't get it. Last time she did this, I got angry. She said sorry and that she wouldn't do it again, but here she is. Doing the exact same thing, again. Then she doesn't get why I'm upset. So when I was pissed, she gets all silent and ignores me. Like &quot;oh. oh well. your feelings don't matter that much.&quot;

Finally, I asked her to go for a walk so that I could rant and rave on my twitter and blog and she does nothing. I ask her again. Nothing. I ask a third time and finally she closes her laptop, picks up all of her crap, turns off the TV that I was watching and then hid the remote. Then she leaves all these demands, grabs her book and with an angry little puff she storms out of the motel room, slamming the door behind her. It was so childish. She's 59 and acting like she's 10.

I often wonder who the adult is here. Yeah, I got mad over cake. I said Melvin could have it, but I wanted to eat what I wanted from it first. I'M the homeless one. Not him. He's doing just fine. I'm not. All I wanted was to have my cake and enjoy it. She wanted to give it away. I could understand if I wasn't eating the cake, but I am. I have at least one piece a day, sometimes two. So I don't get why she would just give the best part of the cake away? What the hell?

He didn't buy the cake, we did. So why is she just giving it away? Then she has the nerve to bring up that I have two more smaller pieces of vanilla cake and she has no cake. I've told her multiple times today that if she wanted one of the vanilla pieces of cake that she could have it. That was fine. She likes the vanilla cake. So I said she could have it. She's said no, multiple times. So if you don't want it, why even bring it up?! That's just so fucking stupid! She can be such a baby!

I dunno. I'm pissed. I don't get why its so hard for her not to offer all my stuff to everyone. She's always giving away my food. I'm sorry, but they may just be snacks to you, but to me, they're my lunch! I enjoy eating! So stop just giving away all of my food! Its mine! Give away your own food! Not mine! I don't think that this is too much to ask. Just for her to keep her big mouth SHUT.</description>

<title>What Friendship Means</title>

<description>Have you ever done something for someone only to find out that they didn't appreciate it? I have. That's what this blog is about.

I have a friend, who's been my friend for almost 5 years now, maybe even longer then that. Well, I do everything for her. I've bought her domain, completely set up her website, helped her with her family abuse, been there whenever she was upset, given her everything and she doesn't appreciate any of it. I give up my time for her, she won't do the same. If she has time and feels like it, then she'll get online and we'll talk. If she doesn't have any plans, she'll get on. If she does have plans, she'd never, in a million years, even consider changing those plans for me. I've dropped plans for her. I've stopped everything I was doing, for her. She won't even consider doing the same. She sees nothing wrong with this but I'm the selfish one.

Today, I went to comment on someone's blog. Come to find out, she's going around lying to people and telling them that I'm going to terminate her account come September. This is ridiculous! Her domain expires in September. What she chooses to do with it, is entirely up to her. She can renew it or not.

What I did tell her, was if she can't respect me and my hosting and stop bad moputhing me all over the place, then I would terminate her account. However, I'll do that right away, not when her domain is expiring. Her domain, that I bought and I paid for and I built the website on it for her. I change her layout and everything for her. Then she has the nerve to bad mouth me all over the place? Excuse me? That's just not okay with me.

She calls me her best friend and her sister and tells me how much she loves me and all that crap, but if this is her idea of love, I'd love to see her idea of hate. Honestly, I don't think that she has any idea what a friend or love is. Its more then just words. Its showing it too. She can't do that. Wouldn't dream of it.

I've tried everything within my power to show her what she is doing to me is wrong. I've tried to explain it to her as clear as day and she just doesn't see it. I've dropped all of the clues, given all the hints, even spelled it out for her. She doesn't get it. She disagrees. She refuses to admit she's wrong.

How can she lie to me like this over and over and over again? You don't hurt the ones you love. Then she has the nerve to apologize later on! An apologize is a promise not to do the mistake again. She just does the mistake over and over again! So she breaks at least once promise every two weeks! I'm always catching her in one lie or another and she sees nothing wrong with this.

I love her and I want to be her friend. I just wish that she knew what a friend was. Her idea of a friend is someone you never argue with and agrees with everything you say no matter how wrong it is. To me, that just sounds like someone who doesn't care about you. Friends argue, that's what makes their friendship stronger. If you can still be friends after an argument then that means you're important to one another. I've never heard of real friends who never argued. I don't see what kind of friendship that is.

Then the fact that her &quot;friends&quot; agree with everything she says. That just screams to me like they don't care about you. If they cared, then wouldn't they want to correct you? Why wouldn't they tell you that you're wrong so you can fix it? So you can succeed! If no one corrects you, how will you know its wrong? If you don't know its wrong, what if its something bad? You get fired at a job, a career making job! Why wouldn't your friends want to keep that from happening? Wouldn't they want what's best for you? Want you to succeed? As a friend, I always want my friends to succeed and do their very best. I never want to see them fail.

I, personally, try to never hurt my friends. She though, she does it on purpose and pretends that she cares when she really doesn't. What she does hurts and she just refuses to take responsibility for any of that. I know, I should just leave her. But friendship means to always be by your friends side. It means to love them endlessly and hold their hand. It means to be their support and with them. It means to be loyal to them. No matter what they do.

I can honestly say that I have never, in my life, ever left a friend to fend for themselves. I've always been there for my friends. I don't think any of them have ever really been there for me. She's worse then that though. She's always talking about herself and then she's like &quot;oh, I'm being selfish again, huh?&quot; and its like like &quot;what the fuck?&quot;. She does that kind of crap all of the time. Its all about her. What kind of friend is that?

I should look for better friends, but I just can't. I'm loyal and even though she's not, I'm not going to break my promise. I'm not going to stoop to her level and betray her like she has me. I have pride and dignity. I love her and I won't hurt her. Even if she does me. I would never betray her like she has me. I could never do that. Friendship means everything to me, even if it doesn't to her.

That's just how I feel. I hope one day she'll sit down and listen and change. I doubt she ever will though.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.sugar-baby.org/img/ic23.jpg" alt="icon" class="left_img" />Have you ever done something for someone only to find out that they didn&#8217;t appreciate it? I have. That&#8217;s what this blog is about.</p>
<p>I have a friend, who&#8217;s been my friend for almost 5 years now, maybe even longer then that. Well, I do everything for her. I&#8217;ve bought her domain, completely set up her website, helped her with her family abuse, been there whenever she was upset, given her everything and she doesn&#8217;t appreciate any of it. I give up my time for her, she won&#8217;t do the same. If she has time and feels like it, then she&#8217;ll get online and we&#8217;ll talk. If she doesn&#8217;t have any plans, she&#8217;ll get on. If she does have plans, she&#8217;d never, in a million years, even consider changing those plans for me. I&#8217;ve dropped plans for her. I&#8217;ve stopped everything I was doing, for her. She won&#8217;t even consider doing the same. She sees nothing wrong with this but <strong>I&#8217;m</strong> the selfish one.</p>
<p>Today, I went to comment on someone&#8217;s blog. Come to find out, she&#8217;s going around lying to people and telling them that I&#8217;m going to terminate her account come September. This is ridiculous! Her domain expires in September. What she chooses to do with it, is entirely up to her. She can renew it or not.</p>
<p>What I did tell her, was if she can&#8217;t respect me and my hosting and stop bad moputhing me all over the place, then I would terminate her account. However, I&#8217;ll do that right away, not when her domain is expiring. Her domain, that I bought and I paid for and I built the website on it for her. I change her layout and everything for her. Then she has the nerve to bad mouth me all over the place? Excuse me? That&#8217;s just not okay with me.</p>
<p>She calls me her best friend and her sister and tells me how much she loves me and all that crap, but if this is her idea of love, I&#8217;d love to see her idea of hate. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think that she has any idea what a friend or love is. Its more then just words. Its showing it too. She can&#8217;t do that. Wouldn&#8217;t dream of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried everything within my power to show her what she is doing to me is wrong. I&#8217;ve tried to explain it to her as clear as day and she just doesn&#8217;t see it. I&#8217;ve dropped all of the clues, given all the hints, even spelled it out for her. She doesn&#8217;t get it. She disagrees. She refuses to admit she&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>How can she lie to me like this over and over and over again? You don&#8217;t hurt the ones you love. Then she has the nerve to apologize later on! An apologize is a promise not to do the mistake again. She just does the mistake over and over again! So she breaks at least once promise every two weeks! I&#8217;m always catching her in one lie or another and she sees nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>I love her and I want to be her friend. I just wish that she knew what a friend was. Her idea of a friend is someone you never argue with and agrees with everything you say no matter how wrong it is. To me, that just sounds like someone who doesn&#8217;t care about you. Friends argue, that&#8217;s what makes their friendship stronger. If you can still be friends after an argument then that means you&#8217;re important to one another. I&#8217;ve never heard of real friends who never argued. I don&#8217;t see what kind of friendship that is.</p>
<p>Then the fact that her &#8220;friends&#8221; agree with everything she says. That just screams to me like they don&#8217;t care about you. If they cared, then wouldn&#8217;t they want to correct you? Why wouldn&#8217;t they tell you that you&#8217;re wrong so you can fix it? So you can succeed! If no one corrects you, how will you know its wrong? If you don&#8217;t know its wrong, what if its something bad? You get fired at a job, a career making job! Why wouldn&#8217;t your friends want to keep that from happening? Wouldn&#8217;t they want what&#8217;s best for you? Want you to succeed? As a friend, I always want my friends to succeed and do their very best. I never want to see them fail.</p>
<p>I, personally, try to never hurt my friends. She though, she does it on purpose and pretends that she cares when she really doesn&#8217;t. What she does hurts and she just refuses to take responsibility for any of that. I know, I should just leave her. But friendship means to always be by your friends side. It means to love them endlessly and hold their hand. It means to be their support and with them. It means to be loyal to them. No matter what they do.</p>
<p>I can honestly say that I have never, in my life, ever left a friend to fend for themselves. I&#8217;ve always been there for my friends. I don&#8217;t think any of them have ever really been there for me. She&#8217;s worse then that though. She&#8217;s always talking about herself and then she&#8217;s like &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m being selfish again, huh?&#8221; and its like like &#8220;what the fuck?&#8221;. She does that kind of crap all of the time. Its all about her. What kind of friend is that?</p>
<p>I should look for better friends, but I just can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m loyal and even though she&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m not going to break my promise. I&#8217;m not going to stoop to her level and betray her like she has me. I have pride and dignity. I love her and I won&#8217;t hurt her. Even if she does me. I would never betray her like she has me. I could never do that. Friendship means everything to me, even if it doesn&#8217;t to her.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just how I feel. I hope one day she&#8217;ll sit down and listen and change. I doubt she ever will though.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Shatter My Heart, Like Dishes On The Floor</title>

<description>My mum and I were talking the other day about my dad. As we spoke we were getting into what happened when I was a kid. it brought up a memory of when I was a little girl. I was like 5 years old but I still remember it so clearly.

Mum and dad were fighting again because she made dinner for him and he didn't eat it. He had come home late again because he was with another women, again. He told her to clean up the dirty dish and food and she didn't. She put it on the kitchen counter and left it there over night. She said that he could clean it up. It was his food and his dish. She made it, he could clean it up.

The next morning when he saw the dish he became enraged. Him and mum started yelling back and forth. Suddenly, he threw the dish on the floor. They started yelling more and he became more and more angry. He opened up the kitchen cabinet and started taking dishes out; plates and bowels and stuff. He started throwing them across the room and to the floor. I still remember the screaming and the shattering of glass.

I still remember as he picked up my favorite dish. It was a barney dish. It was my favorite and I know it sounds silly, but I still cry about that dish. It was special to me. It was something that made me happy. I still remember though as he picked up the dish and removed it from the cabinet. It was like slow motion as he threw it across the room. It fell with a shatter. I just remember staring. I can still feel the tears. I started screaming.

Mum said something like, &quot;Now you're breaking your daughter's things?! What did she do to you?!&quot; or something like that. I couldn't take my eyes off that dish. My dad fell suddenly quiet. I don't remember what happened next. All I could do was stare at the broken pieces of my dish.

I just remember going up to it and trying to pick up the pieces. But there was so much glass and so many pieces. It could never be put back together. I just remember crying. I remember staring at the pieces of my dish. It still haunts me. A silly dish like that, still haunts me. I still wake up some nights, the dream of the memory replaying again in my head. 

It was so many years ago, but I just can't forget it. I try to push it out of my mind, but it still makes me cry. I can't forget it. I can't get over it. I've tried. I guess its one of those things that I should just accept and move on, but I can't. I remember it to clearly and it effected me too much. 

It doesn't sound like much, it wasn't much, but it hit me deeply. It was like my heart was in the dishes that were being shattered. That's the best way I can put it. My heart was taken and throw across the room and shattered like the dishes on the floor. That's what it felt like. It still feels like that. Maybe one day that will change, maybe one day I'll get over it all, but right now, I don't think I can.</description>

<title>Converting to WordPress? Uh... Probably Not.</title>

<description>Well, I posted up a blog this morning. It's kind of personal though and I don't want that to be the first blog everyone sees. It kind of gives off the wrong impress. You know? So I kind of wanted to post another blog on top of it. You can go back and read it, I just didn't want it to be the first impress people got.

Anyways, I've recently grown very frustrated with my FanUpdate. The date in it is always wrong. I've tried changing my time zone offset, but it seems to always be wrong! The time in this thing is very right and its getting to the point where its pissing me off. I'm really starting to look towards something like WordPress, Habari, or Chyrp. The only problem is, I can't convert layouts to Habari ot Chyrp themes. :( So the only open option that I have, is to go with WordPress.

I mean, I like WordPress and I've become very familiar with it. I use it on many of my websites, no problem at all. Its just, this is a small blog. I don't want some big script on a small blog. I don't want to have to go through all the hell of moving everything over to WordPress either. :/ That just sounds like this huge pain in the butt. I've been pretty busy lately; swamped is more like it. So I just don't want to go through all that hell and crap. I just don't think its worth it. 

Worst of all, if I switch to another blogging platform like WordPress or otherwise, I'll have to convert all the layouts I use into themes. I'm really good at that, yeah, but its still time consuming and a huge pain in the ass. :/ I just don't have the patience for that, let alone the time.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I guess if I learned how to convert layouts into like Habari or Chyrp themes that would make a huge difference. It would give me some more options. I'm also open to learn Joomla and/or Drupal too. If anyone can teach, I'd really appreciate it! Any help would be great. I just need basic instruction. Tell me exactly what to do, where, and when, and I'll be good to go. :) Its still asking a lot though I guess. :(

I dunno. I really wish that I was better at self teaching. Lately though, I can't self teach myself anything. Its like my mind just isn't registering the information on its own. The doctor wants to do blood work and I'm just scared. Don't go telling me to just suck it up and face my fears either! I've heard enough of that! It doesn't work. :/ I guess I'm just in a battle where no matter which side you take, you're gonna lose.

Anyways. I need to stop with this depressing talk! If I continue it then I'll get all depressed again. I'm trying not to be so down all the time. I guess its time that I start taking my medications again. :/

You want what I just noticed? Even when I blog about nothing, my blogs are always super long. xD My blogs are always long and boring. I'm glad that people have been actually reading and commenting on my blog though. I've been getting quite a few blog comments lately. I just wish I was faster at replying to said comments. Lol Oh well. I'm getting a lot better. :) So yay!

PS. I finally reached 100 blog posts!!! :D Its only taken me like... two years! xD I suck. Lol

Vote for me by the way! :D</description>

<description>On twitter, I recently went through talking about this guy I am with. You can find his name on my twitter or you can ask me. In this blog though, I'm gonna call him Jack. So, he's like 40 years old. I've been with him for maybe 3 years. We were never officially dating and we're still not. For a long while though, I was the other woman. He was dating this woman, closer to her age and we were still having an on the side relationship. Like, we weren't dating. Our relationship was strictly physical. I hate to say that, because it sounds awful, but that's how it is.

Today, I realized how really upset it was. I kind of had a mental break down. I wasn't really thinking and I started talking about it to my twitter followers and friends. Well, Jack is my sexual relationship basically. He's a friend of my mum's and stuff. He's nice. He's got two kids though, a little boy and a little girl. His ex-wife has custody though. He's a good dad from what I've seen and that's great. I don't want you all getting the wrong impression. He's a great guy. I just feel like he doesn't respect me.

It seems like the only thing we talk about or do is sex related. I don't mind having a sexual relationship but I want to have a loving relationship too. I want to be respected and loved and cared about. He doesn't seem to have any of that. To me, it seems like he's just out for sex and that's it. I hate that part of our relationship. That's not what I want.

There was this one time. After him and I had sex, he sat down and he pulled me into his lap. He held me in his arms and gently caressed my arm. I leaned back against him. I felt so safe and loved. I wanted it to last forever. It didn't last though. He only held me like that for many a minute. Then he went back to whatever. I wanted to beg him to hold me again. I hated when that moment ended. I never forgot the way that felt.

Well, basically, I was just talking about how we only have a sexual relationship. I mean, my main problem with it is that it seems like that's all he wants; is sex. Its like he doesn't love or care about me or anything. He says he does, but it doesn't seem like that when we're sleeping together. He never talk about anything except sex and I hate that. I want him to talk about how much he loves me and cares about me. What he can do to make me happy. Maybe take me on a date or spend the day together without sex or without sex being mentioned. I would kill for that but it seems like that's not what he wants.

I mean, I feel like I'm not allowed to say no to him and his wants because he's been doing and is doing a lot for me and my mum. He's fixed out TV, my computer, my mum's computer and now he's fixing my laptop and our van. He's paying for it all out of his own pocket too. I feel like I can't say no to him. Like I owe him.

What I really hate about how he treats me is when he treats me like a kid. I'm old enough for him to have sex with but I'm not old enough for him to treat me like an adult? That's just like a huge insult to me. I hate that. I may not be as old as he is, but if I'm old enough for him to have sex with, then I'm old enough for him to treat me like an equal. he won't do that. To him, I'm just some sex object, like some porn star. I hate that! Don't treat me like a kid and then have sex with me! He's like contradicting himself!

So, after hours and hours of tweeting about this. I wasn't even paying attention. I just kept talking about him. I felt like I had so much to get off my chest. Earlier in the night, most of my friends had been criticizing me. Which made me feel even worse. Jack already made me feel low. But my friends weren't really helping it. They just made me feel worse. Like I was scum or some horrible person. :( 

Finally, to my shock, Georgina sent me a tweet. We spoke for a while and she really made me feel better. She made me feel like I had done nothing wrong. She made me feel like this wasn't all my fault. As much as I didn't want to admit it, she was right. She kept showing and telling me how he was wrong, how he wasn't treating me right. Even now, I really don't want to see or admit it, but I know that she is right. The way he is treating me isn't right and I deserve better.

After I long talk, I came to the conclusion that I need to take a step forward. I need to move away from his relationship and onto something better. I don't think that I'm ready to move away from him yet. I'm going to try though. She made me see that I do deserve something better; much better. Its all about taking the steps towards the future and not hanging around in the past. I deserve to be happy and this doesn't make me happy.

A few things that Georgina said that made me really stop and think was,


Would you rather be attached to someone who hurts you &amp; won't ever understand, or free &amp; stronger than you are now?  If you let go, you will already be stronger than before. Being strong means that you can face your fears. I would rather be alone than continually hurt. We'll never fly. :) That is what I believe. But freedom and being afraid is better than being hurt and being chained. :)

The future is near or far, but it's always there. Make every day better than the last.


She's right. I want to be free and just... face my fears! I don't want to sit here, chained up like a prisoner. I want to look forward to things, not worry about how things will turn out. So I'm not gonna break it off with Jack right away, but if things don't change, I'm going to definitely do something about it.</description>

I hate to say that, because it sounds awful, but that&#8217;s how it is.</p>
<p>Today, I realized how really upset it was. I kind of had a mental break down. I wasn&#8217;t really thinking and I started talking about it to my twitter followers and friends. Well, Jack is my sexual relationship basically. He&#8217;s a friend of my mum&#8217;s and stuff. He&#8217;s nice. He&#8217;s got two kids though, a little boy and a little girl. His ex-wife has custody though. He&#8217;s a good dad from what I&#8217;ve seen and that&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t want you all getting the wrong impression. He&#8217;s a great guy. I just feel like he doesn&#8217;t respect me.</p>
<p>It seems like the only thing we talk about or do is sex related. I don&#8217;t mind having a sexual relationship but I want to have a loving relationship too. I want to be respected and loved and cared about. He doesn&#8217;t seem to have any of that. To me, it seems like he&#8217;s just out for sex and that&#8217;s it. I hate that part of our relationship. That&#8217;s not what I want.</p>
<p>There was this one time. After him and I had sex, he sat down and he pulled me into his lap. He held me in his arms and gently caressed my arm. I leaned back against him. I felt so safe and loved. I wanted it to last forever. It didn&#8217;t last though. He only held me like that for many a minute. Then he went back to whatever. I wanted to beg him to hold me again. I hated when that moment ended. I never forgot the way that felt.</p>
<p>Well, basically, I was just talking about how we only have a sexual relationship. I mean, my main problem with it is that it seems like that&#8217;s all he wants; is sex. Its like he doesn&#8217;t love or care about me or anything. He says he does, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like that when we&#8217;re sleeping together. He never talk about anything except sex and I hate that. I want him to talk about how much he loves me and cares about me. What he can do to make me happy. Maybe take me on a date or spend the day together without sex or without sex being mentioned. I would kill for that but it seems like that&#8217;s not what he wants.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like I&#8217;m not allowed to say no to him and his wants because he&#8217;s been doing and is doing a lot for me and my mum. He&#8217;s fixed out TV, my computer, my mum&#8217;s computer and now he&#8217;s fixing my laptop and our van. He&#8217;s paying for it all out of his own pocket too. I feel like I can&#8217;t say no to him. Like I owe him.</p>
<p>What I really hate about how he treats me is when he treats me like a kid. I&#8217;m old enough for him to have sex with but I&#8217;m not old enough for him to treat me like an adult? That&#8217;s just like a huge insult to me. I hate that. I may not be as old as he is, but if I&#8217;m old enough for him to have sex with, then I&#8217;m old enough for him to treat me like an equal. he won&#8217;t do that. To him, I&#8217;m just some sex object, like some porn star. I hate that! Don&#8217;t treat me like a kid and then have sex with me! He&#8217;s like contradicting himself!</p>
<p>So, after hours and hours of tweeting about this. I wasn&#8217;t even paying attention. I just kept talking about him. I felt like I had so much to get off my chest. Earlier in the night, most of my friends had been criticizing me. Which made me feel even worse. Jack already made me feel low. But my friends weren&#8217;t really helping it. They just made me feel worse. Like I was scum or some horrible person. :( </p>
<p>Finally, to my shock, <a href="http://heartdrops.org/" target="_blank">Georgina</a> sent me a tweet. We spoke for a while and she really made me feel better. She made me feel like I had done nothing wrong. She made me feel like this wasn&#8217;t all my fault. As much as I didn&#8217;t want to admit it, she was right. She kept showing and telling me how he was wrong, how he wasn&#8217;t treating me right. Even now, I really don&#8217;t want to see or admit it, but I know that she is right. The way he is treating me isn&#8217;t right and I deserve better.</p>
<p>After I long talk, I came to the conclusion that I need to take a step forward. I need to move away from his relationship and onto something better. I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m ready to move away from him yet. I&#8217;m going to try though. She made me see that I do deserve something better; much better. Its all about taking the steps towards the future and not hanging around in the past. I deserve to be happy and this doesn&#8217;t make me happy.</p>
<p>A few things that <a href="http://heartdrops.org/" target="_blank">Georgina</a> said that made me really stop and think was,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Would you rather be attached to someone who hurts you &amp; won&#8217;t ever understand, or free &amp; stronger than you are now?  If you let go, you will already be stronger than before. Being strong means that you can face your fears. I would rather be alone than continually hurt. We&#8217;ll never fly. <img src="http://sugar-baby.org/blog/img/bunemo.gif" alt=":)" /> That is what I believe. But freedom and being afraid is better than being hurt and being chained. <img src="http://sugar-baby.org/blog/img/bunemo.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>The future is near or far, but it&#8217;s always there. Make every day better than the last.
</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s right. I want to be free and just&#8230; face my fears! I don&#8217;t want to sit here, chained up like a prisoner. I want to look forward to things, not worry about how things will turn out. So I&#8217;m not gonna break it off with Jack right away, but if things don&#8217;t change, I&#8217;m going to definitely do something about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>I Don't Wanna Share!</title>

<description>I saw a commercial today and it kind of got me into thinking. The commercial was about a mother giving her daughter her wedding dress. I idea was really nice and all, but I just kind of stopped dead and frowned. The idea made me think deeper, like sharing wedding days without relatives, friends, or national holidays. I really don't understand. Maybe I should explain.

My problem here is why would you want to share your special day with someone else? Why would you want to wear a dress that someone else did for their wedding? Wouldn't you want your wedding day to be remembered as YOUR wedding day? Wouldn't you want your dress to be remembered as YOUR wedding dress and not as your mother's or something?

When I get married I want to be looked at and I want people to see me and my wedding dress. I don't want them to see me and think of my mother and my mother's wedding. You know? I don't want people to see me like they did my mum. There's nothing wrong with that, but I want them to see me for me. I want them to see me as me and not as my mum. 

I want to be remembered as a beautiful bride. I don't want to be remembered as a beautiful bride who looked just like her mother. Sure, you can look different, but if you wear your mother's dress, they're going to think of your mother and your mother's wedding. I don't want that. When people think of my wedding, I want them to think of me, not be reminded of my mother. I want it it be my big day, not a memory of her big day. Does that make sense?

Its the same way with sharing your wedding day. I want it to be my wedding day. I don't want it to be over shadowed by anyone else! Like, getting married on Valentine's day, its romantic, but you have to share that day with everyone else. You can't celebrate an anniversary because everyone will be off with their lovers being happy and celebrating their own love. They won't be celebrating your wedding and your love and your anniversary.

If you share your wedding day with another friend, family, or whatever. Then you can't have them or shared friends/relatives come over to celebrate your anniversary. They'll be wanting to celebrate the other person's marriage and their anniversary.

I guess, I just don't understand. Why wouldn't you want your special day to be your special day? Why would you want to share it with anyone else? Don't you want it to be remembered as your day? Sure, you're going to share your special day with some hundred other people, but you don't know them. The chances of you meeting them are slim. So who cares? With your friends and family and holidays and all. Don't you want it to be just you and your love? Why would you want to share all that with someone else?

When I get married, whenever I do, I want to be me. I want to be remembered for me. I want my day to be for me. Not for my mother or for anyone else. Its my day, my special day, not someone else's. Call it selfish, but with how expensive weddings are, I want it to be remembered. Plus, its not like you can just keep repeating your marriage over and over and over again. No. You have one and that's it. (Unless you get a divorce, but we;re not talking about all that) So since you only get married once, might as well make it the best day of your life and make it the best day every year until the end! That's just how I see it and how I want it.</description>

<description>Last night at around 2:30am, I was getting ready for bed. As usual, I went to check on my hamsters before bed. I have three hamsters in two cages; Cracker, being at least 2 years old in one cage and then Freckles and Scratch, twins, in another, larger cage together. They were only about 7 months old. 

So when I didn't see both Freckles and Scratch I started looking. One of them, Freckles, was awake. hen I didn't see Scratch, I figured that he was just sleeping, as usual. So I wasn't real worried. I did want to check on them all though, because I do worry. I start blowing around int he cage, there was no movement. I figured, well maybe he's really asleep. I was starting to get worried though. I moved the cage a bit, shaking it lightly. I knew they didn't like that, but it usually got them to pop their heads out of the cage's puff that they like to bury themselves in. Still, there was no movement.

By this time, I was getting frantic and worried. I opened the cage door and moved Freckles out of the way, though he didn't like that. I started poking and digging at the cage's puff. Still no movement. I knew something was wrong. Finally, after about 3 or 5 minutes. I found him. He had died. Scratch was buried in his puff, like he loved, and he was dead.

I was up for hours after that, just crying with my mum. Was Scratch sick or something? I don't know. I'm not even exactly sure when he died. He was fine on Sunday. Then with this week, its just been crazy as hell. I've been trying to help Rachel, deal with this infection, fixing my netbook, etc. I'll admit, due to all this hectic crap, I just haven't checked on them like I usually did. Now I wish I had though. Lately I had been just glancing at them, not really checking.

I did get his body out and put it in a few bags. We're going to go up to Micheal's art and craft store as soon as possible. I'm going to get him a box and put him inside, like I should have done for Toast. I'm going to put little Scratch in the box, super glue it shut, and lock it. Then when we settle down somewhere permanently, I'm going to give him a proper burial. I can't bury him here, you're not allowed to dig up land that doesn't belong to you. The only place I could bury him around here is next to a highway. I'm not going to do that to him. So I'll put him in a box and keep him safe, like I should have done with Toast.

I just don't understand though. What was wrong with Scratch? He was only 7 months old. They had food and water and bedding. They weren't in an area that was too hot or too cold, so what happened? I don't understand. Now whenever I look at Freckles, I think of Scratch. They got along so well which is really rare for hamsters. Even if you buy them together, they don't usually get along for more then a few months. They got along great and now... Now Scratch is gone. I just don't understand why.

I keep going back into the the bathroom, expecting him to be there. I keep expecting to hear them playing, but I never do. I keep looking at the cage, expecting to see Freckles running on the wheel and Scratch digging endlessly in his food bowl upstairs. He's not there anymore though. I keep expecting and wanting and praying he will be, but he's not and he never will be. He'll be forever missed. I'm sorry, Scratch.

RIP
Scratch

<description>Hi guys.

I guess some of you are wondering where I have been for the past few days. I haven't been on twitter, replied to emails, replied to texts, or updated my blog here. Some of you have asked about it on twitter. Today, I got some IMs from you on my instant messengers. Well, I guess I have some explaining to do. Its pretty simple really.

It seems like everyone wanted me gone, so I left. Very simple.

For once, I needed to think about me and my feelings since no one else does. My feelings are the ones everyone forgets. Just like in school, just like at home. I draw abuse and I bring out the worst in people. I know. I know that. Its not my fault though and if I could stop it I would. I can't be blamed for things that aren't my fault anymore. I just can't take that abuse anymore. I have feelings, I really do.

For once though, I'm doing what is best for me. I'm tired of people cussing me out, attacking me, criticizing me, and then saying I started it. I'm not always to blame and everything is not always my fault. Yes, drama follows me everywhere and yes, i do get into fights, but they're not always my fault. I'm not always the one to blame. It takes two.

I just can't take it anymore. Those on twitter wanted me gone. So that's what I did. I left. I did what everyone always wanted me to do. As you can see though, my leaving twitter wasn't right either, because now everyone is worried or angry that I didn't say something. Nothing I do is right. If they were really sorry or really worried or even really cared, then why would they always bitch about me and complain about me being there? You can't have it both ways and I can't do both things. Its one or the other.

For once, I need to handle things and do what is best for ME. If they're sorry, let them be. They'll be more sorry if I end up dead, which is where this is quickly headed. I can't handle, mentally or emotionally, the abuse people put me through. Even my own friends. I just can't take the attacking or the abuse or the criticizing like this anymore. I have feelings, even if no one else believes that or thinks about it. At this rate, this is going to lead me to heart attack. I'm not being dramatic or kidding. I really can't take this anymore.

No, I don't back out of arguments. I can't. I really can't. I know logically, that they aren't person to person. You can just reply to the messages later. I can't though. I live in a life where its stand up and fight, or back down and die. When you back down in my life, that's it. Game over. There isn't a second chance. If I start backing down now, then that's it. I'll be dead. So I can't back down. I just can't. If I start baking down now, then everything that keeps my mind stable will break. I just can't. I have to go through something, all the way to the end. That's just how I've always lived.

I'm not strong enough to handle what you all want me too. I'm sorry. I do have feelings too. I can't handle all of the attacking, abuse, criticism, and blaming. Not everything is my fault. Cause because I'm at the center of it, doesn't mean its my fault. So next time, before you go blaming me and shit, TALK TO ME. I can explain things very nicely if you just ask.

I'm sorry, but I can't be everything that you want me to be.</description>

I have feelings, even if no one else believes that or thinks about it. At this rate, this is going to lead me to heart attack. I&#8217;m not being dramatic or kidding. I really can&#8217;t take this anymore.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t back out of arguments. I can&#8217;t. I really can&#8217;t. I know logically, that they aren&#8217;t person to person. You can just reply to the messages later. I can&#8217;t though. I live in a life where its stand up and fight, or back down and die. When you back down in my life, that&#8217;s it. Game over. There isn&#8217;t a second chance. If I start backing down now, then that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll be dead. So I can&#8217;t back down. I just can&#8217;t. If I start baking down now, then everything that keeps my mind stable will break. I just can&#8217;t. I have to go through something, all the way to the end. That&#8217;s just how I&#8217;ve always lived.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not strong enough to handle what you all want me too. I&#8217;m sorry. I do have feelings too. I can&#8217;t handle all of the attacking, abuse, criticism, and blaming. Not everything is my fault. Cause because I&#8217;m at the center of it, doesn&#8217;t mean its my fault. So next time, before you go blaming me and shit, TALK TO ME. I can explain things very nicely if you just ask.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t be everything that you want me to be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description>So, my day started out kind of crappy. I had to get up early with mum so that we could move money from one bank account to another. On our way back to the motel though, we had a cop stop us. He was really nice, but we got a ticket for dead vehicle tags. This is the second ticket we've gotten. Worst off, he took mum's license. :/ Which is really bad because now she can't drive. We can't get the tags fixed either because their in my dad's name and he refuses with a passion to help.

I think my dad just loves to make things more and more difficult for us. My dad is great, huh? Even worse, now that mum doesn't have her license, what are we gonna do? There's no one who can drive us around everywhere. :/ Mum has work and we have things that we have to do so that we can get out of this motel.

Plus, my dad won't even reply to my texts. I send him a text every few days, no reply, ever. He's not dead because people have seen and/or spoken to him. So it's obvious that he's just ignoring me. This is funny because he says that I don't ever try to keep in contact with him. He's the one who never calls back or replies to texts. He's such a joke. I hate to sound cruel, but I hope he drops dead. That way, I'll get every thing he own, including MY VAN. His death would just make my life so much better, you have no idea.

I do have some good news though! :3 Something really good that really just made my day!

Today, I was on twitter, like everyday. lol Well, I've been kind of down about the qbee. I was so tired yesterday and last night that I didn't get to finish my qbee stuff for the Great Bee*mee Derby. It was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. I had wanted to do more though. I was just too tired though. :( Seeing the qbee was making me sad, but I wanted to stay informed. They were announcing some new activities and I want to join them. Plus, I did want to be able to see who won the Great Bee*mee Derby and all. Sad or not, I wanted to see who did amazing, because they deserved it. :)

Well, I was posting an update to twitter and I needed to refresh the page. So I did. When the page finished loading, I saw a new tweet from the qbee. This tweet said that they had announced the May award winners. I just wanted to see who won so I went and checked it out. As I read down the page I saw my name. For a minute I was like, &quot;Must be someone else&quot; because I never win awards or anything. My number was there though. I still didn't believe it. So I clicked the link to the profile; to my profile. There was no doubt this profile was mine.

I just couldn't believe it. I still can't! I'm not done with the surprises either! As I looked over my profile, I saw that I had 2 awards, not just 1. So I stopped and went back to the page. I finished reading the page and sure enough, there was my name again. I had won not 1, but 2 awards. I just sat here shocked for like 15 minutes. I couldn't believe it!

The awards I won were for the Creative Quilt and the Just Because award. With the Just Because award the person who nominates you, must give a reason. The person said,


She's so cheerful and bubbly! When I sent in my trade request, she responded so quickly and was so friendly, I just felt that sort of enthusiasm deserves an award :9


This... this just made my day. No one has ever said anything so nice about me before. I'm almost crying. I'm so glad that I come off as a cheerful and bubbly person to people. That makes me so happy. I love being happy or letting people think that I am. When you come across a happy person, it makes you happy. At least, that's how its always been for me. I mean, I must have made him/her happy for them to have nominated me for this award. Its not winning the award that makes me happy. Its that I made an impression and I made someone happy enough to want to nominate me.

No one has ever said or done something so nice for me and seeing this, I can't even put this happiness into words. I'm just so... shocked and happy. There;s no words to describe how amazing this made me feel .When I say that this made my day, I mean it, 100%. I can't ever thank this person enough for their sweet words.

With all that said, I love both awards and I can't believe I won not 1, but TWO. I'm so happy! </description>

<title>When the Hole Gets Deeper</title>

<description>I blogged yesterday and now I'm blogging again today. Kinda strange isn't it? Well, today I actually have something to blog about. I'm not just blogging because I feel like it. Something happened this morning, something bad. So I'm kind of upset about it and I'm hoping that maybe venting here or talking about it here might help to make me feel better a little bit. I doubt it will because I'm really upset about this.

So, this morning, like every morning, I woke up and checked my cell phone. I always check it to see if there are text messages, emails, and to tweet. I do this in the morning just encase mum gets any important text messages or calls. Well, this morning, she did get an important text. It said &quot;House is under contract&quot;.

You see, on Tuesday or so, mum and I got a place that we could stay. It was at our friend Neal's house. He had moved and the house was empty. He had already been trying to sell it for a while. The sale wasn't going well. His mother and daughter were staying in the house so that the home owners insurance would still be valid. Well, he heard that we needed a place to stay and said that we were more then welcome to stay there.

The house was kind of small, but was really nice. Plus, it was a lot bigger then what we had now! We would only have to pay about $800 a month too. So it was like a dream come true! Too bad we woke up from the dream.

So Neal said that we could stay there until the house either sold or was put up in foreclosure. We were really excited because it would mean that we would be getting some real food! A real home! On Tuesday when we went there to see the place, we even dropped off a few things. We were getting ready to move in!

Today though, we got the email and found out, someone finally bought the house. We can't move in. Now we have to go back and get our things out of the place. I mean, we knew the place would sell, but we didn't expect it to happen over night. We all thought it would be at least a few months before that happened. Guess we were wrong.

We'll be going up this weekend to get our things and move them out. Storage is going up for auction too. Plus, we can't afford this motel any longer. So we'll be moving out of here. Living in the van... here we come.

People always say to be happy and be positive because things will get better, but they never do. Things never get better. The hole just gets bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper and there's no way out! How come everyone else can live in a home and eat and be happy and I never can? They say happiness comes to those who wait. I won't live forever. I can't wait forever. With me, you go to hell and you don't ever come back. I've never had happiness, so how long do I have to wait to leave this hell? Maybe I'll die and live in hell too. I bet you anything that's how it'll end.</description>
