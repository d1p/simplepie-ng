#OCCUPYWALLSTREET is a people powered movement for democracy that began in America on September 17, 2011 with an encampment in the financial district of New York City. Inspired by the Egyptian Tahrir Square uprising and the Spanish acampadas, we vow to end the monied corruption of our democracy … join us! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/OccupyWallStNYC?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;https://twitter.com/#!/OccupyWallStNYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://occupywallst.org/?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;https://occupywallst.org/&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;When I was little, the world was simple. But as a young adult, I&amp;#39;m learning that as we have to make choices--education, career, lifestyle--life gets more and more complicated. We are beginning to feel pressure to produce and be successful. We are learning a shortsighted way of looking at the future, focusing on four-year government terms and quarterly business reports. We are taught that economic growth is progress, but we aren&amp;#39;t taught how to pursue a happy, healthy or sustainable way of living. And we are learning that what we wanted for our future when we were 12 was idealistic and naive.&amp;quot; - SEVERN CULLIS-SUZUKI &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1003126%2C00.html#ixzz1Z4mJEBm9?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003126,00.html#ixzz1Z4mJEBm9&lt;/a&gt;

Its roots are directly linked to the Electro-funk sound of the early 1980s, pioneered by Afrika Bambataa &amp;amp; The Soulsonic Force and later on by UK-based musician Paul Hardcastle. The use of the Roland TR-808 sustained kick drum, raised dance tempos, and occasional sexually explicit lyrical content differentiate it from other hip hop subgenres.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;A star is a massive, luminous ball of plasma held together by gravity. At the end of its lifetime, a star can also contain a proportion of degenerate matter. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun, which is the source of most of the energy on Earth. Other stars are visible from Earth during the night when they are not outshone by the Sun or blocked by atmospheric phenomena. Historically, the most prominent stars on the celestial sphere were grouped together into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest stars gained proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized star designations.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;In an underground city of the future, sexual intercourse is outlawed and use of mind-altering drugs is mandatory. Narcotics are critical both in maintaining compliance among the city&amp;#39;s residents and also for ensuring their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks for long periods of time. The inhabitants worship a godlike being known as &amp;quot;OMM 0910&amp;quot;, with whom they commune in telephone booth-like areas known as &amp;quot;Unichapels&amp;quot;. - THX1138&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I Cant Stop till I reach the surface away from this dark underground.&amp;quot; Dj Chang&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.djchangbang.com?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;www.djchangbang.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;www.redbullmusicacademy.com&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;quot;Endurance (also called sufferance) is the ability for an animal to exert itself for a long period of time. In humans, it is usually used in aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The definition of &amp;#39;long&amp;#39; varies according to the type of exertion - minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can have a negative impact on the ability to exert strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect.&amp;quot;

This is a live recording of Dubtribe at The Legendary Afterhours club in Florida called Simons!&lt;br /&gt;Circa June 3, 1995 AD in the late 20th Century. Much love &amp;amp; respect to Dubtribe for all the great music &amp;amp; for bringing house music to a generation of ravers that were losing their souls. The energy continues as Dubtribe continues to perfrom live shows in 2011!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dubtribe.com/?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;http://www.dubtribe.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/16628005?utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cloudcast_description"&gt;http://vimeo.com/16628005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Dubtribe consisted of singers Sunshine Jones and Moonbeam Jones, but also included many sit in and &amp;quot;on tour&amp;quot; musicians over the years. Originally born in a rent party, Dubtribe Sound System distinguished themselves as performers by performing live for many hours, rather than replaying their recordings from dat tapes or portable computers, and touring without stopping, often bringing their own sound, lights, and traveling family with them..&amp;quot;

For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household. He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who does not take his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me. He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.” (Matthew 10:34-39 NASB)
