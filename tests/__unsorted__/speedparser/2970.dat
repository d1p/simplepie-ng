			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>• It was the 8th International Film and Multimedia Festival<br />
• Part of the World Congress on Safety and Health at Work in Istanbul<br />
• An event that only happens once every three years<br />
• There were <strong>232 entries</strong> from<strong> 30 countries</strong>.<br />
• On 14 September 2011, a jury of international health and safety professionals announced the winners and&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #f89838;">First prize went to: Giants of Leadership &#8212; the Nature of Safety, from Lattitude Productions.</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #f89838;"><a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/First-Prize-Sticker.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1732" title="First Prize Sticker" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/First-Prize-Sticker.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></span></p>
<p>It’s a ringing endorsement of Lattitude’s approach to safety training. We believe that, rather than telling people what’s good for them, it is better to inspire them to behave more safely. It seems like the jury at the World Congress on Safety and Health at Work agrees.</p>
<p>Excellent leadership skills are vital in organisations that aspire to a world-class safety culture. But it is hard to tell someone they are a poor leader. So Giants of Leadership takes a novel approach, moving away from the workplace and into the African savannah. There we find that elephants are, by nature, wonderful leaders, keeping those around them safe and healthy.</p>
<p>Viewers get to spend time watching spectacular footage of elephants &#8212; a refreshing change from many health and safety training sessions. In the process, they learn about the essential components of leadership:</p>
<p>•<a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/elephants.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-344 alignleft" style="border: 10px solid white;" title="elephants" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/elephants.gif" alt="" width="272" height="272" /></a> Respect<br />
• Leading By Example<br />
• Constant Communication<br />
• Caring<br />
• Consistency<br />
• Learning From Mistakes</p>
<p>The World Congress on Safety and Health at Work is held every three years and, since 1990, has included a festival celebrating the best films on the subject. Giants of Leadership &#8212; the Nature of Safety was among those entries shortlisted to be shown to delegates at this year’s World Congress and was awarded first prize at the end of the event.</p>

<p>Cost of bailing out Greece €109billion*</p>
<p>Cost of lost production because people cannot work owing to health or disability (EU annually): €3000billion**</p>
<p>But that is not the real story.</p>
<p>This is the real story of the cost of health and safety . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Shutdown-Front-Cover.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1711 aligncenter" style="border: 15px solid white; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;" title="Shutdown Front Cover" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Shutdown-Front-Cover-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="501" /></a></p>
<p>SHUTDOWN is a film about the financial and human costs of one accident at one factory. You can guess from the title how bad things get. But the real lesson is who pays. It&#8217;s not the insurance company. It&#8217;s the people who work at the factory and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0097d6;">The business case for health and safety</span></strong></h3>
<p>The film is a graphic illustration of how expensive accidents in the workplace can be. Owners and investors lose dramatically. But so do the people who work there. It even affects other companies: suppliers and customers have to cope with the consequences too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>For a business, for its people, a single accident can be devastating</h4>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a business that&#8217;s ticking along quite nicely, starting to make decent money and we&#8217;ve got a good working crew there, </em>says Toby Hill. <em>Suddenly, literally overnight, the place is gone.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Toby used to work in a company that employed 350 people and turned  over £24 million. One day there was an accident. They had had similar  accidents before. But this one resulted in a fire that burned the  factory to the ground. And the company ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Poor health and safety has enormous costs. But in this film we see the devastating consequences from one man’s point of view.</p>
<p>The costs of an accident are not covered by big business or insurance  companies. Mostly, it’s the people who pay. It’s lost wages. It’s lost  jobs. It’s lives ruined.</p>
<p>This film makes the business case for good health and safety. But it  also shows the human cost of getting things wrong. Here’s how it can  help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vivid demonstration that accidents have <strong>consequences</strong>: economic and personal</li>
<li>A convincing <strong>argument</strong> that good health and safety practices are crucial for <strong>good business</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>attitude changer</strong>: eliminate the false logic that because we’ve not had an accident yet, we won’t have one today</li>
<li>Understand that <strong>insurance</strong> doesn’t cover the worst effects of an accident</li>
<li>See how improving your approach to health and safety also improves <strong>business performance </strong></li>
<li>But that health and safety is also about <strong>job security </strong>and about people’s well-being</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an Aluminium factory wanted to imbue a safety culture that went beyond the workplace, it turned to a comic-strip hero.</p>
<p>Belgium has a long and prestigious association with cartoons. Herge’s boy detective Tintin is famous around the world, as are the squeaky-voiced Smurfs. But there are thousands of other characters that everyone knows locally. Comic books are part of the culture here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1616" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 287px"><a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/phew-we-got-away-with-it-again-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1616" title="phew we got away with it again" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/phew-we-got-away-with-it-again-2.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Phew! That was close. A Safety Bob poster campaign encouraging people to report near misses.</p></div>
<p>Now there is a new comic-strip hero. Safety Bob. This cartoon character is the idea of Claudia Eickhoff, the HSE Coordinator at Hydro Aluminium Raeren in south-east Belgium.</p>
<p>“Safety is the most serious subject,” she explains, “but we wanted a way of getting the message across that was not, itself, too serious.”</p>
<p>And the approach is working because Hydro Aluminium Raeren has, at the time of writing, gone 230 days without an accident. It has one of the best safety records of any Hydro plants around the world.</p>
<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 19px; margin: 40px;">“We have a vision that safety is not only something you do in the workplace”</h3>
<p>Safety Bob was designed by Dirk Vandriessche of Talking Circles and he has used the character to create lapel badges and t-shirts. There are Safety Bob safety posters and a big Safety Bob cut-out in reception. It’s all a lot of fun. But every time people see Bob, they are reminded of the serious message: look out for yourself and for those around you.</p>
<p>The idea for Safety Bob came to Claudia while she was watching Lattitude’s training film All For One &#8212; The Meerkat Way. Meerkats are adept at looking out for one another. They stay safe because they naturally work as a team and we humans do well to learn from them. Safety Bob is a Meerkat, so he reminds people that safety is about co-operation.</p>
<p>But this story isn’t a plug for Lattitude’s films &#8212; that’s not why we wanted  to tell it. What is inspiring is how Claudia and the team at Hydro have used Safety Bob to create a safety culture with the widest possible impact.</p>
<p>“This cartoon meerkat is a symbol of safety,” says Claudia. “He is approachable and interesting. Why? Because we have a vision that safety is not only something you do in the workplace.”</p>
<p>Claudia admits that if someone has an accident at home, it affects their ability to work. But there is more to it than that. People are safest when thinking about safety becomes part of their whole lives. It shouldn’t be something they turn on and off at the factory gates.</p>
<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 19px; margin: 40px; text-align: center;">“Now the children are pushing mum or dad to take care when they go to work”</h3>
<p>One day, Hydro’s MD had an idea. He gave every employee a copy of the meerkats film for Christmas so they could show it to their families. Now when the children see a Safety Bob t-shirt or lapel pin they understand what it means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1617" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 258px"><a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Reception-Bob-shows-days-free-of-accident-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1617    " title="Reception Bob shows days free of accident" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Reception-Bob-shows-days-free-of-accident-2.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="341" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Larger  than life Safety Bob (made in the plant from aluminium) welcomes people   at the factory’s reception and proudly displays its safety record.</p></div>
<p>“Now the whole family has a safe way of thinking,” says Claudia. “And the children are pushing mum or dad to take care when they go to work.”</p>
<p>Claudia knows the message is getting through at home. In a recent art competition for employees’ children at Hydro, there were several meerkat pictures.</p>
<p>And Safety Bob is helping the adults at work too. Each month there is a new safety theme and a poster to go with it. And because the posters are fun, people actually stop and read them.</p>
<p>In a recent employee safety questionnaire, responses on communication, learning and trust achieved close to a perfect score. It turns out that Safety Bob is doing a pretty good job.</p>
<p>The cartoon meerkat has made safety interesting and fun. That has spread the idea of a safety culture (where we all look out for one another) from the factory and out into the wider community. Thanks to Safety Bob, the comic-loving Belgians are thinking about safety at work with their colleagues, at home with their families, and everywhere in between.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 17px;">Inspiring stories</h3>
<p><strong>Communication, communication, communication and communication. These are the top four on Adrienne McKenzie’s list of priorities. And the SailSafe project manager at BC Ferries in Vancouver uses everything from workshops to a special intranet site to get the safety message across.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1506" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 354px"><a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Francesca-Sawyer-stands-beside-the-automatic-doors-2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1506" title="Francesca Sawyer stands beside the automatic doors" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Francesca-Sawyer-stands-beside-the-automatic-doors-2-1024x763.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Working safely again: Francesca Sawyer standing by the doors that she ensured operate correctly</p></div>
<p>But it is important to Adrienne that the message is a positive one. In too many organisations, health and safety has a negative connotation. Yet safety works best if everyone is involved and everyone feels good about doing it. So at BC Ferries they make a big fuss of the things they get right.</p>
<p>“It’s clear,” she says, “that everything we’ve accomplished so far has been a direct result of the commitment and involvement of all employees.”</p>
<p>SailSafe is a sophisticated programme designed to ensure passengers and employees of the ferry company stay safe. Getting everyone thinking and talking about safety is part of that. Among other initiatives, a system of alerts allows people to easily report concerns knowing that colleagues will take speedy action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has resulted in some big changes over the last few years, including better systems and improved reporting. But it is just as important for Adrienne that BC Ferries people celebrate the actions of individuals.</p>
<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 19px; margin: 40px; text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;A deckhand noticed how slippery and awkward it was to get into the ship’s rescue boats – he suggested a change</strong>&#8220;</h3>
<p>Francesca Sawyer, for example, works as a ticket agent for foot passengers in the Tsawwassen ferry terminal. She noticed that the automatic doors leading to the waiting area closed while people were still passing through. She was worried that a child or an elderly person might be trapped.</p>
<p>Francesca used the alert system to ask for an immediate check of the door sensor. In two shakes, a repair man was there. He adjusted the sensor and the risk of a passenger being hurt was removed.</p>
<p>A deckhand on the Skeena Queen also submitted an alert when he noticed how slippery and awkward it was to get into the ship’s rescue boats. He suggested a stepping stool chained to nearby railings.</p>
<p>The very next day, a senior officer was out looking at the problem. He decided there wasn’t room for a  stool, and that it might be a hazard in itself. Instead, he suggested converting a section of the railings around the rescue boat into steps. Between the two of them, they have reduced the chances of a sailor slipping and being hurt around a critical piece of equipment.</p>
<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 19px; margin: 40px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Inspiring-Stories-e1302257518354.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1479 aligncenter" title="Inspiring Stories" src="http://www.lattitudeproductions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Inspiring-Stories-1024x521.jpg" alt="Inspiring Stories" width="500" height="252" /></a>&#8220;<strong>BC Ferries has 23 different ways of communicating about safety – that’s how seriously they take it</strong>&#8220;</h3>
<p>But communication works both ways. By publicising these alerts and other safety successes, BC Ferries fosters a culture where people feel good about getting involved. When they read about others being celebrated for spotting hazards and preventing accidents, it helps them understand where safety problems may lie in their own working environment.  They see what they can do about them and, importantly, they feel happy to engage.</p>
<p>BC Ferries has 23 different ways of communicating about safety – that’s how seriously they take it. Bulletins, regular town hall meetings, newsletters, special noticeboards, websites – you name it, they’ve thought of it.  One of these is the Communicating the Wins Bulletin – dedicated to trumpeting the company’s thousands of safety success stories.</p>
<p><em>BC Ferries carries people and goods on 25 routes along the coast of British Columbia in Canada.  It began in 1960 as a two vessel, two terminal operation and has grown into one of the largest, most sophisticated ferry transportation systems in the world, with 36 vessels and 47 ports of call. <a href="http://www.bcferries.com/"><span style="color: #0097d6;">http://www.bcferries.com/</span></a></em></p>

<p>Professor Andrew Hopkins focuses specifically on the communication skills of safety leaders.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Mindful Leaders are acutely aware that the best of systems can fail,  even though auditors might be reassuring them that all is well. They  know that they need to go and undertake non-systematic auditing of their  own. In order to do so, Mindful Leaders need to be able to communicate  effectively with workers.</p>
<p>This program provides guidelines on face-to-face communication with  workers on site, and is suitable for supervisors and managers at all  levels.</p>
<p>The training package includes the main 16-minute  programme on DVD   and extensive support and training notes on an  accompanying CD-Rom.</p>

<p><strong>If you would like to preview the complete training package click on Request Full Preview (above right) and we will happily send one to you.</strong></p>
<p>Professor Andrew Hopkins identifies the key aspects of &#8216;Mindful Leadership&#8217; and illustrates how lapses in leadership contributed to the BP Texas City disaster.</p>
<p>Leadership is important because it is the leaders of an organisation  who determine its culture. This package is suitable for all management  levels, and illustrates how the participation, competency, training,  behaviour and attitudes of individual workers contribute to developing  the safety culture of an organisation.</p>
<p>The training package includes the main 24-minute  programme on DVD  and extensive support and training notes on an  accompanying CD-Rom.</p>

<h3 style="color: #0097d6; font-size: 17px;">Previewing: One For All &#8211; Teamwork The Meekat Way (HR Training)</h3>
<ul style="margin: 0 40px;">
<li>A memorable training tool</li>
<li>A strong message of teamwork</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you would like to preview the complete training package click on Request Full Preview (above right) and we will happily send one to you.</strong></p>
<p>The most powerful success factor for any organisation is how well its people work together. But bringing this idea to life for your people can fall flat, sounding like the same tired truisms.</p>
<p>All for one is a new film that blasts through the clichés to demonstrate the power of teamwork as a life-or-death skill set.</p>
<p>Beautifully shot by BBC crews in the Kalahari, All for one shows how  everyone’s favourite animals, meerkats, manage to survive against all  odds in one of the world’s most hostile environments.</p>
<p>Meerkats aren’t big, fast or venomous (like their predators). But  they continue to thrive because they work together better than almost  any other species. That’s what this film is all about.</p>
<p>All for one both teaches and motivates with its down-to-earth  demonstration of important teamwork principles. Participants will  clearly understand the value of team-oriented behaviours as the  following training points are highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of teamwork</li>
<li>The benefits of inter-dependence</li>
<li>Synergy</li>
<li>The importance of communication</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>DVD contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>“One For All – Teamwork The Meerkat Way” Main Feature</li>
<li>“The Furry Guide” Summary</li>
