</span>Naked sportbikes like the Ducati Monster or the Triumph Street Triple, but as a petite beginner, I need to start small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before I can tame the beast I must first try the babe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

"><span>Since I learned how to ride on a Honda CBR 125, I decided to go with the new 2011 CBR 250.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Honda  launched the 250 in the Canadian market this year and I was really  excited to check it out as I had contemplated purchasing the 125 but  felt I would outgrow it way too quickly.</span></div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/1070810.png?507" style="margin-top: 0;

">                 <span>I drove out to the Honda dealership in Mississauga, my heart pounding from the anticipation of seeing my future bike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The excitement quickly changed to disappointment when, at first sight, I realized they designed the new 2011 model for tall (average) riders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I still got on it, but couldn&rsquo;t even touch the ground with the tip of my toes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the 125 is the same design and since this model is new, lowering kits are not available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Why would Honda change the design and size of a beginner bike?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess the motorcycle market caters to taller riders and there is more $$ when you target that group especially when this new model is designed with VFR1200-style bodywork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the limited choice of sportbikes I can ride has just gotten smaller.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So upset by this setback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>The next choice on my short list is the Kawasaki Ninja 250.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many riders have told me that it&rsquo;s a great beginner bike and that many petite women own one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sounds promising.</span><br /><span></span>    </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/1636751.jpg?460" style="margin-top: 0;

">                 <span>I head to Kahuna Powersports and to my surprise they have a lowered Ninja on display in the showroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sat on it and was able to totally flatfoot it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually, it was a bit too low for me, so I sat on the standard Ninja and I was able to touch the ground with both feet at the same time!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, more on my tiptoes but that means I would only need to lower the back by an inch so the balls of my feet can rest comfortably on the pavement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>So the question now is&hellip;to Ninja or not to Ninja?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s October, if I&rsquo;m lucky, I may have a good two months of practice before storing the bike for the winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only downside with the Ninja is that it takes a bit longer to start in cold weather while the CBR is Fuel Injected and you just start and ride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I&rsquo;m not here to compare the two, my main concern is that I can physically ride the motorcycle and with that as my only criteria, the Ninja wins hands down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>So, I may be seeing you on the road soon with my brand new pearl white Ninja!</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From mid-second to M2]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/07/the-m2-challenge.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/07/the-m2-challenge.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2011 09:52:27 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/07/the-m2-challenge.html</guid><description><![CDATA[21 women, one single goal                 We all met on Thursday evening lea [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/2802916.jpg?513" style="margin-top: 0;

Some were drawn into riding by their companion, others were Vespa commuters needing a licence, while the rest, like me, have always wanted to ride and were tired of being a passenger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman sitting next to me admitted being here behind her husband&rsquo;s back while the girl in front revealed that her parents would disown her if she continued with this nonsense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is now a forbidden topic in her home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I, on the other hand, didn&rsquo;t tell my parents anything and when they called from overseas, I decided to tell them the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The response I got, in a thick Portuguese accent was: &ldquo;are you crazy?!&rdquo; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span>DAY 1</span></strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt nervous and excited at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All I could feel was the butterflies salsa dancing in my stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&rsquo;t shake the thought that this weekend would be a significant turning point on my journey to become a rider.</span><br /><span></span>   </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/7184910.jpg?322" style="margin-top: 10px;

</span>But as the day progressed, the blessing became our burden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Riding all geared up in the sweltering heat without a stitch of shade tested our endurance. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But as we were all pursuing our dream, a bit of sweat wasn&rsquo;t going to stop us.</span><br /><span></span> </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/1507991.jpg?502" style="margin-top: 10px;

">                 <span>Before we were even allowed to make our engines roar, we had to learn how to keep our balance and maneuver the bike while riding in neutral with a fellow rider as the engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Flashback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Me, four years old and my dad pushing me on my first &ldquo;big girl&rdquo; bike with only one training wheel.</span><br /><span></span>                  </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/1109162.jpg?473" style="margin-top: 10px;

">                 <span>The fun began when we were finally able to start our engines and learn how to ride with the clutch in the friction zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One thing I didn&rsquo;t expect was to feel pain in every muscle in my hands, muscles I didn&rsquo;t even know existed started screaming at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No pain, no gain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I pushed forward.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Not until we finally started learning how to shift up to second and then third and back down to first did I finally feel like a confident rider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course my gear shifting wasn&rsquo;t as smooth as I would have liked but with time and practice I&rsquo;ll get better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>All was great until my boots decided to fall apart on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They just couldn&rsquo;t hold up the heat and stress I was putting them through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not surprising since these were fashion boots I bought in Italy 10 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank god for duct tape!</span><br /><span></span>   </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/2702791.jpg?329" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; border-width:1px;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"></div></div></div><div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; ">                 <span>Back in the game, I decided to try one of the Suzuki cruisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As low as it was, I found it difficult to wrap my legs around the engine to reach the back brake and gear shifter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lounging back was such an uncomfortable sitting position and I felt I had less control over the bike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This just confirmed that I&rsquo;m definitely a sports bike girl rather than a cruiser gal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Sitting on the sports bike again, we were now taught push steering and how to maneuver curves while keeping the speed at about mid-second gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I found it difficult to maintain that speed and itched to go faster but there were a lot of slower riders in front of me and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to surpass them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Day one wrapped up and the main lesson I took away is to always look where you want to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once you do that, the bike will follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So rule of thumb, never look down!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When you do, the bike goes down with you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So yes, there were quite a few dropped bikes but I always kept my gaze ahead and my bike upright.</span><br /><br />                 <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span>DAY 2</span></strong>  <br /><span></span><br /><span></span><span>The butterflies still came out to play but this time they were dancing a slow tango.</span><br /><span></span>   </div><div ><div style="text-align: center;"><a><img src="http://i-want-to-ride.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/2763619/6782804.jpg?514" style="margin-top: 0;

">                 <span>In the morning we applied everything that we learned the day before within a traffic-simulation course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The course was quite small and really didn&rsquo;t live up to the real road experience but there was 21 of us riding so we really needed to stay alert and aware of our surroundings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Emergency braking was next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is done by doing a lot of things at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You must remember to ease off of the throttle while simultaneously squeezing the front break and clutch and pushing down on the back break while down-shifting to first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It sounds more complicated than it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Always good to practice emergency breaking in a deserted parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>In the afternoon we learned collision avoidance through practicing three different techniques: assertive braking (as taught in the morning), swerving with push steering, and quick acceleration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Push steering is where you push the handlebars down in the direction you want to go while quick acceleration is basically accelerating from low/mid-second gear to high second gear to avoid a collision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course this applies to any gear you&rsquo;re travelling in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As each minute passed I felt more confident and anxious to get on the road with my own bike.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Late afternoon was the M2 test, the dreaded moment that had overshadowed our thoughts all weekend. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>We practiced the test course for a good 45 minutes while maintaining a speed of mid-second gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The day before was the only time we were able to shift up to third but that was just to practice gear shifting and we really didn&rsquo;t ride much in third.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>High speeds weren&rsquo;t reached but this course was all about learning the basics and being able to maneuver the bike so I didn&rsquo;t mind staying at the speed limit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>The more I practiced, the more I felt confident but once the actual examination started, all I could hear was the pounding of my heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It didn&rsquo;t help that Sunday was an even sunnier and hotter day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were practically melting!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>There were six tests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first one consisted in us maneuvering a tight curve while riding in the friction zone and then speeding up to mid-second on a wide curve and finally coming to a complete stop with the front wheel within a chalked-off box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn&rsquo;t seem too hard but the course was drawn out on the ground and you had to ride within it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not to mention, the riding area was quite narrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All this while making sure you get to the right speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>The second test was the same wide curve but this time you just needed to shift up to mid-second gear and come to a complete stop on the opposite side with the front wheel in the box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately one of the riders fell at the end of this part and automatically failed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pretty heartbreaking to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Note: dropping your bike at any time during the test is an automatic failure.)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Test three: emergency braking. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>We had to build up our speed within a short distance to mid-second (the bench-mark speed for the entire weekend) and then apply the emergency braking technique that we learned that morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All this without anticipating the stop so you must ride at full speed until the instructor signals you to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For this test, we were allowed a second try if we didn&rsquo;t reach mid-second gear speeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Test four was on the same course and we were tested collision avoidance through our push steering skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Same as test three, we built up our speed riding in a straight line until the instructor motioned which way to swerve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the latter test, we were also allowed a second try here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Test five, how to maneuver a curve, cause we all know the best riding is on those beautiful winding country roads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here we needed to maintain our speed coming into the curve positioning the bike on the part of the road that gives us the best view of the road ahead and then quickly accelerate out of the curve into the straightaway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I risk sounding repetitive here, but again we needed to make sure we did this test within the proper timelines by maintaining a mid-second gear speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Finally the last test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here we had to gradually brake on a curve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We speed up into the curve and then come to a complete stop with our front wheel in the appropriate box and our gaze straight ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After completing all of the previous tests, another female rider fell on this last course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was even more disheartening to see but at least both could re-take the test the following week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Personally, I believe if you are unable to keep the bike up then you&rsquo;re not ready to ride on the road along with other traffic, right?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Better to be fully prepared and always remember to drive defensively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>I completed each test with ease and by the end was confident I had passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>We all peeled off our gear and beelined it towards some shade while awaiting the results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>One after another, I saw my fellow female riders return to the group with huge smiles on their faces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those smiles spoke volumes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I, in turn, followed suit with my own huge smile and was over the moon that I only accumulated 3 bad points in total!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>For my first encounter on a motorcycle, I wanted to experience it with other fellow female riders and since there is only one weekend in the entire season dedicated to women, I needed to book in advance to ensure a spot. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>I had all the time in the world to get my M1 and the proper gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I now find myself one week from the training course with only the M1 in hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of that, there is a lengthy list of recommended safety gear that each student must have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Visit <a title="" href="http://www.ridertraining.ca/gear.html">http://www.ridertraining.ca/gear.html</a> for the complete list.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Time is running out and I must buy my gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I ventured to Studio Cycle located at the Junction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The moment I stepped into the store I felt like a little girl in a big kid&rsquo;s world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was definitely out of my element.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully there was a sales clerk ready to help me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>&ldquo;So what are you looking for?&rdquo; he asks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>&ldquo;I need a helmet.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, something that&rsquo;s not too expensive as it will be my first helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And since I&rsquo;m a beginner maybe I should get a full face helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What do you recommend?&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>&ldquo;Everyone here in the store are seasoned riders and we all wear a full face helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus we want to get you something that you can wear for a very long time, beginner or not.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>He shows me a bunch of helmets. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Prices start at $229.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Way more than I thought I would pay for a helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But of course, safety comes first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>I try one after the other. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>First a full face HJC helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The XS is slightly loose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I try a HJC flip-up helmet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This one fits perfectly but the style is questionable. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m unsure what to do or what to buy, all I can think about is that I need a helmet, by next week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the sales clerk informed me that they rent out gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My eyes light up and I jump all over it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>They rent helmets, gloves and jackets for $75 and that total can then be credited towards any future purchases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can&rsquo;t get a better deal than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Problem solved!</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <span>Since the stress level of finding the proper gear subsided, I decided to try the Arai helmet for kicks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wow, what a difference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I fell in love, with the helmet but not the price tag. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I must say though, I&rsquo;m definitely not ruling out a future Arai purchase and it may be sooner rather than later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />            <span>I'm just thankful that I can rent the gear and learn how to ride a motorcycle before I have to actually financially invest in anything.&nbsp; Check Studio Cycle out </span>(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.studiocyclegroup.com/">www.studiocyclegroup.com</a>), you won't be disappointed.<font size="1"></font> </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The M1 Experience]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/05/the-m1-experience.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/05/the-m1-experience.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2011 10:12:05 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/05/the-m1-experience.html</guid><description><![CDATA[                 I decided to finally write the M1 knowledge test.&nbsp;

">                 I decided to finally write the M1 knowledge test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All week I studied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I read the Official MTO Motorcycle Handbook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I read Chapter 2 &ldquo;Safe and responsible driving&rdquo; and Chapter 3 &ldquo;Traffic signs and lights&rdquo; of the Official MTO Drivers Handbook and the night before I completed the Motorcycle&rsquo;s Permit Study Guide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span></span>I feel prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am ready.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  So Saturday morning I make my way to the DriveTest Centre in Etobicoke, one of the few that are open on Saturdays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My plan was to quickly do the written test and then head to my hair appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Boy was I na&iuml;ve to think I would be able to complete everything within an hour!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I suggest to free up your day and have no other commitments when you go to a DriveTest Centre as you will be there for at least three hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  So after waiting an hour, I realize I must leave or I won&rsquo;t be able to make my hair appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Disappointed with myself, I leave without having accomplished anything and decide to give it a second attempt in the afternoon.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Take Two.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  I line-up once again, in that original queue that leads to the Help Desk so that I may be assigned a number.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  As I sit down waiting for my number to be called, I look around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the DriveTest employees are moving in slow motion while everyone else is in a state of confusion. No one knows where to go, which counter to approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not clear that you must first go the Help Desk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  A108.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My number!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally &ndash; after two hours!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do my vision test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last series of numbers are practically illegible, but I pass the test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am then given the paperwork allowing me to do the knowledge test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  I make my way to the Test Writing room; I take a seat, and am given the test. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>One section of the test is questions taken from the Motorcycle Handbook, and the other two sections are questions about road signs and rules of the road taken from the Drivers Handbook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are also questions about G1 and G2 that I didn&rsquo;t prepare for!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That really caught me off guard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  I went into that test feeling confident but after all those G1 and G2 questions my confidence fell apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I shakily hand in my test and anxiously await the results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  My name is called and I nervously approach the front of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Congratulations Cecilia&rdquo;, here&rsquo;s your M1 licence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I passed, I passed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I ask how I did and apparently I just barely passed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each section has 20 questions and you are able to make four mistakes for each section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the motorcycle section I got 20/20, the road signs section 17/20 and the rules of the road section 16/20.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One more mistake in the latter section and I would have failed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So my advice to you all is&hellip;prepare for G1 and G2 questions!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span>So after three and a half hours I leave the DriveTest Centre with my M1 licence.&nbsp; Mission accomplished.&nbsp; I'm so happy and excited; I can't wait to start riding!&nbsp; I think, in the meantime, I may rent a 120cc Scooter so that I can get practice in riding on the streets of Toronto.&nbsp; I've never ridden a motorcycle and before I hop on one I think it's best that I take a Motorcycle Basics training course.</span> </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spring Time]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/04/spring-time.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/04/spring-time.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2011 08:40:37 -0800</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://i-want-to-ride.com/1/post/2011/04/spring-time.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Spring has finally arrived, even though it hasn't felt too springy these past couple of weeks.&nbsp;

</span>So I hit the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br /><span>I come across the Motorcycle Basics website (<a title="" href="http://www.motorcyclebasics.com/">www.motorcyclebasics.com</a>) and it lays out the steps I need to take in a pretty simple way that even a novice like myself can understand.</span><br /><br /><span>The website states that in order to get a motorcycle </span><span>licence</span><span> in the Province of Ontario (where I currently live), one has to go through the Graduated Licensing System.<span>&nbsp; </span>This system consists of three classes: M1, M2 &amp; M.</span><br /><br /><span>What?!!<span>&nbsp; </span>M1, M2 &amp; M?? <span>&nbsp;</span>I didn&rsquo;t have to do that when I got my driver&rsquo;s </span><span>licence</span><span>!!<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh yeah, but I got my G </span><span>licence</span><span> when I was 16!!<span>&nbsp; </span>;)</span><br /><br /><span>Anyhow, the M1 test can only be taken at the Ministry of Transportation so I visit the </span><span>Ontario Ministry of Transportation website (<a title="" href="http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/">www.mto.gov.on.ca</a>) to understand what I need to do to get my M1 </span><span>licence</span><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>Wow so much information!<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m glad I visited the Motorcycle Basics website first!!<span>&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br /><span>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the best starting point is to buy the Official MTO Motorcycle Handbook.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once I get the theory out of the way I&rsquo;ll go in for my written test and get my M1 </span><span>licence</span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The M1 </span><span>licence</span><span> is valid for 90 days but I must have it for a minimum of 60 days before I can obtain my M2 </span><span>licence</span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br /><span>Then the next step is to take a M2 Motorcycle Safety course (or some Motorcycle basics course).<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems I can take this course anytime once I have obtained the M1 but will need to wait the full 60 days before </span><span>bringing the paperwork to the ministry to obtain an M2 </span><span>licence</span><span>. <span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Sounds pretty straightforward.<span>&nbsp;

</span>In 2004 I started small with the purchase of my first scooter &ndash; a 50cc Piaggio Liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not much power, but after my friend &ldquo;re-worked&rdquo; it, this puppy would go up to 80km!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still not a powerful scooter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>I miss that little scooter&hellip;well not so little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did tip over a couple of times and needed help to get it back up!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On second thought&hellip;what am I thinking?!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t ride a motorcycle!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What if I tip over?!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No no no, squash that thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's time, I can do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>I&rsquo;m tired of sitting in the back of someone else's motorcycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to be in control!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to ride!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if I tipped over with my Piaggio Liberty, how will I be able to handle a motorcycle?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m only 5&rsquo;1&rdquo; and 110lbs and when I tell people I want to ride a motorcycle they all chuckle!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>So now on cue my inner voice steps in and says, &ldquo;Come on Cecilia, when have you ever backed down from a challenge?!&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>That&rsquo;s right!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you know what, when I first purchased that scooter six years ago I was so scared to ride but I didn&rsquo;t let that fear take over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s kind of the same fear I feel now with motorcycles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fear mixed in with anticipation and excitement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>When I first started riding my scooter I didn&rsquo;t even take any official training lessons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just got on and started to ride in the crazy streets of Florence, Italy!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So if I was able to do that, then why shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to ride a motorcycle?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br />  <span>One might argue that a scooter is smaller and slower and automatic while a motorcycle is bigger, faster and has gears!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Semantics I tell you!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can do it, I can do it, I CAN DO IT!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just need to start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stop thinking about it and just do it!</span> </div>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
