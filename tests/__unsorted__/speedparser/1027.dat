I&amp;#39;m sure you could guess as much from [my &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; list](http://readernaut.com/matthewwithanm/books/finished/). What you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t guess is how I found myself racing through the story of Jordon Scott (a gay ex-Latter Day Saint whose mother is falsely accused of murder), ravenously anticipating the next chapter in the saga of Ann Eliza—Brigham Young&amp;#39;s real-life 19th (or so) wife. It&amp;#39;s not that the murder of Jordan&amp;#39;s father—a member of a polygamous LDS splinter group—isn&amp;#39;t interesting; it&amp;#39;s just that the characters Ebershoff creates have no hope of competing with those that reality has conjured up. Jordan, his runaway sidekick, his wonderful boyfriend, Kelly Dee, and almost everybody this side of the 20th century, feel a little flat. However, through the use of fictional primary sources, Ebershoff brings each and every one of his historical characters to life. Ann Eliza (who nearly comes off as a skeptic superhero) and Brigham Young (a fantastic villain) are, of course, overwhelming presences, but their whole world is captivating. (I should add here that I may be overstating Ebershoff&amp;#39;s characterization of these two. I&amp;#39;m predisposed to regard any man who claims he&amp;#39;s talking to God—and that God wants him to have sex with a whole lot of women—as a scoundrel.) Thankfully, we never have to wait very long to return to it and our forays back into the present—even if they don&amp;#39;t quite measure up—serve to whet our appetite for more drama in the Beehive House.

Read this book. Not for the puzzle or thrills of a murder mystery, but for the amazing story of Ann Eliza and the people who, only 150 years ago, followed a bunch of horny old men to Utah because they said they spoke to God.</title><link href="http://readernaut.com/matthewwithanm/notes/22452/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://readernaut.com/matthewwithanm/notes/22452/</id><summary type="html">I love murder mysteries; history mostly leaves me cold.

Having read &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;[Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?](http://readernaut.com/books/156584677X/)&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; (an analytical work about &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd](http://readernaut.com/books/B000FC12YQ/)&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;), I already knew the details of the plot.  Even so, the way in which the author unwound them was great.  Much darker than many of Christie&amp;#39;s books, &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Endless Night&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; was also [one of her favorites][1]; I can see why.  With its fantastic (and daring) pacing, &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Endless Night&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; really stands out against the backdrop of Christie&amp;#39;s canon.

I&amp;#39;d been making my way through [Breaking the Spell](http://readernaut.com/books/0143038338/), but my interest was petering out and I found myself really wanting to dive back into some juicy fiction when our trip to Cleveland snuck up on us this past weekend.  &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Man in the Brown Suit&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; seemed to be the most blissfully brainless book on my &amp;quot;Plan to Read&amp;quot; list, so I bounced over to ebooks.com and grabbed it.

The story doesn&amp;#39;t include either of Christie&amp;#39;s famous detectives, but it&amp;#39;s familiar enough: a young girl goes looking for adventure…*and finds more than she bargained for*(!)  I&amp;#39;ve read more than one of these books (Christie has written several and Kathleen Norris&amp;#39; &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Mystery House&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; was in the same mold) and always find them amusing despite myself.  They always include passages like this one:

&amp;gt; I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, ‘Edgar says—’ And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her  married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other.

How downright progressive that must have seemed in 1924!  Of course, our heroine eventually lets us know what she—and all women—want: a man to boss her around.

&amp;gt; ‘And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of someone she does like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it…Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be.’

Unlike lesser protagonists of similar books, though, Anne Beddingfield backs up her observations of human nature with hard science:

&amp;gt; &amp;#39;They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another, that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same—one feels the same, I mean—and that is why women worship physical strength in men: it’s what they once had and have lost.’

Alright, alright. So maybe hilarious, outmoded gender stereotypes in a book written in 1924 aren&amp;#39;t that surprising.  I&amp;#39;ll end my digression.

Even though it doesn&amp;#39;t include Poirot or Marple, &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Man in the Brown Suite&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; does have one familiar character: Colonel Race! Having read all of the other books in which he appears, I was a little spoiled; he couldn&amp;#39;t very well go about solving murders with Poirot after being arrested for one at the end of this adventure.  Still, his appearance is an Easter egg for Christie fans, reminding us of the shared universe of her characters.  The book&amp;#39;s format is also fun—it alternates between the first-person account of the protagonist and excerpts from the diary of another character, foreshadowing the author&amp;#39;s later experiments with the genre.

As far as describing the heartiness of my recommendation, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll bother this time.  &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Man in the Brown Suite&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; is certainly not one of Agatha Christie&amp;#39;s most famous works and by the time you&amp;#39;ve made your way to it, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll already have a good idea of what you&amp;#39;re in for. I did, and got just what I wanted.</title><link href="http://readernaut.com/matthewwithanm/notes/22279/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://readernaut.com/matthewwithanm/notes/22279/</id><summary type="html">Thanks to my recent forays into Python and Pokémon (not to mention a crapload of Columbo DVDs I got @maybeorange for Christmas), I've been on an astounding dry spell as far as reading goes.
