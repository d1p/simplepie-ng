<p>In November 2010, US based FirstBank <a href="http://www.tdaboulder.com/projects/view/id/105">installed a number of signs at Denver International Airport with integrated QR codes</a>. The general public were invited to take a photo of the codes with their smartphones, after which free goodies (such as ebooks, crosswords and sudoku puzzles) would be unlocked. There are 12 different ebooks available for download and FirstBank estimates that 7,000 books and puzzles will be downloaded throughout the five-month campaign.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s like the <a href="http://heymans.org/2011/03/brilliant-use-of-a-qr-code-on-a-resume/">QR Code resume</a> or that creepy QR Code project that makes <a href="http://www.qrdresscode.com/article-les-qr-codes-accompagnent-la-reflexion-65998534.html">the dead talk</a> but with a tattoo. Now who&#8217;ll be the first to do NFC implants to do something similar, that could get you some extra followers on Twitter now wouldn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/f3qv2dSXQXk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/f3qv2dSXQXk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>As you can see, when the tattoo is scanned the phone loads a Youtube video that animates the tattoo when the phone is properly aligned. This looks simpler that it actually is as there&#8217;s some careful scaling and measuring work that needs to be done in order to do this properly.</p>
<p>Major hat tip to Paris tattoo artist K.A.R.L from the <a href="http://www.mysterytattooclub.com/">Mystery Tattoo Club</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never get one by the way, although I do find this one pretty tasteful. Would you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are my QR Code business cards.</p>
<p><img src="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/QR-Code-business-cards.jpg" alt="a set of QR Code business cards from Bert Heymans, on the front there&#039;s a big QR Code with a pixel dude that looks like Bert, and on the back there&#039;s written info and a small QR Code" title="QR Code business cards" width="400" height="266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-652" /></p>
<p>If you want to make your own and could use some advice? Be sure to check out <a href="http://heymans.org/2011/03/qr-code-mashups-for-everyone/">my presentation on QR Code Mashups</a>. Get them printed at <a href="http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=2562&#038;id=120532" target="_blank">moo.com</a> just like I did. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
<p>The small QR Code on the back is a link to <a href="http://jumpscan.com/heymans" rel="nofollow">jumpscan.com/heymans</a> a mobile profile website that looks good on a mobile phone. You can find a bunch of personal info about me there and you can download a vCard (v3.0) too.</p>
<p>The big QR Code is a v2.0 vCard; it contains all my essential contact information but doesn&#8217;t include a picture nor my online resources but it works without an internet connection, very handy for people who don&#8217;t have a data plan yet.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious, that pixel guy was created by <a href="http://www.veryimportantpixels.com/" rel="nofollow">Very Important Pixels</a> and I ordered the regular business card size with a business card holder at <a href="http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=2562&#038;id=120532" target="_blank">moo.com</a> using their custom design upload tool.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, I&#8217;m working on business card Photoshop templates specifically for QR Code business cards and a tutorial on how to customize them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the most comprehensive QR Code infographic I&#8217;ve come across up to now. It&#8217;s a great <strong>barcode marketing breakdown</strong> and deals with picking the right barcode marketing solution, elaborate growth statistics and real world brand use. </p>
<p>As usual scroll down to the bottom for my summary and comment. Be ready for a big scroll, this infographic is 4320px long <img src='http://heymans.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  Thanks for the guys at <a href="http://theawesomeblog.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Awesome Blog</a> for making it.</p>
<p><a href="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/QR-Code-Infographic-Technical-900.jpg"><img src="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/QR-Code-Infographic-Technical-600.jpg" alt="a very big infographic on the subject of QR Codes, dealing on some technical details, it&#039;s spread and fortune 50 companies using the technique" title="Barcode, QR Code, Spyderlynk, Microsoft tag and Jagtag Infographic Technical" width="600" height="4320" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-645" /></a></p>
<p>I learned something interesting here. If you&#8217;re looking for the right barcode technology for your marketing campaign let&#8217;s consider the reason for looking at the alternatives to QR Codes with a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>is your target audience more likely to use <strong>MMS</strong> rather than Mobile internet?</li>
<li>will the target audience be <strong>unlikely to have a barcode scanner</strong> (for QR Codes or Microsoft tags)? or will it be hard to install one for them?</li>
<li>are you <strong>willing to pay</strong> for generating the barcodes?</li>
<li>do you really need to have <strong>your logo</strong>, fully uncluttered <strong>on the barcode</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered <strong>positive to all these questions</strong> you can consider <a href="http://www.spyderlynk.com/how-snaptags-work" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SnapTags</a> as an alternative. That&#8217;s what the infographic says and I wholeheartedly agree. The way <a href="http://www.spyderlynk.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SpyderLynk</a> works is by sending a picture of the logo over to their services and returning you marketing message in the response. Works great to reach people with even basic phones, but you&#8217;ll make them pay for MMS and their phone should be set up for it too.</p>
<p>I can tell you right off the bat that MMS will not work in Belgium, the operators do a lousy job at supporting the technology and it&#8217;s horribly expensive. That said, it might work in other countries, I can imagine that it&#8217;s a different landscape in America and Asia, but I doubt other parts of Europe. As far as my research has told me using QR Codes is your best bet to reaching the most people at this time.</p>
<p>Other things to learn from the infographic:</p>
<ul>
<li>from a publisher standpoint each type of barcode can provide the same kind of services for tracking</li>
<li>30-40% of all smartphone users have downloaded a barcode scanning app</li>
<li>barcode scanning was a huge hit during the holiday season, accounting for 57% of the tracked scans in 2010</li>
<li>main target markets are grocery and personal care products (figures most peopel scanning are women)</li>
<li>barcode marketing isn&#8217;t for targeting children (for now), 30% of the people scanning are aged 35-44</li>
<li>most people scanning barcodes have a reasonably high house hold income</li>
<li>industry leaders have chosen QR Codes as their preferred barcode marketing solution</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion that popularity of barcode scanning during the holiday may be based on an aberration, the numbers are based on the 2010 holiday season and late in that year QR Codes started trending heavily, so the conclusion is probably based on a coincidence. The next holiday season will tell, but I predict another spike around that time. I&#8217;ll be sharing more of my personal research in the near future so stay tuned and <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=heymans&#038;loc=en_US" rel="nofollow">subscribe to the newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been out of blogging for a few weeks as I started my new job at <a href="http://Agency.com">Agency.com</a> a part of <a href="http://tbwa.com/">TBWA</a> as Project Manager, managing digital project. And what better way to start again than with this nice QR Code infographic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The video recording of the presentation on <a href="http://heymans.org/2011/03/qr-code-mashups-for-everyone/">QR Code Mashups</a> I gave at <a href="http://barcamp.be">Barcamp</a> has become <a href="http://barcamp.be/bca5/bert-heymans/">available</a>. If you&#8217;re planning on using QR Codes in the slide deck of your next presentation, please read on, you&#8217;re bound to learn something.</p>
<h3>What to look out for when using QR Codes in your slides</h3>
<p>Some elements of a good presentation experience are really in the details, here are my lessons learned when using QR Codes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>contrast is king</strong>, big black QR Codes on a white background work best</li>
<li>if you can, <strong>maximize the redundancy</strong>, especially if you&#8217;re planning to do something arty with your code (that&#8217;s &#8220;level H error correction&#8221; in QR Code lingo)</li>
<li>as mentioned in the presentation, <strong>don&#8217;t invert and don&#8217;t transform</strong> (e.g. no skewing or tilting the image)</li>
<li>when using a QR Code as a link to online content, add <strong>a short URL</strong> at the bottom of each QR Code, this is for people who don&#8217;t have a scanner, don&#8217;t want to scan or can&#8217;t scan the QR Code</li>
<li><strong>announce</strong> that you&#8217;re going to show QR Codes, people can get their scanners ready</li>
<li>if you can scan a QR Code on your screen at home, that doesn’t mean it will be scannable on a projection, especially for arty QR Codes</li>
<li><strong>optional</strong>: show people where they can download a scanner at the start of the presentation or in the hand-outs</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest lesson learned here is probably that <strong>it&#8217;s harder to scan from a projected image then you would presume</strong>. Also the QR Code is a means to an end, it&#8217;s fun as a gimmick once or twice but remember that it&#8217;s meant to make access to a resource easier and quicker (e.g.  URL, vCard, coupon code, &#8230;) You shouldn&#8217;t use it as a teaser in a presentation as you would in a marketing campaign if you don&#8217;t explicitly mean to play hide and seek.</p>
<h3>Context on my QR Code presentation</h3>
<p>This is to give you an idea of how and why I used QR Codes in my presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>the people in the crow where pretty close to the projection as the room was small, I chose this room intentionally</li>
<li>I paid special attention to make the projected image sharp</li>
<li>there where iPhones, an iPad2 and Android phones in the audience</li>
<li>the crowd was pretty gadget savvy and I had a hunch that I could count on at least 1 internet connected mobile devices with a QR Code scanner on it for each 2 people in the room, luckily my hunch was correct</li>
<li>A big part of my presentation was showing what are the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for designing and using your own QR Codes. If you check out the presentation you&#8217;ll notice I made it deliberately hard to scan some of the QR Codes on the slides.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crowd reaction to QR Codes</h3>
<p>It was interesting to see how people reacted and went about scanning the QR Codes.</p>
<ul>
<li>people where having fun, the interactive character of the presentation was appreciated</li>
<li>for ideal scanning, someone in the audience should sit in a right angle to the projection</li>
<li>some mobile scanner apps are better than others for projections</li>
<li>some people might needed to get up out of their seat and move up close to be able to scan</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime I found out hand-outs are a good solution to make sure everyone will be able to scan your QR Codes.</p>
<p>Some trivia worth sharing here:</p>
<ul>
<li>people like little mobile sites as extras, feedback on those was very positive overall (if they worked as advertised)</li>
<li>the iPad2 wasn&#8217;t that good at scanning from a distance, but the iPhones didn&#8217;t have the same issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at the presentation video and <a href="http://barcamp.be/bca5/bert-heymans/">see for yourself how it went</a>, please do mind that everything is in Dutch.<br />

<p>Shortly after Barcamp Antwerp I got invited by the <a href="http://tech45.eu" rel="external nofollow">Tech45</a> crew, a popular Belgian/Dutch podcast. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://tech45.eu/2011/04/02/tech45-de-barcamp-antwerpen-2011-special/" rel="external nofollow">Barcamp special</a> where they interviewed me on QR Code technology and I got to join the pannel on <a href="http://tech45.eu/2011/03/30/tech45-053-tante-ipad/" rel="external nofollow">the show the week after</a>, which was really fun to do. Check them out for the gadget and tech news if not for the diverse spectrum of charming Dutch accents <img src='http://heymans.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

If you’re in to online marketing you could <strong>stick around</strong> because that’s something the <a href="http://razwar.com">Raz*War</a> brand does very well in my honest opinion, and they’ve got their current success to speak for that.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> and there&#8217;s the coupon code at the bottom of the article if you&#8217;re interested</p>
<p>I’m a pretty big fan of the Raz*War brand razors and got a chance to test their latest product, the Raz*War Black, before it hits the store. </p>
<p>I actually won one of them with this tweet.<!-- http://twitter.com/#!/bertheymans/status/50947550202691584 --><br />

<p> <!-- end of tweet --></p>
<p>I tried the Raz*War Black this morning and this is my review:</p>
<ul>
<li>first thing I noticed, the handle is great, big enough and it has a really <strong>good grip</strong></li>
<li><strong>glides</strong> very smoothly across the skin, comparable with the Gillette I used to shave with but in all fairness the Raz*War Black has a better feeling on the skin</li>
<li>the razor is really <strong>easy to rinse</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>spring mechanism</strong> that pushed the blades toward the skin is <strong>a bit (too) light</strong>, you won’t cut yourself easily, that’s for sure</li>
<li>it’s <strong>a lot prettier</strong> than their other 5 blade model</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past I’ve had other razors break down at the handle connection and I’m wondering how long that part of the Raz*War black will last, by the looks of the build it should withstand quite a lot.</p>
<p>As it’s still in beta there’s no way to tell what the price of the refills will be, but I presume Raz*War will continue its trend of really cheap re-fills.</p>
<p><strong>The result of my shave looks like this</strong>, as I hope you can tell *cough* I’m learning about product photography (don’t worry, I won’t give up my day job yet):</p>
<p><img src="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bert_razwar.jpg" alt="a picture of Bert Heymans with a light beard, a product shot of the RazWar black razor on top of a set of refills, and a picture of Bert after shaving" title="Bert&#039;s RazWar black review" width="510" height="1019" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613" /><br />
As you may notice, I don&#8217;t shave my throat area with a razor.</p>
<p>Before this test I was using the <a href="http://www.razwar.com/products/men-starter-kit">Raz*War El Ché</a> model and I’m considering changing to Black when it comes out of beta.</p>
<p>I’m not affiliated with Raz*War or anything similar. I like what they are doing, wanted to share this with you and give them some publicity on the blog here.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Yay! In the meantime, the people from Raz*War contacted me and gave me a coupon code to share with you.  Use <strong>RWFORBERT</strong> in your check-out. With this code you can get a <strong>15% reduction</strong> at <a href="http://razwar.com">razwar.com</a> valid for orders starting at 7.50€ and the coupon code is valid until April 22, 2011.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday at <a href="http://barcamp.be/bca5/" rel="external nofollow">Barcamp Antwerp #5</a> I did a presentation on how QR Codes are on the rise, what they can do for you and how easy it is today to use them yourself. </p>
<p>BCA#5 was great, the organisation was slick and there was a great crowd. I&#8217;m writing a report on the event that I&#8217;ll be posting in the course of next week. </p>
<p>In the meantime these are my slides.</p>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_7403469"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bertheymans/qr-code-mashups-for-everyone" title="QR Code Mashups for Everyone">QR Code Mashups for Everyone</a></strong><object id="__sse7403469" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=qrcodemashupsforeveryone-110327050154-phpapp01&#038;stripped_title=qr-code-mashups-for-everyone&#038;userName=bertheymans" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse7403469" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=qrcodemashupsforeveryone-110327050154-phpapp01&#038;stripped_title=qr-code-mashups-for-everyone&#038;userName=bertheymans" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>
<p>The presentation is meant to be quite interactive so the slides don&#8217;t stand by themselves that well, but the session was recorded and there&#8217;s a video coming real soon, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/heymans" rel="external nofollow">please subscribe to the feed or the newsletter</a> if you want to be the first to get it. </p>
<p>I learned a lot by paying attention to how people in the audience where scanning the QR Codes in the presentation; very interesting to see what worked and what didn&#8217;t go as I expected. <strong>Thanks</strong> again to everyone who joined this session, you guys where wonderful.</p>
<p>As I point out in the presentation I&#8217;m very charmed by <a href="http://getsharesquare.com/" rel="external">ShareSquare</a>, a start-up that just went out of private beta last Friday. In my honest opinion they are offering the most complete QR Code and Mobile Optimized Website solution available at the moment. For bands who want to advertise using QR Code technology or for event marketing this is an especially interesting service.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get generated QR Codes, mobile websites, statistics and a self-serve CMS at ShareSquare. The free account is great but I can share this code with you that can can be used to credit <strong>$99,-</strong> toward a Pro or Enterprise account: <strong>SXSWPROMO</strong> (only valid until March 31, 2011) Be careful if you choose to sign up though, it&#8217;s a subscription service.</p>
<p>Try it and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Before I forget, kudos to the Barcamp Antwerp #5 sponsors, without them the event wouldn&#8217;t have been possible: <a href="http://www.burooz.be/">Burooz</a>, <a href="http://tech45.eu/">Tech45</a>, <a href="http://ichoosr.be/">iChoosr</a>, <a href="http://krimson.be/">Krimson</a>, <a href="http://www.managingthoughts.be/">Managing Thoughts</a>, <a href="http://www.antwerpen.be/">Stad Antwerpen</a>, <a href="http://www.cebitbushannover.com/">CeBitBus</a>, <a href="http://www.medemerkers.be/">MedeMerkers</a>, <a href="http://www.gingerlove.be">GingerLove</a> and <a href="http://www.medemerkers.be/">Nokia</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people at <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com" rel="external nofollow">Vision Mobile</a> made a fine infographic again, showing the evolution of the top 5 handset OEMs between 2001 and 2010. And boy oh boy, it has been quite a brawl in that market the past decade. The players in the picture here are, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Apple, RIM and LG.  The infographic is based on <strong>volume of handsets sold by brand</strong>. Scroll down for my summary and comments &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2011/03/top-5-handset-oem/" mce_href="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2011/03/top-5-handset-oem/" rel="external nofollow"><img src="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/infographics/2/VMInfographic_02644.jpg" mce_src="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/infographics/2/VMInfographic_02644.jpg"  border="0" alt="Top 5 handset OEM" /></a> </p>
<p>The main thing that pops out of this infographic is that <strong>Nokia has been and still is on top the past 10 years</strong>, this is off course in terms of volume sold, revenue and profits aren&#8217;t taken into account. Putting those numbers in the analysis would deal very different cards in this poker tournament. Good news, Mobile Vision is working on something showing just that.</p>
<p>Another remarkable detail is <strong>the decrease of handsets sold in 2009</strong>, that&#8217;s interesting because 2009 was the year where Android phone and the iPhone popularity took off. That does go to show in the 2010 numbers however. Based on my professional experience that feels counter-intuitive, that&#8217;s why numbers are so interesting they challenge your prejudice.</p>
<p>We see <strong>Apple entering the top 5 in 2010</strong> and they only just joined the mobile market in 2007 with the first iPhone, a very noteworthy feat.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone is touting around some kind of gadget that has a digital camera in it these days; that&#8217;s why I find the following idea so great and accessible. It&#8217;s from an art project hides messages in empty canvasses, I&#8217;ll explain how it works after the pictures.<br />
<img src="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/take_a_picture_poster.png" alt="infographic explaining that you can see the invisible painting by pointing a cell phone camera or digital camera at it" title="Take a Picture concept" width="428" height="662" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-577" /></p>
<p><img src="http://heymans.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/take_a_picture_promo2-e1300661431281.jpg" alt="a mobile phone camera pointed at an empty canvas, IR light painting is visible on camera screen" title="Take a Picture Hidden Art" width="427" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-578" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s based on the way a digital camera like the one in your phone show <strong>infra red light</strong>. You can&#8217;t see it with your own eyes but looking at the screen of your phone or digital camera you will. I&#8217;ve been using this trick for ages to see if the batteries in my TV remote where dead, and these guys elevated this to art. I bet you can do your own <strong>hidden infrared graffiti</strong> like this if you&#8217;d put some research and tinkering time in.</p>
<p>Here Brad and Kyle are, explaining and showing off their hidden picture project:<br />
<object style="height: 260px; width: 428px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/810DLIu0uBg?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/810DLIu0uBg?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="428" height="260"></embed></param></object></p>
<p><object width="428" height="260"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FzhDmySD45Q&#038;hl=en_US&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FzhDmySD45Q&#038;hl=en_US&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="428" height="260"></embed></object></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve made <a href="http://www.kyleclements.com/tap/vids_promo.php" rel="nofollow">other promo video&#8217;s</a>, pretty interesting stuff, <a href="http://www.kyleclements.com/tap/index.php" rel="nofollow">check out their site</a>.</p>
<p>Things like this <strong>used to be something just for the tech aficionados</strong>, just too exclusive to gain sufficient interest; but hiding stuff behind <strong>digital barriers</strong> is getting cooler every day with the wide accessibility of digital cameras, scanners, internet access and GPS integration in common mobile gadgetry.</p>
<p>A few other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geocaching</strong>: You get geographic coordinates of treasure, hidden by other <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Geocaching">geocachers</a> and go out on a quest to find them. You often have to solve puzzles and what&#8217;s hidden can&#8217;t be uncovered without a GPS telling you where you are looking. Not that long ago, you had to buy a GPS device that you could use for geocaching, unless you where into trekking you didn&#8217;t already own this technology. Today most smartphones have GPS and there are GPS apps as well as specialized geocaching apps available for the iPhone and Android devices. <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx" title="Geocaches search">Do a search on your location now, you&#8217;ll be amazed how many geocaches are in your neighbourhood.</a></li>
<li><strong>QR Codes</strong>: Used more and more often, in marketing, art, silly avatars, business cards, wifi hotspots, etc. It&#8217;s just a square barcode, but you can only read the message with a scanner. Popular in Japan for ages, because they have mobile phones that ship with a scanner onboard. Today if you&#8217;re an iPhone or Android phone owners, you can pick from a dozen of scanner apps.
</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are getting more popular every day, and that&#8217;s because of the rise of smartphones. The devices and associated service are <strong>costing less and less</strong> , making them more accessible, but there&#8217;s still a very long way to in Western Europe if we ever want to come close to Asia. Another catalyst that bears mentioning is the widespread increase of speed in mobile internet. But for the hidden IR paintings <strong>all you need is a digital camera</strong>, and it&#8217;s hard to find a mobile phone without one these days.</p>
