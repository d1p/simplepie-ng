The &lt;a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/08/483296.html"&gt;recent wave of riots that happened in numerous English cities this August&lt;/a&gt; did not lead to widespread disruption anywhere in Wales. Despite this, there have been several people arrested for riot related offences, some of whom have been denied bail and handed highly disproportionate&amp;nbsp;sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These arrests are not a result of the limited &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/10/uk-riots-wales-minor-arson"&gt;disorder that happened in Cardiff on Tuesday 9th August&lt;/a&gt;, which briefly led to the BBC to drop the term 'England Riots' in favour of '&lt;a href="http://eye-on-wales.com/2011/08/10/for-want-of-welsh-riots/"&gt;UK Riots&lt;/a&gt;'. They soon changed back, not doubt on the advice of &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/08/10/police-treat-overnight-disturbances-in-cardiff-as-isolated-incidents-91466-29209248/"&gt;nervous police who were keen to paint these as unconnected "isolated incidents"&lt;/a&gt; despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14515521"&gt;15 people in Wales have been arrested for posting on social media&lt;/a&gt;, with two arrests in &lt;a href="http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Pair-arrested-Llanelli-Facebook-8216-riot-8217/story-13120977-detail/story.html"&gt;Llanelli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/08/13/two-men-accused-of-trying-to-incite-cardiff-riots-on-facebook-91466-29227683/"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2011/08/19/flintshire-teenagers-remanded-in-custody-on-riot-incitement-charges-51352-29268333/"&gt;Flintshire&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14631184"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9196209.Gwent_eight_held_after_English_riots/"&gt;eight people in Gwent&lt;/a&gt;. So far only one of these has been handed a jail sentence - four months for incitement - &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14636944"&gt;a sentence branded "too lenient"(!) by a Tory AM&lt;/a&gt;, though several more have been denied bail and held on remand for over a month, awaiting crown court.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This has happened in the context of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/16/uk-riots-four-years-disorder-facebook"&gt;4 year sentences&lt;/a&gt; being handed down for use of social media which led to no disorder. The implications of these arrests and sentences are quite chilling and they underline the often repeated lie that these riots were not political. It is clear that the authorities are at least as much concerned in punishing people for openly showing support for the riots as those who took part in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The offending facebook post that got David Glyn Jones thrown in jail for four months was only online for 20 minutes, and offered up an opinion that a great many people might sympathise with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I don't see why everyone's complaining about the rioters. Given the chance I'd love to smash up a police car, wouldn't you?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The lack of widespread disorder in any of the Welsh cities has meant plenty of &lt;a href="http://yourcardiff.walesonline.co.uk/2011/08/11/how-cardiff-escaped-the-riots-and-the-looting/"&gt;backslapping amongst youth workers, police and politicians&lt;/a&gt;. Without local rioters to tackle, Welsh police forces sent a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14488773"&gt;large numbers of officers over to the riot zones&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Welsh MPs (&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/8083998.stm"&gt;many disgraced by the expenses scandal&lt;/a&gt;) were quick to pack out a &lt;a href="http://itvwalesblog.com/2011/08/11/english-riots-welsh-mps/"&gt;recalled House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; to support the authoritarian crackdown.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with the activities of the police and the courts, others have faced disciplinary action at work for social media posts about the riots. &lt;a href="http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2011/08/27/supermarket-worker-sacked-for-facebook-riot-status-55578-29311419/"&gt;One supermarket workers was sacked by Morrisons&lt;/a&gt; for a post that any of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite"&gt;followers of General Ludd&lt;/a&gt; could identify with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“If anyone is rioting in Rhyl tonight do me a favour and smash up the self-checkout services.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is possible that had those who have been taken into custody due to the riots could have avoided jail time if they had had &lt;a href="http://www.fitwatch.org.uk/2011/08/13/dont-panic-dont-talk/"&gt;better legal advice&lt;/a&gt;. Given the current climate it is advisable that anyone facing the potential for possible arrest would do well to familiarise themselves with &lt;a href="http://ldmg.org.uk/files/No_Comment_4th_Edition.pdf"&gt;No Comment - the defendant's guide to arrest&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;a href="http://ldmg.org.uk/index.html"&gt;the Legal Defence and Monitoring Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whilst &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots"&gt;liberals attempt to 'understand' the riots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://libcom.org/tags/uk-riots"&gt;dissidents seek out what revolutionary potential exist&lt;/a&gt;, the prevailing political establishment has written off all the events that followed the killing of Mark Duggan by police as 'sheer criminality'. This unwillingness to engage with the root causes of the disturbances may well end up being the state's undoing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The way politicians and bankers so&amp;nbsp;blatantly&amp;nbsp;cashed in on their positions whilst forcing everyone else to pick up the bill coupled with a police force that flaunts it's ability to kill with impunity has all but destroyed the idea that justice could exist in such a corrupt country. As faith in the political process has virtually disappeared from working class communities it falls to radicals to come up with an alternative to this failed society, if we don't, others will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One month on, with &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14802359"&gt;police from Welsh forces still in London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14859791"&gt;prison population it at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt; the state has presented it's credentials for repression. There is no doubt that David Glyn Jones' imprisonment, like that of many others across the UK, is a political act, it seems likely there will be many more to come.&lt;/div&gt;

It has been voted the &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/03/24/uk-poll-votes-it-ugliest-building-in-wales-enjoy-it-while-you-can-91466-26097400/"&gt;ugliest unique eyesore in Wales&lt;/a&gt; as well as having won awards for architecture. In its time it’s been known to have its fair share of shady characters and dodgy deals as well as a vibrant and bustling community. The dilapidated buildings are covered in the rubbish from fly tippers but are also smothered by thriving wild plants with flowers and berries. It has been the location for several films and many photographic projects as well as being regularly frequented by graffiti artists, dog walkers and boy racers. And it’s where we currently live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Billybanks housed around a 1000 people for several generations until the council decided to redevelop it in 1998 and had it largely emptied by 2002. They realised the potential money in the incredible views of Cardiff and wanted to build a range of luxury flats, despite inevitably causing the displacement of hundreds of families. Apart from a handful of residents who refused to be bullied out of their homes the Billybanks lay uninhabited until August 2009 when a group of friends parked on one of the roads with their vans, trucks and caravans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The initial reaction to our arrival was mixed. The local paper, the Penarth Times, read ”&lt;a href="http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/latestnews/4576652.travellers_move_in_at_the_billybanks/"&gt;Travellers not welcome&lt;/a&gt;” and quotes from neighbours such as&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”The travellers haven’t caused any trouble as yet, but I do worry that they will increase in numbers and then you just don’t know what will happen”. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was not long before we were given eviction papers by the council including an attempt to ban us from staying in our vehicles anywhere in the county. This was obviously extremely disproportionate and not strictly within the councils power to enforce. We went to court and pointed out their misuse of the law and lack of justification for their actions and called for a judicial review. The case was postponed and a month later the council conceded and we have been enjoying living there ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From our perspective, most of the people we met were friendly and welcoming and a month later the same paper quoting a local read:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“(The Travellers)... have been no nuisance since arriving in August and have kept the site tidy...Indeed; their presence seems to deter vandalism.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The local fire brigade told us they love us living here because they used to attend weekly fires in the buildings and since we’ve arrived they’ve been here less than a handful of times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Billybanks has an incredible sense of history and community. Everyone you meet has a different story to tell you about their time living or visiting here. One ex-resident made a film about the Billybanks where she says&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We had nothing in those days, no money, nothing, we were totally skint but they were the happiest days of my life. Such a happy time, everything was open planned and everyone knew each other...there was a massive sense of community which you don’t see anymore.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many tell of the notorious DIY bonfire night parties where all the residents got together and watched the fireworks go off all over the city. Others describe exploring the huge rows of buildings after they had been emptied to find clothes still on washing lines and toys scattered in the gardens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many local people are disgusted at the councils £100m ‘Penarth Heights’ development scheme and have called for redevelopment of the old flats or the building of affordable housing. Despite the years of debate and lack of a development contract due to the credit crunch the project is going ahead and half the estate is currently being developed, with a supposed 20% social housing. One resident and his family still live in the Billybanks, refusing to leave until they’re offered one of the new builds arguing that they bought their house because they want to live there and local people can’t afford to live in the council’s new development. The council have threatened compulsory purchase several times but cancelled court at the last minute in a clear attempt to intimidate them out of their home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has been called the ugliest eyesore in Wales yet the council plan to flatten the woodland that surrounds the estate and build cubed, beige, wood-clad flats and houses. The area was known by many as the ‘heart and soul of Penarth’, yet how much community and soul will remain in the new ‘luxury’ housing project?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We who have squatted and live at the Billybanks enjoy being part of the community that remains, are proud to inhabit somewhere that the council have abandoned for 7 years and plan to stay here as long as we can. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/jul/13/government-to-scrap-squatters-rights"&gt;government are currently proposing to criminalise squatting and make serious changes to traveller law&lt;/a&gt; that would make it virtually impossible for people to make use of or live in empty spaces like this. The Billybanks is just one example of the government prioritising profits over people as they evict households, leave buildings disused, make it harder for people to get housing benefit and attempt to make you a criminal if you start your own autonomous community on abandoned land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One person filming at the Billybanks asked&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“What is it that makes such a vile disgusting place so beautiful to look at?” &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/55815" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1c5puKwdZWg/TiMM2Ckid_I/AAAAAAAAANU/OKqOZiEz2GU/s400/road.png" width="300" alt="the road to freedom" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It was in mid 1971 that I purchased my still-possessed copy of Bertrand Russell’s &lt;i&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"&gt;Roads to Freedom&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/i&gt; for the princely sum of 60p, helpfully also priced at 12/- for those who had not yet fully adapted to decimal currency.&amp;nbsp; It was one of a number of books which influenced my political development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Russell set out (in the terms of the age; he wrote it in 1918, and I doubt that anyone would use some of his words and phrases in more modern times) his analysis of three alternative roads to freedom, and then concluded with some highly idealistic views of his own as a synthesis of sorts. Socialism, Anarchism, and Syndicalism – three alternative ways of building a utopia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The relationship between Marx and Bakunin had its moments, of course, but whilst the routes to achieve freedom and the structures of the desired free society might look very different, the essential nature of the freedom which underpins them does have some broad similarities.&amp;nbsp; Freedom from the tyranny of capital, and the replacement of competition with co-operation as a means of sharing resources are two of the essential pillars of my own political philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The extent to which national identity has any place in walking the road to freedom, or whether the only identity that really matters is class identity, is an issue which has oft divided Welsh socialists.&amp;nbsp; Certainly, many socialists have traditionally seen nationalism as a diversion from their own view of the road to freedom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a quotation (which used to be used often by Plaid members) from Arthur Henderson, then Secretary of the Labour Party, who said in 1918, that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Given self-government, Wales might establish itself as a modern Utopia”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
He was overstating the case a little, methinks.&amp;nbsp; But there is a long-held view that Wales has a more collectivist outlook than England, and thus has the potential to develop further and faster given the freedom to do so.&amp;nbsp; Attempts to build &lt;i&gt;“Socialism in one country&lt;/i&gt;” have not exactly been entirely successful in historical terms – infamous is a more appropriate description - but that is not the same as saying that Wales could not build on its political traditions more effectively with greater freedom, to an extent at least.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(I leave aside here the question as to whether that view which we hold of ourselves as being more collectivist is still valid.&amp;nbsp; Continuing support for Labour and visceral hatred of the Tories are not at all the same thing as adherence to the values on which Labour was founded; but that’s a separate debate and it’s one where I’d probably give a different answer now than I would have given in the 1970s.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In reality, I don’t believe that national freedom for Wales within the current paradigm is an essential step along the road to freedom, nor does it of necessity lead beyond that current paradigm.&amp;nbsp; But neither do I believe it to be a diversion, and there are aspects of the national struggle which can be building blocks for that wider journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another of the seminal literary influences upon me in 1970 was Marcuse’s &lt;i&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/one-dimensional-man/index.htm"&gt;One Dimensional Man&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/i&gt; (a comparative bargain at a mere 8/-).&amp;nbsp; And at around the same time, I read a piece by Sartre, who talked about the demand by a Basque to speak his own language as being in itself a revolutionary act.&amp;nbsp; The idea of ‘identity’ – or nationality in this context - as a searching for a more human-scale buttress against the one-dimensionalism to which capitalism is leading us became a key part of my own political outlook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are all shaped by the events and zeitgeist of our times, and I was as moved as anyone by the pictures of earth-rise as seen from the moon.&amp;nbsp; The idea that this earth is all that we have, and that we have to draw on its resources in a fair and sustainable way, and that that implicitly means bringing decisions and power down to a more human level, was another factor affecting my political direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a number of reasons which I will not go into here, I wouldn’t describe myself as a Marxist, but I do agree with what Marx had to say about the need to combine theory and practice.&amp;nbsp; When I came to decide how to engage in political activity rather than mere philosophical interpretation, that concept of praxis was central to my thinking.&amp;nbsp; There is always a conflict between ideological purity and the potential effectiveness of a mass movement – which is how so many otherwise good socialists end up justifying their continued membership of the Labour Party – and it’s a conflict to which many of us have given different answers at different times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My particular resolution of the question in 1971 was to join Plaid Cymru.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn’t say that I have ever truly believed that Plaid could or would go all the way to where I wanted to go, but breaking the state down into smaller units, and building a nation with which people could more readily identify and which would give them human roots as cultural beings rather than treating them as purely economic beings was a pretty good, and probably achievable, start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plus there was both a strong socialist strand in the party – tending to syndicalism in some ways – as well as a nascent understanding of the sustainability issue.&amp;nbsp; And, although the party was generally seen as pretty peripheral when I joined it in 1971, it had an obvious potential to my eye to become a serious political force in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s probably inevitable that a combination of electoral success and significant movement towards the constitutional aims creates a situation where those who see politics in terms of small change within the paradigm – or even simply in terms of a career – will come to the fore.&amp;nbsp; It parallels what happened to the Labour Party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I still see progress on the national question as something that can help to create the conditions in which further advance along that wider road to freedom becomes more possible.&amp;nbsp; I suspect, though, that it will take a different vehicle to make that further advance; it’s time to start looking beyond constitutional nationalism.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AE4TmQlpCbo/Th9UUC-MbYI/AAAAAAAAANM/hmDFbgnH7rY/s1600/dontwork.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em;" alt="don't work and fight back"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The London &lt;a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/03/476754.html"&gt;march on 26th March&lt;/a&gt; was the biggest mobilisation by the trade union movement for decades, followed on &lt;a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/06/481488.html"&gt;30th June by the biggest one day strike&lt;/a&gt; seen for many years. Now the question is "Where next?" The talk of a co-ordinated mass strike in the autumn, with the big battalions of UNITE and UNISON joining the fray. How do we keep the heat up over the summer?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of keeping the action going there seems to be little concrete coming from the unions. The PCS has called a months overtime ban, and is relying on a legal route in the meantime on the pension question and is upping its tax justice campaign. All unions are to a greater or lesser degree looking for opportunities to ballot for action, usually on pay or pensions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certainly the summer needs to see the impetus continued. This means supporting the unions in ballots for and actual industrial action. It means militants in the unions pressing hard and arguing for action. The anti cuts groups need to continue organising meetings and demonstrations, but more co-ordination is needed, on a Wales-wide level for a start. The groups need to open up to encompass far more people, including the unemployed and pensioners. It would be better if anti-cuts groups became community defence groups with interaction with the environmental movement. Climate change is still a huge challenge, and is exacerbated by the cuts in its effect on working class communities as &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/topics/fracking/"&gt;the race for resources takes its toll&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/09/flood-defence-schemes-funding-cut"&gt;cuts leave communities vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Its all moving forward and activists everywhere are out nights and weekends fighting back. Good, but to what end? The immediate reaction to such a question is to save pensions, public services and stop the cuts, or al least slow them down. Laudable, but a very narrow perspective. The pensions plan is to make workers pay more, work longer and get less pension. This has already happened with state pensions and was generally supported by Labour and the unions as much as any one else. The argument now is generally about the worth of pensions in the public sector.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The opposition is based on economic arguments. What about the implications that the elderly are termed a “burden“? what about quality of life? How can it be that working lives are to be so extended so you work until you drop? Why are workers working such long hours anyway? In the early 1900s, scientist and anarchist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin"&gt;Peter Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt; deduced that with the advance in society then only 15 hours work a week per able person to produce all society needed. The advances since then have been beyond comprehension.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So should the argument be as much about the quality of our working lives? That there should be less hours worked, retirement earlier and yes sufficiently funded? That this should be for all, private and public? That instead of unemployment work should be better shared out? That being retired or unemployed does not make one a burden, indeed should there not be a right NOT to work, but to live and freely explore ones potential, contributing to&amp;nbsp;society in different ways?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Public services should be saved, but for what? Workers have no real say in them, pay and conditions are low. Much of it, such as the UK Border Agency are hardly sympathetic to support from anyone on the left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Should the argument not just be no cuts but looking at workers self management of public services (this doesn’t mean the shallow mutuals the coalition government are proposing) putting real power in workers and communities&amp;nbsp;hands. Where society deems certain services to be untenable, say nuclear power, that there should be redeployment into socially useful areas. That we run society ourselves for ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is time that those of us who want revolutionary and radical change start arguing on a much wider base. Marx argued we are free when, like artists, we produce without the goad of physical necessity;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1884/useful.htm"&gt;William Morris counterpoised useful work against useless toil&lt;/a&gt;. Such questions and ideas have been a rich part of the tapestry of the communist movement, too often now forgotten. So we raise the game, the aim is freedom from tyranny of everyday life and to ensure in our arguments and solutions we are not simply arguing for bigger cages and longer chains. The social situation world wide is fluid. There is unrest globally. We can support it best by solidarity and unrest here, though on genuine transformational demands, not just narrow economic and democratic reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To end with a story that illustrates the point: Once upon a time a society lived in a huge structure, The only light and heat came from gas lamps. These were maintained and overseen by gas lamp lighters. Gradually the power of the gas lighters grew as they took more and more from the society , claiming how valuable they were, monopolising the gas lamps. Eventually the situation grew so intolerable that the society revolted and threw out the gas lamp lighters, taking power for themselves. During the course of this the violence of the revolt blew great holes in the lightless and cold structure, revealing an hitherto unknown land and light and warmth. Soon all power lay with the window makers!&lt;/div&gt;

Most British newspapers take it for granted that cuts are necessary and that working people have to suffer in the name of fiscal rectitude. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that coverage of the anti-cuts movement is more distorted in some publications than in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although national newspapers such as the Times, Telegraph and Daily Mail are never less than scornful in their attitude towards the resistance, they usually report the facts about strikes, marches and demonstrations with at least a modicum of objectivity.The same cannot be said about many local newspapers. Aware that their work is rarely exposed to rigorous political scrutiny, regional journalists have done more than anyone else to mislead the public about the struggle against the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An especially shocking &lt;a href="http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/claims-low-demo-turnout-proves-lack-strike/story-12860309-detail/story.html"&gt;example of political bias has just appeared in the South Wales Evening Post&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday 30th June the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) organised a well-attended rally in Castle Square in Swansea in support of the co-ordinated strikes in the public sector. In his front-page coverage of the rally on 1st July, Rob Goodman of the Post employed every trick in the book to convey the impression that it had been a miserable failure. His article is worth examining because it typifies the work of regional journalists across the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Goodman's basic technique is to frame his coverage of the rally with the distorted testimony of a politically hostile witness. The very first sentence of his piece refers to the views of the Conservative AM Byron Davies, who claims that attendance at the rally was "low" and that the public clearly disapproves of industrial action. A lengthy quotation from Davies follows shortly afterwards. Later quotations from representatives of the PCS and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) are noticeably shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There can, of course, be no objection to a journalist invoking the opinions of a Conservative politician. Byron Davies is entitled to his views and Rob Goodman is entitled to report them. But what is astonishing about the piece in the Post is that Davies's testimony is implicitly portrayed as definitive. In leading with Davies's words and quoting him so extensively, Goodman effectively sets him up as a sort of unimpeachable witness with whom no sensible reader would wish to disagree. This provides a context in which a number of seriously misleading statements about the rally can be passed off as the truth. For one thing, Goodman claims that only 150 people turned up. The real figure was closer to 350. He also implies that the only participants were members of the striking unions. In fact the rally drew on a much wider constituency that included political activists, pensioners and concerned members of the public. Goodman even forgets to mention that the rally was attended by three AMs (Bethan Jenkins, Mike Hedges and Julie James) and one MP (Siân James).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big problem with Goodman's article is that it conveys a misleading impression of what the anti-cuts movement is fighting for. It does so by giving undue prominence to the words of an activist whose views do not coincide with those of the movement as a whole. In the last column of the piece, Dave Bishop of the ATL is quoted as describing the public-sector pay freeze as "necessary". At no point does Goodman register the fact that this is not the view of Bishop's fellow protesters, most of whom regard the pay freeze as an outrageous attack on working-class living standards. By failing to make it clear that activists oppose the pay freeze as strenuously as they oppose the government's pension reforms, Goodman gives the impression that the anti-cuts movement is a more vacillating, less principled thing than it actually is. It is an old trick but no less objectionable for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How should the anti-cuts movement respond to distorted coverage of its activities? In the short term there are various things that can be done, even though the influence of commercial newspapers will not be undermined in a hurry. Activists must learn to bombard the press with letters of correction whenever their cause is misrepresented. From time to time they should hold demonstrations outside newspaper offices, demand the right to reply and produce leaflets informing the public of where journalists are going wrong. Above all they should play a leading role in building up the alternative media culture which the internet has made possible. There are now hundreds of websites on which dissident opinions can be disseminated. These range from overtly commercial sites such as Facebook to online socialist publications such as Radical Wales. If activists used these sites to provide comprehensive coverage of what they were doing, they would have a formidable weapon in the battle against media distortion. The British press is no more impartial now than it was nearly three decades ago during the Miners' Strike. We ignore that lesson at out peril.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-350549029390165710?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The simultaneous strike by &lt;a href="http://www.atl.org.uk/pensions/dayofaction/day-of-action-overview.asp"&gt;Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/13500"&gt;National Union of Teachers (NUT)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/campaigns/30-june/"&gt;Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5616"&gt;University and College Union (UCU)&lt;/a&gt; members is against proposed changes to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-pensions"&gt;public sector pensions&lt;/a&gt; that will mean paying more and working longer for less.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There will be picket lines outside all kinds of government buildings across the UK and with a &lt;a href="http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=3338"&gt;significant public sector in Wales&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a large number here, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13925219"&gt;widespread school closures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though not the biggest industrial action since the &lt;a href="http://libcom.org/tags/1926-general-strike"&gt;General Strike of 1926&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/21/size-pension-strike-unions"&gt;some have claimed&lt;/a&gt;, it's a hugely important step in building a movement of resistance against the government's austerity programme. In an effort to further spread the message marches and rallies will be taking place in &lt;a href="http://aberuncut.wordpress.com/2011/06/27/j30-strike-fight-for-the-public-sector/"&gt;Aberystwyth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=180025588719866"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.j30strike.org/location/landrindod-wells/"&gt;Llandrindod Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newportagainstthecuts.org.uk/"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.j30strike.org/location/swansea/"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/merthyr/2011/06/23/strike-set-to-cripple-schools-91466-28928586/"&gt;Merthyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.j30strike.org/location/wrexham/"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;These rallies have the support of a a very wide range of local union branches and will feature speakers from all the striking unions as well as the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and National Union of Students (NUS). As ever all the details as we get them are featured in our calendar on the right hand column (please leave a comment about any we may have missed).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following &lt;a href="http://www.radicalwales.org/2011/06/ukuncut-take-action-in-cardiff.html"&gt;last month's successful day of action&lt;/a&gt;, Cardiff's &lt;a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=207944066526879131018.0004a5d84a27467ae5d3f&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=12#bmb=1"&gt;large number of picket lines&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=178525368874296"&gt;march and rally&lt;/a&gt; will be joined by other actions and events that are being organised to increase the pressure and involve more people. A second "&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=135131293231858"&gt;Busk against the cuts&lt;/a&gt;" event will take place in the shadow of the Nye Bevan statue on Queen's street featuring all sorts of street performers. Nearby the local &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs"&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/a&gt; group will be providing a free meal for everyone with a "&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=243306139013420"&gt;Food not cuts&lt;/a&gt;" theme. Later in the day a &lt;a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/actions/610"&gt;UK Uncut action&lt;/a&gt; has been called to target the real perpetrators of the finical crisis - banks and corporations that dodge paying tax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linking up between &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jun/27/trade-unions-anti-cuts-protest"&gt;the TUC and anti-cuts groups&lt;/a&gt; is showing some positive signs, with &lt;a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/join-the-big-society-breakfast-and-support-the-strike"&gt;UK Uncut's "Big Society Breakfast"&lt;/a&gt; supporting picket lines. These kind of moves to generalise the strike aim to reach out and unite the different groups who are resisting the government's attack on working people. The &lt;a href="http://www.radicalwales.org/2010/12/tution-fee-protests-are-just-beginning.html"&gt;upsurge in radicalism among students&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last year set the scene for the kind of fightback that is possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With opposition front benchers like &lt;a href="http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/106214"&gt;Ed Balls blaming the victim for the dispute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.radicalwales.org/2011/03/labour-council-pushes-through-tory.html"&gt;Labour-run councils implementing huge cuts&lt;/a&gt;, it's no wonder that the Labour party has failed to turn disgust and anger with the coalition government into support. PCS general secretary (&lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/cynon-valley/2011/06/23/valley-raised-union-man-in-strike-threat-91466-28914179/"&gt;and local boy&lt;/a&gt;) Mark Serwotka made it very clear that that "&lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/03/unions-labour-alternative"&gt;the alternative&lt;/a&gt;" isn't about the Labour party when he said that "&lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2011/06/union-serwotka-interview"&gt;Labour doesn't speak for me&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://solidaritymagazine.org/2011/06/dave-prentis-and-unison/"&gt;If union leders are to be believed&lt;/a&gt; this will be the first of many days of co-ordinated industrial action, radicals both inside and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/27/we-all-own-30-june-strike"&gt;outside the unions&lt;/a&gt; have an ideal opportunity to galvanise workers and escalate attacks on the government. Encouraging &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_strike_action"&gt;wildcat actions&lt;/a&gt;, or just &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=110414459048319"&gt;throwing sickies&lt;/a&gt; in solidarity are a very good start, but we might just start seeing glimpses of the struggle entering into people's everyday lives. See you on the streets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-8609442327550422915?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In Cardiff the target was Topshop, the clothing store owned by retail giant the Arcadia Group, headed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Green#Tax_avoidance"&gt;Sir Philip Green&lt;/a&gt;, who has avoided the payment of millions of pounds of taxes.   Following an anti-austerity rally dubbed &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jWKmZZ2ybk"&gt;"Busk against the Cuts" &lt;/a&gt; around 50 people simply walked down the main shopping street and straight past the shop's security guards, who were clearly overwhelmed by the number of protesters walking through the door. They then occupied the store for an hour, forcing it to close for at least half of that time.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seemed to be the chants of the protesters that bothered Topshop the most.  One of the more amusing aspects of the occupation was the rather pathetic attempt to drown out the chants by cranking up their own, awful ‘background’ music to ear splitting levels.  In the end even the cops were begging them to turn it down.   . &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After half an hour, the Topshop decided they needed to take other action to stop their customers hearing too much about their tax swindling activities, and closed the shop.  By this time a slightly smaller group of occupiers had strategically positioned themselves just feet from the main door, so even with the store closed the supporting crowd, and waiting TV news team, had a good view of the action. As the occupation entered into its second hour, the activists decided to call it a day and emerged to the &lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/24390869"&gt;waiting cameras&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happily, there were no arrests.   Legal geeks may have thought it a little odd that the police didn’t try to make arrests for aggravated trespass, an ‘offence’ that was specifically created to criminalise this sort of protest.  It’s possible Topshop had told the police they didn’t want to prosecute - a little concerned at the prospect Philip Green’s tax misdemeanours being raised in a public court, perhaps. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A South Wales police inspector did make some legally dodgy threats to arrest for breach of the peace, but the presence of legal observers in the store seems to have dissuaded her.  She was later overheard to moan that she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tombfowler/status/74479858570375168"&gt;“can’t do anything because of the bloody legal observers&lt;/a&gt;”.  Occupiers were, however, individually photographed by both police &lt;a href="http://www.fitwatch.org.uk/2011/05/30/fit-teams-in-plain-clothes-come-out-for-ukuncut-as-police-go-for-breach-of-the-peace-arrests/"&gt;"for the intelligence log".&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some people will criticise UK uncut for taking action that can put them the wrong side of the law.  But this sort of direct action is a powerful beast, and one of the few ways in which ordinary people can have a direct affect on the truly criminal activities of the very rich.  Philip Green is not worried by governments or the courts - he has highly paid legal advisors, tax experts and lobbyists to deal with that.  But direct action like that organised by UK uncut has undoubtedly hurt him.  He’s lost trade and had to deal with a badly damaged public image.     &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It isn’t just about taxes.  UK Uncut focuses public attention on the real villains of the piece – those who get extraordinarily rich by taking advantage of the work and hardship of others – and sets out to take them on.  That has to be a good thing.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CardiffUncut"&gt;activists who sat in Topshop &lt;/a&gt;on Saturday deserve our respect.  It isn’t easy to put yourself in a position that could lead to your arrest.  More than respect, they need support.  It would be good to see twice as many occupiers in the tax avoiding target &lt;a href="http://ukuncut.org.uk/actions/610"&gt;next time round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-6943866380669670645?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

We &lt;a href="http://cymdeithas.org/2011/03/06/language_activists_target_tory_offices_over_s4c.html"&gt;broke into MP Jonathan Evans’s office in Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; and sprayed the slogan ‘Achub S4C’ (Save S4C) on the wall. The sirens went off straight away when we broke the window to get into the office. The police arrived while we were on the phone notifying them of what we had done. The policeman shouted at us to come out of the building and threatened to break the door down and spray us with pepper spray. We opened the door and came out peacefully, the police told us to get on the floor and on our stomachs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were then put into the back of the van and were taken to the police station at Cardiff Bay. Jamie and I had been arrested about 3 months prior for spraying a slogan on a government building in protest against the weak Welsh Language law that let big companies get away with not providing services in Welsh. That time I was only in the cell for about 8 hours and I was allowed my phone call straight away. I thought I knew what to expect but it turned out that that this it would be a little different. I was not allowed my phone call until 17 hours after being arrested and would be in the cell much longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was very glad to get my phone call, i was worried that my father had come all the way down from north Wales, it was lambing season so this would have been quite an inconvenience! I received a newspaper while in the cell that my friend Menna had bought me. I don’t know what I would have done without it, being alone for 33 hours would have been absolutely unbearable without something to read! There were a few articles about protesters in other countries, this really made me appreciate how lucky I was that I was not worse off. I was allowed plenty of tea and almost all the police (except maybe one or two) treated me with respect and were perfectly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My DNA, fingerprints and photos had already been taken by the police 3 months earlier but they decided to take them again anyway. I then had an interview with the police which was 90% of it just me saying ‘no comment’. We had written a letter explaining our direct action so nothing further needed to be said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The police initially told me that I would be allowed out by that evening but I was later told that I was to be charged with burglary and would be kept in overnight. I began to worry that I would be remanded until the final court date. Whether or not I would be granted bail would be decided the following day at the magistrates court. I had not expected this and had exams coming up so I began to worry that my education would be more seriously affected than I first thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a bit of a sleepless night I was taken from the police station to a cell in Cardiff Magistrates Court. That morning when I asked for a Welsh speaking solicitor I was answered with ‘You’ll be lucky!’. I was also given a copy of the South Wales Echo newspaper by the guard 5 minutes before I went to court, looking back it was probably done to shake my confidence. The story in the Echo was completely misleading and was spun so that it sounded like Jamie and I had broken into the wrong building! It was the Tory MP’s office that we had broken into and he shared it with a Tory AM. The Tory office was called a different name in a press release and this lead to a misleading story not only by the Echo but the Western Mail as well. I was quite disturbed the media could twist the truth like that!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The court hearing was running late since Jamie and I had requested it to be in the medium of Welsh, I was told it would take place at 10 am, but it ended up happening 5 hours later than that. I don’t think it’s fair that we had to stay in the cell hours longer just because we wanted to go through process in our own language. It’s these little inconveniences that make Welsh speakers cave in and use English: For an language that is under-threat that’s disastrous. Jamie and I were given bail on condition that we would not communicate with each other and &lt;a href="http://cymdeithas.org/2011/03/07/members_of_cymdeithas_yr_iaith_bailed.html"&gt;we were finally released 33 hours after being arrested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jamie and I will be &lt;a href="http://cymdeithas.org/2011/04/26/s4c_in_court_-_campaigners.html"&gt;in court for our final hearing on the 7th of July&lt;/a&gt;, we will have a rally at 12:30pm outside Cardiff Magistrates court. Your support would very much be appreciated (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=143811232355880"&gt;facebook event&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The maximum sentence Jamie and I could receive is 6 months imprisonment although I’m told I’m likely to just get a fine of a few thousand pounds as it’s my first offence. Jamie was on a suspended sentence when we did the direct action so our sentences will probably be different although we are being tried together. Although it has not been an easy experience, I do not regret the direct action against the Tories at all. Our Welsh language TV channel is absolutely essential for the survival of the Welsh language. It’s is for this that reason people were imprisoned for years at a time in the 70’s and 80’s in the campaign to establish it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lobbying and protesting unfortunately is not enough on its own, history shows us that non-violent direct action is an effective form of protest. The Tories promised before the general election that S4C would be safe in their hands but right now it is facing a cut in real terms of 40% and a BBC takeover. After 2015 there are no guarantees of any funding at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can &lt;a href="http://www.cymdeithas.org/darlledu"&gt;contribute to the campaign&lt;/a&gt; in a number of ways: from writing a letter to your MP or refusing to pay your TV licence or come to a meeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-1117447698009389536?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Since then, the government has successfully raised the cap on tuition fees, abolished the Education Maintenance Allowance in England and introduced massive and unprecedented cuts to Education funding. Despite all the high profile protests, dozens of student occupations, publicity about alternative solutions, celebrity appeals and inspiration from popular revolutions in North Africa, the government has managed to begin the implementation its extremist austerity agenda.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One might conclude that the impassioned actions of hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life have come to nothing: that this deeply unpopular government remains unstoppable. However, it would be to underestimate the power of the establishment  to presume that a series of street protests or student occupations alone could bring it down. More than that it would be to misunderstand the nature and direction of the movement that has emerged in opposition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The government has been threatened and accordingly has responded, not with overt oppressive force, which would only escalate the threat it faces by providing a clear apprehensible object of hate that would unite people. Instead, the tactics consist of a string of measures, statements, and policies that encourage us to regard our own individual interests as different from, and in some cases, in conflict with those of others. Our attention is deflected away from a singular establishment that manages and profits from the reordering of our social life, and redirected towards those other ‘individuals’ whom we end up seeing as competitors. Therefore, we find ourselves applauding those political leaders who castigate the bankers; criticising those education workers and students who want more investment in education at the expense of a reduced investment in other public services; demonising those ‘lower ranking’ members of society who ‘drain the public finances’ by being in receipt of ‘unnecessary’ benefits of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their greatest weapon is distraction and division. At the student occupation in Aberystwyth, this is something we encounter every day. When we speak to lecturers, students, and members of the community we receive vocal support. Many people recognise our objectives and are in agreement with our methods but something stops them from supporting us in a more direct way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every occupation suffers from small numbers. Students and staff are too preoccupied with the details and distractions of their own lives to commit to actions that might precipitate real change. They fail to recognise that they are the missing ingredient that is required to reach critical mass; they possess within themselves the possibility of either success or failure. They dwell in a state of constant deferral: they will only act in the future because the present makes too many demands on them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This idea of ‘the future’ is perhaps the most pernicious way of neutering effective resistance. Academics are absorbed in the requirements of accruing research funding; students are intent on balancing their desire for good grades with having a ‘rich student experience’, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What this shows is that at the most profoundest level, the establishment, the object which most hinders our realisation of a truly free life, is located as much inside – within our own self-conceptualisations and motivations – as it is in the very concrete institutions which we feel around us. Those students and, in some cases staff, who remain in occupation see this most clearly. Not only by noting the failure of other academics and students to act on their beliefs, but also through their having made some efforts to reclaim, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-12590768"&gt;through difficult and often exhausting action&lt;/a&gt;, their own present. This offers up countless difficulties because it reveals that in essence the site of the movement’s struggle is situated not just protesting outside the offices of senior management, but in the decisions we make to act now and support one another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strength of this movement, defined largely by student occupations on campuses, lies in the radical shift in thinking and being which they embody. If we are going to mount a genuine challenge to the establishment then those students, staff, and members of the community who as of yet only provide vocal support will need to realise that the future that we want is here now but if it is not to slip away, they have to join the occupations in order to seize it. As &lt;a href="http://aberoccupied.blogspot.com/2011/03/solidarity-from-noam-chomsky.html"&gt;Noam Chomsky puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The protestors in Aberystwyth – like those in Tahrir Square, Maddison Wisconsin, and many other parts of the world – are in the forefront of global struggles for basic rights, freedom, and democracy, and merit full and committed support.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can get into contact with Aber Students against the Cuts by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_106886066049033"&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:aberstudentsagainstcuts@gmail.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-3950817297566670631?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The following day, trade unions in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council were called in to an emergency meeting to be told that the Labour led council was to issue a &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/188"&gt;‘Section 188 Notice’&lt;/a&gt;, with a view to dismissing over 10,000 staff and re-engaging on lesser terms and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The changes were proposed in the context of an anticipated budget shortfall of £60 million over the next three years (which turned out to be £45m). Three areas were to be considered to close the gap; efficiency savings, service provision and staff terms and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The section 188 notice marked the commencement of 90 days negotiations around changes to staff terms and conditions. Throughout the negotiations it was claimed that a collective agreement was preferable and the 188 was just to keep their options open. Yet paert way through negotiations, trade union officers were called in advised that talks were over. With hardly any concessions having been made, the Council were going to impose their proposals unilaterally. Clearly the spirit of cooperation agreed in Westminster was not going to be echoed in RCT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to side step confrontation with the unions – and to be able to avoid the stigma of having sacked 10,000 workers – the council proceeded to offer staff new contracts for them to sign ‘voluntarily’. If anyone was losing money through the process, they would be offered a one off compensation payment the equivalent of one year’s loss. Failure to sign by the 18th of February would result in the compensation offer being withdrawn and a dismissal notice being issued.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some staff chose to return their contracts with a letter of protest, only to find Human Reasources knocking on their door in the evening telling them they had to withdraw their protest, or again, lose compensation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New contracts have now been issued to those that were not bullied or bribed into accepting the first contract. However, this time, failure to sign will result in dismissal. Yet management still maintain that there is no ‘compulsion’ to sign the contract and there has been no ‘duress’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The council’s defence throughout has been that it is avoiding compulsory redundancies and very few staff would suffer any detriment. But a cursory dig beyond the headlines reveals staff losing up to £6,700 a year; over 600 people losing 10% of their wage. The biggest losers being the low paid workers who have to work extra hours or unsocial hours to top up their wages – generally jobs that provide a vital role to the community, such as caring for the elderly or gritting roads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an effort to help close the funding gap, the unions presented the employer with a list of suggestions for efficiency savings from union members. The suggestions were ignored, and the Chief Executive blocked meetings with service directors to discuss savings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The savings made through the changes to staff terms and conditions are around £5.5million. No detail has been provided as to how the other £8.5million will be saved, yet the council still feels confident enough to make promises about no redundancies and no cuts to front line services. The unions are doubtful these promises can be delivered, especially as the council has no idea how they are going to make these efficiency savings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposals were bad enough, but the implementation, the refusal to talk to trade unions, the &lt;a href="http://www.unison.org.uk/cymruwales/pages_view.asp?did=12460"&gt;bully boy tactics&lt;/a&gt; and a succession of factually incorrect statements made to the press has forced to unions to consider industrial action. Council leader, Russel Roberts has publicly stated that he is ‘staggered’ by the union response – conveniently ignoring the fact that it was him that told the trade unions negotiations were at an end despite the consultation period required in law having not been exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On January 24th the Joint Trade Unions and the Welsh Local Government Association signed a &lt;a href="http://www.unison.org.uk/cymruwales/pages_view.asp?did=12372"&gt;memorandum of understanding&lt;/a&gt; on the way forward for savings. RCT chose to rush its proposals through before the memorandum was signed. Roberts has stated that he did not know when it would be agreed and could not wait – despite the fact that officers of the council and the trade unions had discussed a draft version of the memorandum in detail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the Welsh Labour Party Conference in Llandudno, Ed Miliband proclaimed that his party would fight the cuts and that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“a vote for Labour on 5th May was a vote for a different way"&lt;/blockquote&gt;less than a week later, &lt;a href="http://www.rctunison.org.uk/press_statement_240211.htm"&gt;the full council met to approve the budget&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting was quickly adjourned and the council tried to clear the public gallery and conduct its business behind closed doors. Following a walk out of opposition councillors and intervention from the Branch Secretaries of UNISON and the GMB, together with the reluctance of the police in attendance to intervene, common sense prevailed and the meeting continued.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After much party political grandstanding – and the bizarre sight of the Lib Dems making out they were the friends of the workers – the budget was forced through with no dissent from within the Labour Party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whilst “a vote for Labour is a vote for a different way"; there is no guarantee it will be a better way. Clearly the roots of this issue lie in Westminster, but that does not mean Labour councils should be smoothing through the policies of the Coalition and blaming someone else. &lt;a href="http://falseeconomy.org.uk/"&gt;The alternatives to the slash and burn&lt;/a&gt; of the public sector have been widely published by the trade unions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than let employers impose long terms changes on staff to deal with a short term problem, we must all take a more active role in fighting this ideological attack on the public sector. If elected representatives do not represent our views, we must elect someone who does.

The group of young men stand their ground. “It’s blank” shouts one “They won’t shoot.” Another rifle crack. “It’s all right, they’ve only got blank cartridges”. Suddenly, a bullet slams into the throat of a man sitting on the wall, driving him backwards into the garden. Everyone runs, “That’s a bastard shot!” Blood splashes the grass. One of the men cries out as a bullet glances off his thumb, bringing down the man behind him. There is more firing. Three men are down. The two most seriously injured are carried into the house and are laid out, bleeding profusely, on the table in the middle room, where they die. Outside on the railway track Major Brownlow Stuart orders the soldiers of the Worcester Regiment, who have fired the shots, to withdraw to the railway station.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These events occurred not in some beleaguered war zone, but&lt;a href="http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/news/killed-strikers-disrupt-rail-travel/article-2279868-detail/article.html"&gt; in the back garden of a house in Llanelli High Street&lt;/a&gt; on 19th August 1911 during the first ever national railway strike. The last time troops on the British mainland fired on workers during an industrial dispute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neither of the &lt;a href="http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/news/killed-strikers-disrupt-rail-travel/article-2279868-detail/article.html"&gt;two dead men&lt;/a&gt; Leonard Worsell and John "Jac" John were railway workers at all. Leonard was not even a Llanelli resident, he was a Londoner suffering from tuberculosis being treated at Alltymynydd sanatorium on weekend leave in the town. Jac  was was mill worker at the Morewood Tinplate Works. The tinplaters turned out in force in support of the more poorly paid railway workers and were considered some of the most militant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the shootings, strikers, their supporters and other local people rose up, fighting with soldiers and police in a protest at the injustice the community had suffered at the hands of the military. The magistrate who called in the troops who fired the fatal shots, (a shareholder of the Great Western Railway Company) had his shop trashed and looted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strike was a rank-and-file revolt over low pay while the railway company was making massive profits. Despite the expanding economy railway workers were low paid . Infant mortality was high, in that year alone 113 babies died in Llanelli. Yet the railway companies were making record profits and handing out substantial dividends to their shareholders. Whilst railway workers often earned less that £1 for working a 60-72 hour, 6-day week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were about 500 railway workers involved in Llanelli led by John Bevan,  a signalman at Llandilo Junction. However crowds of 5,000 people came out to support the railway workers. Trains were stopped from travelling until soldiers were deployed, the Riot Act read and station gates opened at the point of the bayonet. By the time the strike was over there were 700 soldiers stationed in the town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the events of 1911 are often unknown to many. Whilst &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonypandy_Riots"&gt;Tonypandy&lt;/a&gt; has justly been seared into the consciousness of the Welsh working class, the events at Llanelli a year later were arguably a much more serious confrontation.  Both incidents along with the &lt;a href="http://www.radicalwales.org/2010/11/newport-docks-dispute-1910.html"&gt;Newport Docks Dispute&lt;/a&gt; were part of the Welsh dimension of &lt;a href="http://www.thesyndicalist.org.uk/the-great-unrest-an-overview/"&gt;The Great Unrest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although there has been little official recognition of the strike, there is a rich vein of folk memories. Llanelli’s signature-tune has “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosban_Fach"&gt;Sosban Fach&lt;/a&gt;”, through some of its words, transmits traces of the dramatic events of those days. The verse “Dai bach y soldiwr/ A chwt ei grys e mas” – “Little Dai the soldier/And his shirt tail hanging out”. only appears after 1911 and is surely a reference to the military intervention and the shootings, which had such an impact on popular consciousness. A reference to the fact that the soldiers were surprised by the strikers and had not had time to dress properly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pickets and demonstrators sang “Sosban Fach” as they engaged in the pushing and shoving against police lines, employing serious scrummaging  techniques, defeating the police on a number of occasions. There was an euphoric, carnival atmosphere on the all-night picket lines during the first night of the strike, before the soldiers arrived. There were speeches, tap-dancing contests and a mock election.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this centenary year, the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10210259"&gt;Llanelli Rail Strike Commemoration Committee&lt;/a&gt; is organising &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10243150"&gt;memorial events&lt;/a&gt;.  A week of events is &lt;a href="http://www.llanellitown.com/whats-on-guide/1911-railway-strike-festivities"&gt;planned for 15th - 21st August&lt;/a&gt;, details will appear in the calendar. Meetings and a round table discussion will be held, as will a march and rally, a poetry evening and a graveside ceremony. &lt;a href="http://www.llanelliyouththeatre.co.uk/"&gt;Llanelli Youth Theatre&lt;/a&gt; is putting on a play with music, and the internationally renowned director Michael Bogdanov will be directing &lt;a href="http://www.academi.org/writers-of-wales/i/138222/"&gt;Liz Morgan&lt;/a&gt;’s play “According to the Regulations” at Glenalla Hall. The memory of&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/28/reviving-working-class-history-wales"&gt; the working class martyrs of Llanelli &lt;/a&gt;will not be forgotten. If anybody has ideas or would like to help or take part, especially if you have experience fundraising, please &lt;a href="http://tim.l.evans@btinternet.com/"&gt;get in contact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
On the weekend of the 4th - 6th March 2011 Cardiff will be the venue for not one but two government party conferences.  The  Conservative Party will be  hosting their &lt;a href="http://www.conservatives.com/Get_involved/Conference.aspx"&gt;Spring Forum at the Swelec Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the Welsh Lib Dems will be having their &lt;a href="http://welshlibdems.org.uk/en/conference.html"&gt;party conference just down the road at the Angel Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Prime Minister himself, David Cameron will be be coming to make a keynote speech to the party faithful on the Saturday afternoon. We should give him the welcome he deserves to ensure he knows that his cost-cutting policies are not popular with the poorest in society.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His speech is already pretty much written: &lt;i&gt;“Thank you for your wonderful Welsh welcome… blah blah… the cuts are necessary and tough decisions have to be made by everyone… a reference to recent Ashes victory… If we all work as team we can get through this together… "&lt;/i&gt;. Toad-like Welsh conservative leader Nick Bourne will lead the standing ovation, before staking a subtle claim for his surely inevitable seat in the House of Lords.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But Tory self-congratulation aside the 'Big Society' is not going to work and his policy makers know it. The organisations and charities that help the most vulnerable in society are suffering harsh cuts. Many will have to cease operation or be forced to abandon neutrality further and take funding from corporations. This will mean in some areas there will be little or no help for the poorest and most vulnerable including asylum seekers, people with debt issues and those with mental health problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His policies were started by his mentor and political hero Margaret Thatcher in 1980s, breaking the unions and imposing unjust laws. This coalition government intends to carry on in her tradition: support business, the rich and the warmongers and ignore everyone else.    But cracks are beginning to show. The ConDems have already felt the anger of students in recent demonstrations at the end of 2010, which saw a rise of militant protest not seen on the streets for many years. This has given experienced (often jaded) activists encouragement and a new mood of solidarity between diverse groups and campaigns is emerging.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the coalition already showing signs of weakness with their &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/16/forests-sell-off-cameron-uturn"&gt;u-turn on the sell off of the forests&lt;/a&gt;. Local grassroots groups around the country are campaign against the raft of austerity measures, closures, sell offs and other issues.  Trade Unions are beginning to mobilise the thousands of public sector workers who will be affected by a raft of extremely deep cuts. A new social movement concerned with tax justice has begun to coalesce around the effective actions of &lt;a href="http://ukuncut.org.uk/"&gt;UKUncut&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Wales we have a referendum on 3rd March followed by assembly elections in May. David Cameron would doubtless like to announce some kind of victory when he speaks on the 5th. As an anarchist I think we should all seriously consider refusing to play their political games and not go to the polling stations: not to encourage political apathy or disengagement, but to actively send a message to politicians of all parties that we have heard too many lies and too little truth.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We should be on the streets when the ConDem circus comes to town. 'Official' demonstrations have already been called, with the Welsh TUC having decided to do the police's job for them by limiting themselves to a ticket-only “free speech zone” some distance from either event. Doubtless more will be announced, check the calendar for details in the days ahead. But don't wait to be told what to do, make plans and be creative on the day. Be mobile and make the 5th March a day of chaos and confusion for the Tory toffs. This is a rare and valuable chance to really show conman Cameron what we think of him.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-8319716953207711053?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Now there’s a coincidence. The cuts that the ConDems are imposing on us will have a profound impact on our society for generations to come. From the extra strain on our public services to our ‘jobless generation’ it will change the face of Wales. What people do not necessarily take into consideration is how the cuts are going to threatan our identity as distinct people.  After 700 years of being ruled by our big next door neighbour, what we were left with as a symbol of our identity was our language.  The ConDem’s plans to hack away at public services as well as their decision to put and end to S4C as we know it could be the final blow that could kill the Welsh language.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Statisticaly, the number of Welsh speakers is on the rise. Although this is heartening, a rise in the number of speakers does not necessarily mean that the language is in a healthy state. Latin,  although being spoken by many, is a 'dead' languauge. In no part of the world is Latin the community language or the language of the home and the same must be kept in mind when we look at the situation with Welsh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although spoken more within the classroom, it is becoming less and less a community language. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly young people who have learnt Welsh at school are bombarded by the capitalist anglo-american popular culture. The SRG (Sin Roc Gymraeg - Welsh language music scene) is scarcely known whilst Welsh language films and television aimed at 15-30 year olds, are few and far between and do not have the resources to compete. Young Welsh speakers therefore see English as a language that they can relate to better in their social lives.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second reason is that Welsh speaking heartlands are deprived areas. There is an exodus from places like Gwynedd to other parts of Wales and the UK in the search for work. The austerity measures will be a catalyst to this process. Gwynedd has a workforce heavily dependent on the public sector (60%) and the huge cuts in this area will rip apart the few Welsh speaking communites left.    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another way the austerity measures will have a severe impact on the Welsh language, is by the abolishment of S4C as an&amp;nbsp;independent&amp;nbsp;Welsh language channel. The department for culture sport and media will cut their funding to the channel by 95%. Though the BBC will fund some of the difference, S4C will lose 40% of its original funding in real terms and will have to compete with other departments in the BBC for funding after 2015. What worries people most of all is that by becoming part of the BBC, it will compromise the independance of the channel.  We must remember that the BBC is the ‘British Broadcasting Corperation’ in essence the state broadcaster, which is why so much disproportionate attention will be given to the royal wedding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is scarcely better than the situation of Welsh language broadcasting before S4C was established. The &lt;a href="http://cymdeithas.org/pdf/s4c-pwy-dalodd-amdani.pdf"&gt;campaign for S4C during the 70s and 80s&lt;/a&gt; was long and costly.&amp;nbsp;Thousands of people in Wales broke the law by refusing to pay the TV licence, hundreds were arrested, fined and spent time in prison. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) activists like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=95E9AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA111&amp;amp;dq=Ffred+Ffransis&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=LLYTTbbeK42ShAeEy_22Dg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Ffred%20Ffransis&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Ffred Ffransis spent  3 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; as a result of taking non-violent direct action. Gwynfor Evans in all seriousness gave Thatcher an ultimatum that he would go on hunger strike to the death unless the Tories&amp;nbsp;delivered&amp;nbsp;on their promises regarding a channel. 'The lady’s not for turning'? After decades of campaigning we turned her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These extreme and admirable actions reflect the importance of S4C to us as a nation. The future of the language is dependant on whether young people can identify with Welsh as a modern ‘young’ language. Welsh language on the television is an essential part of normalising the language and giving our culture a platform from where it can ‘compete’ with the anglo american mainstream that seeps into everyone's homes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S4C is so precious to the Welsh language, that its funding is protected by law, meaning these proposed cuts are in fact illegal. The Tories answer to this is to change the law. Going through the House of Lords during this time is the public bodies bill that not only will give them the power to make these devastating cuts and changes but it will allow for S4C to be abolished completley after 2015.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Welsh speaker or not, it is essential that all unite in solidarity to fight all these&amp;nbsp;austerity&amp;nbsp;measures. In Ireland it has been the acceptance of the government's right wing policies that pushed them even deeper into economic turmoil. These cuts will mean misery for millions and will not boost the economy; if the consumers don't have jobs they can't spend! It makes  no economic sense and is purely ideological. The Tories are taking advantage of the ‘economic crisis’ to push their right wing agenda. One that could mean suffering and hardship as well as the end of the Welsh language.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far Cymdeithas have organised a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailypost.co.uk/business-news/business-news/2010/12/06/hundreds-out-for-caernarfon-cuts-protest-55578-27773200/"&gt;rally against the cuts in Caernarfon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/11/06/video-s4c-rally-held-in-cardiff-91466-27613495/"&gt;rally in Cardiff against cuts facing S4C&lt;/a&gt; and in January &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12321913"&gt;occupied the BBC in Llandaff&lt;/a&gt;. The situation is urgent and we must act now. After the public bodies bill is past then it will be much more dificult to have an impact.&amp;nbsp;Keep updated with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cymdeithas.org/english"&gt;Cymdeithas news in English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2257567961"&gt;find us on facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or come to one of meetings arranged across Wales. These meetings will discuss how we will fight the cuts facing S4C and our communities. One way you can help save S4C now is to simply stop paying for your TV licence and &lt;a href="mailto:post@cymdeithas.org"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; that you are joining the boycott.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-2755192824352088003?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Widely regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals of our age, deemed one of the fathers of modern linguistics, it was  his opposition to the Vietnam War that really brought him to public attention. As an outspoken critic of the global hegemony of the United States and neo-liberal capitalism, he has become hugely well known despite little mainstream media coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I emailed Noam Chomsky on 27th April 2010 inviting him to speak at Cardiff University.  I didn't in my wildest dreams expect that he would get back to me, but he did. It wasn't a response from his secretary or assistant,  but from the Professor himself, only a few hours after I emailed him. I knew he was the most cited living author, but now I realised he's probably the most modest living author too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The title of the talk was chosen by Chomsky himself from a list of several options I sent him. He chose it because as the issue has always been so important he has spoken on it before over the years and it never fails to be a pertinent title.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blocked by Israel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This speech comes at a time of extreme tension in the Middle East. Israel is piling its tanks and infantry at the borders of Gaza and Lebanon, in preparation for imminent use; military aggression that political analysts expect to be more destructive and deadly than ever before. With the background of rising tension between the Iranian and the American government, Chomsky stressed that it is vital to bring in Iran when talking about Palestine and Israel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As one of the Friends of Palestine here at Cardiff University, inviting Noam Chomsky to come and speak gained added resonance when he was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/16/israel-noam-chomsky-palestinian-west-bank"&gt;denied entry to occupied Palestine&lt;/a&gt; by Israeli border control. Though the Israeli interior ministry attempted to publicly backtrack, Noam himself was typically matter of fact about the affair:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the government of Israel doesn't like the kinds of things I say, which puts them into the same category as every other government in the world".&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brought up in a Zionist Jewish setting, he is highly critical of the policies of Israel towards Palestinians, in keeping with his wider world view. Chomsky not only highlights the US government's support for dictatorships and opposition to democratic governments. He goes further by analysing how self-acclaimed democratic regimes such as the USA and UK exploit popular media to control the public, the same end point for any classical dictatorship throughout history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After inviting Noam Chomsky and getting his approval, I was keen (along with a group of friends who were aware of the correspondence) on getting the support of as many organisations in Wales that support the politics and views of Noam Chomsky to make this event as versatile and non-partisan as possible. This of course includes &lt;a href="http://southwalesanarchists.wordpress.com/"&gt;South Wales Anarchists&lt;/a&gt;; Chomsky himself labels his politics as Libertarian Socialism, specifically &lt;a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm"&gt;anarcho-syndicalism&lt;/a&gt;.  He has repeatedly come under fire for his anarchism being incompatible with his tactical support for reformist measures, something he has robustly rebuked:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One can, of course, take the position that we don't care about the problems people face today, and want to think about a possible tomorrow. OK, but then don't pretend to have any interest in human beings and their fate, and stay in the seminar room and intellectual coffee house with other privileged people. Or one can take a much more humane position: I want to work, today, to build a better society for tomorrow -- the classical anarchist position..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome in Wales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It took less than 24 hours for all 1645 seats in St David's Hall to sell out for this lecture, simply because the speaker is Noam Chomsky.  Though unpopular with most governments and corporate interests, he stands alone with unparalleled popularity with the public as an intellectual. The overwhelming interest isn't merely because he is a renowned scholar, but because he is willing to take on uncomfortable issues as a political activist. The ban by Israel is a testament to his political integrity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This talk was organised with the help and support of a wide platform of activist and anti-war groups in Cardiff, including The Friends of Palestine, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4403463641"&gt;Cardiff University Green Party&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/"&gt; Stop the War Coalition&lt;/a&gt; in Cardiff, &lt;a href="http://www.cardiffisoc.co.uk/"&gt;Cardiff University Islamic society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=123536235354"&gt;Cardiff Students Against War&lt;/a&gt;, South Wales Anarchists and last but not least, this very website, Radical Wales.&lt;br /&gt;

To mark this anniversary, vigils have been held in the US, in the UK and around the world. In Wrexham, an information stall was held in the town centre, highlighting the effect of the war on Iraq's children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By January 1991, Iraqis had already been suffering months of punishing sanctions. In the 8 months from August 1990, these were estimated to have killed 47,000 children under the age of 5 [&lt;a href="http://www.unicef.org/"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;]. Millions more babies and children were malnourished and not receiving the medical care they needed because food and medical supplies were not allowed into Iraq even though these items were expressly excluded from the sanctions. The results were nothing short of catastrophic for the Iraqi people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On New Year's Day 1991, two weeks before the bombing began, four anti-war activists entered Griffiss Air Force Base in New York and disabled a B52 bomber, putting it out of action for the duration of the Gulf War. Remanded in custody pending trial and watching the war unfold on the jail TV set, one of them wrote:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the outset, the military conflict has been presented as a Nintendo Game, free of serious consequence. Forty-four thousand bombing missions flown with no casualties shown, very cynical, very slick, very marketable. As death and destruction is reduced to blips on a video screen, dialogue is reduced to a discussion of technique: "how we will win?" rather than "why are we there?" The conflict is stripped of history, politics, economics with pivotal issues ignored and forgotten....Who armed Saddam Hussein? Who supported him, in the eight year war with Iran? Who created Kuwait and why? Does anyone remember the Shah? [&lt;a href="http://www.indymedia.ie/article/98592"&gt;Ciaron O'Reilly, 1991&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 'official' TV presentation of the war was very far from the truth. Tens of thousands were killed during the bombing but the real mass killing of civilians was still 'work in progress', as a planned longer term result of the 'precision warfare' which had decimated Iraq's infrastructure. Power production, food production, transportation, healthcare, education, water treatment and sewerage were all effectively put out of action, a tactic which has been described as &lt;a href="http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-myth.htm"&gt;'bomb now, die later&lt;/a&gt;'. Without their life sustaining infrastructure and with ongoing crippling sanctions, Iraqi civilians were left to die of disease and malnutrition. Children, especially babies, were the most vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sanctions remained in place in the years between 1991 and the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. Although measures such as the Oil-for-Food programme were introduced to reduce the suffering of the civilian population and to silence mounting criticism of the sanctions, these are widely considered to have failed miserably. High ranking &lt;a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6081.htm"&gt;UN officials resigned&lt;/a&gt; in protest. A &lt;a href="http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm"&gt;UNICEF report&lt;/a&gt; found that between 1991 and 1998 half a million babies and children under 5 died in Iraq over and above the expected death rate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Extensive use of &lt;a href="http://www.cadu.org.uk/info/iraq/7_1.htm"&gt;depleted uranium&lt;/a&gt; weaponry in the southern battlefields around Basra turned the Gulf War into a nuclear war, with levels of cancers and birth defects in the area now comparable with those seen in the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. The cocktail of poisons rained on Fallujah by the US-led coalition in 2004 has led to a &lt;a href="http://www.sott.net/articles/show/221466-Iraq-Study-Shows-High-Rate-of-Fallujah-Birth-Defects"&gt;similar situation&lt;/a&gt; there, with high numbers of spontaneous abortions, nearly a quarter of all babies dying in the first seven days after birth and three-quarters of these having visible deformities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 2003 US- and UK-led invasion of Iraq brought an end to UN sanctions, small comfort given the death and destruction visited on the long-suffering Iraqi people in Operation Iraqi Liberation, which was hastily renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom after critics made the obvious connection between the initials of the original name and the real reason for the war. A few days after the 2003 bombing started, UK reporter &lt;a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk03252003.html"&gt;Robert Fisk&lt;/a&gt; wrote about the child victims and the media circus that presented them as heart-wrenching news stories for the West: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is something sick, obscene about these hospital visits. We bomb. They suffer. Then we turn up and take pictures of their wounded children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since 2003, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties"&gt;it is estimated&lt;/a&gt; that well over a million more Iraqi civilians have died, many of these killed by the 'liberating' coalition forces or caught up in the violence which accompanied a deteriorating security situation. Many children have been killed or maimed by the vast numbers of unexploded cluster 'bomblets' which litter the land. Whole families have been killed in bombing raids allegedly targeting militants. 5 million Iraqi children have now lost at least one parent. Half a million children are homeless and living on the streets. 4 million Iraqis have been internally displaced or have sought refuge outside Iraq. There are continuing shortages of food, clean water, medicines and other essentials. The security situation continues to pose a threat to all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.wpjf.org.uk/"&gt;Wrexham Peace and Justice Forum&lt;/a&gt; and supporters organised a stall in Wrexham town centre on 15 January with a display of information about the effects of war and sanctions on Iraqi children. Dozens of pairs of children's shoes were displayed alongside the information as a visual reminder of Iraq's lost children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stall included information about &lt;a href="http://www.radicalwales.org/2011/01/bradley-manning-solidarity-from-wales.html"&gt;Bradley Manning&lt;/a&gt;, who stands accused of leaking a video of a &lt;a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/"&gt;US helicopter attack&lt;/a&gt; which killed over 12 people including two Reuters journalists and seriously injured two children. Campaigners around the world are using this anniversary to call for Bradley Manning's release and for his proper and humane treatment while in custody. Bradley Manning's mother is Welsh and he spent three years here in his teens, attending a high school in South Wales. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In the recent elections millions of people did not vote, and millions more voted reluctantly and without enthusiasm; most of these will not vote in the next election.  They can see that, at bottom, there is little difference between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Millions of people, perhaps the majority, can see this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the beginning, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been condemned by radicals as wrong morally, militarily and politically. The West has lost in Afghanistan and is losing in Iraq.  People are sick of these wars and do not believe in the politicians, politics and parties who sold them the war. Millions of people can see this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Practically since its inception, Left politics has said that capitalism cannot create a better society, that it is based on exploitation and subject to crisis. The current economic crisis and the cuts that are hitting society have shown the brutal reality of capitalism. Millions of people can see this. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The radical analysis has been proved right. Yet, these millions are not drawn into the orbit of the radical politics. Why? Why are radicals isolated from the masses of people in society, with so little influence? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Partly, it is the ‘objective conditions’; Britain is a first world country that benefits from imperialism, and the whole of society, even the working class, benefits to some extent. However, it seems that many of the first world privileges will now disappear with the cuts, and as a consequence, many people will be drawn to radical ideas and movements, either of the left or the right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there are also problems with the ‘subjective forces’. The disparate radical forces do not present a coherent line, plan or program. Let us take the left-wing groups in Cardiff as an example. Aside from the Anarchists, who have their own problems, the main Marxist groups are the Trotskyist &lt;a href="http://www.swp.org.uk/"&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (SWP), the &lt;a href="http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/main/Home"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (SP), and the remnants of the once influential ‘official’ Communist Party, now called the &lt;a href="http://communist-party.org.uk/"&gt;Communist Party of Britain&lt;/a&gt; (CPB). The CPB have some influence among the trade union bureaucracy, but not much, and they are largely a spent force. Their political line does not differ much in practice from the SWP and the SP, but their cadres tend to be older, and they do not have much support amongst younger people, for whom the USSR is just history. There are other smaller groups, but they are insignificant.  All these groups claim descent from the Russian Bolsheviks, but there is really no plan for revolution, as they have no mass base. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the absence of a revolutionary plan, they instead try and influence the Labour Party or pretend they are the old Labour party. In the absence of a mass base, they instead organise amongst students. They have been doing this for a while and it has led to nothing. So, I make the following suggestions: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Break with Labour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Labour Party is, for people under a certain age, the party of Blair and Brown. It cannot be reclaimed to what it supposedly was in the past, nostalgia means nothing for the young; old Labour is not even a memory. Forget trying to set up new versions of old Labour under a new name, such as Socialist Alliance or Respect.  These have failed dismally. Do not think that by supporting ‘left’ Labour politicians you can influence the Labour party or you can ‘use’ a professional politician to further your ends-you cannot; they will use you. Stop nominating Labour politicians to head coalitions, speak as honoured guests on platforms, and benefit from popular discontent. Stop channelling popular protest back into electoral politics. Labour party (or Plaid Cymru) politicians can join but should never lead popular mass campaigns, because they will lead it back into electoral politics. This is what happened with the anti-war movement (Stop the War Coalition headed by Tony Benn), the Anti-Fascist movement (&lt;a href="http://www.unitewales.org.uk/"&gt;Unite against Fascism Wales&lt;/a&gt; headed by Peter Hain!) and will probably happen with the anti-cuts movement. Break with Labour and do not support Plaid Cymru; do not lead people disillusioned with electoral politics back into electoral politics by the back door. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Leave the University&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Radical politics is largely based in the university. In the summer vacation, the students go home and there is little activity, until the start of the new term and the students return. Students are important for any political movement, but no movement can be based just on students - most will leave when their course ends. They are not rooted in the community. Radicals in Cardiff must seek to organise in areas such as Butetown, Riverside, and Ely, not just in the university area of Cathays. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dissolve the existing Left groups-set up something new&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The existing radical culture is not attractive to the majority of people, because of the sectarian infighting of the parties, the insincere politics of front groups, and the weird leftist subculture. Many of the cadre of the SWP and SP leave after a few years, disillusioned with radical politics, as they realise that these parties cannot achieve much and are tired of competing against other similar groups. Some stay in the parties not out of positive belief in their programs, but in desperation at the lack of anything better. It would be better for these parties to dissolve, to allow for something new to emerge. I am sure that there is enough experience and intelligence amongst Cardiff radical activists to create something better, without the nonsense of the existing left. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it stands, the radicals do not pose any threat to the state or to capitalism. Disillusionment with the political system, the disaster of the Afghan and Iraq wars, and the financial crisis present big opportunities for radicals. But unless the radicals radically change, this opportunity will surely be lost.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-4200072803296734138?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

What can we do here in Wales to support him?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In brief, Bradley Manning is a  young man, aged 23, an intelligence analyst with the US Military. He stands accused of unauthorised disclosure of US classified information, including  the &lt;a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/"&gt;Collateral Murder&lt;/a&gt;' video and the '&lt;a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010/"&gt;Afghan War Diary&lt;/a&gt;'. These  disclosures confirm what most of us already knew: that the invading  and occupying forces in Iraq have killed civilians in unprovoked  attacks and have lied about these attacks to cover their backs; that  the war being waged on/in Afghanistan is an unmitigated disaster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is further  suspected of releasing hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak"&gt;diplomatic  cables&lt;/a&gt; which, amongst all the trivia, demonstrate how the US  operates across the planet - as a serial bully intent on full spectrum domination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently held in Quantico military jail, Virginia, in &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14/manning"&gt;solitary confinement&lt;/a&gt; and  with little or no access to daylight, fresh air or exercise,  "tortuous conditions that are proven to cause mental  deterioration" [US Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's  Prisons], he has been subjected to these &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment"&gt;cruel and unusual  punishments&lt;/a&gt; for over seven months now, but has yet to be tried or  convicted of any crime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Irrespective of  whether he actually carried out the acts he is suspected of  and  irrespective of whether he is ultimately convicted, he is a casualty  of the typically repressive treatment of whistleblowers everywhere,  designed to discourage others from speaking out in the face of  injustice and cover-up. For instance, &lt;a href="http://www.peaceheroes.com/MordecaiVanunu/mordecaivanunu.htm"&gt;Mordechai Vanunu&lt;/a&gt;, who blew the whistle on Israel's nuclear weapons programme, was jailed for 18 years, spent 12 of them in solitary confinement and is still not free to travel or to communicate with the outside world. Such treatment is  designed to let us know that we live in a world where honesty,  openness and integrity, particularly when it exposes things the  imperial powers would prefer us not to know, will be severely  punished. There have even been calls from right-wing Republicans for  Bradley Manning’s &lt;a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/bradley-manning-wikileaks-mike-huckabee-calls-execution-2734390.html"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt;. He is likely to spend  the rest of his life behind bars, unless such a groundswell of  public pressure and outrage at his incarceration makes a lengthy  detention politically impossible to sustain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bradley Manning's mother is Welsh.  He lived in Wales for three years when a teenager and was educated  at a local high school. His mother and extended maternal family  still live in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A bit of Welsh history&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here in Wales, there is a long tradition of peace work and antimilitarism, social justice movements and international solidarity. 150+ years ago, there was Henry Richard of Tregaron, whose work included an organising role in the Worldwide Peace Congress in Brussels in 1848 and persuading Gladstone’s government to accept a motion that it was the duty of His Majesty’s Government to recommend a reduction in Europe’s armaments. Then there was George Maitland Lloyd Davies, one-time Wrexham bank manager and Welsh Fusilier, who was subsequently elected to Parliament as a Christian Pacifist and later became a Presbyterian minister.  He was sent to jail as a conscientious objector more than once during the First World War and played a part in early peace talks with Ireland, acting as a bridge between de Valera and Lloyd George.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cymdeithas y Cymod, the Fellowship of Reconciliation in Wales, has protested the forced removal of the residents of Mynydd Epynt since 1940 when the land was seized from the locals by the War Office, and is now protesting against the testing of drones in the airspace above the evicted land. It was women from Wales who established the Greenham Common peace camp following the ‘Women for Life on Earth’ march from Penarth to Greenham organised by Anne Pettit, and another Welsh woman, Helen Thomas, who lost her life there in 1989 after being hit by a police vehicle. Activists from Wales, some of them elderly, were sent to jail in the 80s for failing to pay fines imposed for their symbolic acts of resistance at nuclear installations during the 'Snowball' Campaign. There is a Temple of Peace in Cardiff and proposals for a Welsh Peace Institute to be established. There are strong international solidarity campaigns in Wales including Palestine Solidarity campaign, Cymru-Cuba and Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign. There are still many active local peace and justice groups across Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What can we do?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;In the tradition of peace, justice and support for the oppressed, we are surely capable of mounting a solidarity campaign for Bradley Manning here in Wales. Responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures or not, he is in prison for anyone who has ever protested US wars of aggression and British (and other countries’) complicity in these wars, questioned government cover-ups or argued for openness, transparency and accountability. He is there, likely for the long term, in all our names and we need to speak out for him wherever we are. Exposing war crimes is not a crime!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My suggestion is that, in the first instance, we ask performers, preachers, politicians, poets, writers and anyone else we can think of in the Welsh public eye to make statements in support of Bradley Manning. If you know anyone who fits the bill, please talk to them about Bradley and his Welsh connections, send them some background information and ask if they will make a statement to the press, on their blog or website and forward a copy (with a link to the original) to wrexhamsaw@yahoo.com (Wrexham Peace &amp;amp; Justice Forum) where I will collate them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The majority of the planned cuts are at best harsh, at worst a cynical attempt to keep the rich rich and the poor firmly in their place.  However, for people who believe in peace the 8% cut in the defence budget is at least a step in the right direction.  One particular aspect of this 8% reduction has been seen as a particular cause for celebration: &lt;a href="http://itvwales.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/st-athan-military-training-camp-scrapped-in-defence-spending-review/"&gt;the cancellation of the proposed £14billion St. Athan Military Academy&lt;/a&gt;.  The headline of a subsequent &lt;a href="http://www.cndcymru.org/relief-and-joy-at-st-athan-military-college-cancellation"&gt;CND Cymru press release&lt;/a&gt; in response to the cancellation declared&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Relief and Joy at St Athan Military College Cancellation”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But in their haste to declare victory on this issue, there is a danger of allowing a lesser, but still significant, defeat for the&amp;nbsp;campaign, as the government has shown no loss of desire for a military training project in St Athan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The St. Athan Military Academy was announced to great fanfare in January 2007, billed as by far the biggest single investment in Wales at that time.  Politicians fell over themselves to declare that the installation, scheduled to be built on the site of the existing St. Athan RAF base, would create more than 5,000 jobs (&lt;a href="http://www.antimetrix.org/2010/09/st-athan-defence-training-college.html"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt;) and revolutionise the training of the British armed forces.  Naturally, the Welsh Assembly government also leapt at the chance to welcome such a large-scale investment in Wales, estimated at the time to be in the region of £11billion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from the size and scale of the project, the announcement was also used as an opportunity to show just how much faith the New Labour government was willing to place in controversial &lt;a href="http://www.unison.org.uk/pfi/index.asp"&gt;Private Finance Initiatives (PFI)&lt;/a&gt;.  PFI involves at its core allowing private firms to front a share of the capital for ostensibly public, government-administered projects, and many commentators have labelled the use of PFI in schools and hospitals as essentially the part-privatisation of public services.  It is not difficult to see, with the scale of the investment and the military nature of the project, why the use of PFI at St. Athan would prove to be so contentious.  It was, however, the choice of private bedfellow in this particular use of PFI that made it particularly unpalatable for many people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The government’s PFI partner in this case came in the shape of Metrix UK.  Metrix was conceived as a consortium consisting at its core of a partnership between Land Securities (the largest commercial property company in the UK, whose share of the partnership was later taken by catering and site-management company &lt;a href="http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=347"&gt;Sodexo&lt;/a&gt;), and British ‘defence technology' giant &lt;a href="http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=2065"&gt;QinetiQ&lt;/a&gt;, which counts among its major backers the politically well-connected Carlyle Group.  But as with any consortium, aside from the main partners there were many other backers involved, and one in particular would raise most eyebrows, namely the American missile manufacturer &lt;a href="http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=139"&gt;Raytheon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Raytheon is the largest producer of guided missiles on the planet.  Militaries around the world boast the pick of Raytheon’s product catalogue among their arsenal, including Israel who used Raytheon hardware to murder 28 civilians in an &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5228554.stm"&gt;attack on Qana village, Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; during the war of 2006.  This led to nine peace activists in Northern Ireland, nicknamed the &lt;a href="http://www.raytheon9.org/"&gt;‘Raytheon Nine’&lt;/a&gt;, to occupy the Raytheon plant operating at the time in Derry.  The Nine were charged with terrorism offences, but acquitted in 2008 after the judge dismissed the case.  During the trial, the activists publicly accused Raytheon of actively aiding Israel in the persecution of war crimes.  Raytheon has also been accused of involvement with cluster bomb technology, the use of which many countries have outlawed and also labelled as a war crime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were &lt;a href="http://cardiffpr.wordpress.com/2007/10/15/wales-does-not-need-the-st-athan-death-academy/"&gt;many angles of opposition to the Military Academy&lt;/a&gt;.  You don't need to be a peace activist to object to the spending of billions of pounds on one project (the estimated cost rose from £11billion when announced to £14billion at cancellation); or the £50m spent by the MoD to prepare the site for construction; or the £5m spent by the Welsh Assembly in so-called consultation fees in the three years since the project was given the go-ahead.  Although the latter two amounts have been wasted, it is a comforting victory of sorts for those with purely financial objections that the project has been pulled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, for people who &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbjvqkD6Zr4"&gt;protested against the Academy in Cardiff in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, although the cost certainly represents a horrendously misguided use of public money, it is the nature of the project itself and of its corporate backers which provokes most opposition.  The idea of British and foreign militaries being trained in the art of death and destruction by the industrial manufacturers of the technology of war is rightly abhorrent to any anti-militarist or pacifists. &lt;a href="http://antiwar.com/orig/pilger.php?articleid=13508"&gt;John Pilger summed it up&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a British "School of the Americas" is to be built in Wales, where British soldiers will train killers from all corners of the American empire in the name of 'global security.'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is because of this that we should pay close attention to the words of the government ministers who announced the axing of the academy.  David Cameron stated to MPs:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“This is not the end of the road for training at St Athan”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Defence Secretary Liam Fox went further, saying of St. Athan,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“we still hope to base our future defence training solution there”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-11571849"&gt;Plans for a scaled-down version of the original complex appear to be very much alive&lt;/a&gt;, and it would be a disaster if we were so busy&lt;a href="http://www.cymdeithasycymod.org.uk/saintathan-saesneg.htm"&gt; celebrating ‘victory’&lt;/a&gt; with the axing of the £14billion plan that, say, a £5billion plan was able to slip through quietly behind our backs.  We must not allow a case of ‘we can’t afford it right now but it will happen in some form in the future’ to camouflage itself as ‘it was a horrific idea which should never have been conceived of and will never be allowed to happen.’  The &lt;a href="http://www.antimetrix.org/"&gt;movement to oppose St. Athan Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; needs to keep its defences firmly on alert.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-4430478369682929140?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

If for the purpose of this article we put aside the issue of climate change and take this statement at face value, even then we can see that this does not tell the full story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we take for example three major natural disasters over the last decade and in each case it was the response to these events or lack of response in reality that caused much of the destruction. Seen in the cases of the 2004 &lt;a href="http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/1512"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2010/01/model-haiti-excerpt-shock-doctrine"&gt;Haitian earthquake&lt;/a&gt; and particularly with &lt;a href="http://www.socialistworld.net/print/1899"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, a natural disaster which hit the world's superpower, the United States were shamed by their response, exacerbated  by the much better response by the Cuban regime as the same hurricane hit Cuba first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously the recent snow in Wales and the rest of Britain has not in any way been of the same magnitude, yet there are similarities. Much of the disruption and risk to peoples safety could have easily been avoided. That is, of course, if the capitalist drive for short term profit is taken out of the equation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The advances in weather forecasting, whilst not always 100% accurate were able to predict well in advance the oncoming snow. Yet local authorities did not adequately prepare to avert serious problems. The usual half hearted gritting occurred in some areas, yet local authorities have said openly they &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8509543.stm"&gt;limited this as to keep enough stockpiled&lt;/a&gt; for the whole winter. Yet this leads to a completely ineffectual cost-cutting exercises which will mean councils can publicly say they have enough grit to last through and have been out gritting, nice soundbites but the reality has meant that roads in the large remain iced and dangerous. A situation unlikely to change when councils are carrying out huge cuts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though it is clear that gritting for the latest round of snow was completely redundant anyway, the grit could have absolutely no effect once it is buried under eight inches of snow, yet the same limited road gritting continued by local authorities in drone fashion. This led to many major access roads, such as Llantrisant road in Pontypridd, (used heavily by commuters on the way to work) being completely inpassable with scenes of many cars simply abandoned by the drivers as it was impossible to go anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of this inadequate response, the local authorities who were fully aware of the scale of the oncoming snow should have employed whole teams of people to shovel snow from roads and pavements, of course provided with adequate equipment to work in this weather. Many council vehicles, with some investment and adaption, could have been fitted with snow plows to clear the roads and snow tyres or chains fitted to vehicles which could transport around nurses, doctors and other essential workers to aid the care for the most vunerable and at risk from the cold weather. This could have gone along way to ensuring a safe environment in this bad weather and would have had a serious effect of the unemployment figures albeit temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course whilst all four main parties in Wales are spreading the&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8094605.stm"&gt; mantra&lt;/a&gt; that we have to make cutbacks as somekind of universal truth then this unfortunately is not likely to happen, central government have already made it clear that equipment to deal with snow in the future has to be 'balanced against other services, as something else will have to go if we invest here'. The reality has been cars sliding of the road, or stuck and situations where the safest place for pedestrians, particularly the most vunerable who are unsteady on their feet is to walk in the middle of the road as no obvious attempt has been made to clear the footpaths even now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This issue is a prime example of how politics affects everything and how it always has a direct effect on us. I've already used the example of the inadequate response of the Rhonnda Cynon Taf council which covers Pontypridd, but it seems very doubtful that a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11641538"&gt;Labour council currently threatening to sack 10,000&lt;/a&gt; of its workforce is likely to put the safety of it residents first by employing anyone to clear the streets, and this is the same for every local authority in Wales which have one by one committed themselves to cutting back to make ordinary people pay the rich man's debt.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-1411976754274810371?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In the past my generation saw &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm"&gt;massive public opposition&lt;/a&gt; to the war in Iraq swept aside by an arrogant prime minister, convinced by his own &lt;a href="http://iraqdossier.com/blairslies"&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; that he had no obligations to the will of the people whom he supposedly represented, and popular dissent seemed to wither away as a result. Now though, we once again face an ultra-right wing government bent on a campaign of ideological scorched earth not seen since the dark days of &lt;a href="http://isthatcherdeadyet.co.uk/"&gt;Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the new flowerings of dissent has come in the shape of the &lt;a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/"&gt;UK Uncut&lt;/a&gt; movement, although “movement” seems like too strong a word for something that is little more than an online message. The message goes like this – make the greedy corporations who (legally) evade their tax liabilities in the UK pay a fair share of tax, and in so doing, put the missing money into the government’s coffers that would pay for nearly everything that is being cut back. Watching from behind the safety of my laptop screen, it was frustrating to see the protests explode across the country while nothing seemed to be happening in Cardiff.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Saturday 18th December that changed, with a demonstration outside Topshop, part of the Arcadia Group. This is run by &lt;a href="http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2010/08/13/sir-philip-green-the-wrong-man-to-head-a-review-of-public-spending/"&gt;Philip Green&lt;/a&gt;, but it is “owned” by his wife who doesn’t live in the UK, and who therefore didn’t pay any tax on &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/oct/21/executivesalaries.executivepay"&gt;the £1.2bn dividend that her husband paid her in 2005&lt;/a&gt; – depriving the UK of approximately £300m in lost tax revenue. A message went up on the UK Uncut website to say that there would be an action on Saturday 18th December. Despite the atrocious snowy conditions, a small group gathered and the numbers eventually swelled to about 25. Five of us arrived early, and finding only a few people standing around outside, decided to go for a wander around the shop itself, trailed by several members of the specially hired-in security staff. After leaving the shop we joined the demo, chanted a bit, marvelled at our mate’s lovely banner, watched the three police officers suspiciously, and eventually headed off home. In comparison with other UK Uncut protests across the country, where people have occupied shops, superglued themselves to doors, climbed roofs, and slept in on bank floors, this would definitely rank as one of the less bolshy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is this a problem? It is and it isn’t. This was the first straight-up “UK Uncut” demonstration in Cardiff, and as such, it reflected the strengths and weaknesses of this movement. It was a demonstration that nearly existed more online than it did on Queen Street, and certainly the cost to Topshop in extra security was out of all proportion to the nature of the demonstration (so the online threat of disruption cost the company more money than the actual protest). It is stimulating to someone of my generation, used to having to laboriously flyer and poster a demo for weeks in advance, to see how people can organise with a mere click of a mouse button. In fact it has been something of a revelation to me to hear older activists recognise the importance that &lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2010/12/information-solidarity"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; have had in determining the narrative of the recent protests, for example, the way that &lt;a href="http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/news/96-education/8655-student-protest-evidence-of-police-violence-continues-to-emerge"&gt;police brutality&lt;/a&gt; has been in the spotlight as never before, and within an ever-shortening period of time. So social media got us together in front of Topshop, and social media carried the message of our presence there far and wide – well, to all 128 of my Twitter followers, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What, though, could be improved? Well, as is already clear, this is not a single-issue protest. The question of Britain’s missing tax millions touches on every other question of the imposed cutbacks. So these actions could serve, perhaps ought to serve, as a springboard to greater resistance to Cameron and Clegg’s neo-liberal shock therapy. Already, encouragingly, within a small demonstration of 25, there were several different strands of Cardiff society present – students, working people, &lt;a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/campaigns/tax-justice/"&gt;trade union organisers&lt;/a&gt;, anarchists, and socialists. But are the &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell"&gt;bonds that bring this group together strong enough&lt;/a&gt; to be able to increase the political price that our action can exact?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Judging by other &lt;a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2010/12/469919.html"&gt;demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; we could have made a bigger fuss, caught more public attention, garnered more media coverage, and increased the numbers interested in joining the next demonstration. Concrete improvements would have been to call for the demonstration to meet, incognito, inside the shop and on a given signal produce banners, placards, and megaphones. And shut it down. Or take the protest straight away to &lt;a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&amp;amp;issue=1275"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; or any of the other outlets of the corporate tax-dodgers. And shut them down. Eventually cause them such a level of discomfort that it becomes politically expedient to &lt;a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/touchstone/Missingbillions/1missingbillions.pdf"&gt;pay their bills and contribute fairly to this society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without the trust and confidence in your fellow protestors that is offered by an &lt;a href="http://www.starhawk.org/activism/affinitygroups.html"&gt;affinity group&lt;/a&gt;, it is hard to know who is going to take the first step. But a traditional picket, politely following the instructions that a bored police sergeant dishes out, doesn’t seem like the best we can do. Building resistance is a chicken-and-egg practice. It’s not so important what comes first, as long as it is built upon and grows in strength and wisdom. It is always a learning process, but what is important is to clarify the issues at stake – &lt;a href="http://falseeconomy.org.uk/cure/how-cuts-will-make-britain-more-unfair"&gt;a class war&lt;/a&gt; has been declared on us, and we must learn to fight back and take the struggle to the heart of the empires of the robber barons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
History teaches us that we squandered the opportunity to save countless &lt;a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"&gt;Iraqi lives&lt;/a&gt; by not having the courage to up the political ante in the face of Blair’s determination to go to war. This time round, we must not shrink from upping the political ante - anything else risks condemning us to historical oblivion. So the next time there is a UK Uncut action in Cardiff, why don’t we see if we can make life just a bit more uncomfortable for the rich and powerful, their political lackeys, and their allies the bankers, who are collectively looking to destroy our way of life while they wring every last penny of profit out of us in the meantime?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-3861142238398915826?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The video shows the July 2007 US attack in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad, shot from the gun-sight of one of the US Apache helicopters involved. Around a dozen people, including two Reuters journalists, were killed. Two children in a van driven by a rescue party were seriously injured in a further US attack. The US initially claimed that all the dead were Iraqi 'insurgents' and that the killings took place in a 'battle'. Reuters had been trying to obtain the footage from the primary helicopter involved since August 2007, but it was &lt;a href="http://213.251.145.96/"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt; that eventually released the video evidence of what really happened that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradley Manning has been charged with leaking this footage. He was initially held in Kuwait before being moved to a military jail in Virginia, US. He is also suspected of being the source of the &lt;a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010/"&gt;Afghan War Diary&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-war-logs-391832-iraq-war-files-released-to-media/"&gt;Iraq War Logs&lt;/a&gt; and 250,000 previously secret &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-us-embassy-cables"&gt;diplomatic cables&lt;/a&gt; to and from US embassies around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Julian Assange hit the headlines big time a few weeks ago, Bradley Manning's name and his plight had been barely mentioned in the mainstream British media once the initial interest in the release of the Collateral Murder video had died down. Manning has been even less frequently referred to by members of Britain's anti-war movement, something that can and should change, especially here in Wales given Bradley Manning's close connections: his mother is Welsh and his early teenage years were spent here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bradley's Welsh mother Susan met his American father while Brian Manning was serving in the US Navy and stationed at the nearby Cawdor barracks. The couple married and moved to the US, where Bradley was born in Crescent, Oklahoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradley Manning is not Crescent's first major whistleblower. The Kerr-McGee Plutonium plant near Crescent manufactured pellets used to make fuel rods for nuclear power stations. It was here in 1974 that a young union activist, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Silkwood"&gt;Karen Silkwood&lt;/a&gt;, having already raised concerns with the Atomic Energy Commission, died in mysterious circumstances while driving to meet a New York Times journalist to show him a dossier of documents allegedly exposing widespread health and safety violations and serious contamination risks at the plant. After the accident, the dossier had apparently disappeared from Karen's car and was never found. Kerr-McGee closed down its nuclear plants the following year. A subsequent civil action taken on behalf of Karen Silkwood by her surviving relatives was to become the longest civil trial in Oklahoma's history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was in Crescent, Oklahoma with this background that Bradley spent the greater part of his childhood. However, when he was 13 his parents separated and Bradley moved back to Wales with his mother. They lived in Haverfordwest and Bradley went to high school here for three years before returning to the US.  He followed his father into the military aged 18. Bradley's mother and his extended maternal family still live in south west Wales. In August 2010, some months after Bradley's arrest, FBI agents accompanied by a Welsh Police sergeant  &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1299311/FBI-question-WikiLeaks-mother-Welsh-home-Agent-interrogate-distressed-woman-search-sons-bedroom.html"&gt;turned up unannounced&lt;/a&gt; at his mother's home, interrogated Susan Manning, who is in ill health following a series of strokes, and searched Bradley's bedroom before leaving Susan in a distressed state after her sister intervened and demanded that the police and FBI should leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While serving in Iraq in 2009/10, it appears that Bradley became increasingly disillusioned with his work and with the US military. If the evidence of the journalist and ex-hacker &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo"&gt;Adrian Lamo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;, who reported Bradley to the US authorities, is to be believed, Bradley sought Lamo's opinion on leaking confidential information during an on-line conversation between the two: "Hypothetical question - If you had free reign [sic] over classified networks for long periods of time, say, 8-9 months, and you saw incredible things, awful things, things that belonged in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC, what would you do?" &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Bradley Manning made his choice and the results of this are now ricocheting around the world. Bradley, meanwhile, has just 'celebrated' his twenty-third birthday in &lt;a href="http://www.stopisolation.org/en/"&gt;solitary confinement&lt;/a&gt; in a military jail in Virginia, being held in conditions which are &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14/manning/index.html"&gt;inhumane&lt;/a&gt; and could be considered to amount to torture. According to &lt;a href="http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2010/12/typical-day-for-pfc-bradley-manning.html"&gt;David E. Coombs&lt;/a&gt;, Bradley Manning's lead civilian attorney, Bradley's 'home' is a 12' x 6' cell without sheets, pillows and devoid of any personal effects, from which he is released for just one hour of 'exercise' each day, during which time he is allowed to walk, and only walk, round and round a different room. He is not allowed to exercise in his own cell. Bradley has been incarcerated for seven months now and may spend the rest of his life in jail. On 18 December, the Independent reported that Bradley is likely to be put under &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/assange-begins-mansion-arrest-but-his-source-feels-the-heat-2163607.html"&gt;intense pressure&lt;/a&gt; to enter into a plea bargain with his accusers, to place WikiLeaks' Julian Assange in the frame in return for an agreed fixed term sentence for himself. Meanwhile, the Guardian two days earlier reported on Bradley Manning's desperate &lt;a href="http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2010/12/typical-day-for-pfc-bradley-manning.html"&gt;circumstances and his deteriorating mental and physical health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradley Manning needs our solidarity and support now more than ever. I will examine the arguments and possibilities for a Welsh solidarity campaign for Bradley Manning in another article. For now, though, here are a couple of suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, take a few minutes to write to Bradley Manning. The small act of solidarity in sending a letter or card means a lot to a political prisoner, one indication that the world has not forgotten them. Christmas is coming and it was Bradley Manning's 23rd birthday on 17 December. You can send letters, cards and postcards to: Bradley Manning,  c/o Courage to Resist, 484 Lake Park Ave #41, Oakland CA 94610, United States. Letters will be opened, "contraband" discarded and the letters then mailed in a weekly package to Bradley via an individual currently on his approved correspondence list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, familiarise yourself with Bradley Manning's story. If we're going to have any sort of solidarity campaign, we need to know the details and the issues, to understand what's at stake and to share this information with others. Please take the time to read about Bradley Manning. This &lt;a href="http://thislandpress.com/09/23/2010/private-manning-and-the-making-of-wikileaks-2/"&gt;article by Denver Nicks&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of background details, while the &lt;a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/"&gt;Bradley Manning solidarity website&lt;/a&gt; has details on the campaign to support him and secure his release.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-8804728365643268768?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

A matter of months ago we were lamenting the creation of the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that aims to make working class people pay for the follies of the rich. Suddenly the gauntlet has been thrown down by a younger generation who are not only prepared to say no, but hit the streets to make the point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The catalyst was the introduction of higher fees for students. Despite being a devolved issue, the Plaid/Labour coalition in the Welsh Assembly were playing their cards close to their chests. Not only are they facing an overall cut of 1.2% of the Welsh block budget from Westminster, but five out of eleven Welsh universities have a deficit of £70 million and funding cuts of £50 million.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The initial solution, as far as the universities saw it, was to put up fees for students, and they lobbied the Assembly accordingly. This would mean universities charging up to £9000 annually per student, up from the original cap of £3000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On 10th November, 25 coaches full of students from Wales went to London to protest with others from around the UK. The Police failed to maintain control of events and &lt;a href="http://london.indymedia.org/articles/5938"&gt;students were able to 'run riot' and occupy Millbank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what distinguished these protests from others that have occurred over the years is the momentum that was generated. A week later, in Cardiff, &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/11/24/student-protesters-storm-cardiff-uni-vice-chancellor-office-91466-27708767/"&gt;300 people marched and the Shandon lecture theatre in the main university building was occupied&lt;/a&gt;. In a carnival-like atmosphere, teach-ins and spontaneous demonstrations went off as students and their supporters made their feelings plain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/8687825.Sixth_formers_go_on_the_march/"&gt;Monmouth and Chepstow&lt;/a&gt; sixth formers took to the streets to try and reclaim their future. More teach-ins happened, in Aberystwyth (where they had already &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2010/11/17/gillan-cancels-aberystwyth-lecture-due-to-student-protest-fears-91466-27671674/"&gt;scared off the secretary of state&lt;/a&gt;) it took place in the centre of town, with students stating that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If we can’t get education in the universities, we’ll get it in the streets.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;though before long, they &lt;a href="http://aberoccupied.blogspot.com/"&gt;occupied the university&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/cardiff/2010/nov/30/cardiff-students-protests-university-fees-welsh-assembly-government-announcement"&gt;"Carnival Against Cuts" demonstration&lt;/a&gt; in Cardiff’s city centre on 28th November turned into a game of cat and mouse with cops, as students dispersed from the main demo by the Bevan statue and occupied Lloyd’s bank on Queens Street, for its role in causing the initial credit crisis that got us in this mess in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While all this was going on, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/08/wales-student-tuition-fee-rise"&gt;Education Minister Leighton Andrews finally stated his position&lt;/a&gt;, saying that students living in Wales, regardless of which part of the UK they study, will not have to pay the extra fees. The cost instead would be met by the Welsh Assembly, as well as cuts in the teaching budget. English students who come to Wales, however, will still be subject to the higher rate. This is on top of the fact that the Education Maintenance Allowance is to be kept in Wales, but not in England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which, on the surface of it, is a victory of sorts. By announcing it as the protests were going on, Andrews acknowledged the importance of what was happening on the streets. The question facing us in Wales now is do we pack up and go home, or see this as the cosmetic touch-up it is?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The implications of Lloyds occupation in Cardiff are considerable. There is a widespread awareness amongst this new generation of politicised students that these protests are nor just about cuts in education. All over Wales and the UK, ordinary people are gloomily bracing themselves for the impacts of cuts across the board, as well as hikes in VAT and the overall cost of living. This is a crisis we did not create, and should not be expected to pay for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://ukuncut.wordpress.com/"&gt;UKuncut movement&lt;/a&gt; is targeting firms such as Vodafone who are avoiding paying tax. There have been actions in Cardiff, Swansea, Aberystwyth, Wrexham and across the UK. This wave of protests at corporate tax dodgers is capturing public imagination, who knows what the impact might be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Assembly may well be&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/08/wales-student-tuition-fee-rise"&gt; using their position as a way of trumpeting the virtues of devolution&lt;/a&gt;. They have &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/17/welsh-assembly-government-budget-cuts"&gt;made reassuring noises that they want to protect health and social services&lt;/a&gt;, and do not believe education should be a market. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the control they have to limit the effects of the ConDem austerity programme is limited. The Welsh Assembly has already released it's &lt;a href="http://wales.gov.uk/docs/finance/report/101117budgetnarrativeen1.pdf"&gt;draft budget&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the the full announcement of its budget in February.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Experienced radicals need to marshall our support for what is going on, as well as kick off any new initiatives that we see may be lacking. This is a real opportunity to push forward. But without support from those in the Trade Union movement, community and workplace organisations and large doses of direct action, we will not be able to defeat this austerity programme and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/18/anarchism-direct-action-student-protests"&gt;push for radical alternatives&lt;/a&gt;. In January non-hierarchical groups opposed to cuts from around the country are meeting in Manchester for a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=165446950159789"&gt;Network X gathering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We need to acknowledge that this is a global problem and link up accordingly. There have been massive demonstrations across Europe, from the 'usual suspects' of &lt;a href="http://www.occupiedlondon.org/blog/"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-braces-for-riots-as-protests-turn-violent-2110305.html"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://www.wsm.ie/c/students-education-under-attack"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere. There have also been solidarity demos for the UK students as far afield as &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=114841695247799"&gt;Helsinki, Finland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we look so far into the past, the radical traditions of working class activism and self help in Wales that created improvements in education, housing health care and working conditions, provide a great source of inspiration. So too do more recent struggles to protect the Welsh language. Once again, it's our entire future that is at stake now.

It happens when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while” - &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/criticalmasscardiff/"&gt;Cardiff Critical Mass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Saturday 4th December is the anniversary of the revival of Cardiff Critical Mass. Critical Mass events have been happening in the city for many years but the regular meetings were restarted by a tireless group of activists in December 2009. It now meets by the Museum steps at 11am on the first Saturday of every month.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://critical-mass.info/" linkindex="34"&gt;first Critical Mass happened in San Francisco in 1992&lt;/a&gt; and was originally known as 'Commute Clot'. A group of cyclists came together at a set time and cycled together as a block taking over the road and for a brief moment replacing the sounds and smells of combustion engines with music, the ringing of bells and the honking of bike horns. It has since spread to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass" linkindex="35"&gt;over 300 cities across the world&lt;/a&gt;. Although some individuals get more involved with printing and distributing flyers or discussing possible routes, Critical Mass is 'horizontal' and so has no leaders or 'organisers'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some call it a protest but participants more often than not refer to Critical Mass as a 'spontaneous celebration of the bike'. However, people attend for a variety of reasons: Some want to raise awareness of the safety issues around city cycling, some do it to highlight the health benefits, others want to encourage more sustainable forms of transport for environmental reasons. Some come simply to get their own back on the motorists that dominate the road during their daily commute. I and many others attend for a mixture of these reasons but one of the most exciting and empowering things about Critical Mass is reclaiming the street as a public space and making it safe for a fleeting moment of carnivalesque celebration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With awareness growing of the connections between the unrestrained consumption of fossil fuels with climate change and socio-political problems, the bicycle has become an obvious and attractive tool for all sorts of protest movements. It's fluffy, fun and visual enough to achieve public support, yet with a cheeky, almost menacing potential for easy road-blocking, coupled with a side swipe at car culture. It is an appealing and mischievous way to give the middle finger to business as usual with virtually no risk of arrest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several protest movements have used the same 'go slow' bike block tactic to raise awareness of their concerns. For example in 2006 during the campaign against the &lt;a href="http://www.urban75.net/vbulletin/threads/185922-Critical-Mass-%28bike-protest%29-tomorrow" linkindex="36"&gt;Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) pipeline&lt;/a&gt; that was subsequently built through swathes of the south Wales countryside, and &lt;a href="http://www.urban75.net/vbulletin/threads/133085-Cardiff-critical-mass?s=a5d8a400a01253781f993a45d6da7652&amp;amp;p=3613142&amp;amp;viewfull=1#post3613142" linkindex="37"&gt;anti-G8 rides&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2005.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bike block tactics have also been used successfully in conjunction with other mobile blocks to take spaces and hold them such as during the '&lt;a href="http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/london-2009/swoop" linkindex="38"&gt;swoop&lt;/a&gt;' for the 2009 &lt;a href="http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/" linkindex="39"&gt;Camp for Climate Action&lt;/a&gt; and 2010 &lt;a href="http://risingtide.org.uk/node/348" linkindex="40"&gt;Party at the Pumps&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the regular Cardiff Critical Mass rarely takes in other protest issues despite attempts by some members earlier this year to organise an &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25837678825#%21/topic.php?uid=200111257726&amp;amp;topic=14538" linkindex="41"&gt;anti-EDL ride&lt;/a&gt;, its purpose is to challenge the dominance of the car over the bike in our cities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since the industrial revolution the focus of western society has been on economic growth, driven in large part by the use of oil and the private motor vehicle. Our cities are therefore designed with the movement of the car and the endless consumption of resources prioritised above anything else.  As we realise that economic growth comes with negative consequences for our standard of living there is a growing desire to reign in car culture and all it symbolises.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to make our towns and cities safer, less polluted, happier places we must begin to de-prioritise motorised transport wherever feasible. Critical Mass can serve as a reminder that small changes must be made to all aspects of our lives in order to realistically tackle global and local issues from all angles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cardiff, on paper at least, is a perfect city for cycling. It's almost completely flat, compact, and from my own observations cycling has definitely increased since I moved here 10 years ago. There is little doubt that the recession has helped encourage the shift to virtually free transport, and schemes such as cycle to work have made getting a good quality bike much easier for a lot of people. Despite this, the number of people that use a bike as their primary mode of transport around the city remains dismally low.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps counter-intuitively, the more cyclists that are on the roads the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/may/07/cycling-safety-york-calderdale" linkindex="42"&gt;safer the roads become&lt;/a&gt; to cycle on. By encouraging more and more people onto their bikes we  also improve safety for all cyclists, from the beginners to the  veterans. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to Cardiff Council's bike officer, Jo Sachs-Eldridge, the number of people commuting by bike in Cardiff is increasing, but still makes up just 7.4% of journeys to and from work. And whilst the local authority is making efforts to encourage more cycling, such as through the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/cardiff/2010/oct/13/cycling-in-cardiff-consultation-ark-lab-council-report-network-strateg" linkindex="43"&gt;proposed new cycling network&lt;/a&gt; , it's only by raising awareness of the unhealthy dominance of car culture and highlighting the alternatives through events like Critical Mass that we can begin to achieve a significant shift towards happier, cleaner and safer cities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You don't have to be an anarchist, an environmentalist, or 'anti-car' to  join in. Many of those that participate regularly in Cardiff Critical  Mass are car drivers themselves, although for most their preferred mode  of transport within the city tends to be a sturdy bike. They may have  many reasons to come on the rides but a universal concern is that the  city's infrastructure needs to be much more bicycle friendly. &lt;br /&gt;

However it was &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-history/articles/2010/10/05/a-new-history-of-wales-dr-louise-miskell-remembering-1910-it-wasn-t-all-about-tonypandy-91466-27404935/"&gt;far from the only event&lt;/a&gt; of that year worth remembering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though little remarked upon, the dispute at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Docks"&gt;Newport Docks&lt;/a&gt; in 1910 was hugely significant in the development of industrial relations and policing.  The calculations a government makes when 'refereeing' between employers and employees changed dramatically, and the state has been on a collision course with workers' rights ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strike has been overshadowed by the &lt;a href="http://www.newportpast.com/gallery/video/dock_disaster/index.htm"&gt;disaster of 1909&lt;/a&gt;, and largely ignored in the history of working class struggle, possibly because workers were fighting for almost the opposite of the demands of the &lt;a href="http://libcom.org/history/1910-cambrian-combine-miners-strike-and-tonypandy-riot"&gt;Cambrian Combine Strike&lt;/a&gt;. In the short term, the dockers were successful, but the lasting effects were far from positive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Wednesday 18th May 1910 Houlder Brothers and Company brought a Canadian steamer called 'Indian Transport' into Newport Docks to load 5,000 tons of goods. It was the largest cargo at the port at that point and destined for South America. Before the steamer arrived, Houlder Brothers informed workers that rather than the usual tonnage payment system, they would be paid a daily rate to load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike other major ports, stevedores in Newport were payed on a tonnage basis that gave  regular gangs of dockers guaranteed work loading any cargo they started. On being told of the change in the payment system, members of the Dockers Union refused to load the ship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the ship arrived in Newport it was carrying so-called 'free labourers' from London. All 5000 dock workers in Newport stopped work to crowd the vessel. A delegation of dockers entered the ship and informed the imported workers that they were scabbing and offered to pay for them to go back home; this offer was refused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the blackleg labourers attempted to start work the crowd rushed the police line that had formed, threw the police into the dock and stopped work. The strike breakers were escorted by the massed ranks of dockers under the Union banner to Newport train station where their fares were paid and they returned to London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Work did not resume on the docks the following day and all work had already been halted for King Edward VII's funeral on the Friday. Over the weekend the dispute was sent for arbitration, allowing work on other ships to resume. A rally was held in Cathays Park, Cardiff. Which was attended by thousands of workers from both towns, coming by train, foot and in a mass bicycle ride of over 80 dockers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The workers were able to secure &lt;a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/26260828"&gt;the solidarity of dock labourers in other ports in the Bristol Channel&lt;/a&gt;. As far as most exporters in the Newport Board of Trade were concerned, the tonnage system suited them perfectly well. The main criticism of rushed work leading to minor damage was hardly relevant to the loading of coal. The dockers themselves had their own reasons for opposing day wages, which was a system workers in other industries were clamouring for. In the words of one member of the Newport branch of the Dockers Union:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conditions of the dock workers at Newport are in no way ideal; they are capable of improvement. The tonnage system gives a greater security and regularity of employment than is obtainable under the day wage system. Under the tonnage system a man works a job from start to finish, but under the other system he is taken on from day to day and can only claim to be employed four or five hours, for which he received an average of 6d an hour... Judging by the effect of the day wage system on other ports the results will be disastrous for the workers and to householders and to tradesmen, because it will diminish the purchasing power of the labouring classes. The men fully realise, from report and practical experience that the conditions under the day rate will be worse than the tonnage basis." (South Wales Argus 18/5/1910)&lt;/blockquote&gt;It was acknowledged by all sides that the only result of blacklegs coming into Newport Docks would be serious violence. A large number of police were imported into the town and soldiers were held in reserve. &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1910/jun/20/newport-dock-dispute"&gt;Arbitration was agreed&lt;/a&gt;, somewhat &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1910/jun/28/newport-dock-dispute"&gt;contentiously&lt;/a&gt;. On the day work was set to resume the Shipping Federation informed the Home Office that Houlder Brothers would be bringing in un-unionised labour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Newport's Watch Committee (in charge of policing) deciding it would be better to keep the peace than enforce the law, prevented a ship containing strike breakers from entering the dock:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the Newport Dock labourers are prepared to load the Indian Transport, this Committee are not prepared to provide the additional police protection which would be necessary if labour is imported, until commanded to do so by the Home office, and that any labourers proposing to come to Newport be warned that it is unsafe to do so in the existing circumstances" (South Wales Argus 25/5/1910)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Home Office, in a desire to avoid an explosive confrontation, &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1910/jun/20/newport-dock-dispute"&gt;took responsibility for the local authorities actions&lt;/a&gt; and informed Houlder Brothers they would be held responsible for the 'grave consequences' of importing scab labour. In effect, the Newport Dockers had intimidated the government into backing them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Houlder Brothers responded by demanding compensation from the local authority, as they were entitled to the protection of the state. The &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1910/jun/22/newport-dock-dispute"&gt;expensive consequences&lt;/a&gt; of this successful claim confirmed the legal right of employers to bring in strike breakers. Though the Newport Dockers were unbowed by a bullying employer, the lasting effect of their struggle was the commitment of the state to defend scabs.&lt;br /&gt;

Indeed many people felt that the Ryder Cup would be good for  Newport, raising the city's profile and establishing a footing on the  international stage. What could be better for a town in need of  investment than the hosting of a major sporting event?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since  the Celtic Manor resort on the edge of the city was announced as the  venue some nine years ago, the local council has been mesmerised by the  spectacle of a massive influx of wealthy visitors. Preparations were  made in earnest and huge sums of public money were made available for  projects that would improve the image of Newport. As the competition got  nearer signs, flags and billboards appeared wherever there was space,  welcoming the arrival of golf fans. Though many of the planned &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Spires"&gt;showpiece projects never materialised&lt;/a&gt;, the train station was revamped with a new walkway, and the creation of  new jobs was hinted at, something the town really needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The  knock on effects of the cup included the Severn Bridge tolls starting  to accept credit card payments, something motorists have complained  about for many years, however once the cup was over, they were promptly  removed. In an effort to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9037000/9037980.stm"&gt;tidy up the city's image&lt;/a&gt;, some of the large number of abandoned business premises in the  city centre were reopened by the '&lt;a href="http://www.newportcitycentre.co.uk/emptyshops.aspx"&gt;Empty Shops Project&lt;/a&gt;' as art galleries and drama spaces. &lt;a href="http://www.newportsuperdragons.co.uk/site/"&gt;Sculptures of dragons&lt;/a&gt; were placed around the city and  a number of community events got limited council support rather than  the usual hostility. All this was designed to bring a much trumpeted "festival atmosphere" to the City.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to make sure the glamorous celebrity golf fans weren't inconvenienced by too much traffic, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10329547"&gt;schools were closed&lt;/a&gt; across the city and even as far away as Cardiff, much to the inconvenience of local parents. The security operation meant &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/ryder_cup/ryder_cup_news/8416772.Road_closures_in_Gwent_for_Ryder_Cup/"&gt;many roads were routinely closed&lt;/a&gt; as the 'great and the good' patronised the former site of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Manor_Resort#Site_history"&gt;Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Special infrastructure was constructing including a &lt;a href="http://www.caerleon.net/ryder/bridge/index.htm"&gt;special bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/4780599.__2_5_million_Ryder_Cup_road__waste_of_money_/"&gt;extra bit of road&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that cost £2.5 million (closed to as soon as the event was over).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the event was finally on, the jobs hinted at never materialised, instead there was a &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/8392557.Could_you_welcome_Ryder_Cup_visitors_/"&gt;call for volunteers to basically act as skivvies&lt;/a&gt;.  It was apparent that the Ryder Cup crowd had a complete lack of  interest in anything to do with Newport. Far from bringing in new trade  into the city centre, trade and walking traffic in the dropped to next  to zero.The people who had arrived to see the Cup stayed at the Celtic  Manor or lodged in rural Monmouthshire and didn't venture into Newport  at all. One section who were expected to profit from the event the taxi  cab drivers were ushered away from the train station so that a fleet of  coaches could ferry people back and forth to the Celtic Manor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it was painfully apparent in the pub, club and cafe culture that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/sep/24/ryder-cup-newport-ringland-local-benefits"&gt;'old' Newport was not going to benefit&lt;/a&gt; from the event, thousands expressed their distain, proclaiming &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bollocks-to-the-Ryder-Cup/151560294876499"&gt;Bollocks to the Ryder Cup&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. A &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/oct/01/ryder-cup-newport-fanzone"&gt;big screen was erected in John Frost Square&lt;/a&gt; so that interested Newportonians and visitors who didn't have a ticket could watch the event. Nothing illustrated local opinion of the event  quite like the deserted 'fanzone'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The huge number of Ryder Cup signs remain all over the city, all the more grotesque with the announcement of the &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/passport_office/"&gt;closure of the Passport Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/8450155.Marks_and_Spencer_s_move_from_city_centre____devastating___/"&gt;departure of a major department store&lt;/a&gt; from the centre. &lt;a href="http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=22791" target="_blank"&gt;People are getting angry&lt;/a&gt;, what was billed as the beginning of a fresh start for the the city has  turned out to be the subsidising of private business whilst Newport is  left to rot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In all the &lt;a href="http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/8422123.Ryder_Cup_drives_hopes_for_more_big_events/"&gt;event cost £40 million of public money&lt;/a&gt;, a return of next to nothing for the local people who had no choice in  funding it. In the context of public sector and benefit cuts by the  ConDem government this is clearly a pointless waste of money. Money that could have been spent on the overloaded Royal Gwent Hospital, run  down amenities or a whole host of other projects. Despite the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-1315633/Newports-Tiger-economy-With-golfs-Ryder-Cup-taking-place-deprived-Welsh-town-nicely-teed-lift-off.html"&gt;talk of boosting the local economy in the press&lt;/a&gt;, this event was never about Newport, and the only legacy it leaves is underfunded services and an inflated tax bill.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5343320711385594995-4935609839434061299?l=www.radicalwales.org' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
