  <title>The dilemma of protagonist in visual novels</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/18282.html</link>
  <description>As someone in the midst of writing his third attempt at a VN, I&apos;ve had to grapple with the most unpleasant character i have to write in every one of them: the MC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the forms of story we&apos;re familiar with since childhood are centered around the protagonist: their flaw drives or at least informs the events of the story, and the only game we as readers play is experiencing the tension of not knowing whether (or to what degree) they will overcome the antagonism that defines drama. (As we grow more sophisticated and bored as readers, we begin to make bets with ourselves as to what&apos;s going to happen, transfoming catharsis into poker.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visual novels upset this paradigm while simultaneously wearing its trappings. As I&apos;ve played through a number of games, I&apos;ve groused that the main character is badly written, inconsistent, two dimensional, etc. and chalked it up to inexperience on the writer&apos;s part. But in the case of a game based out of dating sims, my proxy is in an untenable position: he has to follow my orders AND&amp;nbsp;justify them to himself so as to maintain the fiction of free will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I as his writer have to provide a reader choices that keep them interested while keeping those choices within the realm of possibility for that characterization -- and therein is my dilemma:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overemphasize consistency of characterization, and my choices may be so locked that the reader feels no sense of control and thereby feels cheated by what is effectively a sound novel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overemphasize breadth of choice, and the reader might feel gratified by their sense of control (and its resulting draw into that world), but may also doubt the MC&apos;s reality and lose emotional connection if I&amp;nbsp;don&apos;t bust my ass in narrative to compensate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This dilemma makes it convenient to only write stories about adolescents and young adults, because they are a universally recognized real-world example of Aristotle&apos;s notion that &amp;quot;to do is to be&amp;quot; starting from a tabula rasa, and equally notorious for foolish decision-making where it might otherwise feel uncanny in an older character. (The fact that the majority of scenario writers and their audiences are themselves inside this age group --or first connected to the medium at that age-- makes it even harder to conceive thinking outside that particular box.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the presently dominant genre, the &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; (regardless of the premise or pretext of one)&amp;nbsp;is doing whatever it takes to achieve romantic/sexual connection to the most desired characters, and then multiple replays to unlock the remaining ones, and then finally find all the other endings for sense of closure (presuming you haven&apos;t decided the game wasn&apos;t worth the effort by this point). Immersion trumps self-supporting characterization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two uncompleted VNs I&amp;nbsp;started had MCs who both entered their story at a crossroads, their surroundings abruptly changed enough that they had permission to reinvent themselves. In an effort to try something new, I developed a premise which is centered around the contrapositive: the MC&apos;s surroundings have not changed, only his circumstance, and his behavior/worldview is canonically the result of undeserved privilege.&amp;nbsp;in my drive to avoid making another apathetic player-condom, I landed in unlikeable protag territory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a novel, play or screenplay, this is cut-and-dried, well-ploughed premise territory. As a VN, it&apos;s a challenge because the reader has to steer this heel towards heroism while not being given any easy shortcuts. Game development is a collaborative effort, and it took work to get Paul to the place he is now. Other characterizations have been the source of debate and revision as well, but this one was a dealbreaker if it couldn&apos;t even be pitched without making people uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&amp;nbsp;learned anything from this and the complaints of other VN writers, it&apos;s that you have to walk into a project with a conscious idea of what degree of self-definition your VN&apos;s MC needs, and how to ensure your intended audience accepts that MC from beginning to end. You may have to be comfortable using some of the tricks of the trade to smooth over those imperfections.</description>

  <title>I Think I&apos;ll Complain Some More In Private</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/18163.html</link>
  <description>Actually, no I won&apos;t. I&apos;m going to take stock of the things I should be grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, &lt;strong&gt;abscess&lt;/strong&gt;. He has believed in me when I didn&apos;t more times than I&amp;nbsp;can count, and I pray I&apos;m learning not to rely on him for that. He has called me out on pandering, made me justify my positions when i changed my mind or he disagreed, and made sure I&amp;nbsp;show up regularly and have a damned good reason when I&apos;m not writing. He knows when to let me ramble and when to pull on the reins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juno&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone&apos;s said you can&apos;t make a VN without concept art to inspire you, and in our dry spell he&apos;s provided music to fill in for that. When a catchy piece of music&apos;s stuck in your head and you realize you didn&apos;t hear it on YT&amp;nbsp;or Pandora or the radio, this was written &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;, it makes you want to sit down and write more. And his continual devil&apos;s advocacy when abscess really didn&apos;t like an idea I&amp;nbsp;wanted to pursue has kept us honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VCR&lt;/strong&gt;. The (mostly) silent deputy of #aj and an artist to watch with a heart larger than the state of Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Leaf Studios&lt;/strong&gt;. You are bastards, every last one of you, and most of you have taken turns crushing my ego and being unimpressed with my life experience, my ambition, my sense of humor or its underlying adolescent need to be liked. I couldn&apos;t be here without you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do what&apos;s actually next to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;q lang=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Het slingerde zich naar de top van een grasheuveljte dat nu grijs onder de egale sterrenhemel lag.&lt;/q&gt;</description>

  <title>The Lion, the Witch, and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/14963.html</link>
  <description>2005:&lt;br /&gt;Susan Pevensie: Peter, just because some man in a red coat gives you a sword it doesn&apos;t make you a hero! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1975: &lt;br /&gt;Dennis: [interrupting] Listen, strange women lyin&apos; in ponds distributin&apos; swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You can&apos;t expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. If I went &apos;round sayin&apos; I was Emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they&apos;d put me away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen the BBC version of the entire series first, I had my doubts but the film was excellent. Then again, given the amount of LotR resources they&apos;ve pilfered (WETA, Sala Baker, New Zealand itself) and the guaranteed wrath of PLU everywhere, Disney had no choice. And yes, the screenwriter is the same Andrew Adamson who directed both Shreks and wrote the second.</description>

  <description>&quot;This Is The Day&quot; by The The. My fucking theme song for a life of wasted potential and the dawning of utter regret, penned and performed when Trent Reznor was still learning his third chord and covering Floyd in his dad&apos;s basement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s now the music in the Dockers commercial. WITH the lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the hatred I felt watching Target use &quot;It&apos;s a Beautiful World&quot; by Devo could never be eclipsed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprise of surprises, the band&apos;s website isn&apos;t accepting new registrations (&quot;Yuor c0d3 is inc0mpl3t3&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moping on LiveJournal seems like the perfect response.</description>

  <title>Recent comics worth reading</title>

  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wapsisquare.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wapsi Square&lt;/a&gt; gets better and better, even as the characters get more and more like Henson creations. Pablo, ink these and there will be a world of hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://loserz.scribblekid.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Loserz&lt;/a&gt; has left its hiatus, and to an extent its previous style which continues to balance between manga and Eric&apos;s own increasingly organic inking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wigu.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Magical Adventures In Space&lt;/a&gt;: What can I say. Jeff realized he misses the Tinkle family as much as the rest of us, gave us an excellent fix and then brought us to Clark Kent, Crip King (where the shtick is hella funnier than with Weedmaster P). And he&apos;s still doing Overcompensating. Don&apos;t think of his merchandise section as a store so much as a trust fund for his inevitable carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alienlovespredator.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alien Loves Predator&lt;/a&gt;: Just go, if you haven&apos;t already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dolari.org/cs/1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closetspace&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The story of a boy who thought he could be a woman so well, he moved in with one. And the chaos that followed.&quot; I admit Jenn&apos;s Star Blazers-influenced style presold me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niego.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Niego&lt;/a&gt;: Simple, funny, and a loose, non-derivative&amp;nbsp; drawing style perfectly suited to the material. Hey, I just contradicted myself. Live with it.</description>

  <title>Never been prouder of my alma mater</title>

  <description>From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14886-2005Mar31.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Reliable Source column today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hazards of Punditry, Part 1: Weekly Standard Editor   &lt;b&gt;William Kristol &lt;/b&gt;was undaunted when a student splattered a pie in his face during a speech Tuesday evening at Earlham College in Richmond, Ind., saying immediately after the attack: &quot;Just let me finish my point.&quot; The neo-con commentator told us yesterday: &quot;Next time I go to a college campus, I&apos;ll wear a poncho.&quot; He described the pie as &quot;chocolate cream . . . quite gooey,&quot; but didn&apos;t partake. &quot;I&apos;m on the Atkins diet,&quot; he said, laughing. The pie wielder was suspended and could face expulsion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

  <title>Stupid liberal bloggers.</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/10009.html</link>
  <description>Hey, there&apos;s this great article on the stupidity of the President and the utter futility of our foreign policy&apos;s attempt to democratize the rest of the planet. Quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are simply not going to stop buying Saudi oil or cut off our $2 billion in annual aid to Egypt or sever relations with Musharraf or sanction a China that could sink the dollar because these regimes refuse to make the reforms Bush demands. It is not going to happen. President Bush will either wind up eating his overblown rhetoric or following it over the cliff and taking us with him.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amconmag.com/2005_02_28/buchanan.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to read the rest of this raving liberal&apos;s blog. No, really. Just click the link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m waiting.</description>

  <title>Turning my crank to Frank</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/9981.html</link>
  <description>Now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd/featureoverview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;iDVD 5 can burn +Rs as well as -Rs&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;m getting off my arse and resuming the drive to get rid of my VHS boat anchors. A couple of trips to the hardware store yesterday added another shelf to my computer hutch inbetween the monitor and the scanner for the cheap Samsung VCR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What takes me completely by surprise is how quickly the Pioneer A06 (aka SuperDrive) burns +Rs compared to -Rs. Fuji -Rs take about an hour to burn; +Rs take about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as testing with inexpensive set-top DVDs is concerned they&apos;re kosher: I&apos;ll be testing them at work Tuesday (Monday isn&apos;t a holiday but I have to stay home to sign for a replacement insulin pump).</description>

  <title>I swear, it wasn&apos;t me, Jin.</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/9656.html</link>
  <description>But after forcefeeding myself the entire run of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crap.jinwicked.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Crap I Drew On My Lunch Brea&lt;/a&gt;k 2 nights ago, and then perusing Jin&apos;s photo gallery that &lt;a title=&quot;midget porn star&quot; href=&quot;http://crap.jinwicked.com/images/comics/20050203.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;three word description&lt;/a&gt; crossed my mind once or seventy times. But in the good sense, Jin, the good sense. Please put down the folding chair before one of us gets--OOOF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&apos;t know where they got the &quot;queen of the world&quot; thing except that clearly their pencils are shorter than yours. Looking over how far your style evolved/cleaned in six months compared to most other webcomickers, I don&apos;t know whether to kneel in supplication or dull all your nibs when you&apos;re not looking.</description>

  <title>Breaking a promise</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/9250.html</link>
  <description>I said I wouldn&apos;t actually talk about Hope &amp;amp; Dread until more strips were up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There won&apos;t be any new strips up for a little while. Here&apos;s why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&apos;t generally mention it, but I&apos;m the editor for Open Directory Project&apos;s Poser category. When I took this on 2 years ago, I had a lot of free time to look at other peoples&apos; Poser sites and review them for the category. I was also passionately devoted to Poser as a hobby, with the eventual intent of doing a strip or a short movie using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&apos;s still a movie plot bunny kicking around in my head, a sci-fi short I&apos;d like to do before the inevitable occurs and someone else thinks of the same idea and gets it done first. For that, Poser (and other tools) will be great and I don&apos;t regret the time I&apos;ve spent using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the strip I put together in mid-December took more time to arrange, pose and render than it would have done to draw it by hand. And more importantly, I ended up using an apartment set that wasn&apos;t what I had in mind — but was available. The characters are pretty close to what I had in mind but the hair and clothes were again more a matter of what I had at hand or was willing to purchase. The range of expression is good but not ideal: cheat in illustration and it looks hilarious. Cheat in Poser and it looks grotesque. [Part of the mistake is using realistic characters instead of cartoon figures with properly cartoony expressions, but as of this writing nearly all the available cartoon figures are female.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I&apos;m not a perfectionist. But I also don&apos;t like signing my name to crap. Bill Watterson made a point in an annotation to one of his strips; when the joke is great, the art can be minimalist; when it&apos;s dumb, go for broke on the illustration. You can&apos;t easily make those kinds of choices with mannequins and a renderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to make mistakes and learn from them. Enjoy the ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;P.S.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; if you want to see how 3D webcomickery is done right, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syntaxerrorscomics.com/pipeline.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Syntax Errors&lt;/a&gt;. Damon Riesberg has the gumption to build all his characters, sets, clothes, hair and props from scratch, to spec. I don&apos;t, because I suck.</description>

  <title>tap tap... this thing on?</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/9175.html</link>
  <description>Saturday night I and the missus were walking downtown, when we saw a naked guy walking half a block in front of us. This is January. In case any of you are vaguely aware of where I live, yeah, it&apos;s Arizona but it&apos;s the base of the San Francisco Peaks. We&apos;re higher in altitude than Denver, and it never gets above 82°F out here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missus asked what he thought he was doing, and I said he was probably hard up for something to write about in his LJ. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to my question. Is anyone reading this? Dunno if paid subscribers can get stats on that kind of thing or not; all I have to go on is next to no comments. I check my friends page pretty regularly; not sure if the rest of you do or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ll try to keep things interesting. I promise.</description>

  <title>Welcome to the Ownership Society, part 2</title>
  <link>http://duanemoody.livejournal.com/8488.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/jan05/0105ldvd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DVD Copy Protection: Take 2&lt;/a&gt; (oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c105:1:./temp/%7Ec1052qeO8r:e31973:&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kiss noncompliant VHS devices goodbye&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindfully.org/GE/2005/Monsanto-Prosecuting-Farmers12jan05.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monsanto prosecuting farmers for planting 2nd-generation seeds from GMO crops grown from Monsanto seed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hbo.com/corpinfo/faq/cgmsfaq.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HBO&apos;s use of anti-copying tech exclusively for their on-demand programming&lt;/a&gt; is entirely consistent with the intent of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/464_US_417.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&apos;s ruling on home recording&lt;/a&gt; (namely, to permit time-shifting which should be a non-issue with on-demand programming). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I think the Senate should mandate this CGMS-A signal be added to C-SPAN and all Oval Office addresses, press conferences and live Congressional hearings. If Condy Rice can tell her confirmation committee with a straight face that she didn&apos;t say the things she said to them to justify the invasion, there&apos;s no reason we the public need the ability to prove otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&apos;t help thinking it reminds me of this pulp I read last week about grownups who&apos;d rather play the Sims online all day than see the decay outside, political correctness destroying freedom of speech, and the rule of law being used to shunt all art and history to cyberspace where they can be altered at a whim, personal ownership effectively legislated out of existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to figure out how someone wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=0345342968&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; fifty-two years ago in a public library basement on a rented typewriter.</description>
