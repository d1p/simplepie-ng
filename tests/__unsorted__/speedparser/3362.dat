Not many people can say that. He unwinds by playing the drums, creates with a glass of wine in one hand and cooking utensils in another and escapes to water whenever he needs to rejuvenate.</p><p>At first glance, Payne’s shorn head, tattoos and lithe physique would make many people think biker or drummer, but few might guess that he actually makes his living inspiring people to be better.</p><p>“It’s hard work, but it’s not a job,” Payne said. “People want my energy and I give them that.”</p><p>For Payne, it all starts with his dreams. Every morning he wakes up looking to interpret them, and uses his findings to guide his daily choices. He knows his intuition is always trying to tell him something and since it has done him pretty well so far, he knows to trust it.</p><p>After his daily reading, his next step is the daily Vibe call with team leaders from his company. Although he doesn’t speak much &#8211; or at all, usually &#8211; he feeds on the energy his team exudes. Payne knows that this energy is integral to making each day great. This may be the only passive activity Payne does, in fact.</p><p>“I relax by seeing Suns games or concerts,” Payne said. “I never watch them on TV, I’m about the crowd, the energy and the flow of the uptempo game.”</p><p>Teamwork is important to Payne, as evidenced by his trust in his leadership team. However, another team has a bigger impact on Payne: his kids.</p><p>“[Spending with my kids] is more therapeutic than anything else,” Payne said. “They help chop and stir the seafood linguine. Being a great dad is important to me.”</p><p></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

No longer will they allow <a rel="nofollow">free plastic bags</a> to be given away at grocery stores and are backing this up with threats of heavy fines for any owner who ignores the request. Any bags that are used must also be biodegradable, which is an excellent approach for any modern city. While  this will no doubt cause some headaches for hurried shoppers, plastic bags have too long clogged our landfills.

The creatives, recognized as the irreplaceable part of an economy whose repetitive jobs can be outsourced too easily, are coming alive after decades of being cast aside by the left-brained workers who built our cities, our homes and our way of life.</p><p>And the fucking right brainers are making the same damn mistakes as the lefties did before. Ask any creative professional what they think of following rules, establishing patterns and making processes repeatable and they&#8217;ll probably scoff at you. The designers, photographers and other bohemian creatives of the world usually turn up their noses at any mention of something so mainstream as punching a time clock.</p><p>The bohemian creatives have failed to think about a few things. First, there are way, way more creative jobs that DON&#8217;T require artistic talent. Really, any job without a rulebook or closely-followed manual could be considered creative, and I bet most of them don&#8217;t care that bohemian creatives turn up their noses at so much. Second, how in the fuck would anything in this world get done without at least the help of lefties? Who handles all the &#8216;little things&#8217; so the bohemian creatives are few to create?</p><p>The greatest gift any true artist has is the ability to see the world as it truly is and then explain that in a picture/image/story/design that inspires a strong reaction or connection to the viewer. This process doesn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum, as it requires actually experiencing the world to be able to comment on it. Sitting at a desk alone, or sharing a six pack and bong rip with fellow bohemian creatives is fucking pointless. You&#8217;d be better off watching yourself whack off in a mirror.</p><p>WE ha</p><p></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

You could be severely injured, terminally ill, comatose, or, in my case, aware that you&#8217;re in a slump while still being in that funk. Like a realized dream that you can&#8217;t quite control and can&#8217;t quite wake up from, this awareness feels like a bored sports announcer in the middle of another five-game losing streak with the same preventable mistakes spurring more losses. Though I won&#8217;t go as far as what we think to be purgatory, I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s much different. But at least with purgatory you knew there was a reason.</p><p>With a slump it&#8217;s not like that. I have no idea why I&#8217;m in a slump, nor how exactly I got here. I know that a few client contracts didn&#8217;t renew, so I&#8217;m poorer than I was before, but I&#8217;m not about to line up for food stamps or unemployment. My writing seems the same, albeit less angry. My daily routine, while lately mucked up by sickness, hasn&#8217;t changed much. I wake, I work. Sometimes I work out in the morning, sometimes at night.</p><p>Perhaps it&#8217;s that I don&#8217;t go out enough, that I don&#8217;t get to any parties or hang out with many people. It&#8217;s not that I hate them, it&#8217;s that I hate who I am when I do show up. We have constant conversations about other people, talk about shit that&#8217;s already happens and there&#8217;s usually too much drinking involved. Or we talk about barefooting, which is always results in me going on and on about how well I&#8217;m doing without bothering to ask anyone&#8217;s else take, most likely because I assume that a) they&#8217;re not runners and b) don&#8217;t know shit about running anyway.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I&#8217;m in a funk because I&#8217;m too self-involved, too critical of other people and far too willing to talk about myself.</p><p>I&#8217;m boring, I&#8217;m not interesting and I know it.</p><p>Fuck, I&#8217;m becoming emo.</p><p></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, they may be getting by by adhering to their daily routines, but they don&#8217;t know why. They&#8217;re aimless and looking for something more, or at least a little different. What these people lack is a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bestpersonaldevelopmentplan.com/visualization/visualize-future/">vision for their future</a>. WeAreAvant knows this.</p><p>Visions are not like road maps. There are no <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://searchwarp.com/swa601266-Does-A-Road-Trip-Parallel-A-Life-Journey.htm">road trips</a> that have life&#8217;s answers, nor are there journeys that can show anyone how they should be living their lives. Change for the better, especially the type that can be sustained and nurtured, comes with only one thing: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://personaldevelopmentblog.co.uk/?p=69">intention</a>.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://weareavant.com">WeAreAvant.com</a> can help with that, but the answers to whatever your problems are won&#8217;t come without work. They won&#8217;t come without discovery and they won&#8217;t come without sharing something from yourself. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for WeAreAvant <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pitch.pe/81913">giving back</a>, too.</p><p>But there&#8217;s more to success than being intellectually, or at least mentally, stimulated. Success often comes to those who are able to balance their body&#8217;s needs without irreparably harming one. If you sit and think alot, balance that out by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://workoutips.com/1159/">sprinting</a> every once in a while. If you&#8217;re fairly active but dislike harder workouts, a proper diet geared toward slow metabolisms might help, but remember that our bodies like balance. Too much of one thing isn&#8217;t good, either.</p><p>Sometimes it takes more than a lifestyle change, it REQUIRES a shift in our perception of what we think life is. Is it a constant struggle for acceptance? Or is it about taking <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com/building-that-better-life">responsibility for your actions</a> and not blaming others? Whatever you think you life means, has become or should be, the next step is to act on it. Get out of your <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kazspence.com/2010/08/08/my-comfort-zone/">comfort zone</a> and do something different.</p><p>The answers you seek are not in this blog post. They are not online (well, not directly). They are probably located outside your house, and maybe even outside your neighborhood. Now, go search for them.</p><p>When you find your answers, let us know.<br /></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Thanks to my near addiction to the digital world, I’ve stopped thinking of day and night as separate occurrences, as the light of my laptop screen is always bright.</p><p>People post differently depending on what time it is. They’re most chatty in the mornings, before the tedium of their day has caught up to them. Then again in the evening, maybe right before primetime, they get conversational again, but not for very long. After the news starts rolling, only a dedicated few that make their living in harmony with the digital world keep on updating, or posting, or communicating.</p><p>Nothing is ever really experienced real-time anymore. We think that we’re tasked with the necessity of sharing information, so we’re always looking for something to remember, not something to interact with. We’ve become narrators of our own lives, seemingly without even knowing.</p><p>I bet most of us think that we’re living in a grand story, and I think that’s good. There’s no reason to call out the deluded, I’m sure they’re much happier that way. But what about those of us who can tell the difference? Who understand and fully embrace our addiction? It seems we’re mostly willing to be lead into it, nay, we’re making our way without a true leader showing the way. Crowds are powerful.</p><p>What happens next is what happened in the analog world. Classes form. Cliques and monopolies take shape. Those that were powerful before may be powerful again and new faces will rise, but in the end, it will all be the same.

It hurts. But if you do, make it count.)</em></p><p>There&#8217;s plenty of drinking nights that I regret, &#8216;though I can&#8217;t always say exactly what, because I don&#8217;t remember most of them. Yep, I black out. Or used to, I guess. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m an alcoholic, or a binge drinker or because I was trying to self medicate my way through my problems. Though my excessive drinking DID reveal one thing to me (well, not to me, but to my friends who later told me): my blacked out self was everything my sober self wanted to be.</p><p>The blacked out version of me is mostly coherent, able to type fairly well and seemingly still able to function like a normal human being. I&#8217;m not proud of this, just thankful that I don&#8217;t go completely out of my mind when I drink that much. That being said, my night in Corvallis may have been the funniest, scariest and most exciting night of my life. I was 22, working for the WSU baseball team, and on my first road trip to central Oregon. I&#8217;m thinking this was in 2002. Maybe 2001.</p><p>The first thing any of us think about after a road trip is food. For me, while a student manager for the WSU baseball team, my first job was always laundry. Always, always laundry. This included washing every piece of athletic gear the guys had, scrubbing grass and dirt stains out of uniforms and folding them nicely, by number, either in their lockers or while on road trips, in my hotel room. My duties also included helping with practice, filming games and handling equipment issues, but that stuff was easy and didn&#8217;t make much time. Laundry was the bore.</p><p>My first night in Corvallis wasn&#8217;t any different. The team and I had left directly after practice for OSU and because I hadn&#8217;t had time to wash before we left, my first duty was to round up laundry and get it washed in time for the next day&#8217;s wake up call. Whatever hotel we stayed at was nice enough to shuttle me to a local laundromat, where I spent three hours scrubbing, washing and folding until I had everything packed back up in three equipment bags. Quick stop at the hotel room to drop off the bags and change, and my night was ready to begin.</p><p>I dressed differently back then. At 175 lbs, anything and everything fit me. Fitted, boot-cut slacks, polo shirt with a little lycra to give it some curve and hot-at-the-time black Doc Marten lace ups with black and white stitching off-center. It was the early 00s, and I looked good. Hair? Pretty much the same. Let&#8217;s just call that look timeless.</p><p>So maybe I was overdressed, but I had no idea because that&#8217;s what I always looked like. Dive bar, club, party, you name it, I always wore some combination of boot-cut pants and a fitted shirt with varying amounts of buttons. Call me preppy, call me metrosexual, call me whatever you want, but I looked awesome.</p><p>My first stop of the night was a decent-looking, Hawaiian-themed bar about a mile off campus. A short walk from my hotel (a short walk EAST), the bar had dining tables, a stage, pool tables and dart boards. For a divey bar just outside a huge college town, it was a jackpot. Perfect place for me to have some dinner and head back to rest up for our 9am wake up call. And then the owner arrived. He was huge, he said he was Samoan and he said he LOVED WSU people. Came in and spent TONS on drinks before and after games, he crowed. Tons? Well, this wasn&#8217;t my drinking night, but I&#8217;d hate to disappoint&#8230;(I&#8217;d long been trained that large, olive-skinned island-looking people are very scary and could break me in half, mostly because I grew up with a bunch of guys who looked and acted like <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/sunnythaper">Sunny Thaper</a></span> and then ended up in weekly police reports. Lesson: be nice, do what they say. And smile. It&#8217;s almost always a guaranteed good time.)</p><p>I ordered my first double Red Bull and vodka. That&#8217;s all I drank at the time, save for a few wind-down type drinks with cranberry and vodka. Though I didn&#8217;t accept it at the time, energy drinks mixed with alcohol make you friggin&#8217; nuts. If you&#8217;ve never experienced it, imagine being completely hammered while completely awake. You THINK you know what&#8217;s going on until you try to do anything beyond standing or sitting and then you&#8217;re screwed.</p><p>The bartender loved me. Though she wasn&#8217;t related to the owner, she was the same nationality (I think, anyway) and she also loved WSU people. My dinner was soon up, I scarfed it, and went back to drinking my now third double red bull and vodka.</p><p>And then the bartender&#8217;s girlfriends showed up. Drunk. Looking for someone to dance with.</p><p>I said yes.</p><p>To be continued&#8230;</p><p></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Ready access to high-quality sporting equipment, access to the very expensive sport facilities and a relationship of sorts with the student-athletes you&#8217;re helping out. A position like this can be a dream come true for life-long baseball fans or a tedious, arduous experience that reminds you very much why you stopped playing baseball in high school. For me, it was both, but what I really remember are the road trips.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/200911212054752479167-pf.h2.jpg"><img src="http://nosemicolons.com/wp-content/uploads/wpid-200911212054752479167-pf.h2-2010-08-9-19-37.jpg" alt="wpid-200911212054752479167-pf.h2-2010-08-9-19-37.jpg" width="321" height="275"/></a>Our team didn&#8217;t travel too often in the beginning of the season. Usually down to Lewiston, Idaho because they had better weather, but that was less than an hour. Normal road trips consisted of a two-hour drive to Walla Walla, where we had access to PAC-10 quality fields and a nearby airport for California and Arizona teams. Oh, we most certainly took the bus to Oregon and my most memorable road trip was the time we spent three nights in Corvallis.</p><p>I&#8217;m not certain I&#8217;ve had more fun, pissed off more people, hurt more parts of my body or met more random people on a trip in my life. One night in particular was the penultimate road trip experience that involved me, in no particular order, getting in a bar fight, making out with three girls, starting a fight with their boyfriends, being saved by the bouncers and snuck our the back by the cute bartender, a free bar tab, getting lost while running the wrong way from my hotel, spraining my ankle so badly I needed an air cast and introducing myself to four stoners who wanted nothing more than to serve me baked goods and send me on my way.</p><p>I did this all alone, before the days of ready access to cell phones, in a city where the only people I knew were asleep and in no way what I would consider backup in case I needed it. To this day, there are chunks of that night missing that I&#8217;d certainly like to understand, but I&#8217;ve accepted won&#8217;t ever be fully comprehended.</p><p>God DAMN Corvallis, you were fun.</p><p>Story to be continued&#8230;</p><p></p><p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Lemonade Movie is making an appearance.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lemonademovie.com/">Lemonade</a>, a movie by <a rel="nofollow">Erik Proulx</a>, is a short film about him and a bunch of inspired people who saw unemployment as an opportunity, not a hardship.</p>
<p>Proulx recently visited Phoenix as part of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://laidoffcampphoenix.com/">LaidOffCamp</a> and was a hit. More than a few tough guys admitted to misty eyes after seeing the short film.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be showing Lemonade at 1pm at SkySong, just before we kick off ScottsdaleCamp. Let&#8217;s see what a group of inspired people can do for each other.</p>
<p>Following the movie, Proulx will be available via Skype for a short Q&amp;A period with the entire audience.</p>
<p>No cost for Lemonade. All we ask is that your share your experience and link where links are due.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support. See you April 24!</p>

While our facility has kindly been taken care of by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://adaptivecurriculum.com">Adaptive Curriculum</a>, we&#8217;re still looking to cover the costs of programs, stickers, pens, video tapes and possibly some Facebook ads. All funds raised will go directly to the event.</p>
<p><strong>Room Sponsorships</strong><br />
These are the big guns. $50 buys you a room to put your signs in (all day), special recognition on this website before the event, mention in the opening speech and your logo on any printed material. You&#8217;ll also receive a huge thanks from us and will be on the end of EVERY speaker video.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Sponsorships</strong><br />
Support the your presenters with $20 here. Your money buys your logo space on your sponsored speaker&#8217;s slides, as well as a 15-30 second bio of your company (either written by you or in cooperation with us) and a place for your logo and URL on your published speaker video here at TheScottsdaleCamp.com.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your support. A PayPal link will be provided as soon as the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://innovatephoenix.org/">PIF</a> group wraps up <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ignitephoenix.com">IgnitePhx</a> and we ask them for one.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Get this guy a medal for that beard.</p>
</div>Each of these groups sell their wares to masses of normal people (or provide information for other companies to do the same). Their strength, and their profits, rely on making a lot of things for a lot of people for less money per item than it takes to make a few things for a few people.
<p>This tactic worked for years. Lack of choice, limited marketing mediums and fear of change (few TV channels, no easily found and trusted &#8216;weird&#8217; internet sites and the desire to be like our friends and colleagues) kept normal people in line. We bought groceries from Wal-Mart, electronics from Best Buy and everything else from Amazon.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think normal people are somehow bad. They&#8217;re not. They choose to be that way and often live extremely happy lives. But what about those who choose different? What about people who choose to be weird?</p>
<p>Seth Godin&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719223/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=tdhurstsays-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=1936719223">We Are All Weird</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tdhurstsays-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1936719223&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important;"/> delves into this new world of weird. He states that the mass markets aren&#8217;t going to get any more massive and the years of changing consumer behavior to fit the mean are over.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The factory came first. It led to the mass market. Not the other way around.&#8221; -page 9,</em> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719223/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=tdhurstsays-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=1936719223">We Are All Weird</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tdhurstsays-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1936719223&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important;"/></p>

</div>Factories all over the world are dying, even if they don&#8217;t know it yet. There&#8217;s just too much choice–too many weird people–out there to continually treat everyone the same. For someone who wears minimalist shoes, eschews (tries to, anyway) wheat and sugar and recently discovered the joy of personally tailored clothes, this is a godsend.
<p>But weird comes with its own problems. Weird products and services, because they can&#8217;t always be made or offered efficiently on scale, cost more. And because the market of the weird isn&#8217;t quite as efficient or consistent as the typical mass market, anything produced will be in short supply. Limited edition, formerly a marketing buzzword to get us to BUY IT NOW, will soon become the default.</p>
<p>There are 7400 hardcover copies left of Seth Godin&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719223/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=tdhurstsays-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=1936719223">We Are All Weird</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tdhurstsays-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1936719223&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important;"/> and he has no plans to print any more, ever. Buy it and see how being ourselves, how being individuals, how being weird is how it almost always was and how it always will be.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><em>(This started out one way and then completely switched on me about halfway through. Was going to talk about playing tennis in Vivo Barefoots, which was challenging but doable. Instead I wrote a diary entry. While all the marketers keep saying not to talk about yourself, I can&#8217;t seem to help it much.)<br />
</em><br />
There is no greater weapon in an amateur tennis player&#8217;s skill set than a kick serve. Forget a great topspin forehand, a backhand slice or even a great serve-and-volley game, a consistent kick serve will win you every other game outright.</p>
<p>The kick serve, also called a topspin serve, isn&#8217;t necessarily the hardest hit ball. It doesn&#8217;t have to be. When it&#8217;s on, a good kick serve clears the net by five feet, drops off a cliff just inside the service line and jumps up and toward a returner&#8217;s (right-handed) backhand. Or face. Or torso. Wherever it ends up, a proper kick serve made an amateur return guy feel and look pretty dumb.</p>
<p>I have it in me to unleash such a weapon. Last night&#8211;my first competitive tennis match in over a decade&#8211;my kick serve worked for two games. My second serve, while slower, gave the other guy fits.</p>
<p>And then I remembered I was old. As most undisciplined players are wont to do, I kept swinging harder and harder and tired myself out. Dizzy with a mouth and nose full of shit-smelling dust from the cow pastures to the southwest thanks to a dust storm, I played the rest of my two sets out, winning a 11 games to my opponent&#8217;s 10.</p>
<p>One win…whee. Point totals roll over from week to week, so giving up so many games meant my victory will matter little. But that&#8217;s not the point.</p>
<p>It was fun. That&#8217;s my point. It felt good to try so hard. It felt good to be good, even for a game or two. It felt good to understand that most of what we do in life depends on us knowing how to do one thing really well and a lot of other things fairly well. My forehand and kick serve rock, but tire me out. My backhand and net game suck and also tire me out.</p>
<p>I suppose I could break out the ball machine and practice backhands for hours. I could do all the drills my tennis coach taught me and spend a ton of time perfecting a stroke I use less than 20% of the time. I could also run court sprints and work on my volleys so I&#8217;d never lose a point at the net. While I won&#8217;t be ignoring these parts of my game, there&#8217;s no reason to devote a good deal of my time and energy to them.</p>
<p>If I perfect my kick serve, I&#8217;ll win at least every other match. If I can get my topspin forehand under control, I&#8217;ll be able to win almost half the points when the other guy is serving. My efforts seem best suited toward improving what I&#8217;m best at dramatically, while staying passable in my least-liked and used skills.</p>
<p>For work, I currently write blogs, produce short videos, help with IT stuff, edit stories, ghost write novels, create marketing plans and act as a problem solver for any problem a client or possible client may have. I&#8217;m a jack of all trades who works every second I&#8217;m not sleeping or exercising.</p>
<p>But what if I concentrated on one thing. What if I stopped following sports so much, turned a blind eye toward tech news, ignored new marketing trends and eliminated or at least severely curtailed any job or project that didn&#8217;t suit my main talents?</p>
<p>My honesty is my kick serve. Time to figure out how to use it.<br />

<p>And this is what I think it means to be American:</p>
<p>Everyone deserves a chance. Maybe only one, but they deserve one regardless of anything but prior actions.</p>
<p>We help those that need it, regardless. We live in a civilized society, basic needs can always be met.</p>
<p>Manners (how we act toward others) are more important than laws. If we all we&#8217;re decent to each other, we wouldn&#8217;t need laws.</p>
<p>Ideas and innovation are the backbone of any leader. We need to embrace change.</p>
<p>We have the freedom to almost anything we want, and the maturity to embrace the consequences.</p>
<p>We can, if we so choose, be a greater version of ourself on every new day.<br />

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><em>(I&#8217;m sure that blog posts like this are the reason my dad thinks I don&#8217;t have more clients and am not more successful in business. That being said, I don&#8217;t know of any other way to get this stuff out and I feel an obligation to share. Granted, this isn&#8217;t as inspiring as most of the other real writers I constantly compare myself to, but this is what you get when you have no actual education in how to write correctly. Okay, I&#8217;m done apologizing for myself.)</em></p>
<p>Never satisfied. Always looking to get better. Constantly obsessed with busting the status quo. Disagreeing with authority on principle.</p>
<p>None of these things matter without an end goal. They end up making a person bitter, angry, upset, frustrated and a shell of who they should be.</p>
<p>I have no idea what a meaningful life is. Love? Have that and that is AWESOME. Financial success? Eh, but I don&#8217;t need much. Recognition? A fair amount&#8211;I mean, there are tshirts out there with my face on them. A sense of a job done well? Never.</p>
<p>I suppose part of being &#8220;creative&#8221; is never being satisfied, but that creates an endless cycle of disappointment.</p>
<p>And all the above creates stress. Stress that will slowly kill you. Stress that makes your body function at high alert for hours on end, exhausting our ability to think, fight off disease and even process food correctly.</p>

<p>In the new movie <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thestateofillusion.com/">People vs The State Of Illusion</a>, writer/producer Austin Vickers discusses, among other things, the amount of stimuli that we&#8217;re exposed to every single day. It&#8217;s something in the billions range, but we can only process about .0001% of that. No matter how much we read, how much we produce and how many places we travel, our minds cannot use most of what we&#8217;re exposed to.</p>
<p>But dammit, I sure as hell try. Writing, visiting, reading, giving an opinion, volunteering where I can…it&#8217;s become a race against time. How much can I do today? How much can I do for others today?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really, really hard. So hard that I cried during the first 15-20 minutes of this movie. Right in the middle of the movie theater with my Donald Duck &#8220;This is my happy face&#8221; cap pulled low, I cried tears of frustration and maybe a little catharsis. After the movie, I couldn&#8217;t wait to tell Austin that it had saved my life.</p>
<p>I see it now, I told him. People can change, but only if we accept that our reality can be shaped by us. Only if we accept that some of what we do is bad for us and instead of running from those bad things (overeating, depression, addiction, etc.) we should run straight toward to see what GOOD it&#8217;s doing for us.</p>
<p>Why did I used to drink until I blacked out? I loved living in the moment.</p>
<p>Why do I eat an entire pizza and many bags of popcorn? It reminds me of home and being safe.</p>
<p>Why am I addicted to Twitter/Facebook/anywhere people will read my thoughts? It gives me a sense that I&#8217;m doing something.</p>
<p>But nothing has really changed. A long, relaxing trip to Flagstaff wasn&#8217;t enough. A five-day trip to LA and Disneyland wasn&#8217;t enough. The support of the lovely Katie (who puts up with my almost daily Gangplank criticism and does her best not to take it personally) sure helps, but she can&#8217;t fix me either.</p>
<p>This feeling of helplessness hits me every August. I really, really don&#8217;t like this heat. Call me a pussy if you want, but if people can get sad because of too much rain, it certainly stands to reason that the same damn thing could happen when I wake up sweaty, spend my day sweaty and go to bed hoping I won&#8217;t wake up with a soaked pillow and sheets. But I digress.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I was able to act on what I recognized in The State Of Illusion. I wish I could say that I feel better and that I know what it is I&#8217;m supposed to be doing and how to ensure that my life and those of who I love will be great.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m stuck feeling dissatisfied, upset with myself and frustrated that I&#8217;m not doing enough.</p>
<p>Either way, I&#8217;m going to see the movie again. Perhaps the second showing will allow me some kind of respite from the spinning in my head. It sure as hell worked the first time, but I know something needs to change. This time, I&#8217;m taking notes.</p>
<p>And this time I&#8217;m not going to run away.<br />

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Every day I yearn to be a part of something greater than myself. I want to improve lives, right wrongs and remove obstacles to success. I yearn for this because I think success isn&#8217;t a zero-sum game. But this isn&#8217;t totally altruistic.</p>
<p>The selfish part of me knows that if others get better, the bar will be raised and I&#8217;ll be pushed to new levels of understanding.</p>
<p>Then I realized I was starting to sound like a self-help book bought in a clearance bin and I shut the hell up. I&#8217;d rather do one small, specific, measurable thing than choose a lifetime of maybes and promises. Enter <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://j.mp/r03ald">End Malaria Day</a>.</p>
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Buying <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://endmalariaday.com/">this book</a> will save lives.</strong> </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Malaria-ebook/dp/B005CKBF4I/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2"><img src="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EM_Logo_v13_110603_whiteonblack.jpg" alt="" title="EM_Logo_v13_110603_whiteonblack" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5880"/></a></p>
<p>Every penny of every <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Malaria-ebook/dp/B005CKBF4I/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">Kindle version</a> sold and at least $20 of every <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://j.mp/n49HYZ">hardcover</a> sale goes straight to Malaria No More (recent audited financials show their overhead to be less than 20%) to buy mosquito nets to protect children.</p>
<p>Feel free to scoff at my altruism and go back to whatever it is you do for a living. That&#8217;s cool. But next time you find yourself bored and out of touch with a deep longing to make a difference, remember that 4/5 of every dollar you spend will be protection against a disease mostly unknown to the western world. </p>
<p>I suppose I should mention that this book is filled with 63 essays from people more successful than you or I, but I honestly don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;d recommend you buy a blank book if I knew it would have this kind of impact.</p>
<p>As a member of the Domino Project Street Team, our goal is to sell something like 100,000 copies and save four million lives &#8212; on the first day. </p>
<p>I invite you to share in our goal and make a choice that absolutely makes a difference.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s save some lives, shall we?<br />

<p><img src="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/southwest.jpeg" alt="Southwest" border="0" width="288" height="288" style="float:right;"/>It&#8217;s that last one that freaks me out the most. I&#8217;m always very mindful of where my iPhone and laptop are, and even more so aware of my Kindle, as I have a tendency to stick it in the seat in front of me. Thankfully, I&#8217;ve never left anything on a plane and judging from the many horror stories I hear about people who do, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve never lost anything.</p>
<p>My buddy Chris Lee has the same issue. On a recent flight back home to Phoenix, he left his iPad in the seat in front of him, not realizing until hours later that it was missing. Here&#8217;s the beginning of his story:</p>
<p><em>I was flying back from Dreamforce 2011 on Southwest and happened to run into a buddy, Brandon Willey. We secured seats together and had killer conversation all the way back. Prior to Brandon finding his seat, I’d pulled out my iPad though I had a suspicion that I’d not end up using it. I figured my buddy and I would end up talking throughout. So at some point I stuck it in the seat back and I think somewhere in the back of my head, I realized it probably wasn’t a good idea.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;s screwed, right? If not for John San Diego, he surely would be. Read on to find out how far one good employee went to make sure Chris got his iPad back without having to wait weeks for Southwest Air Customer Service to get back to him.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we love PodcampAZ so much is the endless supply of information. We also realize that the term “media” is growing up, and always expanding. No one rolls their eyes at using Facebook anymore to promote, because everyone links to Facebook! Many companies and freelancers make social media success less of a guessing game and more of a science, but there are many mediums within the realm that are getting less attention than they should.</p>
<p>Right now you’re thinking “Yeah! I want to hear more about ______!”      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://podcampaz.org/wp-content/uploads/4139050991_4a20ce766e1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-220" title="Evo Speaking" src="http://podcampaz.org/wp-content/uploads/4139050991_4a20ce766e1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"/></a></p>
<p>So how do we geeks, let alone anyone who isn’t on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Foursquare, learn about all of these new or under-represented technologies? How do they merge their existing skills with new ideas and make life even more awesome than it all ready is?</p>
<p>They ask you, and your friends. We all use a form of media in some way, or you wouldn’t be reading this now. And we bet you know someone who uses it in an innovative way that we all want to know about. They might not even realize there’s a place to share what they know.</p>
<p>Please help us get all of these questions answered all in one weekend at PodcampAZ 2011 on November 12-13.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://podcampaz.org/speakers/">Nominate yourself</a>, your work buddy, Twitter or Facebook friend, or even your sister to help out. Each speaker will receive our undying gratitude, an audience eager to learn and a chance to learn from other successful, charming people just like them.<br />

<p>While many a high achiever has already at least dreamed about their acceptance speech to whatever organization they&#8217;d like to honor them, it&#8217;s short sighted to think our hopes and dreams will stay the same now as they will be years from now.</p>
<p>As I watch my father bounce around a job market that has made him a number&#8211;just another factory worker&#8211;I feel blessed that I am able to do work that I am proud of and can at least somewhat support the lifestyle I&#8217;d like to lead.</p>
<p>And if my farewell speech is at half as thankful as Dennis Rodman&#8217;s, I should feel pretty good about the legacy I&#8217;ll be leaving.</p>
<p></p> 
<p><em>(I read Dennis Rodman&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440222664/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=tdhurstsays-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=0440222664">Bad as I Wanna Be</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0440222664&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important;"/> over ten years ago and loved it. Fascinating look at why he became the caricature that he did.)</em></p>

         <description>During my 19-month foray into corporate America, I learned many new terms that I would never, ever hear anywhere else. Phrases like &amp;#8220;non-rev&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;non-essential personnel&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;reach out&amp;#8221; bounced from talking head to talking head.

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>During my 19-month foray into corporate America, I learned many new terms that I would never, ever hear anywhere else. Phrases like &#8220;non-rev&#8221;, &#8220;non-essential personnel&#8221; and &#8220;reach out&#8221; bounced from talking head to talking head.</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a code designed to keep me out. A sort of cool lingo that was only available to insiders. It may have been above or beyond me, but either way, I felt threatened by it. I hated that I didn&#8217;t know what the words meant, but not because I wanted to be able to do what they allowed, rather that I just wanted to know.</p>
<p>Thanks to Google and Twitter, I figured it out in minutes&#8211;but spent hours. The next time I flew on a free ticket, I knew that non-rev meant &#8220;not a paying customer&#8221; and was insulted that someone who&#8217;d bought MANY tickets in order to qualify for this &#8220;free&#8221; flight would be in any way singled out except to be praised.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gapingvoid.com"><img src="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/product_thumb.php_.jpeg" alt="Gaping Void" title="product_thumb.php" width="509" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5845"/></a></p>
<p>It makes sense, right? Cost me a lot of money to fly the miles to qualify for the ticket, so I obviously enjoyed the airline enough to choose them again and again. But the phrase non-rev tasted like wet bread or waterlogged pretzels. Did you know most non-rev passengers must go through the most invasive TSA scan because they&#8217;re often booked on two, one-way flights instead of one, round-trip? Happened to an ex-girlfriend, which made what should have been a fun flight home feel like we were stowaways lucky to find a seat.</p>
<p>Nevermind that I had actually PAID for my seat. Consorting with my non-rev ex-girlfriend had apparently infected me. So that sucked.</p>
<p>Hearing &#8220;reach out&#8221; all the time was weird, too. &#8220;Reach out&#8221; to that sales guy, &#8220;reach out&#8221; to your colleagues, &#8220;reach around&#8221; to your boss and so on. Where was I reaching? How should I be reaching? Which hand should I use? I&#8217;m right handed, but I can bat and shoot layups left handed, so maybe I should protect my important hand and use my left?</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gapingvoidart.com"><img src="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Believe_Copy.1.jpg" alt="" title="Believe_Copy.1" width="599" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5843"/></a></p>
<p>Wait, &#8220;reach out&#8221; means I should just call them? Can&#8217;t I go to their office? The door is open, I can see it when I stand up. I&#8217;m not allowed to walk in unannounced so I can &#8220;reach out&#8221;? Do I have to &#8220;reach out&#8221; before I &#8220;reach out&#8221;? Christ, you may as well call it smurfing.</p>
<p>After reaching out appropriately and having shallow conversations about nothing more than what we used to do, I set about doing my duty in my cube. Months passed and then there was a blackout. High summer temperatures had forced rolling blackouts and our building had been hit. We were all emailed and told that &#8220;non-essential personnel&#8221; would not need to come in, but would be paid their regularly daily wage. We were instructed to ask our supervisors for the account code when we were back in the office and to make sure it be done before next Friday, the end of the pay period.</p>
<p>Okay, cool. Paid day off. But what is this non-essential personnel thing? You mean me not showing up to work doesn&#8217;t affect much? That my presence and actions are a luxury rather than a need? That I wasn&#8217;t very important and when it really came down to it, it was cheaper for my employer to not deal with me that day than have me come in and do work?</p>
<p>I was thankful for this. I didn&#8217;t much want to drive and I sure as hell didn&#8217;t want to drive to work, get my laptop, and bring it home so I could pretend to work from the couch. If I really needed to I could check webmail to see if anything needed to be done today&#8211;not that I had the ability to do it from where I was.</p>
<p>Non-essential personnel is the worst. Just after my second leave for pilonidal cyst surgery (paid injury leave is certainly a huge perk of corporate America), I had planned to come back to work the week of 4th of July (Thursday that year, I think). And then the power went out.</p>
<p>The first day, right before I left for work, we all received an email that told us to wait for manager approval to come INTO work and that managers should tell all non-essential personnel to remain at home.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gapingvoid.com"><img src="http://tdhurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/product_thumb-1.php_.jpeg" alt="" title="product_thumb-1.php" width="509" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5844"/></a></p>
<p>I was told to remain at home. After being absent for nearly six weeks, I had a nagging suspicion that what I did a) wasn&#8217;t very hard and b) wasn&#8217;t very important. While I do understand that showing up to an office without power would have been a waste of my time, being labeled as unnecessary seemed a bit much.</p>
<p>We were told to work from home for the rest of the week. I checked my laptop once a day, ignored my voicemail and treated the extra few days like an extended vacation (which meant I worked on a ton of other more interesting projects that paid jack but helped me and/or others). </p>
<p>Non-essential? I showed them!<br />

Some of us are experienced, some not. Some of us practiced&#8211;we did for an hour&#8211;and some have had classes. Some of us were also scared to death to go onstage even though there were 33 people in the audience and no live stream.</p>
<p>That last guy was me. While I&#8217;m usually comfortable in front of a crowd and leave little behind my internal filter, the experience of walking on stage with two other people who I didn&#8217;t know all that well and making stories up was exciting at first. I&#8217;m a master bullshitter, right? I have no problem saying just about anything.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. Improv&#8211;really good improv&#8211;is very, very hard. It&#8217;s nothing like a stage play, nothing like a speech and certainly nothing like spouting off online. What it is very much like is pickup sports (my favorite is basketball) where a group of people who agree on basic principles get together to play an unscripted game. Sure, there are fundamentals that must be incorporated, but no one goes into a pickup game with set plays or any real practice.</p>
<p>You take what you get and go from there.</p>
<p>Just like improv.</p>
<p>Improv, just like a pickup basketball game, can teach you a helluva lot about your life, provided you&#8217;re able to survive the experience. I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m chubbier than I thought. Damn.</li>
<li>Sweat is super noticeable.</li>
<li>I say well a lot.</li>
<li>I need to enunciate better and speak louder.</li>
<li>I need to trust my body.</li>
<li>I must sell my colleagues AND the audience on jokes.</li>
<li>Process is almost always more important than outcome.</li>
<li>People generally want others to succeed.</li>
<li>Staying in the moment feels awesome.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no time to reflect when you&#8217;re really living.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life moves pretty fast. If we never take the time to live in the moment, we&#8217;ll miss it. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://downtownphoenixjournal.com/2011/08/02/torch-theatres-4721-opens/">Improv</a> may have not made me a better person, performer, writer, lover or friend, but it sure as hell made me realize that fear is a necessary part of growth and that if we go through life avoiding risk, we&#8217;ll never be happy.</p>
<p></p>

         <title>Fitness goal for the next three days</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/fitness-goal-for-the-next-three-days</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MeYouHealth is group of healthy minded individuals who partake in daily challenges that seek to improve their overall health and well being. &lt;p /&gt; Today's challenge was to write down a fitness goal for the next three days and this is what popped in my head: &lt;p /&gt; Jump over a heavily fortified fence. I need to do this to get into the Chandler police equipment and evidence locker and see their loot. &lt;p /&gt; I have to jump 3+ feet, pull myself up, balance on a six-inch wide lip (so as to not set off the motion detectors) and then leap across what looks like a few feet of razor wire. &lt;p /&gt; A standing leap my do it, but I have to keep my weight forward to make sure I don't catch on the razor wire, which may reduce my leaping distance. &lt;p /&gt; Maybe I'll throw something rubber over the wire. Or maybe pogo jump over the wall instead. &lt;p /&gt; Will keep you posted.
	
&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;...and publish it and be successful and do Q&amp;amp;A sessions like the Rooster Teeth guys do at PAX.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written some short-novel length stuff, but nothing complete yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until then, I'd sure as hell like to see others succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teel of Modern Evil is helping a South African author turn a book of poetry into a printed piece. They need $330 to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave $10. Won't you, too?&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mad Men walk-on for Morgan! Vote now!</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/mad-men-walk-on-for-morgan-vote-now</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I like Morgan.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, she's kinda perfect for Mad Men.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;She sent this to me earlier today, so DO WHAT SHE SAYS and no one will get hurt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hope this finds you all well. I’m writing because I’ve entered a contest to win a walk-on role on the TV show Mad Men, and in order to win, I need a LOT of votes! All you have to do is go to this&amp;nbsp;link&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/browse/detail/45a01f14a72736620760ec0d479cbbb30dda28cd&quot;&gt;http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/browse/detail/45a01f14a72736620760ec0d479cbbb30dda28cd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and click the “vote” button next to my photo. The first time requires that you create a login, but it only takes a minute and doesn’t&amp;nbsp;result in any junk email. You’re allowed to vote once every 24 hours. The contest ends September 25 and I think I really have a chance at winning with your help!&lt;p /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Please consider forwarding this to your own contacts; it would really mean a lot to me. Retweets and Facebook posts are much appreciated as well. If I can return the favor in any way, i.e., if anyone else needs nominations or votes for&amp;nbsp;another contest, please let me know.&lt;p /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thanks so much everyone!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Get to voting!&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Brian Clark's life story?</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/brian-clarks-life-story</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.... very well, where do i begin? &lt;br /&gt;My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. &lt;br /&gt;My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. &lt;br /&gt;My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. &lt;br /&gt;My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. &lt;br /&gt;At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. &lt;br /&gt;There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.
	
&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Have a buddy looking for this - &lt;p /&gt; &quot;I need a hacker, ethical preferred. You know anyone? I need two things: one, I need to scrape other sites in search of copyright infringement and two, I need to protect us against scraping. &lt;br /&gt;This hacker/consultant person can help with other aspects too like firewall configs, device recommendations, DDOS protections, intrusion protection and software security auditing. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing even grey area on my requests, everything I need is on the defense &amp; up-and-up. &lt;br /&gt;Know anyone? Know any place I could start to look?&quot; &lt;p /&gt; Help!

         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What if Darth Maul survived the first movie? &lt;p /&gt; What if the Emperor ordered Darth Maul to kill the Jedi younglings, and Anakin tried to stop him, but was injured? &lt;p /&gt; Then Obi Wan swooped in, killed Darth Maul, but in doing so, accidentally injured Padme? &lt;p /&gt; Then Anakin freaks out, blames Obi Wan for what he thinks is Padme's death, but Obi Wan defeats him? &lt;p /&gt; Padme dies, Anakin gets angry and the rest of the film goes on. &lt;p /&gt; It's better.

         <title>Don't Sell Me Bro (guest starring me)</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/dont-sell-me-bro-guest-starring-me</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I have trouble selling what I do. I'm not sure if it's a lack of confidence that what I do is valuable (it's easy for me, but only because I have lots of practice), have an issue asking people for money (highly likely) or I just don't like talking to people (unlikely), but I've never been a great salesman.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;When Conrey and Cooke offered me some quick sales training on their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/lnOV9m&quot;&gt;Don't Sell Me Bro podcast,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;I jumped right on it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Excellent tips and a few pointers that I'm still using. My biggest lesson?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ask for the sale. Never going to happen unless you ask.&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Very proud today</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/very-proud-today</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There are times in my life that I am completely, totally and absolutely both proud of myself and the people that I know. While I frequently make do with arrogance and bravado, this time it's the most humble form of pride that I know.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;A friend sent this yesterday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Short and sweet: I finally figured out what I want to do when I grow up because of you. Thanks for that. Keep doing what you do.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I did nothing to directly help my buddy, but I'm damn happy that I assisted.&lt;/div&gt;

	I just drove nearly two miles at night on a 50cc scooter through a few busy intersections while impaired, wearing Vibrams and listening to music via earbuds. &lt;p /&gt; I'm not sure if I have a death wish or that I think I'm invincible, but I feel fucking alive right now.

         <title>Dose Fly Id - TEDxScottsdale</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/dose-fly-id-tedxscottsdale</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As a sometimes journalist, full-time writer a very amateur video creator, I don't often have trouble getting people to open up. I have a ton of practice in asking probing questions that get interview subjects to open up about topics they normally wouldn't speak about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the subject knows that a) anything recorded will be edited and b) I'm not in it to make them look stupid, they usually relax a bit and we have our conversation, I take my notes and then write my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, the interview WAS the story, as we were trying to set up as realistic a presentation as possible without making it look like Dose had people behind the camera prodding him. So, we tried to ask ONE question and let him give his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried that three times. It didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bob had the idea just to turn on the camera, start talking as a group and slowly ease out of the frame. This worked well, and the video you see has a minimum of edits. Most of the segues were his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Airport, Bikilas, Coffeemaker and Surround Sound System for sale!</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/airport-bikilas-and-surround-sound-system-for</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Time to pass on a bunch of stuff I'm no longer using. &lt;p /&gt; First, my b/g Airport Extreme Base Station. It's the UFO one AND it has a modem. No longer made. Works perfectly, I was offered a free newer one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/ele/2300887549.html&quot;&gt;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/ele/2300887549.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p /&gt; As much as I love Vibrams, I never could get used to my Bikilas. Time for someone with higher arches than my flat feet to try them out. Good condition. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/clo/2317036154.html&quot;&gt;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/clo/2317036154.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm finally switching to tea, so I need to give up my nice coffeemaker. It's programmable and comes with insulated mug and thermos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/app/2317145414.html&quot;&gt;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/app/2317145414.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie and I brought this JVC surround sound system back from Chicago because I really wanted it. Turns out, it's too loud for this apartment. Or I'm not man enough to handle the bass. Either way, someone else should be using this. Has TOSLINK (optical audio) inputs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/ele/2297192568.html&quot;&gt;http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/ele/2297192568.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p /&gt; I'd rather not split the surround system up, but am willing to listen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Look Better Naked Challenge Day 1 - Work those pecs!</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/look-better-naked-challenge-day-1-work-those</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After my &quot;successful&quot; participation in Vin Vallejo's Body Fat Reduction Content, in which I was the only one who GAINED inches (in the manly areas, I lost in my gut), Katie said she wanted to try something similar. So I'm going to take what I learned from Vin and continue my own training while whipping Katie into shape as well. &lt;p /&gt; We'll try to get both our measurements done so that we can track progress over the next few months, but our first day, which was actually Monday, was pretty good. &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Katie really, really doesn't like the foam roller.
	
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BFRC Day 57 - Results</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/bfrc-day-57-results</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After nearly two months of training with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://facebook.com/vinvallejo&quot;&gt;Vin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and competing for a $2500 cash prize, the results are in: I didn't win.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;In fact, I GAINED INCHES. Seriously. I was, as of 6pm, the ONLY contestant who actually gained inches.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, I did gain in all the manly areas (arms, shoulders, chest and legs) while losing in the fatty places (a bit in the ass and an inch around my gut), so the entire process (minus the nearly three weeks I missed because of travel and sickness) was absolutely worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel stronger, look better and, most importantly, have way, way more energy than I have in quite a long time. My next task will be to train Katie the best I can as I prep for my next half or full marathon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Huge thanks to Vin, as I'll still be training with him sporadically as long as I can keep up giving him some publicity (CLICK ON HIS LINKS! JOIN HIS GYM!) or convince him to trade gym time for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://profitnessaz.com&quot;&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>BFRC Day 56 - What's next?</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/bfrc-day-56-whats-next</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Okay, so I didn't lose all the weight I hoped. My slow struggle to change my eating habits, a weeklong illness and a loooooong road trip to Chicago certainly didn't help, but the responsibility is obviously mine.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now it's Katie's turn. Starting tomorrow, and every weekday until we get tired, I'll be training with my fiancée to help the both of us reach our fitness goals. While I'm certain it won't be as productive as my workouts at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://profitnessaz.com&quot;&gt;Pro Fitness AZ&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure I'll be able to figure something out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Next on my plate is more running, as I'd really like to get my per mile time under nine minutes for runs 10+ miles. I'll also be out on my bike a bit more and will eventually start swimming as I prep for Ironman 2012 in Tempe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whew.&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Day 54 &amp; 55 - Done</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/day-54-55-done</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It's been nearly two months since I started working out with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://facebook.com/vinvallejo&quot;&gt;Vin&lt;/a&gt;. While we didn't make it five days a week every week, we certainly came close.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I dry heaved five times, sweated gallons and managed to make every pair of pants and shorts I own too big. I'm also working on a nice four-pack that is begging to be let out from underneath a few more pounds of belly fat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;My arms are noticeably larger, my neck is smaller and I feel GOOD. Did it hurt? Hell yes it did. Did it suck giving up flour, sugar and Diet Coke (for the most part)? Yes, at first.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it was definitely worth it. While I doubt I'll win the contest, my time spent at the gym was more than worth it, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Next step? Marathon. 2012 Ironman after that.&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>BFRC Day 53 - Whew</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/bfrc-day-53-whew</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Much needed day off today, as my forearms and abs still ache from workouts earlier this week. I suppose that's a good thing, but the pain involved is trying to tell me it's not. &lt;p /&gt; And I had a Diet Coke today. I know I wasn't supposed to because of my self imposed no sugar, flour or Diet Coke month of March, but dammit, it's St. Patrick's Day and I don't even drink anymore. I figure a can of Diet Coke when I REALLY want one won't kill me. &lt;p /&gt; I'm also noticing a positive change in the pictures taken of me. While I still look a bit chubby slobbish, my profile has improved even over the past three weeks. Hopefully I won't have to cringe much longer when seeing myself on video or photos. &lt;p /&gt; I think it's a stretch day tomorrow and I really, really want to get some runs in this weekend.
	
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BFRC Day 52 - More pain, more gain</title>
         <link>http://tylerdhurst.com/bfrc-day-52-more-pain-more-gain</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After begging off boxing yesterday (I jammed or bruised both my hands and it hurt to even throw a punch, so we did core work instead), I figured&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://facebook.com/vinvallejo&quot;&gt;Vin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;would want to punish me having such fun assigning core work yesterday.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So he made me challenge a girl.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=776923528&quot;&gt;Megan Hoover&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and I were workout buddies today, which mostly consisted of one of us doing something continuously while the other plowed through a certain number of reps so we both could finish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Megan, who's likely stronger than I am, held her own just fine. The sprints were a little tough for the both of us, but I'm proud that I have no shin splints from running today. First time in a while that I've sprinted without major calf pain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;My shoulders are tired, my forearms hurt from Monday and my abs are making it hard to get out of bed, but damn, it feels good.&lt;/div&gt;

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I&#8217;ve never run a half marathon in less than 2:10. I&#8217;ve never run one in Vibram Five Fingers in less than 2:17. After my fifth half marathon, it&#8217;s become apparent that I need to do a lot more with my training if I want to get faster or ever compete in a triathlon.</p>
<p>My legs are great. Strong, lean and in probably the best shape of my life. But my upper body? Psh. I carry all my fat there. From my protruding gut to my pecs that jiggle a lot more than I&#8217;d like, it&#8217;s time for some full body workouts. So when Vin Vallejo of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://profitnessaz.com">Pro Fitness AZ</a> offered me a chance to compete in a two-month Body Fat Reduction Challenge in exchange for documenting my progress, I jumped at the chance. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_111" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width:200px;">
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.barefootrunning.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DSCF0053.jpg"><img src="http://www.barefootrunning.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DSCF0053.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0053" width="200" height="211" class="size-full wp-image-111"/></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Who's that chunky dude on the left? That's me? Huh.</p>
</div>I&#8217;ve never worked out full time in Vibram Five Fingers before. I suppose I should be worried about dropping a weight on my toes or slipping, but they&#8217;ve been great in the gym. Except for the few times I have to rest on my heels, I forget I&#8217;m not wearing regular shoes.
<p>I still get questions about my Sprints, ranging from &#8220;don&#8217;t they hurt your feet&#8221; to &#8220;are they really comfortable,&#8221; but I&#8217;m really surprised that more serious trainers don&#8217;t use them. Maybe they know something I don&#8217;t or perhaps they&#8217;re just not distance runners. Or maybe the Vibram Five Fingers are just too ugly. My Sprints certainly are. (what new color should I get?)</p>
<p>The goal of my time with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/vinvallejo">Vin</a> is to lose 8% of my body fat, to get down to 17% total body fat. The plan is to lose 30ish lbs of fat and gain 6-7 lbs of muscle. The first two weeks haven&#8217;t been easy, as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tylerdhurst.com/body-fat-reduction-challenge">my posts from each day</a> will attest.</p>
<p>My hope is that adding weight and resistance training, from an actual trainer, will help me prepare to compete in the 2012 Ironman in Tempe that November. A lofty goal, but hell, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shankman.com/race-report-ironman-cozumel/">Peter Shankman</a> did it, so I figure with some serious training, I can too.</p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;ll be biking and running almost barefoot. But which Vibram Five Fingers should I run in?</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong>2:20.</strong> That&#8217;s two hours and twenty minutes it took me to run 13.1 miles this morning. Of my five half marathons, this is my second-worst time, but only if you count my disastrous 2:45+ showing in L.A. that had me limping three miles to the finish.</p>
<p>I should probably be disappointed in myself and frustrated that my half marathon times have increased steadily over the past two years. Any semi-serious runner would see finishing as necessary, but improvement as paramount, and I haven&#8217;t been improving.</p>
<p>But if I sort out my running a bit, I remember that my last race in regular shoes was a scant year ago and that I&#8217;ve only been running full time in Vibrams for slightly over 13 months. In that time, I&#8217;ve run four half marathons, <strong>completely changed my running form</strong> and suffered through ITBS so painful I rested for the <strong>entirety</strong> of November 2010.</p>
<p>This also means I had a scant six training weeks to get ready for this morning, and as I sit here typing this, I&#8217;m aware of a few things that are certainly different than my other races.</p>
<p><strong>1. I don&#8217;t hurt anymore</strong><br />
I&#8217;m stiff, I&#8217;m sore and I&#8217;m tired, but nothing really hurts. I didn&#8217;t lean on Katie in order to walk like I did in June at Seattle and I didn&#8217;t need medical attention like I did in L.A. I&#8217;m also not limping like I was after my 10-mile run last week.</p>
<p><strong>2. I know exactly what I need to do to get better</strong><br />
I signed up for my first half marathon as a knee-jerk reaction to my pilonidal cyst surgery, knowing that if I spent money on registration, I was far more likely to train. I had no idea what I was doing then and subsequently hurt a ton after the race. I have a plan now.</p>
<p><strong>3. I FEEL good</strong><br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m heavier than I should be and I&#8217;m sure I could be faster, but I can&#8217;t cut weight or get faster with poor form that injures me. Running no longer hurts as much as it used to.</p>
<p><strong>4. I have a sense of purpose</strong><br />
Ironman 2012. I know it sounds crazy and way too much of a commitment, but dammit, it&#8217;s a helluva thing to be able to do. I&#8217;m sure it will hurt and I&#8217;m sure it will be harder than I can imagine, but you don&#8217;t get better by repeatedly doing things you&#8217;ve already done.</p>
<p><strong>5. My friends run now</strong><br />
When I first started, I knew absolutely no one who ran. While I haven&#8217;t really met many new people (except for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/corey_nagle">Corey Nagle</a>, whose posts are noticeably absent) through running, I&#8217;ve met them through other activities. We&#8217;ve shared stories, traded tips and served to inspire each other. Without the support of others, competing against yourself gets really lonely.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>Cross training. Cross fit. Fat loss. Strength building. More running, biking and swimming. </p>
<p>22 months until Ironman 2012 here in AZ. Will you be ready?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky not to have seriously injured myself while running, but I&#8217;ve come way close. I&#8217;m hesitant to share some of the crappy (literally!) situations I&#8217;ve gotten myself into, but what the hell, at least you&#8217;ll laugh.</p>

</div><strong>1. I&#8217;ve never crapped my pants while on a run</strong><br />
Oh, but I&#8217;ve come oh so close. On an early morning run this past summer, I went a little further out of my way than I&#8217;d planned and because I hadn&#8217;t had my morning shit yet, so I was full of it. About two miles from home the urge hit me and since I was in the middle of the Willo neighborhood in Phoenix, I had nowhere to go. I ran into an alley, found a secluded spot next to a huge dumpster and made waste. RIP, gray running shirt. 
<p><strong>2. I&#8217;ve never been hit by a car</strong><br />
And I&#8217;m really not sure how, because Phoenix drivers are dicks. In spring 2010, while running after dark along the very well-lit section of Central Ave in downtown Phoenix &#8211; the part with the Light Rail &#8211; I crossed Thomas with the signal. Every car stopped, except the last fucker who really wanted to turn right and couldn&#8217;t be bothered by a crosswalk. I remember shuffling my feet, worried I was about to get hit, and had I not slowed down by a half a step, my legs would have been crushed by a goddamn girl on her cell phone in an Acura. Fuck you, girl in that Acura.</p>
<p><strong>3. I&#8217;ve never passed out</strong><br />
But I&#8217;ve come damn close. You see, dehydration is a bad thing. I usually drink TOO much water and end up having to pee during my run, but for some reason I was a little light on my water intake before this run and noticed, about a mile from home, that I&#8217;d stopped sweating even though it was 95+ and I&#8217;d just run five miles. I threw up, twice, got some water and hurried my ass home. I don&#8217;t remember much about that run, except to know you can never drink enough water.</p>
<p><strong>4. I&#8217;ve never run with anyone beyond a mile</strong><br />
I play lots of team and partner sports, but running just isn&#8217;t one I&#8217;m good with other people. I ran with Katie a few times, but she quickly tired of my endless chatter and my endurance. I guess me running is an individual thing.</p>
<p><strong>5. I&#8217;ve never not finished a race</strong><br />
This once meant I had to limp three miles, which is an experience I never, ever want to have happen again. Somewhat oddly, sporting events are the only thing I&#8217;ve never quit early. In my life. Perhaps I should treat my professional life like I do my athletic one. Watch out, future clients and colleagues.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>In 12 days I will run my fifth half marathon and my third in Vibrams. I am less prepared than I&#8217;ve ever been, as my ITBS flareup in November stole some of my prep time. I was originally signed up to run the marathon (26.2 miles!) this January, but meekly decided my body wasn&#8217;t going to be ready. Hell, I&#8217;m not sure my body is ready for a half.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_103" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width:300px;">
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://peeass.blogspot.com/2010/12/vibram-toe-socks-chronicles.html"><img src="http://www.barefootrunning.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2373-300x244.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_2373" width="300" height="244" class="size-medium wp-image-103"/></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">I also wore socks with my Sprints last week. Very comfy.</p>
</div>And then I ran 10.11 miles last week. Just out of the blue. I planned on running a quick 5k, turned it into 10k and then briefly considered running 13.1 miles. But when I made it to Elliott Road, about five miles north of my home, I realized the sun was setting. Normally this wouldn&#8217;t be a thing, but running another eight miles in sub-40 degree heat while wet seemed stupid. I also knew I was pushing my body a bit, so I completed the loop and headed toward home.
<p>I made it. My foot hurt the next day, but thanks to some <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myfivefingers.com/golf-balls-and-five-fingers/">golf ball therapy</a>, that&#8217;s gone now. My legs are a little stiff from lunges, squats and sprints yesterday, but I feel good.</p>
<p>12 days. 13.1 miles. Again.<br />

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I&#8217;m still not full recovered from my ITBS that flared up during my half marathon.</p>
<p>And my legs hurt. They hurt a whole f***ing lot.</p>
<p>I started training again last week, eager to prepare myself for another half marathon in mid January. I ran three miles early in the week, did some lunges and squats and played floor hockey that evening, and holy s*** do my legs hurt. IT bands on both legs decided to tighten up on me. I&#8217;m slow to stand up, slow to sit down and slow to do just about anything.</p>
<p>What caused it is easy: my basketball shoes are shot. The cushioning has given way and my sore legs prompted my body to land gingerly on the outside of my feet while sprinting around for an hour, producing a similar effect to what happened in L.A.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time like this that Vibrams seem f***ing stupid. I&#8217;ve never dealt with this kind of pain before, nor have I struggled so much to run. I wish I had a cure for my pain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty to combat my ailments, however. Studious use of a foam roller, combined with laying on a baseball, have managed to loosen up my muscles enough for me to walk kind of normally.</p>
<p>I really, really wish I knew what I was doing wrong because the foam roller and rolling baseballs hurt so much I tear up every time I use them. Is this struggle normal? God I f***ing hope not.<br />

	<p class="wp-caption-text">I had some serious trouble walking for about three days after the race. Ouch.</p>
</div>It&#8217;s now been four weeks since I&#8217;ve ran, worked out or done anything remotely athletic. My <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome">ITBS</a> is slowly getting better, but today is the first day I&#8217;m planning on working out since I limped the last three miles of the L.A. half marathon on October 24. I&#8217;d like to say I should have seen it coming, but let&#8217;s get serious here: I have no idea what to expect. Here are a few things I&#8217;ve learned from studying both injury prevention and running form over the past few months.
<p><strong>1. Weight training is essential</strong><br />
I pitched as a kid, and now my shoulder is shot. Had I lifted weights when I was younger, I could have prevented long-term issues. Same goes for running. While I certainly am not looking to get into bodybuilding, stronger, more flexible muscles allow for both faster injury recovery and a lesser chance of getting hurt in the first place, regardless of speed or running style.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stretching and foam rolling are absolutely essential</strong><br />
I seldom hurt after running, so I didn&#8217;t stretch or use my foam roller as often. This was stupid, naive and just about every other negative adjective. Absence of pain does not mean absence of the possibility of injury. Stretching and using the foam roller are now a part of my daily routine, whether I&#8217;m running, lifting weights or watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>3. Form is far more important than cardiovascular capacity</strong><br />
My lungs catch up far quicker than my tendons, bones and muscles adapt to longer distances. I was far too concerned with my lung capacity and as such always tried to run too fast. I know now that this matters very little.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be wary of terrain</strong><br />
My ITBS was aggravated by running the the graded streets and sidewalks of L.A. Had I paid more attention and run in the middle of the street or at least switched from left to right side, I could have prevented my injury. Living in flat Phoenix has spoiled me, as grade is seldom a problem.</p>
<p><strong>5. Physical therapy, no matter the pain, is worth it</strong><br />
My chiropractor&#8217;s office has a physical therapy group inside and I get regular massages from them. I paid $35 to have them work on my IT band two weeks ago. Although the treatment hurt like hell, I came out of it feeling much less pain in my knee. There&#8217;s only so much you can do on your own.</p>
<p>Ice, complete rest and stretching have been my best friends for the past couple of weeks. Time to get back into training so I can beat my Dad at the Phoenix half marathon in January.<br />

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I&#8217;ve run almost four half marathons, the last two in Vibrams. I&#8217;ve never broken 2:11 and I didn&#8217;t finish my last because of an ITBS flare up at mile 10. Three miles of limping and the ensuing weeks of recovery made me rethink why I run, why I race and what the hell it is I even want from life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m entering tougher and tougher physical challenges because I know I&#8217;ll fail. You see, I&#8217;ve become really, really good at failing. So much in that I feel comfortable down there. I relish the chance to climb out of a hole, but the problem is, that&#8217;s all I know. I know how to fall and how to get up, but not how to succeed once I&#8217;m upright.</p>
<p>I could probably bust my ass and be ready for the marathon in January. I could ignore my job search, put professional development on the back burner and replace real, steady progress for some athletic accomplishment.</p>
<p>Not that I mean to cheapen entering races; races are great goals that are for the most part good for runners are as way to chart their progress, but they must mean something more than that.</p>
<p>When I started running, I wanted to a) have something to clear my mind, b) lose weight and get in better shape and c) live a healthier overall lifestyle. Punishing myself physically wasn&#8217;t one of those goals.</p>
<p>My dad asked me to run the half marathon with him again this morning. Instead running the entire 26.2 alone, I&#8217;ll be running 13.1 with him. Life&#8217;s too short to spend my time going at it by myself.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hope I&#8217;ll beat him this time.<br />

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><em>“Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones, but by contrary extreme positions.” &#8211; Friedrich Nietzche</em>
<p>A friend asked for some advice and resources on barefoot running the other day, and it caught me off guard. Where DO I send someone for some good usable knowledge on how to get started with barefoot running? I didn’t have a quick, easy answer for that. Obviously, I pointed her here, but that was partly just shameless self-promotion (I said partly. Put the stick down, Tyler), but for someone new to barefoot/minimalist running, there’s not many places I’ve found that give you just the straight dope.</p>
<p>For your average joe, just googling “<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=barefoot+running">barefoot running</a>” gives a rabbit’s hole of scientific jargon and hippie-speak. Finding just the facts is difficult to the point of feeling futile. As (almost) barefooters we preach easing into barefooting, but at the same time bombard people with crazy [sounding] diets, insane workouts, and how everything they know about running is COMPLETELYWRONGSOSTOPDOINGITRIGHTNOWBEFOREYOURLEGSJUSTFALLOFF!</p>
</div>
<div>(Do you know how hard it was to type that?!)
<p>No, I don’t have anything against the paleo diet. It actually makes total sense to me. But, your long beard and Jesus hair might be kinda scary to someone who just wants to try something a little different. Yes, we are all passionate about our sport/way of life, and that’s great. Much respect to all who have ditched their traditional running shoes. Every last one of you, new or experienced, is an inspiration to me, but we all tend to be over-sharers. Don’t ambush runners at your local trail. If someone asks about your VFF’s or bare feet, keep it short and sweet. We all want to share the gospel of barefooting, but sometimes we start sounding like this guy:</p>
<p><iframe class="embeddedvideo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/G2OQoqpIkS4"></iframe></p> 
<p>Please, feel free to let me know if I start sounding like this (or call the proper authorities, whatever the case may be)</p>
<p>If you’re anything like me, once I find something that interests me, I consume every bit of knowledge I can find. But it’s daunting. There’s so many varying opinions out there &#8211; barefoot vs. minimalist shoes, diets, hundreds of differing training schedules to meet whatever running goals you may have set, crosstraining activities for your off days&#8230; It all turns into work. And nobody likes work. And since nobody likes work, I’m going to be a dick and give you homework:</p>
<p>Go run. That’s it.</p>
<p>Leave the mp3 player, take off the Garmin- hell, don’t even wear a watch. Just go. Fuck Daily Mile. Run until you’re tired, then go home. You’ll be amazed at how you feel when you get done.</p>
<p>Where do you get your barefoot/minimalist running info from? Blogs? Friends? Books?Let me know.</p>
