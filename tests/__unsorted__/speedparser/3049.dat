  <title>Scars that will never heal</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/25823.html</link>
  <description>This post is a pure personal rant, just a wave of my emotions, because at the moment I&amp;#39;m crying so much I can&amp;#39;t really stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of you know of my family issues: my mum getting pissed at my dad for being lazy and&amp;nbsp; watching her all the time, making her do all the hard job and being a cry baby, he has always seemed like some kind over-grown baby to me. Choleric, lazy, but at the bottom of his heart a very nice, kind and loving man, who just can&amp;#39;t really understand other people&amp;#39;s emotions very well. She left him 20 months ago to be with another man, who&amp;#39;s kinda an exact opposite of my dad: always happy, phlegmatic, working hard, making jokes, not being overly much aggressive. He&amp;#39;s really tolerant too.&lt;br /&gt;My dad has never really gotten over it, he still needs someone to take care of him, to help him do all the regular everyday stuff, even though he doesn&amp;#39;t really need that help. He just got really used to it and now he misses it, when no one is around to do all those things for him.&lt;br /&gt;I left our family house approximately a year ago, to get myself up again, to help my depressions and to be on a neutral place, without neither of my parents near by. I thought it would be only temporary, for few months before my dad would start dealing with his problems, facing his fears and trying to undo any harm that he had caused to my mother. But he didn&amp;#39;t. So I got stuck here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, every night I want to return. I would do it, but I know that my depressions would certainly strike back because of my father&amp;#39;s mental break downs. And I might not survive that. I still got scars on my hands since the last time I was having one of those suicidal attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, my parents and I, went to see the Nabucco opera. Everything went pretty well, except it was really cold and my dad sat on his chair all crouched. My mother and I thought that he&amp;#39;s angry at us for some reason (he does that), so we let him be.&lt;br /&gt;When the opera ended and my dad was supposed to drive us home, he had one of his &amp;#39;angry attacks&amp;#39; for getting lost. He swore a lot and drove really fast, i was scared. He has always done that, but he has never crashed his car nor harm any one. So my mum told him to calm the fuck down, because he was over reacting and he destroyed the nice atmosphere of the evening.&lt;br /&gt;When we finally got to Prague and my mum left, dad got all angry about what she had told him earlier. I told that her reaction was okay, which was followed by his talking back. We got silence for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here comes the reason why I&amp;#39;m actually writing this: I still love my dad. He has done lot of crazy stuff, he has treat me like shit, and god knows what else. But I still love him, because he&amp;#39;s not really bad. It&amp;#39;s just his temper and traumas from his childhood. I would never let him stay all alone in the house if I really didn&amp;#39;t have to. I would even care about him more, if he wasn&amp;#39;t so full of complexes. I would spend much more time together with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, while driving me to my place, he said that his back is really sore, because he&amp;#39;s got some kind of bad bacterial skin illness. I replied, that he should use the ointment he had gotten from the doctor. He went silent for a while, started sobbing... and with a voice full of shame and sadness, he told me that he can&amp;#39;t really reach that place on his back, so he can&amp;#39;t really use the ointment and so it can never really get okay. He started crying, so did I. I feel so sorry for him, being all alone in the house, he&amp;#39;s got only a few friends and I can understand that he&amp;#39;s sometimes so stupidly angry at something only because he&amp;#39;s too stressed out. I feel so sorry for not helping him more, he isn&amp;#39;t youngest, (my dad&amp;#39;s almost 60). And I know that one day I will regret that I didn&amp;#39;t spend more time with him, because he&amp;#39;s a good dad. And he loves me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, he called me, to tell me that mum was really angry at him for being angry at us at the opera (which was not true) and she only just reproached all the time and doesn&amp;#39;t say anything nice to him in general. I can understand mum as well, she used to take care of him for 20 years, suffering through all of his mood changes... But I still can&amp;#39;t stop crying, because&amp;nbsp; I have a very strong bond with both of my parents and it is just so &lt;b&gt;horrible&lt;/b&gt; to see them sad, depressed and crying. It feels so horrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to go through this. I wish all of this never happened. I wish all these problems would sort out.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Oh hey guys. Long time no see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve got several reasons for that: I was moving again, my school pretty much killed the whole Juny, I was internet-less the July and then I was just lazy to write anything. Isn&apos;t that wonderful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Here, have a look what my room now looks like (even though you don&apos;t really care, I guess. XD But hey, this is my room, IDGAF xD)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Click to open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pics.livejournal.com/i_eat_choco/pic/00002pq4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;700&quot; width=&quot;119&quot; src=&quot;http://i777.photobucket.com/albums/yy57/Armirris/Room_Meme__Blank_by_XToxicityX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Expect more entries soon, I&apos;ve got a lot to tell you, guys.

  <title>New times</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/23995.html</link>
  <description>I felt like writing a journal, so here you go, guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those, who hasn&apos;t really seen me online for a long time, that means all of you, I guess: Don&apos;t worry about me. I AM going through pretty hard times, my parents&apos; conflict might be gone, but &apos;the sea is still rough after a storm&apos;. It will take some time before I eventually get over it. It still hurts, especially when I have nothing to do, or when I have time to think about it. So I keep myself busy. The life keeps me busy. My school keeps me uber busy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School sucks a lot recently. Most teachers just act terrible, I have been yelled at many, many times. &lt;br /&gt;I thought many things would be easier to reach, to achieve after all this. Many plans of mine failed. It&apos;s hard to get up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is keeping me awake, or alive, is music. My friends actually laugh at me, I used to be a hard-core metal-head and goth, long hair, black clothes, taste for gore stuff, mostly listening to metal and rock. &lt;br /&gt;But now? My hair is short, I&apos;ve got different glasses, I&apos;m not afraid to wear other colour than black and I listen mainly to electronic music. Hardcore techno, hardstyle, dubstep, breakcore... I wish I had more money so I could go clubbing more often, it fills me with energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve changed so much. I&apos;ve always been very conservative, stuck at one thing, unable to change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But change is good. It&apos;s so good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life is changing. I might fail at school, but I am much more self-confident, much more sure about who I really am. It&apos;s not easy to deal with some crazy shit. But no one&apos;s gonna take me alive.</description>

  <title>Just a short recapitulation of recent stuff</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/22929.html</link>
  <description>I&apos;m terribly sorry for disappearing like that, but since my term classification was postponed, I have to finish all my exams till the end of February. I&apos;ve already successfully passed my Math and Biology exams. Well, four more to go - Czech, History, Psychology and Physics. Uh. &amp;gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&apos;m still sick - having fever almost every day. I can&apos;t even properly describe how shitty I feel. But hey, my depressions got a lot better and overall I feel mentally better. :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, for something completely different - a funny fact of the day: A week ago, I bought this awesome long black and white scarf. I wear it almost every day, together with my leather converse shoes, baggy trousers and my &amp;quot;I will kill you so hard you&apos;ll die to death!&amp;quot; t-shirt on top of another, black and white t-shirt. &lt;br /&gt;And just few days back I realized that I look exactly like &lt;a href=&quot;http://i-eat-taco.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;Rai-che&lt;/a&gt; had when I had met her for the first time. XD It made me giggle a lot, but I also felt kinda stupid and awkward. Is the age of 17 some kind of black-and-white striped time? Uuuh, neve rmind, I guess I just wear whatever I find cool, haha.... But still. &amp;gt;:l &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s 2:00AM. I should go to bed, but I&apos;m not tired at all. Maybe I should study for &lt;strike&gt;tomorrow&apos;s&lt;/strike&gt; today&apos;s exam? Naaaah, I guess I&apos;ll just continue surfing the awesome waves of internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;ungh, now I feel somewhat nostalgic, listening to my old mp3 player and going through some old stories I wrote few years back.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Reached into it for keys today and cut my hand badly. Oops. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Tarakau/status/36211126228226048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sat, 00:52&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Tomorrow, I&apos;ll go and try painting outside with my aquarels. I hope the weather will be fine. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description>

  <title>WHAT S THIS</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/20988.html</link>
  <description>I&apos;m so fuc*ing bipolar. My awful gloomy suicidal moods alternate with hyperactive way-too-funny ones. WHAT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;THIS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, anyways. I&apos;m off to Hungary with my friend, I&apos;ll be returning tomorrow. :3 Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to take some photos, so prepare yourself for a photo boom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your weekend, my friends!</description>

  <description>Ever felt like committing suicide? But seriously, have you ever been thinking about what would be the least painful and the fastest way to go. Thinking about what would your relatives and friends do, even writing down some final words in form of a letter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&apos;t wanna sound like teenage drama queen. When I was younger, I though way too often about suicide, but hey, I was too stupid and weak and not courageous enough to even &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; about it more seriously. Not like nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is horrible. I feel like the most pathetic excuse for a human being, not able to do anything right. I&apos;m not unique in any way, I can&apos;t draw properly, I can&apos;t sing properly, I can&apos;t play any instrument properly, my writings suck, I failed almost all the exams at school, thanks to my stupid health problems I can&apos;t even sleep with my dearest one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m sick of it, I&apos;m sick of myself, I&apos;m sick of being average, I&apos;m sick of my health, I&apos;m sick of trying harder. I&apos;m sick of my lies, I&apos;m sick of hearing &apos;calm down&apos; by everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m sick of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m sorry if I make you feel bad and sad, I love you all. I just don&apos;t know how much longer I can take this. I&apos;m trying, alright. I&apos;m trying. But, probably, not enough.</description>

  <title>Winter Conspiracy vol. 4</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/20412.html</link>
  <description>...was just awesome. Seriously. Haha, I was the only one wearing rave clothing, people were taking photos with/of me and almost every one gave me thumbs up. XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; src=&quot;http://media1.mikrotek.jex.cz/images/media1:4d122a77dc603.jpg/Winter conspiracy vol.4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;But seriously, I felt like on ecstasy, but that&apos;s probably because there was so much THC in the air. XD&amp;nbsp; I also drank few beers (one of my class mates was there with me, he was all like O_O when he saw me partying hard and drinking, because, somehow, my classmates think that I&apos;m shy, calm-music-loving person who hates techno XD )&lt;br /&gt;My legs still hurt from the jumping, I&apos;ve finally improved in jumpstyle a bit and we danced together with my mum and the said class-mate. :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&apos;t hear properly, haha, the music was so loud, but, oh-so-awesome. I must party more often, I feel amazing. :3&lt;br /&gt;This is just a preview of the whole show:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ljembed&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is how I looked like: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://i777.photobucket.com/albums/yy57/Armirris/P1213114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is me when I finally came home and fell asleep immediately. Wiki the cat was probably partying too, just look at her. XD (btw, I&apos;m gonna kill my boyfriend for taking photos of me while I&apos;m asleep.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://i777.photobucket.com/albums/yy57/Armirris/P1223117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>OMG shoes!</title>
  <link>http://i-eat-choco.livejournal.com/19950.html</link>
  <description>Hi, living people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m currently kind of internet-less, because our awesome UPC net just crashed and it refuses to start working again. That&apos;s when I discovered that&amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve been horribly addicted to being online. Seriously, my day starts with checking my email and dA. So I&apos;m on a rehab now, haha, at least till Friday, when some IT expert &amp;lt;/sarcasm&amp;gt; will try to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went shopping few days ago, I was supposed to by new pants, but instead, I bought new shoes. 8D They are like my new babies now, I hug them all the time, haha, I&apos;m such an idiot. I&apos;m not going to tell you my secret about these shoes, it&apos;s...well... secret. But they fit me and they are actually Bugatti&apos;s. Haha, whenever I wear them I feel like driving Veyron, maybe because they&apos;re so comfortableeee~.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m sorry but I don&apos;t have a better photo than this. Please, ignore me in the pic and concentrate on the shoes. XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, sorry for not responding to your messages (thank you, jira, for a really nice message &amp;lt;3), I&amp;nbsp;will respond as soon as I have my internet back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till then, see you, guys!&amp;nbsp;:3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i777.photobucket.com/albums/yy57/Armirris/P1153102.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 353px; height: 663px;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
