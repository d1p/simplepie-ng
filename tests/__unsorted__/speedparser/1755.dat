<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Week 10 of the season and we have a classic division game set for MNF. Donovan McNabb gets set to face his old team just hours after inking a <a href="http://www.thescore.com/home/articles/84290-fit-enough-for-an-extension" target="_blank"><strong>MASSIVE</strong></a> contract extention with the Redskins. Enough storylines there? McNabb came out the winner in the first meeting between the two teams but has struggled as of late. Vick on the other hand missed games due to being injured. The injury came vs. these Redskins and he is looking to get back on track. This game has all the makings of a memorable MNF game&#8230; let&#8217;s just hope it lives up the the billing.</p>
<p>The Eagles are one of the surprise stories in the NFL this season. No one knew what to expect from this team yet Vick has the fans and the city believing in a deep post season run.  LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson are just two of the bright spots on this team that for all intensive purposes is overachieving. Vick once written off by most is saying all the right things and has his coach believing that he is the right guy to take this team to the next level. On the defensive side of things, expect the Eagles to pressure McNabb early and often. That O-Line has holes and Philly will look to get through them.</p>
<p>McNabb has had quite the eventful week. He was benched for the overtime period last week and now inked a contract extension. The Redskins run game has suffered with Portis out. McNabb has to hope his O Line protects him tonight or he is going to be doing a lot of scrambling. Those legs are not what they used to be. He has some long threats on the field but has yet to show he can make the right passes consistently in the Shanahan offensive system.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> The Eagles are favored -3 on the road. I expect that line to move maybe closer to game time. I am an Eagles fan to the core so I am not going to roll out a prediction on the winner. But, if the Skins win it will be thanks to a great performance from McNabb who has several reasons to be fired up for this one. Oh and I like the Under (going with my gut)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Both teams entered this season as major contenders and heavy favorites to reach the Super Bowl. Mid-way through the season, it&#8217;s not looking so good anymore. While the Packers still own the top spot in the NFC North, they have been dealing with a bevy of injuries. The Cowboys who will be hosting the big game, came apart early and never managed to right the ship. Sitting at the bottom of the NFC East at 1-6, the only thing Dallas fans are looking forward to is a new coach.</p>
<p>The Cowboys haven&#8217;t lost 5 in a row since 1997. They are going to avoid matching that record today with John Kitna at QB. After Romo went down last week, he played fairly well all things considered. Wade Phillips, who miraculously still has a job, went back to the basics in practice this week. Rather than focusing on a game plan, he put his team through rigorous drills. Offensively this team has a lot of weapons but lack a coach who can call the right plays. On the defensive side of the ball, which is supposed to be the head coach&#8217;s specialty, they have struggled &#8212; Giving up 33+ points over the 4 game losing streak. This week things don&#8217;t get easier, the Packers posted the first shut out of the NFL season last week and if Kitna can&#8217;t get the ball moving down field, it will be another long night at the office.</p>
<p>The Packers are still very much in the post season discussions. They have lost some key players but other guys have stepped up to keep them atop the division. They will miss Donald Driver this week but it is just another chance for someone else to step up to fill the holes. Rodgers was an early MVP candidate but now his 9 INT&#8217;s look pretty ugly. He will see the blitz early and often today and needs to avoid racking up the negative yardage. Packers have struggled offensively at times, but it&#8217;s their defense that gives them a chance to win each game. Posting a shut out last week, the Packers are 3rd best in the NFL when it comes to sacks and interceptions. That should get better tonight playing against a tentative John Kitna. </p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Green Bay has a favorable line in this one seeing that Romo is out (-7). I got the Packers to win it and they should cover as well. As for the Over/Under, I am going with my gut feeling and the Under 46.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The Texans had a lot going for themselves in week 1 as they stunned the Colts. Being picked by the Experts as the surprise team in the NFL and riding the tails of RB Arian Foster can only take you so far though. Things have balanced out since then. Both teams are coming off Bye weeks and share the same record of 4-2. With this being a divisional game, it comes with long term implications for the season.  I expect tonight to be a shootout and the first team to show signs of defense comes out with the win.</p>
<p>A win tonight would be the first for Houston in Indianapolis. While they are a good team, a lot would have to go right for that to be the outcome. It should be noted though that they have yet to lose a game on the road. The Texans need to go with a heavy dose of the ground game. The Colts have yet to show they can stop it and Foster was an absolute beast in the first meeting. Defensively, the Texans bring nothing to the field. They rank at the bottom of the league and will have to step up to avoid getting shred to pieces by Manning and Co.</p>
<p>The Colts come into this one banged up. They lost TE Dallas Clark for the season and Austin Collie is going to miss time with an injured thumb. Joseph Addai (shoulder) is also hurting and will probably miss tonight&#8217;s game. What all this means for Indianapolis is they will need some of their young players to step up. Manning makes things easier for his receivers as long as they run the routes. Look for Reggie Wayne to put up big numbers to make up for the loss of some of the guys.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: The Colts have just gotten better since the last meeting and the home field will help. I got the Colts to win it in a high scoring affair. Take the Over (o/u 51)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Monday Night Football. A classic division rivalry. One team is nowhere near where they want to be and the other sits where most didn&#8217;t expect them to be. Can you ask for more?</p>
<p>The Giants find themselves atop the NFC East standings. A win tonight will solidify that even further. Offensively the team has really found its stride over the last few weeks. Eli Manning has found his receivers when needed but the run game is still the weapon of choice. One obstacle tonight &#8212; DeMarcus Ware. The O-Line is going to need to bring their A game or Manning will find himself on his back early and often. The Giants D has been somewhat of a surprise to me. They have played well as a unit. Dallas has a lot of weapons, it is to be seen if New York D is up to the challenge.</p>
<p>The Cowboys came in with all the hype but that deflated in a hurry. Sitting at the bottom of the NFC East at 1-4, this is a do or die game for them. It baffles me that Wade Phillips still has a job in the NFL. Offense hasn&#8217;t been a problem for America&#8217;s Team. They rank 3rd in the NFL in the category even with the horrendous play calling at times. The D is not where it has been in past years and the special teams unit has really let them down over the first 5 games. Another issue &#8212; discipline. In order to get the win today, Dallas needs to minimize the penalties. If the Cowboys execute a game plan while limiting the mental mistakes, they should come out with the win tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Was off the mark with my picks last night but am going to stick with similar logistics. This game may determine the Cowboys&#8217; season so I have them to win it (-3.5). Also, after seeing what the Giants did to Cutler a couple of weeks back&#8230; I am thinking take the under tonight.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>A division rivalry with tons of storylines. Perfect for a Sunday Night face off in front of a national audience.</p>
<p>The Vikings stumbled out the gates to start the season. They sit at 2-3 and no one is talking about the product on the field. Favre has been in the news for all the wrong reasons and has yet to develop chemistry with his receivers. Randy Moss&#8217; arrival has been underwhelming but there is still time to right the ship. In his first time back at Lambeau, Favre came out on top but I expect to hear louder boo&#8217;s tonight. The main thing is protect the ball. Hampered by a sore elbow, Favre has thrown 7 INT&#8217;s this season already matching last years total. When he isn&#8217;t throwing INT&#8217;s, Farve is always a prime candidate for the Sack. The Vikings need to use moss as a threat down field and balance it with the running game of Peterson.</p>
<p>The Packers have their own issues to worry about. Hit hard by the injury bug, this team has to make adjustments on the fly. Once Super bowl favorites, the Packers come into this one trying to avoid losing 3 in a row. Hoping to have some of their injured players return, the Packers will be led by QB Aaron Rodgers. Missing RB Grant and TE Finley has proven to be difficult for the Packers offense. With just 3 touchdowns over the last 2 games, Green Bay needs to find some other guys ready to produce. The defense has looked ok and should be able to pressure Favre all night. Expect atleast 1 INT and a score by the D will go a long way tonight. </p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Favre returning to Green Bay is always emotional. I am going against the grain tonight. Got the Vikings +3 and taking the UNDER (o/u 44)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The Colts have one of the best offenses in the NFL and head to Washington to face the worst defense in the league. This should be interesting. </p>
<p>The Giants and Eagles both won today so the Redskins are going to have to bring their &#8220;A&#8221; game to keep up in the NFC East. They will go without Portis for the second week in a row but this team goes as their defense does. In both their losses they gave up 30+ points and will be in tough against the high powered Colts offense. The defense will be missing Haynesworth for the 2nd game, even though he has not been much of a factor all season, opponents usually account for him when he is active. McNabb and his athleticism will be needed to assist Torain with the ground game. Also, the Redskins haven&#8217;t had too many big plays this season so they should be due.</p>
<p>The Colts are still one of the teams to beat in the NFL. Even with Joseph Addai hobbling, they have Reggie Wayne playing like he is 25. Manning is tied for the league lead in TD passes and has already crossed 1500+ yards throwing on the season. On the defensive end, the Colts need to bring pressure on McNabb all night. With not much of a running game, McNabb will look to throw, even the short screens so early pressure should go a long way to throwing him off his game.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Off the bat, I take the over in this one (44o/u). As for the winner, I got the Colts to win it by double digits.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randy Moss gets traded to Minnesota&#8230; Allegations arise about Brett Favre involved in some inappropriate conduct with a female personality when he was with the Jets&#8230; McNabb has a storybook homecoming in Piladelphia. Yes, we are only done week 4 in the NFL. Here are some of the other stories of note.</p>
<div class="slidedeck_frame skin-default"><dl id="SlideDeck_784_1043" class="slidedeck slidedeck_1043" style="width:100%;height:480px"><dt>Jay Cutler – Man down!</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1059" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/cutlersack/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1059" title="cutlersack" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cutlersack-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="165" /></a>He may not be leading the league in interceptions this season but last week Cutler displayed a complete inability to stay composed in the pocket. Sure some blame goes on the O Line - no QB should spend more time on his back than his feet. Snap after snap, Cutler was unable to get rid of the ball quickly (probably worried about throwing a pick) and payed for it heavily. 9 sacks did him in as he left the game with a concussion and will not play in week 5. The Bears need to work on getting his confidence back, but first he needs to get his head in the game.</p>
</dd><dt>Josh Scobee – Crazy Legs</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1060" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/houston-texans-v-jacksonville-jaguars/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1060" title="Jacksonville Jaguars" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/scobeekick-300x271.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="251" /></a>There seems to be a revolving door in the NFL when it comes to kickers. Josh Scobee just guaranteed himself employment with a 59 yard game winning field goal against the Indianapolis Colts. That was some mad leg extension!</p>
</dd><dt>Arian Foster Only Needs 3 Quarters</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1061" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/fostertd/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1061" title="fostertd" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fostertd-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="205" /></a>Arian Foster was held out of the 1st quarter last Sunday -- Fantasy owners world wide went into panic mode. The reason given was disciplinary issues. It didn't matter though, all he needed was the final 45min to do all the damage. Things are looking bright for this undrafted running back who is bpoised to break a lot of records this season. The Texans have found a gem, let's hope they keep letting him shine.</p>
</dd><dt>Philadelphia Eagles – CRUSHED!</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1062" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/michael-vick-2/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1062" title="Michael Vick" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vickribs-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="169" /></a>Vick gets sandwiched between two Redskins players and Eagles fans are crushed. Literally! Just as he was hitting his stride, Vick was dealt a blow early in the game. Earlier this week, it was revealed that the QB has a crack in his rib cartilage. So aside from losing to the McNabb led Skins, the Eagles will have to go on without Vick for a couple of weeks. Let the Kevin Kolb era begin -- AGAIN!</p>
</dd><dt>Kansas City Chiefs – Last Team Standing</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1063" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/kcchiefs/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1063" title="kcchiefs" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/kcchiefs-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="190" /></a>The Chiefs are the only unbeaten team in the NFL. Yes, they were on a bye in week 4 but I just really wanted to type that. Doubt I will get to do so again this season. This is not to take away from the ball they are playing. The Chiefs are surprising most of us but they have yet to play some real competition.</p>
</dd><dt>Miami Dolphins Ditch The Wildcat</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1064" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/wildcat/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1064" title="wildcat" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wildcat-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="215" /></a>A lot has been said/written about the wildcat. It seemed to be working for the most part but there are just some teams that are well equipped to defend it. Last week, The Patriots dared them and the Dolphins surrendered, essentially giving up on the tried and tested play call. Sporano used it a handful of times in the beat down they took from New England on MNF. I think they need to give the wildcat another shot, their best weapons are under-utilized without it.</p>
</dd><dt>LT – Don&#039;t Call It A Comeback</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1065" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/ltjets/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1065" title="LTJets" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/LTJets-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="195" /></a>He may not have the legs he did in his record breaking season but LT is on a mission to prove he still got it. This week he passed he 100yrd rushing mark for the first time in 2 seasons. His 2 TD's were a big art of the rout the Jets layed on the Bills. I have always been a fan and am rooting hard for him to succeed. If he can put together a string of these games, the Jets automatically becomes my favorites in the division.</p>
</dd><dt>Who wants the AFC East?</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1066" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/brady100/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1066" title="brady100" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/brady100-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="186" /></a>The Dolphins had a chance to step up on Monday but couldn't. The Jets look great 1 week and horrible the next. Brady is looking like his old self but playing with a young defense. I think by week 6, the Patriots will separate themselves from the pack and become the team to beat.</p>
</dd><dt>NFL – Doing it right for the cause</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1067" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/breastcancer/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1067" title="breastcancer" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/breastcancer-300x208.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="188" /></a>For the month of October, the NFL has once again come together for breast cancer awareness. The NFL and its players have been really successful with this campaign. From pre-game festivities to athlete gear on the field. They raise money selling merchandise and auctioning game worn gear. The MLB and NFL definitely do it big for the cause.</p>
</dd><dt>Parity</dt><dd><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1068" href="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/slidedeck/tma-week4/gatessd/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1068" title="gatesSD" src="http://heelsinthehuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gatesSD.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="320" /></a>4 weeks and we have seen a ton of low scoring games but more importantly they have been close. Really makes you appreciate the parity a hard cap has created. If you are a betting man/woman, its a different story. Tough calls this season but a lot of games going on the UNDER.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></p>
<p><strong>PREVIEW</strong></span></p>
<p>With all the parity going on in the NFL this season, the Bears are trying to prove they are contenders. They come into this one as the only unbeaten NFC team. Their 3-0 record is more surprising than the lackluster way the Giants have played to start the season. Who wants it more tonight?</p>
<p>Jay Cutler is still trying to settle down. Every pass feels like an interception waiting to happen yet as a unit the Bears are getting it done. Chicago is at this point thanks to its defense. They have been great on rush D, forced timely turnovers and kept the team in the game each week. The special teams unit has done its part as well, head by Hester who is always a threat to return for a TD. The defense has carried the load and the offense has done just enough to lock down the wins.</p>
<p>Eli Manning has a ways to go if he ever wants to be spoken of like his brother. He seems to have taken a page from Cutler and is tied for interceptions this season with Favre. The run game was supposed to be the main threat for the Giants but that has yet to be seen. The defense has been a bright spot but keep getting caught in tough spots with all the turnovers on offense. They have to clean that up along with all the penalties in order to make this a game.</p>
<p>For some strange reason the Giants are the favorites tonight but I am not buying what Vegas is selling. </p>
<p><strong>My Prediction: Chicago Bears 24 &#8211; New York Giants 20</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was 10 years ago that I fell in love with this game. The Philadelphia Eagles were the object of my affection and at the helm was a young QB Donovan McNabb, wowing me with his ability to make something out of nothing.</p>
<p>1999 &#8211; Draft day. Notoriously known for their love/hate relationship with star athletes, Eagles fans were none too happy with the team selecting the QB from Syracuse. The ribbing he took from on draft day was just the beginning. Even after leading the team to four consecutive NFC East division championships, five NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl, McNabb was still trying to win over the city.</p>
<p>Today McNabb returns to Philadelphia wearing a Washington Redskins jersey. He never asked to leave and gave everything that he had to the city. There are campaigns going around on how to react to his return. There is the standing &#8220;O&#8221; group and the boo bird group. The indifferent group is looking for members. That&#8217;s the thing with sports, you only show emotions for those who mattered most. If McNabb hears silence &#8212; then maybe he should be offended.</p>
<p>Will he be booed once again? Probably. Philadelphia fans have a reputation to protect after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">McNabb: Highlight Package</span></strong><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PREVIEW</strong></span></p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are 2-0 yet no one is talking about them. That should change if they get the win today and retain top spot in the AFC East. The Jets did make some strides last week but have a ways to go before matching the hype.</p>
<p>Sanchez was finally let loose last week and he had a career day against the Patriots. He seems to have built a good chemistry with Keller and will have to rely more on that today. Why? Because Braylon Edwards got busted for a DUI and will not be starting for the Jets. The bread and butter still has to be the power running game. The Dolphins have been exploited by the ground game and that needs to be the point of attack. Tomlinson is proving his doubters wrong and has re-established himself as a force, but the Jets need Shonn Greene to keep doing what he did last week. On the other side of the ball, the defense needs to be prepared for a Miami&#8217;s wildcat plays. They use Ronnie Brown effectively at that spot. Aside from the rush defense, missing Revis is going to hurt. Cromartie has some big shoes to fill in order to keep Marshall at bay.</p>
<p>It may be early in the season but the Dolphins need to be respected. Both their wins came on the road including last week against a good Vikings team. They upgraded their offensive core this summer, adding Brandon Marshall but that has yet to pay off. The team still relies heavily on the ground game and has found success going with the wildcat. While the offense is coming along slowly, it is their defense that has carried them through the first 2 weeks. Forcing turnovers and limiting opponents has been the story all without Jason Taylor who now plays for the Jets. Taylor faces his former team for the first time and hopes they don&#8217;t get the last laugh.</p>
<p>While the Dolphins are looking good and the Jets look a little scattered, this is a statement game. I am calling the Jets to pull it together and get one on the road.</p>
<p><strong>My Prediction: New York Jets 20 &#8211; Miami Dolphins 17</strong></p>
