        <p>Abstract<br/>
        A previous genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis of 12,386 PD cases and 21,026 controls conducted by the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC) discovered or confirmed 11 Parkinson's disease (PD) loci. This first analysis of the two-stage IPDGC study focused on the set of loci that passed genome-wide significance in the first stage GWA scan. However, the second stage genotyping array, the ImmunoChip, included a larger set of 1,920 SNPs selected on the basis of the GWA analysis. Here, we analyzed this set of 1,920 SNPs, and we identified five additional PD risk loci (combined p&lt;5×10(-10), PARK16/1q32, STX1B/16p11, FGF20/8p22, STBD1/4q21, and GPNMB/7p15). Two of these five loci have been suggested by previous association studies (PARK16/1q32, FGF20/8p22), and this study provides further support for these findings. Using a dataset of post-mortem brain samples assayed for gene expression (n = 399) and methylation (n = 292), we identified methylation and expression changes associated with PD risk variants in PARK16/1q32, GPNMB/7p15, and STX1B/16p11 loci, hence suggesting potential molecular mechanisms and candidate genes at these risk loci.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Exome sequencing is rapidly becoming a fundamental tool for genetics and functional genomics laboratories. This methodology has enabled the discovery of novel pathogenic mutations causing mendelian diseases that had, until now, remained elusive. In this review, we discuss not only how we envisage exome sequencing being applied to a complex disease, such as Parkinson's disease, but also what are the known caveats of this approach.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for Parkinson's disease have linked two loci (MAPT and SNCA) to risk of Parkinson's disease. We aimed to identify novel risk loci for Parkinson's disease.<br/>
        METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of datasets from five Parkinson's disease GWAS from the USA and Europe to identify loci associated with Parkinson's disease (discovery phase). We then did replication analyses of significantly associated loci in an independent sample series. Estimates of population-attributable risk were calculated from estimates from the discovery and replication phases combined, and risk-profile estimates for loci identified in the discovery phase were calculated.<br/>
        FINDINGS: The discovery phase consisted of 5333 case and 12 019 control samples, with genotyped and imputed data at 7 689 524 SNPs. The replication phase consisted of 7053 case and 9007 control samples. We identified 11 loci that surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (p&lt;5×10(-8)). Six were previously identified loci (MAPT, SNCA, HLA-DRB5, BST1, GAK and LRRK2) and five were newly identified loci (ACMSD, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, SYT11, and CCDC62/HIP1R). The combined population-attributable risk was 60·3% (95% CI 43·7-69·3). In the risk-profile analysis, the odds ratio in the highest quintile of disease risk was 2·51 (95% CI 2·23-2·83) compared with 1·00 in the lowest quintile of disease risk.<br/>
        INTERPRETATION: These data provide an insight into the genetics of Parkinson's disease and the molecular cause of the disease and could provide future targets for therapies.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Spinocerebellar ataxia type 15 and 16 (SCA15/16) are autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias that are slowly progressive with a predominantly pure ataxia phenotype (ADCA III). The locus for SCA15 was first mapped to 3p24.2-3pter and subsequently full or partial deletions in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) gene were identified in several ADCA III families that segregated with the disease. A single missense coding variant has been described, but the pathogenicity of this change has not been proven. We sequenced the entire coding region and flanking regions of ITPR1 in unrelated ADCA III families (n = 38) that were negative for large deletions on whole genome arrays, and for which SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17 and the Friedreich's ataxia expansion were excluded in all probands. Mutation at SCA5, 10, and 27 was also excluded in some families. A number of coding and noncoding polymorphisms were identified but no ITPR1 mutations were found. The results indicate that point mutations in ITPR1 are at best a rare cause of ADCA III.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,713 individuals of European ancestry with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 3,978 controls. After replication in 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, we observed two strong association signals, one in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein (SNCA; rs2736990, OR = 1.23, P = 2.24 x 10(-16)) and another at the MAPT locus (rs393152, OR = 0.77, P = 1.95 x 10(-16)). We exchanged data with colleagues performing a GWAS in Japanese PD cases. Association to PD at SNCA was replicated in the Japanese GWAS, confirming this as a major risk locus across populations. We replicated the effect of a new locus detected in the Japanese cohort (PARK16, rs823128, OR = 0.66, P = 7.29 x 10(-8)) and provide supporting evidence that common variation around LRRK2 modulates risk for PD (rs1491923, OR = 1.14, P = 1.55 x 10(-5)). These data demonstrate an unequivocal role for common genetic variants in the etiology of typical PD and suggest population-specific genetic heterogeneity in this disease.<br/>

        To test whether the synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA) share a common genetic etiology, we performed a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study of the 384 most associated SNPs in a genome-wide association study of Parkinson's disease in 413 MSA cases and 3,974 control subjects. The 10 most significant SNPs were then replicated in additional 108 MSA cases and 537 controls.

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) are associated with Gaucher's disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder. Parkinsonism is an established feature of Gaucher's disease and an increased frequency of mutations in GBA has been reported in several different ethnic series with sporadic Parkinson's disease. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of GBA mutations in British patients affected by Parkinson's disease. We utilized the DNA of 790 patients and 257 controls, matched for age and ethnicity, to screen for mutations within the GBA gene. Clinical data on all identified GBA mutation carriers was reviewed and analysed. Additionally, in all cases where brain material was available, a neuropathological evaluation was performed and compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease without GBA mutations. The frequency of GBA mutations among the British patients (33/790 = 4.18%) was significantly higher (P = 0.01; odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-12.14) when compared to the control group (3/257 = 1.17%). Fourteen different GBA mutations were identified, including three previously undescribed mutations, K7E, D443N and G193E. Pathological examination revealed widespread and abundant alpha-synuclein pathology in all 17 GBA mutation carriers, which were graded as Braak stage of 5-6, and had McKeith's limbic or diffuse neocortical Lewy body-type pathology. Diffuse neocortical Lewy body-type pathology tended to occur more frequently in the group with GBA mutations compared to matched Parkinson's disease controls. Clinical features comprised an early onset of the disease, the presence of hallucinations in 45% (14/31) and symptoms of cognitive decline or dementia in 48% (15/31) of patients. This study demonstrates that GBA mutations are found in British subjects at a higher frequency than any other known Parkinson's disease gene. This is the largest study to date on a non-Jewish patient sample with a detailed genotype/phenotype/pathological analyses which strengthens the hypothesis that GBA mutations represent a significant risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease and suggest that to date, this is the most common genetic factor identified for the disease.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        This research investigates the influence of demographic factors on human genetic sub-structure. In our discovery cohort, we show significant demographic trends for decreasing autozygosity associated with population variation in chronological age. Autozygosity, the genomic signature of consanguinity, is identifiable on a genome-wide level as extended tracts of homozygosity. We identified an average of 28.6 tracts of extended homozygosity greater than 1 Mb in length in a representative population of 809 unrelated North Americans of European descent ranging in chronological age from 19-99 years old. These homozygous tracts made up a population average of 42 Mb of the genome corresponding to 1.6% of the entire genome, with each homozygous tract an average of 1.5 Mb in length. Runs of homozygosity are steadily decreasing in size and frequency as time progresses (linear regression, p&lt;0.05). We also calculated inbreeding coefficients and showed a significant trend for population-wide increasing heterozygosity outside of linkage disequilibrium. We successfully replicated these associations in a demographically similar cohort comprised of a subgroup of 477 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants. We also constructed statistical models showing predicted declining rates of autozygosity spanning the 20th century. These predictive models suggest a 14.0% decrease in the frequency of these runs of homozygosity and a 24.3% decrease in the percent of the genome in runs of homozygosity, as well as a 30.5% decrease in excess homozygosity based on the linkage pruned inbreeding coefficients. The trend for decreasing autozygosity due to panmixia and larger effective population sizes will likely affect the frequency of rare recessive genetic diseases in the future. Autozygosity has declined, and it seems it will continue doing so.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        It is hoped that an understanding of the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease (PD) will lead to an appreciation of the molecular pathogenesis of disease, which in turn will highlight potential points of therapeutic intervention. It is also hoped that such an understanding will allow identification of individuals at risk for disease prior to the onset of motor symptoms. A large amount of work has already been performed in the identification of genetic risk factors for PD and some of this work, particularly those efforts that focus on genes implicated in monogenic forms of PD, have been successful, although hard won. A new era of gene discovery has begun, with the application of genome wide association studies; these promise to facilitate the identification of common genetic risk loci for complex genetic diseases. This is the first of several high throughput technologies that promise to shed light on the (likely) myriad genetic factors involved in this complex, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder.<br/>

        <p><b>Emerging pathways in genetic Parkinson's disease: Potential role of ceramide metabolism in Lewy body disease.</b></p>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations at the glucosecerebrosidase locus have recently been shown to be a potent risk factor for Lewy body disease. Based on this observation, we have re-evaluated the likelihood that the different PARK loci (defined using clinical criteria for disease) may be misleading attempts to find common pathways to pathogenesis. Rather, we suggest, grouping the different loci which lead to different Lewy body disease may be more revealing. Doing this, we suggest that several of the genes involved in disparate Lewy body diseases impinge on ceramide metabolism and we suggest that this may be a common theme for pathogenesis.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Several genetic variations have been associated with Parkinson disease in different populations over the past few years. Although a considerable number of worldwide populations have been screened for these variants, results from Sub-Saharan populations are very scarce in the literature. In the present report we have screened a cohort of Parkinson disease patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 51) from Nigeria for mutations in the genes PRKN, LRRK2 and ATXN3. No pathogenic mutations were found in any of the genes. Hence, common pathogenic mutations in these genes, observed in several different populations, are not a frequent cause of Parkinson disease in Nigeria.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Mutations in GIGYF2 have recently been described as causative of Parkinson's disease in Europeans. In an attempt to replicate these results in independent populations, we sequenced the entire coding region of GIGYF2 in a large series of Portuguese and North American samples. We report the finding of two of the previously published mutations in neurologically normal Control individuals. This suggests that mutations in GIGYF2 are not strongly related to the development of the disease in either of these populations.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Mutations in three genes (PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP) have been identified in patients with early-onset (&lt;65 years) Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a screening for mutations in the coding regions of presenilins, as well as exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene in a total of 231 patients from the Iberian peninsular with a clinical diagnosis of early-onset AD (mean age at onset of 52.9 years; range 31-64). We found three novel mutations in PSEN1, one novel mutation in PSEN2, and a novel mutation in the APP gene. Four previously described mutations in PSEN1 were also found. The same analysis was carried in 121 elderly healthy controls from the Iberian peninsular, and a set of 130 individuals from seven African populations belonging to the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain-Human Genome Diversity Panel (CEPH-HGDP), in order to determine the extent of normal variability in these genes. Interestingly, in the latter series, we found five new non-synonymous changes in all three genes and a presenilin 2 variant (R62H) that has been previously related to AD. In some of these mutations, the pathologic consequence is uncertain and needs further investigation. To address this question we propose and use a systematic algorithm to classify the putative pathology of AD mutations.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene were recently described as the cause of ubiquitin positive frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in many families. Different frequencies of these genetic changes have been reported in diverse populations leading us to determine if these mutations were a major cause of FTD in the Portuguese population. The entire coding sequence plus exon 0 of PGRN were sequenced in a consecutive series of 46 FTD/CBS Portuguese patients. Two mutations were found: a novel pathogenic insertion (p.Gln300GlnfsX61) and a previously described point variant (p.T182M) of unclear pathogenicity. Pathogenic mutations in the PGRN gene were found in one of the 36 probands studied (3% of the probands in our series) who had a corticobasal syndrome presentation, indicating that in the Portuguese population, mutations in this gene are not a major cause of FTD.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        Genome-wide patterns of variation across individuals provide a powerful source of data for uncovering the history of migration, range expansion, and adaptation of the human species. However, high-resolution surveys of variation in genotype, haplotype and copy number have generally focused on a small number of population groups. Here we report the analysis of high-quality genotypes at 525,910 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 396 copy-number-variable loci in a worldwide sample of 29 populations. Analysis of SNP genotypes yields strongly supported fine-scale inferences about population structure. Increasing linkage disequilibrium is observed with increasing geographic distance from Africa, as expected under a serial founder effect for the out-of-Africa spread of human populations. New approaches for haplotype analysis produce inferences about population structure that complement results based on unphased SNPs. Despite a difference from SNPs in the frequency spectrum of the copy-number variants (CNVs) detected--including a comparatively large number of CNVs in previously unexamined populations from Oceania and the Americas--the global distribution of CNVs largely accords with population structure analyses for SNP data sets of similar size. Our results produce new inferences about inter-population variation, support the utility of CNVs in human population-genetic research, and serve as a genomic resource for human-genetic studies in diverse worldwide populations.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        BACKGROUND: Dystonia and parkinsonism may present as part of the same genetic disorder. Identification of the genetic mutations that underlie these diseases may help to shed light on the aetiological processes involved.<br/>
        METHODS: We identified two unrelated families with members with an apparent autosomal recessive, novel, young-onset, generalised form of dystonia parkinsonism. We did autozygosity mapping and candidate gene sequencing in these families.<br/>
        FINDINGS: High-density genome-wide SNP genotyping revealed a disease-segregating region containing 277 homozygous markers identical by state across all affected members from both families. This novel disease locus, designated DYT16, covers 1.2 Mb at chromosome 2q31.2. The crucial interval contains 11 genes or predicted transcripts. Sequence analysis of every exon of all of these transcripts revealed a single disease-segregating mutation, c.665C&gt;T (P222L), in the stress-response gene PRKRA, which encodes the protein kinase, interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent activator.<br/>
        INTERPRETATION: We describe a mutation within the gene PRKRA that segregates with a novel, autosomal recessive, dystonia parkinsonism syndrome. These patients have progressive, generalised, early-onset dystonia with axial muscle involvement, oromandibular (sardonic smile), laryngeal dystonia and, in some cases, parkinsonian features, and do not respond to levodopa therapy.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        BACKGROUND: Mutations in the genes PRKN and LRRK2 are the most frequent known genetic lesions among Parkinson's disease patients. We have previously reported that in the Portuguese population the LRRK2 c.6055G &gt; A; p.G2019S mutation has one of the highest frequencies in Europe.<br/>
        METHODS: Here, we follow up on those results, screening not only LRRK2, but also PRKN, SNCA and PINK1 in a cohort of early-onset and late-onset familial Portuguese Parkinson disease patients. This series comprises 66 patients selected from a consecutive series of 132 patients. This selection was made in order to include only early onset patients (age at onset below 50 years) or late-onset patients with a positive family history (at least one affected relative). All genes were sequenced bi-directionally, and, additionally, SNCA, PRKN and PINK1 were subjected to gene dosage analysis.<br/>
        RESULTS: We found mutations both in LRRK2 and PRKN, while the remaining genes yielded no mutations. Seven of the studied patients showed pathogenic mutations, in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for PRKN, and heterozygosity for LRRK2.<br/>
        CONCLUSION: Mutations are common in Portuguese patients with Parkinson's disease, and these results clearly have implications not only for the genetic diagnosis, but also for the genetic counseling of these patients.<br/>

        Mutations in the gene encoding beta-glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal degrading enzyme, have recently been associated with the development of Parkinson disease. Here we report the results found in a cohort of Portuguese Parkinson disease patients and healthy age-matched controls for mutations in the aforementioned gene. This screening was accomplished by sequencing the complete open-reading frame, as well as intron/exon boundaries, of the glucocerebrosidase gene, in a total of 230 patients and 430 controls. We have found an increased number of Parkinson disease patients presenting mutations in GBA when compared to controls. These results, together with recent literature, clearly suggest a role of glucocerebrosidase in the development of Parkinson disease.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence in the literature have shown that inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the results from the evaluation of serum inflammatory markers in AD patients have been controversial.<br/>
        OBJECTIVE: To determine if any differences exist in the monocytic secretion pattern of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients, when compared with healthy age-matched controls.<br/>
        METHODS: To evaluate the percentage of peripheral monocytes secreting IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha along with the relative levels of these proteins, a cytofluorimetric analysis was conducted under basal conditions and after lipopolysaccharide-induced cell activation.<br/>
        RESULTS: We found, in AD and MCI patients, a significant raise in the percentage of monocytes producing the studied cytokines (under basal conditions and after the exposure to an inflammatory stimulus), as well as a decreased competence of these cells to respond to inflammatory challenges, when compared with controls.<br/>
        CONCLUSIONS: These results agree with a persistent inflammatory status in AD, reinforcing the hypothesis of a progressive impairment of the immune response in this disorder and suggesting that monocytes may be good targets to study the progression from MCI to AD.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        BACKGROUND: Pathological brain iron deposition has been implicated as a source of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson diseases (PD). Iron metabolism is associated with the gene hemochromatosis (HFE Human genome nomenclature committee ID:4886), and mutations in HFE are a cause of the iron mismetabolism disease, hemochromatosis. Several reports have tested the association of HFE variants with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD with conflicting results.<br/>
        METHODS: Genotypes were analysed for the two most common variants of HFE in a series of 130 AD, 55 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 132 PD patients. Additionally, a series of 115 healthy age-matched controls was also screened.<br/>
        RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found in the PD group when compared to controls, showing that the presence of the C282Y variant allele may confer higher risk for developing the disease.<br/>
        CONCLUSION: Taken together these results suggest that the common variants in HFE may be a risk factor for PD, but not for AD in the Portuguese population.<br/>

        <p>Abstract<br/>
        LRRK2 mutations have recently been described in families with Parkinson's disease. Here we show that one of them (G2019S) is present in 6% (7 of 124) unrelated cases of disease in a clinic-based sample series from central Portugal, but not present in 126 controls from the same population. Thus, LRRK2 mutations appear to be a common cause of typical Parkinson's disease and as such will alter clinical practice.<br/>
