			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3651" title="" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/missing-leg-2.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="554" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>The missing leg</strong></p>
<p>To answer the question: ‘what is a body?’ let’s begin a bit smaller and ask ‘what is a leg?’</p>
<p>Oliver Sacks was baffled when a patient was horrified by the sight of his own leg one morning, claiming that it did not belong to him:</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>He seized it with both hands, with extraordinary violence, and tried to tear it off his body, and, failing, punched it in an access of rage.       </em></p>
<p><em></em><em>&#8216;Easy!’ I said. &#8216;Be calm! Take it easy! I wouldn’t punch that leg like that.’      </em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;And why not?’ he asked, irritably, belligerently.       </em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Because it’s your leg,’ I answered. &#8216;Don’t you know your own leg?’ </em></p>
<p><em>He gazed at me with a look compounded of stupefaction, incredulity, terror and amusement, not unmixed with a jocular sort of suspicion, &#8216;Ah Doc!’ he said. &#8216;You’re fooling me!’”</em></p>
<p>How can a leg get lost and be there at the same time? The answer lies inside the brain, in a small part, called ‘<em>somatosensory cortex’ </em>or, simply, ‘body map’<em>. </em>This small area contains a representation of the entire body. Thanks to it, we have a body.[1] But if it malfunctions, things go seriously wrong. The man who lost his left leg is just one case from Mother Nature’s eerie house of horrors. ‘Cotard’s syndrome’ sufferers, for example, are convinced that they inhabit a corpse. Quite similar to them, some sufferers from schizophrenia perceive their body as a lifeless coat hung over their person. Another strange malfunction is the inability to perceive movement. Only static objects exist in such a brain. Just imagine crossing a road. A car in the distance is suddenly in front of you, because the brain suppresses all gradual movement. And, to end this little excursion into the world of malfunction on a more surreal note: sufferers from ‘Capgrass disease’ believe that their mother is an impostor. Here, the connection between sight and emotion is severed. No emotion no mother! However, a telephone conversation with ‘mum’ does not provoke this problem. The link between auditory cortex and emotions is intact and she is identified as a genuine mother.</p>
<p>All these failures of the brain seem to point to one thing: that there is no body (and also no external world) apart from the one we carry in our head. Is Bishop Berkeley right after all? Are there only experiences and the experiencing subject?</p>
<p>Yes, of course he is right. But then there is also the other side to be considered. We have to add to the truth that there are only experiences and the experiencing subject also another truth: that there is nothing but a material world.</p>
<p>The material truth emerges when we ask how the body comes into the brain. We might think that we are born with a well functioning body map. But as with everything else, our body also has to be played into existence before we can use it. At the beginning of our lives we are similar to the man who lost his left leg &#8211; only that we have not as yet found it. And this not only applies to the left leg, but also our entire body. The process that plays our body into existence is as simple as it is ingenious. Here is how it works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3652" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mammillary_body.gif" alt="" width="360" height="360" />The body map</strong></p>
<p>As small babies, the world is centred on our needs, which are the needs of a not yet consciously realized body that requires food and care. The world is simply this need to survive. Objects emerge only gradually thanks to a procedure that works on the principle of touch. When, for example, I touch the handle of the cup of coffee next to me, only one impulse is sent to my brain. This signalises that I touch something that is external. However, if I touch my right hand with my left hand, then the brain receives two impulses: one from the left hand that touches the right, and one from the right hand that touches the left. The brain registers that I have touched something that belongs to my body. It is that simple: <em>single touch means external world and double touch means my own body.</em> This principle of double and single touch plays our body into existence and detaches it at the same time from the rest of the world. Subject and object have emerged.</p>
<p>Shortly after body and external world have detached each other, there is another creative development in store for young children. This development can go on well into their teens and settles them finally into the human world.</p>
<p>Young children have up to seventy percent more nerve connections than adults. This means that they have many more possibilities in playing their worlds into existence whist still under construction.</p>
<p>What we finally recognise as “the world” is, from the outset, nothing but a cortical process. The inborn cortical procedure is entirely automatic and works on a similar principle as the one, which plays body and external world into existence. But instead of working on a single and double touch system, it proceeds by routing the excess neuronal net that is conspicuously present in every small child’s brain.</p>
<p>Since we are already born into a civilisation created by many generations before us, our individual existence is influenced by a history of social traditions and habits, where our world develops further still, with the denial, acceptance or modification of social routines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3656" title="" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/neuronal-garden.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="368" />The neuronal garden</strong></p>
<p>The principle strategy of this process is again very simple. Active neuronal pathways grow and passive ones die. Imagine it just like a garden in which only specific areas are watered, whilst others are forgotten. Such a garden would bloom in places and become a desert in others.</p>
<p>What remains after this ruthless extermination of nerve connections is a brain, which is sensitive to certain events, vaguely aware of some, and entirely oblivious of others. Our world begins from here on to congeal the once fluid state of connected nerves &#8211; which allowed higher degrees of unpredictability in shaping our life &#8211; into a more predictable, selected world, which we identify with.</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, there are also internal conditions that dictate how our world will be made up. These inborn predispositions allow, or, if they are very strong, <em>force</em> certain individuals to seek out another world for themselves. These individuals seem to have an <em>inclination</em> to favour different (or even forbidden) areas of the real world &#8211; areas that are denied, unrecognised or shunned by their civilisation. This special bent makes them sensitive to things that go unnoticed with others. In such individuals, more unusual neuronal pathways will be preserved. Their neuronal garden will look very different.</p>
<p>Wherever we look, we can see that the world in which we exist is not fixed. It varies from person to person, and on a larger scale, from generation to generation and from civilisation to civilisation. It depends not only on the actual world, but also ultimately, on our own brain in accordance (or conflict) with the civilisation into which we happen to be born. This personalised world is the one into which we settle &#8211; a world we, each one of us, believe to be real. So real in fact, that much of our life is spent in convincing others, by persuasion, argument or force, of the realness of this world.</p>

<p>[1] Kant’s insight that ‘the mind does not create its laws from nature; it <em>imposes</em> it on nature’ is also true in this case: the brain <em>imposes </em>even legs on the body.</p>

<strong><em>&#8230;it&#8217;s got everything I need to get my creative juices flowing!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>The NeoKitsch studio is in the heart of trendy Crouch End, London.</p>
<p>It is a studio which has been home for world class concert performers and renowned film directors during the course of their projects and collaborations with Danny Hahn and the Creatives in Residence from the online multi-arts centre.</p>
<p>Having been praised for its spacious, high tech and efficient work space, it has also raised a few eyebrows for its unique and quirky approach to a professional environment. With its walls and shelves bursting with unusual instruments, vintage equipment, and library of films, books, scores and records, it feels more like a shrine for cinephiles and audiophiles than your average post-production studio.</p>
<p>Finnish director and film producer Mika Rantonen, (And White Was The Night, Detachment) flew over to London to stay at the studio for over a week to complete the final sound design, music and mastering stages of his feature film. He remarked &#8220;<em>This place is awesome. I should stay here more often to develop more film projects, because it&#8217;s got everything I need to get my creative juices flowing!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3551" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/studio-space.jpg" alt="" width="476" height="351" /><strong><em>We try to watch as many films and listen to as many records as we can in-between projects.</em></strong></p>
<p><em></em>When the space isn&#8217;t being used for post production purposes, it is often run as a recording studio, where actors from across the globe work on voice over dubbing in the studio&#8217;s sound isolation booth, and musicians regularly meet to improvise or explore the written music scores for feature films. Classical string players and even opera singers are familiar with the studio, as well as popular musicians and avant-garde soloists who enjoy using the synthesisers and the etherwave theremin.</p>
<p>Film crews have visited the studio to capture some of the work in progress, with broadcasts on Humtoo&#8217;s online music library, and Channel Fives&#8217;s TV show, The Gadget Show.</p>
<p>Resident violinist David Way, who has performed in most of the larger projects for NeoKitsch, has enjoyed working over many years with Danny Hahn. The two have scored 3 feature films together and have made several documentary films on their collaborations. However, the studio is not only for completing projects, it is also where ideas begin. &#8220;<em>As the enjoyable atmosphere allows lots of room for contemplation and brainstorming, we both often listen through entire operas with the librettos and scores from the studio&#8217;s music archive. We try to watch as many films and listen to as many records as we can in-between projects.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3559" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/neokitsch-equipment.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="339" /><em><strong>As you can guess, it is quite a rich audio experience!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The collection of instruments and recording equipment has been growing over the years. In Mika Rantonen&#8217;s feature &#8220;And White Was The Night&#8221;, the music soundtrack alone involved a colossal range of synthesisers and acoustic instruments, including the modern Swedish synths, <em>Elektron Monomachine and</em><em> Machinedrum </em>for their electronica and sci-fi sounds, the vintage <em>Yamaha CS-10, </em>the warm sounds from the<em> Logan String Melody, </em>the continuos pitch slides and vibratos from the<em> Continuum Fingerboard</em> and the <em>Moog Etherwave Theremin</em>, the otherworldly sounds from hand made avant-garde synths by Folktek such as the <em>Micro Garden, Modified Omnichord, Harmonic Field</em> and <em>Drum Scape</em> machines, popular collectables such as the <em>Roland TB-303, Korg MS-2000, Moog Rogue, Roland Groove Box</em> collections, midi controllers such as the <em>Monome</em>, and the <em>Roland TR-808</em>, as well as performers recording on the violin, cello and slide guitar, with orchestral backing from over 2 Terabytes of award winning symphonic software such as the <em>East West Quantum Leap</em> composers collection. As you can guess, it is quite a rich audio experience!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/40557"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1584" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/continuum-group.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>However, out of all the instruments, the Continuum Fingerboard has always been a favourite in the studio. Danny Hahn and NeoKitsch are featured on the instrument&#8217;s website for more information. (See link at bottom of page).</p>
<p>Much of the sound effects and foley library at the studio have been recorded with the location recording equipment and collection of microphones. For one particular project, Danny even travelled to Switzerland to record a particular church bell he required for his project. Unique and quality sounds have been painstakingly recorded and mastered across the globe for original audio soundtracks.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3566" src="http://www.neokitsch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/neokitsch-library.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="341" /><strong><em>&#8230;this is the place to watch great cinema classics.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>The book library in the studio is bursting with classical novels, philosophy, and especially film, screenplay and cinema literature, so time to learn and discuss further into specific areas of study has been a fruitful experience for many of the young students who have come to study, as well as for the professionals who needed time out from long days in front of the computer!</p>
<p>A collection of music on record, reel to reel, and CD is available with full scores for opera, symphonic works, chamber music, and solo works, as well as a collection of modern electronic, avant-garde and film soundtracks on vinyl.</p>
<p>The film library is almost getting too big for the demands of the studio, but if there are any 1940&#8242;s to 1950&#8242;s cinema buffs, or Hitchcock, Fellini, Bergman, Lubitsch and Billy Wilder fans, then this is the place to watch great cinema classics on the studio&#8217;s projector.</p>
