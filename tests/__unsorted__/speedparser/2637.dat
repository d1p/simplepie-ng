<p>In <a title="Understanding the prophets: Part one" href="../understanding-the-prophets-part-one/">Understanding the prophets: Part one</a> I spoke about the "Three Cons" as a key to reading the prophetic books of the Old Testament with understanding and in ways which are faithful to their original intention. In this second part we'll look at an example from Amos 5:18ff. and apply this approach. The result will be an uncomfortable word from God for us today.</p>
<p>Here are the slides from that talk: <a href="http://5minutebible.com/uploads/Amos.ppt">Understanding the Prophets: Part Two: Amos 5:18ff</a>. There are some <a href="http://5minutebible.com/category/ot/prophets/amos-prophets-ot/">podcasts that deal with the book of Amos here</a> and there is a <a href="http://bible.gen.nz/amos/">detailed free online commentary</a> with a wealth of background information and pictures here.</p>

<p>If podcasts can have dedications, then this one is dedicated to Robert Carroll. The podcast is full or irony, first that of an introvert who spoke before thinking and who failed to read or digest a fine work by an admired teacher and friend, and then that of a frequently (and often mordantly) humorous Irishman who denies title humour to black humour so like his own. And then in the end, in Ezekiel 4:9ff. I'll suggest there is both irony and (black) humour in the account of the Lord GOD conceding a customary prohibition to his staunch, righteous and rigorous prophet, while demanding that nevertheless he break the clear commandment of Scripture.</p>
<p>Here's the audio: <a href="http://5minutebible.com/audio2/humour26ezekiel.mp3">Humour in the Bible: book 26: Ezekiel</a></p>
<p>In this podcast I refer to:<br />
Chotzner, Joseph. “Humour of the Bible.” In <em>Hebrew humour and other essays</em>, 1-12. Luzac &amp; co., 1905. (The quotation is from page 12.)</p>
<p>and especially to:</p>
<p>Carroll, Robert P. “Is humour also among the prophets?” In <em>On humour and the comic in the Hebrew Bible</em>, edited by Yehuda T. Radday and Athalya Brenner. 169-189. Continuum International Publishing Group, 1990.</p>

<p>The poem in Prov 31:10ff. has been read in various ways, by men and by women, as an oppressive and as a liberating text. I will suggest two clues to making sense of the poem. The first is to read it in the context of the book of Proverbs (and not as an isolated poem), and the second is to read it precisely as a gendered text.</p>
<p>This podcast was provoked by reading a short piece on this text by Ann Wansborough produced back in 1992 for the Uniting Church in Australia's "Commission on Women and Men". (Thank you <a href="http://judyredman.wordpress.com/">Judy</a> <img src='http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>BTW <strong>since</strong> Proverbs <strong>is </strong>a gendered text, and since <strong>I</strong> read it as a male, I offer an invitation to my women listeners to do a short (ideally 4-6 minute) female reflection on this text from a woman's perspective to set alongside mine... Where/How do you find the Strong Woman?</p>
<p>Here's the audio: <a href="http://5minutebible.com/audio2/prov31.mp3">Proverbs as a gendered text: Proverbs 31:10ff</a>..</p>

<p>While it is quite clear that Proverbs is a gendered text, the way it speaks of women is interesting. For a text coming from an ancient patriarchal society human women who serve as aspirational models are a surprise.</p>
<p>No doubt any real Feminist would instantly switch into "pedestal" mode, but I think it's worth pausing and noticing what's going on, and maybe as I'll suggest in a follow-up podcast finding inspiration for contemporary spiritualities...</p>

<p>I am doing a three part series at South City Baptist Church on Sunday afternoons on <em>Understanding the prophets.</em> This week thinking, about what a prophet was and how they spoke, I used the title: "<a href="http://5minutebible.com/uploads/What%20does%20it%20profit.ppt">What does a prophet? What does it profit</a>?" these are the slides from the talk.</p>
<p>A key idea in this talk was the ideas in my <a href="http://5minutebible.com/week10-prophets-3-principles-unlock-the-code/">Prophets: three principles to unlock the code</a> another podcast that uses the same idea (but to address a New Testament prophet) is: <a href="http://5minutebible.com/week-12-teachings-of-jesus-the-prophet/">The teachings of Jesus the prophet</a>. There are many more of these 5 minute audio teaching about the Hebrew prophets and about particular prophetic texts. Just use the menu above &gt; <strong>OT</strong> &gt; <strong></strong>and choose a prophetic book.</p>
<p>Another good place to explore the nature and contents of biblical prophecy is the book of Amos. My commentary with also a huge amount of Bible Dictionary type material is here <a href="http://bible.gen.nz/amos/">Amos: Postmodern Bible</a>.</p>

<p>At last, I'm on the home straight, the first of the prophets <img src='http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  The prophetic books are packed with humour. But right at the start we'll need to get one thing clear. Humour is not just the comic, entertainment that promotes a giggle or a smile. There is humour also in tragedy, at times when "you either have to laugh or cry" and those when the sharp scalpel of cutting wit is needed to cut through defenses.</p>
<p>I'll try to explain this idea of tragic (as well as comic) humour in exploring Isaiah 1, and will also argue that in this passage (at least in Isaiah 1:8ff) all but two of the "signs of humour" we have been working with are present. One that isn't is "lighthearted mood" but you'd hardly expect that if there is such a thing as "tragic humour", as I am claiming.</p>
<p>So, listen to the podcast and tell me if YOU think that tragic humour exists, and if I've rightly named it!</p>

<p>If you ever want to provoke laughter in church in the 21st century, just read a chunk of the Song of Songs, of course it works better if you get a couple to read to each other! The imagery is just so strange to our culture that almost any passage will achieve laughter in moments. But this does not mean that the book is intended to be funny.</p>
<p>So my difficult problem in this podcast is to try to convince you that there is humour, as well as poetry and sex, in this very best Song.</p>
<p>It won't be easy or quick, indeed this is the longest ever "5 minutes" at way over 6 minutes <img src='http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />  on the other hand, I'm convinced that looking seriously at the topic of humour in the Song is a great way to get closer to its heart...</p>

<p>Never one reluctant to ask for more, <a href="http://5minutebible.com/humour-in-the-bible-book-21-ecclesiastes/">David Ker has rightly pointed out</a> that I did not explain how/why Ecclesiastes 10:5-15 is (and was meant to be) funny. So here goes...<sup><a href="http://5minutebible.com/humour-in-the-bible-21b-ecclesiastes-again/#footnote_0_1364" id="identifier_0_1364" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" If I had the hubris I&#039;d title this podcast: &quot;An artist&#039;s reply to just criticism&quot;, but that would be most unfair to poor David   ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Oh, don't worry, this won't be a dull dissection or a boring breakdown, I'll just show you how several of the <a href="http://bigbible.org/sansblogue/bible/biblical-interpretation/distinguishing-humour-signs-that-a-text-is-intended-to-be-funny/">signs of humour</a> are present, and in doing so hopefully reveal (without analysing to death) the humour in this passage!</p>
