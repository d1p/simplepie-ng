			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When leading congregations, Christian leaders must be aware of both explicit and implicit theologies.  What people believe determines how they act, and because of that, church members will continue to act according to the theologies that they hold.  Without an awareness of both explicit and implicit theologies, church leaders can waste time, “spinning their wheels” on technical fixes to problems, while ignoring the deeper issues that are involved.  Though it can take years, but church leaders need to address the explicit and implicit theologies of their congregants. </p>
<p>To begin with, explicit theology is what a church expressly believes.  Explicit theology is usually easier to determine because of its public nature.  What a church explicitly believes can be gathered from mission and value statements, doctrinal position papers, sermons, liturgy (including the hymnody), and various other items that express belief.  While explicit theology is often accurate, it can sometimes be more of an expression of intent, meaning that not everyone may hold to the same ideal.  Even still, explicit theology is usually the starting point for understanding what a congregation believes.</p>
<p>Implicit theology, on the other hand, is underneath the surface per se, and for that reason, it is much more difficult to determine.  The term “implicit theology” refers to those beliefs that are held, but may not be fully expressed.  Peter Cha, for example, illustrated how difficult it is to interpret implicit theology from merely what is visibly seen (i.e., artifacts), and that church leaders must take time to question what is unseen.  In fact, congregants themselves may not even be aware of their underlying beliefs until they are explicitly pointed out.  Implicit theology can include anything from “the pastor is the most spiritual man in our congregation” to “real worship means the raising of hands.”  In most contexts, neither of the statements would be verbalized, but they can become part of the working assumptions of a congregation.</p>
<p>As Kevin Ford points out in Transforming Church, churches function best when their explicit theology matches their implicit theology and vice versa.  If there is any discontinuity between the two, there will be underlying conflict.  Such conflict should not be overlooked, but used as an opportunity to change either explicit or implicit theology, so that it better aligns with Scripture.  To help encourage spiritual transformation, therefore, church leaders should be aware of both explicit theology and implicit theology, so that churches can be healthier and more apt to grow.  </p>
<p>As church leaders help to develop local churches, they must look beyond mere technical fixes and focus on deeper adaptive change.  In this effort, however, church leaders must take time to delve into the basic assumptions of a congregation, compare those assumptions with Scripture, and invest time in changing unbiblical assumptions.  Simply changing the explicit theology (such as a doctrinal statement) will not change people’s hearts.  Ministry needs to go deeper than what is espoused, so that heart issues, including what is assumed, can be sanctified for God’s glory.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An important, yet often neglected, reason to update hymn arrangements relates to chord structures and patterns.  Updating a song, or becoming more relevant, is not merely a matter of instrumentation.  Simply adding guitar and drums does not make a hymn contemporary.  In fact, many of the hymns were composed for piano or organ, so we can do them a disservice by simply swapping instrumentation.</p>
<p>Arrangements need to be flexible.  In the music world, arrangements are part of the &#8220;language,&#8221; just as authors vary their sentence structures.  We need to be cognizant of this as musicians &#8212; not berating people for being born in a different time period, but being sensitive to how culture has changed.  We cannot expect someone born in 1998 to speak the musical language of the 1730&#8242;s, and if we do, we are being elitist.</p>
<p>Certain chords (e.g., diminished chords) just aren&#8217;t as common in popular music these days, and it can sometimes create an extra barrier that prevents people from focusing on the lyrics of our worship songs.  For that reason, it&#8217;s beneficial to rearrange hymns, so that more people can appreciate them &#8212; even if they are slightly updated.  </p>
<p>Of course, we should not limit ourselves to I, IV, V chords. While we should slowly experiment and try to teach congregations different styles, we cannot force it upon them.  As with any language, it is necessary to start with what people already speak and gradually teach the new language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The family was designed by God to be a unique place, the most basic form of community, where much of our spiritual growth can occur.  </p>
<p>Because God designed families, churches should support families and minister to them.  In this effort, churches need to encourage families to live out their faith outside of Sunday morning.  It is during the week, within the natural context of our home, where we make our daily decision to follow Christ.  </p>
<p>At a formal level, midweek gatherings help parents, children, and youth to refocus on Christ.  At the same time, there needs to be balance.  Especially for young families, rather than “over programming” and having families over-commit (which can be counter-productive to spiritual growth), churches should support spiritual growth that can take place within the home.  Extra help should be provided for young families who are just starting their journey.</p>
<p>We should never forget that churches need to be a “second family” for dozens, if not hundreds of people.  Many do not have families, and others do not have healthy families.  Because of this, it is important for the church to be sensitive to these needs and provide a safe place for orphans, singles, divorced, and widows.  As the church loves as a family and ministers to those in need, the gospel is supported and enabled to spread (Acts 6).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;God has made you a rational animal, set you over the cattle, formed you in his own image.  Ought you to use your eyes as the cattle do, only to see what to add to your belly, not to your soul? </p>
<p>Stir up the eye of reason, use your eyes as a human being should, consider the heaven and earth, the fruitfulness of the earth, the flight of the birds, the swimming of the fish, the goodness of the seeds; consider the works, and seek for the author. Believe in him you do not see because of these things that you see. </p>
<p>If you think that it is with my own words that I have exhorted you, hear the Apostle: &#8216;For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities… have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made&#8217; (Rom. 1:20).&#8221;</p>
<p>- Augustine of Hippo</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hark, the voice of Jesus calling,<br />
&#8220;Who will go and work today?<br />
Fields are white and harvests waiting,<br />
Who will bear the sheaves away?&#8221;<br />
Loud and long the master calls you;<br />
Rich reward he offers free.<br />
Who will answer, gladly saying,<br />
&#8220;Here am I. Send me, send me&#8221;?</p>
<p>If you cannot speak like angels,<br />
If you cannot preach like Paul,<br />
You can tell the love of Jesus;<br />
You can say he died for all.<br />
If you cannot rouse the wicked<br />
With the judgment’s dread alarms,<br />
You can lead the little children<br />
To the Savior’s waiting arms.</p>
<p>If you cannot be a watchman,<br />
Standing high on Zion’s wall,<br />
Pointing out the path to heaven,<br />
Offering life and peace to all,<br />
With your prayers and with your bounties<br />
You can do what God demands;<br />
You can be life faithful Aaron,<br />
Holding up the prophet’s hands.</p>
<p>Let none hear you idly saying,<br />
&#8220;There is nothing I can do,&#8221;<br />
While the multitudes are dying<br />
And the master calls for you.<br />
Take the task he gives you gladly;<br />
Let his work your pleasure be.<br />
Answer quickly when he calls you,<br />
&#8220;Here am I. Send me, send me!&#8221;</p>
