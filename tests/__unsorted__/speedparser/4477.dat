			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try and make my posts positive and informative, but somethings things have to be said and sometimes informative is more important than positive.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re coming up on the beginning of audition season, and my fourth, I thought it was finally time to give my opinion on trying to make it as an actor in New York. Though I have no first-hand experience on LA, I hear from friends that it&#8217;s similar, if not worse. Let me get this out of the way: </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t move here to become an actor. </p>
<p>You will not be discovered and become famous. And that&#8217;s not me being pretentious, it won&#8217;t be me either. It doesn&#8217;t happen. Maybe 20 years ago, but now theatre is full of stars to bring in the money and that money comes from tourists who don&#8217;t know better. Theatre is informed by the &#8220;shoulders-up&#8221; performances of film. Gone is the breeding ground of great actors who then move to film and show off what they&#8217;ve learned and their inherent talent. Now it&#8217;s entirely about how you look, who you know, and that&#8217;s it. Otherwise, you&#8217;re cattle to be shuffled around based on your type and relative talent from show to show to make producers money. They are not going to help you out, you are just another face in the crowd of thousands upon thousands. And you are entirely replaceable.</p>
<p>Yep. No matter what your parents, your mentors, your teachers, your school tells you, you are not the most talented, brilliant person out there destined to &#8216;make it big.&#8217; You get here and there are hundreds&#8211;no exaggeration&#8211;just like you. So, Casting Directors and Producers can pick any of you and it won&#8217;t matter, and they know it. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be one of the few *thousand* kids who come to the city to try and break in. If you aren&#8217;t entirely ready to spend five to ten YEARS, then it will not happen. Nope. Not a chance. And don&#8217;t kid yourself and throw your and your parents&#8217; money at a dream that cannot, will not happen.</p>
<p>If you are willing to spend that time investment to make this a career, then you *might* be able to, and then that&#8217;s all it will be, a career, where you will work harder than any other person in a job, constantly be searching for the next job, cutting corners constantly, and constantly being rejected, but you *can* be an actor. After five or so years.</p>
<p>And even then, that&#8217;s now. In ten years, I have to imagine&#8211;given our culture&#8217;s sad focus on fame and notoriety rather than talent&#8211;that it will be even harder to become famous (read: now not even a needle in a haystack, but just impossible) and maybe impossible to be an actor anymore. Don&#8217;t be one of them, save yourself the anguish and the wasted years.</p>
<p>Watch a movie or go to a play instead. Support the art form you love in that way, and through you and others, maybe you&#8217;ll make it possible for one more actor to live.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers, those people in an audition that play opposite you with sides. Who are they? And how do they get their job? And what is it like? I was recently asked to be a reader and found the experience thrilling, useful, and upsetting, all at the same time. </p>
<p>First, I was brought in because I had a good audition for the casting director, she took some interest in me and asked if I was available to read for the upcoming auditions. I was sent the entire play (a production of a rarely-done work) and the sides I was expected to be ready in under a week. Now, the issue with being an actor and a reader is two-fold: your job is to give the actor as much as you can so that they can have the best audition possible, so you need to do good work. But! You can&#8217;t draw focus or make this about yourself; it&#8217;s their audition. Granted, you *can* get work out of being a reader, but that&#8217;s a rarity and usually after you&#8217;ve been a proven reader time after time. </p>
<p>So, I got a behind-the-scenes look at what agent auditions and callbacks for a prestigious theatre are like, the conversations after the people leave the room, the similarities between auditions, the people who come in unprepared, the people who knock it out of the park, and the people they bring back. Now what lessons did I learn that I can impart?</p>
<p>-Come in with a strong, committed choice if you&#8217;re at that level of the audition process; once the sides are in your hand, make it yours, give them as finished a product as you can. </p>
<p>-Read the material, and be ready to discuss the play you&#8217;re auditioning for.</p>
<p>-The people with the stand-out auditions are not necessarily those that will be brought back. In a couple instances, I thought people were phenomenal and perfect casting choices, but never appeared again in the process. So a great audition doesn&#8217;t mean you got the part, nor does a mediocre one mean that you&#8217;re out of the running (as that happened, at least in my opinion).</p>
<p>-Be ready for any situation, be it &#8216;performing&#8217; with the reader as your scene partner, or the reader playing multiple (read 3+ roles) in one scene. It&#8217;s all up to the director&#8217;s desire.</p>
<p>Being behind it all was exciting, plus I was getting paid! Seeing great actors do their work, meeting the producer, the director, established actors, and getting to know the CD even better. I was doing good work, as they kept asking me back, which could only bode well in the future. Now, why did I say upsetting? </p>
<p>As I had auditioned for the play, a role (I believe) is perfect for me, and they wanted their talent to be able to sing. I can sing quite well, and few of the performers really could, and almost all were nearly untrained. So, having to sit there, knowing I was not being considered, and knowing they wanted singers rankled a bit, but that&#8217;s a factor of being in the room. You are not auditioning. You&#8217;re networking, at the very most.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to read, do it at least once, it&#8217;s great to experience. And if you can get in with a theatre company and be their reader, do it. I think it&#8217;d bear more fruit than a CD&#8217;s in-house reader. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agents. The unicorn of the entertainment industry. How do you get one? How do you keep one? Why does everyone who has one think theirs is awful? Do they do anything? Or are they the panacea for actors&#8217; inability to land work? </p>
<p>Well, thanks to a friend who saw my work and liked what I did, I was recommended to an agent&#8211;who will remain nameless, as will her agency (namedropping is gauche and, well, you&#8217;ll see it wouldn&#8217;t do anyone any good)&#8211;and surprisingly, after I submitted my headshot/resume and cover letter to her, she called me in!</p>
<p>Needless to say, I was excited and hoped that this might be a breakthrough. Granted it was in commercials, but they pay well. I&#8217;d had some good experiences in the past year being called in and called back for commercials, and maybe it would lead to other opportunities. So, I arranged an appointment, and showed up fifteen minutes early. (Early is on-time, on-time is late, and late is fired)</p>
<p>I waited patiently, taking no issue and just chilling until I was called back. Then the red flags started. From the first words out of her mouth, her manner was incredibly caustic. Within a few questions, I began to feel like she had felt obligated to call me in due to our mutual connection, and had no desire to use me. (Silly, because my look is great for commercials and I could earn her a buck or two)</p>
<p>I read a side, and after a miscommunication (operative words are an important part of speech, people, as is speaking clearly and with projection) and a bit more snippiness from her. The read was meh, but I had made a choice and she laid into me about how I needed to take class. Go take from person X, or Y, or Z, let them know that she recommended them, and call her when I was done. </p>
<p>I left, absolutely crushed. I had never been treated like chattel. And maybe that&#8217;s the commercial-film business, maybe that&#8217;s just her, but there was incredible disrespect and a total feeling of her wasting both of our time. Needless to say, should I take class, or be seeking commercial representation&#8211;which I still am&#8211;will I ever call her again. She made it very clear that she&#8217;s not the kind of person that I want to be representing me, nor someone that I want to deal with for work. I don&#8217;t expect to be pandered to or have my ego stroked, but just be a decent human being.</p>
<p>So the question still remains, what are these agents? What will they do for me? And are they all incredibly rude?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are all kinds of auditions. The typical ones at Pearl/Ripley-Grier/AEA, the ones at a film school, the ones in tiny rooms, the cattle calls, the appointments, but none compared to this instance.</p>
<p>It was one of the hotter days this summer &#8212; and there have been some ridiculously hot ones &#8212; and I was running from audition to audition to class to class, taking down time when I could. This audition was for a film and was ostensibly in a &#8220;suite&#8221; of a building, implying a business operation. It became clear when I arrived that it was someone&#8217;s apartment. (Sidenote, *never* go to an audition at an apartment, especially if you are female, and only if you actually know the person/people and won&#8217;t be alone.) Red flag up, but thankfully there was &#8216;construction&#8217; so they wanted to meet outside.</p>
<p>We go to a &#8216;park&#8217; just outside the building, one of those concrete ones fully stocked with benches and places to sit, but with little foliage and on a day like that, with the sun as it was, a virtual oven. So, we mosey on over to the shady corner benches and sit down. I hand them my resume and not thirty seconds from sitting down, a haggard old homeless man pops up from a nearby bench, brown bag in hand, two teeth in his mouth, bleary-eyed, and begins to talk loudly at us. He makes a comment about how you can&#8217;t expect what life&#8217;s going to do to you and how you should be thankful for what you have, and how he&#8217;s now a &#8216;doom prophesier.&#8217; Well, he&#8217;s got a knack.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t respond, they do. They encourage him in their naive kindness, meanwhile trying to get the audition on track. Anyway, after a good five minutes of being preached to, he shuts up&#8211;I think to smoke with the hand not clutching the brown-bagged bottle&#8211;and they ask some questions and I do the sides they just handed me. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an intense scene, requiring emotional investment and definitely some raised voice, if not yelling. Being who I am, I commit, only to watch the auditors/couple cringe as they worry about all the people around us who are hearing this. I finish, unaffected, and they comment on how good a reading it is, and imply how it may have been uncomfortable. Good. Until:</p>
<p>Doom-sayer returns! To make his comments about my audition and critique my choices. Which they engage him on, thankfully to deflect him and defend me, but all the same, the situation has me not wanting this job one iota. We finish up, and start to head out, after a bit more fire and brimstone, and a couple apologies (surprisingly, but they were quickly negated as he kept speaking) and we headed out post-haste. </p>
<p>So it was weird. I did not contact them again. I am auditioning them as much as they are auditioning me (especially for a film), and though I&#8217;m thankful for the funny story and the experience, it wasn&#8217;t that great at the time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, being back in the city with my card has allowed me to be seen for every audition I have attended. Actually seen. Not just sat on line, not put my name on a list and had to check back later, but seen at the time I chose to be seen. It&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s also eye-opening that despite having that advantage, things are not that much easier than before. I still have to get cast, and that&#8217;s still a tall order with at least 100 people seen at each EPA, not counting those at others, the ECC&#8217;s, the agent invited auditions, or other rounds.</p>
<p>With all of that difficulty, how can you keep your head above water and not get mired down in the rejection? It&#8217;s finding all those little moments and conversations as Casting Directors, Artistic Directors, and others get to know you and see the talent that you bring to the table. In one month, this has shown itself in a number of ways:</p>
<p>An audition that went well&#8211;a lengthy and positive conversation with the CD after I had finished my audition&#8211;didn&#8217;t result in anything until I heard that she wanted me to come in for the rest of the auditions as the reader. What a wonderful opportunity to see how other actors work, make mistakes, make great choices, be heard and seen by directors and show my stuff. And get paid.</p>
<p>An audition I was perfect for, and nailed, could possibly lead to a job down the line. The Casting Associate (so don&#8217;t undervalue an audition where the CD or AD isn&#8217;t there) spent a long time asking me about my desire and ability with multiple characters, swinging roles, understudying, et c. And made a comment about how glad she was to meet someone capable, and how integral that was to the show they were casting.</p>
<p>And then you just have the auditions that you know went well. From a CD going out of their way to make a comment about how nice it is to meet you, or how great your audition was, to the audition where the lights literally turn back on when you hit the high-B and the room enjoys the humor and excitement with you of &#8216;your audition turning the power back on&#8217;. These are all wonderful things, they are all traction, and they&#8217;re all in the course of a month. Whew.</p>
<p>How to follow these up? Take note of who said what, when. Thank them in a postcard with your headshot and contact information on it. Remember the next time you audition for them that you now have a shared history and that can lead to longer conversations making you more memorable. And just keep your head up, be proud and keep doing the good work. It will come in time, just keep pounding the pavement.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to my father&#8217;s Christmas generosity, I had the opportunity to see Barcelona a couple weeks ago. It was a fantastic experience and one of the most vibrant, clean, and exciting cities I&#8217;ve been to. There&#8217;s so much to see, experience, and enjoy that 6 days wasn&#8217;t close to enough. I easily could have spent 10-14 days there and still had more I wanted to do.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of great food, though it&#8217;s hard to find variations outside of tapas and paella, so be ready for lots of carbs and seafood&#8211;not a bad thing in my opinion, but it&#8217;s not for everyone. There&#8217;s the best sushi I&#8217;ve ever had, and I eat sushi a ton, which we found at Yu on Carrer de Valencia, a sister restaurant to Yamadori (just around the corner). We also had some great contemporary Mediterranean at a place in El Born called Tarantaranta. There&#8217;s also a ton of tapas places, though we only tried a couple, and nothing was outstanding enough to report. As you can tell, I&#8217;m a foodie.</p>
<p>If food isn&#8217;t your focus, there&#8217;s art museums all over the place, but living in New York, we avoided those and went to see the sights. La Sagrada Familia&#8211;a Basilica designed by Gaudi and under construction for the past hundred years&#8211;was the highlight. I&#8217;m by no means religious and I had a couple religious experiences just walking through and experiencing the most wondrous Cathedral I&#8217;ve ever seen&#8230;and it&#8217;s unfinished. The city itself is full of architectural wonder and distinct neighborhoods that are full of life and each have their own unique flavor. While walking around&#8211;it&#8217;s an incredibly pedestrian city, we walked from port to the top of Barcelona and down in one day&#8211;I saw my first street art from &#8220;Exit Through the Gift Shop&#8221;: an Invader. Quite cool.</p>
<p>We also saw Montjuic, Park Guell, and Montserrat, the latter being absolutely phenomenal. It&#8217;s a monastery up in the mountains with a full chapel/cathedral that people make pilgrimages to all the time. We hiked a kilometer above it into the mountains and still had an hour or so higher to go before we decided to leave that to another trip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also got shopping for days, if that&#8217;s your thing, though I avoided it like the plague. Other things you should avoid: Las Ramblas unless you want a bit of their form of Times Square, full of street performers and con-artists and tourists and tourist-aimed restaurants (read: bad). Also, the Aquarium. It&#8217;s over-priced, it&#8217;s full of pushy tourists, and all the tanks are poorly decorated and inadequately-sized, any aquarium I&#8217;ve been to has been twenty times better than this one. Instead, and cheaper, go to CosmoCaixa, near Park Guell, it&#8217;s six floors of an amazing science museum, even with an acre of perfectly recreated Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>Barcelona LOVES it&#8217;s gelato (much to my happiness) and gofres, or waffles, with nutella and gelato. Mmm. Oh, and definitely try their cava.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I want to go back, hopefully life will allow that opportunity.</p>
<p>Now, back to acting life and auditioning.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SWP is the crowning jewel here at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. A week devoted to new work, playwrights, and workshopping for the intention of production. Three plays were worked this year:</p>
<p>27, based on William Faulkner&#8217;s short story &#8220;Old Man&#8221; of a convict swept away during the Mississippi River flood of 1927 and his struggle to return to his life in prison with his task successfully completed, despite having every opportunity to escape scott free.</p>
<p>Double Time, a musical by Nile Rodgers and John Walch, based on Leonard Harper and his successes and failures as an African-American breaking into Broadway in the early 1900&#8242;s.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Christmas Carol, by John Longenbaugh&#8211;where I played Young Holmes&#8211;where Moriarty is dead and without his arch-nemesis, Holmes becomes a curmudgeon as he finds no more joy in life, and is forced to reflect on his life like Scrooge.</p>
<p>Each was great work, and much improved over the course of the week, and performed by very talented people. I can&#8217;t wait to see what life these productions have in the future, they all have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>The best part of the week, better than seeing new work, or being a part of the process, was all the new people, the infusion of energy and creativity and a ton of people I really liked. If you have the opportunity to be a part of this project, do so, it&#8217;s incredibly rare, and the best thing at ASF&#8211;if you ask me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this job is coming to an end. What am I doing in preparation? Get my mind back in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update my resume.</li>
<li>Reach out to the directors, CD&#8217;s, and other contacts that I&#8217;ve worked with, letting them know when I will be returning and attaching my current headshot and resume.</li>
<li>Start looking at casting notices now, 3 weeks before I get back. See what is upcoming, what jobs I could potentially be right for and if the auditions happen before I get back, reach out and see if they might want to see me anyway.</li>
<li>Look at possible agencies&#8211;and just those that might be a good fit for my type and what jobs I want to get&#8211;and pick a targeted group (read: 3-5) and begin writing introduction cover letters for my HS/R that I will send out nearer to my return.</li>
<li>Check in with the people I worked with here before I leave, seeing how I stand, but mostly just to ensure I leave on a good note. I&#8217;d like to work here again, and you never know who might call and ask for recommendations&#8211;and people in this business, moreso than others, do.</li>
<li>Brush off the dust from monologues, change my repertoire as needed and start looking over my songs before I jump back into the audition circuit.</li>
<li>Apply for Unemployment&#8211;gotta have some money to tide me over until I land another gig, or until I&#8217;m forced to get back into &#8216;normal&#8217; jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that done, I need to take a step back and assess what I&#8217;ve accomplished here, and what my next goals are.  I&#8217;d love to start making headway into commercials, television and film, as I think my type is perfect for those venues. I&#8217;m also laying the groundwork for the upcoming ASF season and the potential roles I could be right for, just a seed here or there that might grow into another contract.</p>
<p>Who knows what the next step will lead to, but I&#8217;m picking my foot up and I&#8217;m making sure there&#8217;s going to be someplace to put it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of April 17th, every Repertory show at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival has opened.  We&#8217;re up and running, which means on any given day we could be performing Moonlight &amp; Magnolias&#8211;a hilarious play about the near-catastrophe of a failed Gone With the Wind&#8211;Julius Caesar, or Much Ado About Nothing.  Maybe performing two completely different plays during one day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s invigorating to say the least. Though it was tough to get three shows (and tons of understudy lines) into your head and be ready to perform any of them at any time, it&#8217;s amazing what the human brain can do, and amazing what quality shows we put on day in and day out despite having so much in our heads. So many directions, so many different types of plays, so many different characters. Yet, people are loving it, and I&#8217;m thrilled to have a break from school-age audiences; I&#8217;m finally able to see what really works for all people, what&#8217;s funny, what&#8217;s exciting, what works and what flat doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This is what I came here to do, and I&#8217;m doing it, and loving it.  It&#8217;s been trying, but well worth it. If you can, do come see something at ASF. Their shows are fantastic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s wonderful to have the father that I do.  Not only is he incredibly supportive&#8211;and now potentially pursuing the art as well!&#8211;but he&#8217;s one of the best resources I could ask for.  He is a copyright/intellectual property lawyer, and a great one.  Most of my life, I wanted to be an attorney like he is, either in IP or entertainment, and one summer he said that if I really was still considering the career, I had to see what it was like.  So, I took the Da Vinci Code (or Angels &amp; Demons, I can&#8217;t remember which one) and I went to an appellate court hearing to watch others and him work.  It&#8217;s obvious he had both a knack for the job, but also his background in acting, as he was so much more fun to watch, so interesting, and passionate in comparison to the others.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not an attorney, but that&#8217;s not because he wasn&#8217;t inspiring, I simply had some mentors who pushed me a different way.  So, here I am and needing some legal help.  Call in Dadmeister! I had received a second email from &#8220;Tyler&#8221; and it was clear he was serious, even going so far as to insist that unless I did what he was asking, I &#8220;would be held accountable.&#8221; So, then went out the opinion letter from my attorney-father.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say, it was full of legalese proving my side of the story, but also with enough candor to make it clear to him to back off.  I was a Cheshire Cat.  I&#8217;m a proud son, and this isn&#8217;t the only time he&#8217;s helped out in this capacity, and I can&#8217;t thank him enough for this or all the innumerable times he&#8217;s supported me in this life.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dad, I hope to keep making you proud.</p>
<p>Moral: Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about before throwing legal threats around.</p>
