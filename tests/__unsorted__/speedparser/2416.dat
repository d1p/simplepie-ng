<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.24820895004086196">One of the great things about my line of work is that I&rsquo;ve crossed paths with some incredibly smart, talented and thoughtful designers and technologists over the past few years, some through great events such as </span><a href="http://www.liftconference.com/"><span>Lift</span></a><span>, some through association with different corporate design teams, and some met randomly. I've met some of these folks through client projects or conversations in the hallway at conferences as they worked inside larger organizations, but most have now migrated teamed with friends, hung out their own shingle and become the newest crop of visionary workshops charting the path for the rest of us&mdash;teams like </span><a href="http://urbanscale.org/"><span>Urbanscale</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://berglondon.com/"><span>BERG</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://stamen.com/"><span>Stamen</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://superflux.in/"><span>Superflux</span></a><span>, and many more like them that are just emerging.</span></p>

In many cases, I&rsquo;ve found their ideas and creations a rich source of weak signals that manifest some of the critical uncertainties we face as a technological society. A common characteristic of these creators is a facility to take a nascent technological capability and bend it around a moral, ethical or social issue, intentionally or as by-product, and thereby provide a useful thinking space to model implications and consequences. They continually ask questions about what it means to attempt to put emotion into technology, and by doing this, they create and explore hundreds of mini-scenarios of a human-technological future.</span><span>&nbsp;Whether you agree or disagree with particular views of how these futures may unfold, the questions need asking, if only to provide a better sense of the direction(s) we wish to pursue.</span></p>

<p><span>Because of this, visiting </span><a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/"><span>Talk to Me</span></a><span>, a newly opened exhibit at the MoMa focusing on communication between people and objects was like some kind of strange family reunion. I was familiar with so many of the works featured in the exhibition, in some cases recalling the out-loud thinking some of the artists involved have shared over time as they crafted these amazing pieces, and with others thinking of how many times I&rsquo;ve invoked them as references to explain a concept to someone unfamiliar with this area. And, </span><a href="http://urbanscale.org/2011/07/24/week-29-talk-to-me/"><span>as Adam Greenfield rightly pointed out</span></a><span>, it made me think about how the exhibit signifies a kind of mainstreaming of these ideas and the attention (hopefully) now placed more squarely on the makers themselves. </span></p>
<p><span>Many of the works featured are only a few years old at most. Some, like Jack Dorsey's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/145490/">Square</a>&nbsp;and Usman Haque's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/145486/">Pachube</a>, are commercial products already, and as such are important influencers.&nbsp;MoMa's staging of the exhibit&mdash;of the actual alongside the speculative&mdash;shows how quickly we move from theory to practical consideration of technology&rsquo;s impacts on our most personal interactions, behaviors and emotions now.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>For the past two weeks, I've been locked away with <a href="http://www.kedgelabs.com">two</a> <a href="http://www.imlaurenpeters.com/">colleagues</a> and 28 of the brightest high school students in the US at our second annual <a href="http://www.tip.duke.edu/summer_programs/SFS_docs/FUTUR.pdf">Futures Institute</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.tip.duke.edu/">Duke University TIP program</a>. As was the case the previous year, the experience taught me as much as we taught the students&mdash;about how young people think about the future, how tuned in they are to their world and everyday environment, how values are evolving, and how they view big global challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We added some twists to 2010's curriculum, throwing in a closer look at the dynamics and future of open source, more on <a href="http://www.changeist.com/changeism/tag/design-fiction">design fiction</a>, a look at emerging technologies such as <a href="http://www.changeist.com/changeism/2011/5/4/makers-fight-for-the-future.html">personal manufacturing</a> and a heavier emphasis on social innovation and the <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/columns/2011/6/15/code-is-culture.html">changing needs of cities</a>. We also had the benefit of an industrial designer among the instructional team who helped students move from ideation to concept to creation smoothly, and new guest speakers representing different faces of applied foresight and innovation.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://www.changeist.com/storage/5909140366_549916b091_z.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1309966134212" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>Over the course of 10 packed days, five teams were taught fundamental foresight tools and methods, and taken deeper into key topical areas such as money, communication and media, energy, governance and health. Each team was asked to focus on solving future problems facing inhabitants of emerging megacities&mdash;wealthy and poor alike&mdash;including breakdowns in interaction patterns, lack of clean water, need for sustainable power creation, use of the democratic process, and access to financial services. Combining methods and knowledge, each team created a product, service or other offering tailored to their focus area, and spent the last three days in intensive labs moving from scanning to solution, complete with communication design and prototypes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 550px;" src="http://www.changeist.com/storage/IMG_20110629_200437.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1309893342894" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>The students jumped into the challenge of internalizing these new ideas and applying them in a blank slate environment head first, filling white boards and draining us of paper, post-its and scrambling for Internet access, putting in extra hours to get it done. Each team created a unique, innovative and often surprising solution, all while working with people and ideas they'd never encountered before the first class. "I don't think I'll see the world the same way after this experience," was common refrain in final day discussions with the students. And, as happened the previous year, a number of participants said they would now go home and rethink how they wanted to spend their future&mdash;what they want to do with their lives, and how best to apply their newfound knowledge gained from what one student called "free-range thinking". I call that a good way to spend two weeks.&nbsp;</p>

The new column, <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/columns/2011/6/15/code-is-culture.html">Discontinuities</a>, looks at disruptions created by technology and innovations in emerging markets. As a reader of CI, I've been incredibly impressed with the diverse voices it brings to the fore, particularly around the geopolitical realm. As technological and political economies become more closely intertwined, the opportunities for one to shape the other increase dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm grateful to editor Mike Innes and the CI editorial team in particular for the space to distill observations and thinking about the way technology, as it is both filter through and emerges in its own form, from emerging markets are re-orienting the way we think about the world&mdash;new threats, new opportunities, new risks and completely new vectors of development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first installment sets out an overview of this rebalance as we are beginning to see it, particularly as technological power from the developing world seeks to solve some of the complex problems of growing megacities, and how other forces are coming into play to feed home-grown innovations.</p>
<p>Please feel free to offer feedback and topic suggestions. And if you haven't already, put this publication on your must-read list. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/rss-comments-entry-11836727.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Dharavi: Backward and Forward in Time</title><category>India</category><category>cities</category><category>development</category><category>technology</category><dc:creator>Scott Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 19:57:59 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/2011/6/10/dharavi-backward-and-forward-in-time.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">82229:707010:11760162</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The first day of my <a href="http://www.changeist.com/changeism/2011/5/27/moving-money-moving-lives.html">weeklong stay in Mumbai</a> last week, I had the privilege of spending the afternoon in Dharavi, the largest slum in India, and a central part of Mumbai's life. With almost a million people living and working within one square mile, it functions almost as its own city within a city. Through&nbsp;the assistance of our local guide, we were able to spend about three or four hours in the backstreets, workshops and alleys of the district, getting a close up look at the culture that has grown up in this extraordinary area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Plenty of people have written at length about this stunning example of both poverty and resilience, so I'll limit this to a few observations made as we walked through:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Dharavi acts as a filter, cleaning and recycling an important part of Mumbai's commercial and materials ecosystem</strong>. Most people in the West define slums as a place of taking, not making, draining welfare and support, and giving little back. Dharavi is a case of the contrary. From fuel barrels to plastics to paper to textiles to metals and earthenware and just about any material or item that that can be scavenged or collected, there are small workshops that reclaim, reprocess and recycle hundreds of categories of consumables. In just a few hours, we witnessed plastics, fibers, metals and natural materials being sorted, stripped and reworked. <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Dharavi-A-slum-beyond-comparison">Some sources claim the district itself has an export economy of nearly a half billion dollars</a>&nbsp;alone. From what we saw, that is undoubtable. It's both a throw-back to earlier times in the West in manufacturing and small industry, not a million miles from 19th century London or New York, but it is also a glimpse into what may be the future as communities look to become more locally resilient and create end-to-end economies. Clearly the area lacks in many basic services and hygiene, but it has its own internal intelligence and systems not built to rely on modern infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Along with human knowledge, lightweight technology is a form of glue that keeps modern Dharavi running.</strong> The Wi-fi signal finding app on the phone in my pocket frequently alerted me to an open wireless Internet connection nearby, and the most prominent product segments for advertising in the area are communications and media. Dozens of mobile salesmen and repair shops lines the alleys. as did signs and banners for all of India's mobile operators and satellite TV vendors. Satellite dishes were not &nbsp;in short supply, and many of the street vendors or shopkeepers openly sport mobiles. Like the area's light industry, its lightweight communications infrastructure, while not clean lined with all bells and whistles, is clearly in place and functioning despite the infrastructure difficulties, and expenditure on communications and media are seen as important parts of living and doing business within Dharavi, as well as staying connected to the city and nation without.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Aspiration to upward mobility is signalled everywhere. </strong>The frequency of posters and ads offering English lessons were hard to ignore. Many forms of vocational training are offered, most prominently for IT jobs such as network management, reinforcing the previous point. Alongside Bollywood and cricket, technology is a lure to the young looking to move beyond Dharavi. With IT having brought so much wealth to the country in the past decade, it's an obvious aspirational target, but one that, outside the dot com bubblespace in the US, doesn't have the same allure here. I look forward to watching the rise of Dharavi <a href="http://www.angelasaini.co.uk/books.htm">geek culture</a> over time.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>My feeling on leaving is that Dharavi's future is India's future is the global future. How this area is improved and integrated into the city and nation will be an indicator of if and how India grows and what sort of power it will wield globally in the next century. The ingenuity required to solve these problems, both by the area's citizens and the country at large is something the West, in its stagnation, should pay careful attention to.</p>

Not the paper stuff, but the invisible variety. In the same week I'm prepping and packing to join SWIFT's <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/innotribe">Innotribe</a> in Mumbai, India for the upcoming event on <a href="http://www.swift.com/events/2011/Innotribe_Mumbai/index.page">mobile payments for the unbanked</a>, start-up <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> unveiled its play to make the smartphone the register, and <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/#utm_source=HA&amp;utm_medium=ha_sem_bk&amp;utm_campaign=en-US&amp;utm_term=google%20wallet">Google</a> also announced its wallet strategy. Both companies are promising, through the miracle of the same ubiquitous mobile, to alter forever the physical transaction of standing at a cash register and swiping a card or handing over currency. As <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/predictions-for-the-future-of-electronic-wallets">Ljuba Miljkovic of Adaptive Path points out</a>, we are suddenly being asked to give up many of our preconceived notions about the act of the transaction&mdash;and physical retail shopping in general&mdash;and anticipate the possibilities of even lower friction commerce.</p>
<p>Ironically, but perhaps not surprisingly if you watch this space closely as I do, despite all of the handwaving and liveblogging around the two latest innovations coming from Silicon Valley, it's what we will find happening in Mumbai&nbsp;and across emerging markets perhaps more indicative of the future of money and commerce. Finding solutions to allow the currently unbanked to tap into the same ubiquitous mobile&mdash;albeit not as expensive or powerful (yet)&nbsp;as an iPhone or Android&mdash;may shape a far greater part of the next few decades of commerce, as well as health, quality of life, and many other important human factors. Getting a coupon for the Gap is great, and those shorts will look *awesome* this summer, but enabling a remittance payment to get from a worker in one country to a family back home x 1 million may help us learn so much more than unlocking incremental advertising revenue in Seattle or Chicago.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. Square, smartphone wallets and the boom in competition both will drive will have wide-ranging impacts. For one, they may both help to eventually minimize the role of the physical card in payment, and drive new technologies such as NFC through the retail environment. They will both yield an enormous amount of transaction and other behavioral data over time (why else do you think Google is in the game?). Doubtless money will become more "<a href="http://emergentbydesign.com/2011/04/04/the-bank-of-facebook-currency-identity-reputation/">social</a>" again, in the social media sense. Don't think for a second that deals won't be attached to practically every transaction you make over your smartphone in the developed world. But these innovations, or exploitations of possibility, largely serve to increase velocity. They will make consumer spending move even faster, but in many ways only incrementally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Mumbai and beyond, the first thing to unlock is the ability to move money <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at all</span>&mdash;to receive it, send it, save it, pay bills with it, and more. These capabilities will enable something we take for granted: they save time, increase the security and predictability of money. Lower risks, as banks will tell you, increase opportunities. Accessing opportunities to improve life is what financial inclusion should be all about. Insights gained solving the money issue could very well help solve health, legal, education and a raft of other issues along the way.</p>
<p>So, looking at the potential future impact of these events relative to each other, I'm betting that innovating around mobile money for the unbanked is the one that, with fewer innovations spread more broadly, will be the <a href="http://thereboot.org/blog/2011/01/27/mobile-banking-in-international-development/">lever that lifts much more</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://thereboot.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Reboot-Mobile-Money-Infographic-11.gif">see this graphic</a> for just how big an impact it could make). Change is often relative, depending on where one stands. I'm betting in 20 years, my life will be more impacted by solving this problem than making it a little easier for me to buy lunch without a card.</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/rss-comments-entry-11597120.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Makers Fight (for) the Future</title><category>design</category><category>economics</category><category>education</category><category>fabrication</category><category>innovation</category><category>making</category><category>manufacturing</category><category>technology</category><dc:creator>Scott Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2011 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/2011/5/4/makers-fight-for-the-future.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">82229:707010:11319692</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://www.changeist.com/storage/5673267019_5d2280c42e_z.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1304281099948" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>Last week I had a chance to sit in on two panel discussions on <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/3731">3D printing and personal manufacturing hosted by Public Knowledge</a> that took place, surreally, on Capitol Hill in the august conference rooms of the US House of Representatives. The Hill was empty due to the Easter recess, which, as one colleague put it, is "probably why they let the nerds in for a day". But the fact that it was, and that, among the sixty or so people in attendance, probably one-third had direct access to 3D printing technology, showed that this is an issue that is now creeping onto the radars of those concerned with the US economy. Bre Pettis of <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">MakerBot Industries</a> likened the moment to an early meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club that spawned Apple in the late 1970s, maybe only slight hyperbolic when we look back ten years from now, given the potential of this area.</p>
<p><strong>iTunes, Etsy, or Pirate Bay?</strong></p>
<p>You could sense the outlines of a fight for the future taking shape&mdash;with the boundless enthusiasm for pushing ahead with an almost palpable transition butting up against the suspicion of entrenched interests. The room was literally split between tech journalists, DIY supporters and makers on one side, and lawyers and lobbyists on the other. Talk of micro-patents and micro-entrepreneurship put the focus on the threats that lie ahead for personal manufacturing. The possible futures are starting to take shape, from an iTunes-like market dominated by large commercial interests to creative peer-to-peer markets to illegal "object" torrents&mdash;and likely all of these will coexist in the 3D world the way they do in the world of bits at the moment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p style="display: inline !important;">Panelists' views of the obstacles standing in the way of a growing personal manufacturing economy include lack of frameworks for IP protection that take into account the novel properties and capabilities of these technologies, development of killer apps, or what someone called "content" sweet spots&mdash;with content being designs and categories of objects that will spur wider interest (or, not being solely defined by novelty "<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mgorbis/status/60424327887192064">crapjects</a>)", and setting up viable networks and clearinghouses for that content.</p>
<p>On a technical level, Cornell roboticist Hod Lipson specifically pointed to need for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/tag/carl-bass/">more accessible creation tools</a>&nbsp;and common descriptive languages that can help standardize and simplify the development of fabrication networks. Like the hundreds of small, independent PC makers of the early 1980s, at the moment we have a jumble of bots that don't speak the same language.</p>
<p><strong>The Future They Fight For</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of enthusiasm in the room for putting these technologies in the hands of the young, in particular with primary school-age kids, to harness their passion for making things at a young age, to develop their visual acuity, and to give a boost to STEM education in the classroom. But, as one panelist pointed out, many schools in the US having aging, often little used computing technology, and weak connectivity, hampering such a push, and budgets for the simple things like books, supplies and basic instruction are being cut, pushing advanced investments in the economic future like 3D printing in the classroom further down the line just when it could be most powerful.</p>
<p>This excitement about unleashing the unknown is gaining momentum, and the lessons learned from previous generations of technology about education, business models, sociology, etc. may provide useful guides. Designing and making your own tools and objects is an evolution of the personalization of pre-designed objects the young today have grown up with as a nearly universal expectation. As with the PC revolution, and the Internet boom after it, the adults in the room at their creation only set the tools in motion, and the generations after innovate. Only, as they create physical objects, the potential for these technologies is exponentially more disruptive&mdash;from <a href="http://dvice.com/archives/2011/02/3d-bioprinting.php">bio-printing</a> to <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2011/02/the-secret-world-of-printing-concept-cars-in-3d/">large-scale fabrication</a> to <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/03/giant-3d-printer-can-print-building.html">printed architecture</a> and areas not yet realized.&nbsp;</p>

In the first set of clips from thinkers such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FutureOfFacebook#p/u/48/1Vh7x0PK4AM">Douglas Rushkoff</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FutureOfFacebook#p/u/29/_i70jIMJ-s0">Kevin Kelly</a>, one common note seems to emerge around what Facebook does next&mdash;how it engages its nearly three-quarters of a billion users to do more than spend time online peering into each other's lives. What do you do when you've amassed this many people, beyond adding "me too" location and deal-sharing features?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the questions I chose to focus on is, what happens with Facebook as infrastructure? Forget the pages, pokes and features, and think about the network mapped over our giant collective social graph. How does it move with the evolving digital economy? In the clips below, I talked about two ideas: getting off the Web and into the real world, extending itself as an economic conduit, and also becoming part of an emerging botttom-up economy.</p>
<p>While we share likes of "The Wire," Lady Gaga and Manchester United now, could we share creations, ideas, instruction sets in the near future? If Facebook wants to become the next-generation infrasructure for social currency, part of that currency is creation&mdash;making and doing. Think of the Visa network, or Xbox Live, but perhaps for grassroots creativity. It's a thought experiment of sorts, taking the road less discussed, diverting from the well-trodden content and apps "fork" to the ideas and objects path.</p>
<p>Thoughts and polite provocations welcomed. Personally, I'm looking forward to more of the videos. Stay tuned to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FutureOfFacebook">the project's YouTube channel</a> for more.

In it, Meier recounts some recent thinking in this area, citing collaborative efforts around crisis mapping as an example of how, when due to incapacity, corruption or unwillingness, a government can't provide adequate assistance to its people, technology provides tools for the people to take on this role themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 450px;" src="http://www.changeist.com/storage/help-map-375x257.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1302464146482" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>Meier recounts his colleague&nbsp;<a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/author/gregory-asmolov/">Gregory Asmolov</a>'s example of the Russian wildfires of 2010, where groups used the Ushahidi collaborative mapping platform to track the fires as the government failed to keep up with their spread. Using these maps, local residents were able to pinpoint, and even taking on fighting, these fires. Meier notes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...the resulting map is often not as profound as the social capital generated between the dozens, often hundreds, of people collaborating on a live crisis map. In turn, this social capital facilitates mass collective action. In other words, social capital is fungible.&nbsp;As [James] Scott notes, &ldquo;this transformative power resides not in the map, of course, but rather in the power possessed by those who deploy the perspective of that particular map.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It isn't hard to see how this dynamic will grow stronger over time, in a period where governments at all levels are increasingly diminished by both lack of resources and growing complexity&mdash;not just in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/apr/11/world-bank-global-development-focus">the fragile and failed states</a> that have taken so much of our attention in the past decade, but in developed countries rocked by globalization's effects. The phase of waiting for governments to open access to data is already being overtaken by citizen collection, reporting and action, from Kabul to Kyoto.</p>
<p>Rachel Sterne's talk about New York City's efforts in this area at the PSFK NYC event this past week demonstrated how this is happening in one major, stable city, in what <a href="http://www.anthonymobile.com/">Anthony Townsend</a> calls combinatorial local innovation in his recent study, <a href="http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/publications/future-cities-information-inclusion">A Planet of Civic Laboratories</a>.&nbsp;But in places where there is no partner to combine with, but where the innovation capability can be generated through creation of this social capital, citizens won't just step in where the state can't, but will take over the role of the state. It has happening in a negative sense where parasitic terrorist organizations inhabit shells of failed states, and now we may be seeing a more positive strain emerge in situations like the Russian example, or the <a href="http://community.pachube.com/node/611">citizen-driven collection of radiation data in Japan</a>&nbsp;via Pachube. How long before we see this kind of effort creating bottom-up governance in a place like Detroit?</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/rss-comments-entry-11109413.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Making Future Greeble</title><category>design</category><category>design fiction</category><category>experience</category><category>film</category><category>future</category><category>interfaces</category><category>media</category><dc:creator>Scott Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2011 14:46:04 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/2011/4/4/making-future-greeble.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">82229:707010:11042941</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="http://jtnimoy.net/workviewer.php?q=178">interview on just out</a> with the designers responsible for the look and feel of interfaces in the recently released Tron: Legacy film reveals an interesting design fiction tension that arises after several generations: the desire to fight one rendering of a fictional future with another. While Tron: Legacy, like Tron before it, is a fantasy present, the dynamic is still much the same as trying to design a future: working out the look, feel and experience, whether its a future state or a loosely distributed present.</p>
<p>In the interview with GMUNK, one of the principal designers, he speaks about his team's task in terms of wrongs to right:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"I take representing digital culture in film very seriously in lieu of having grown up in a world of very badly researched user interface greeble. I cringed during the part in Hackers (1995) when a screen saver with extruded "equations" is used to signify that the hacker has reached some sort of neural flow or ambiguous destination. I cringed for Swordfish and Jurassic Park as well. I cheered when Trinity in The Matrix used nmap and ssh (and so did you). Then I cringed again when I saw that inevitably, Hollywood had decided that nmap was the thing to use for all its hacker scenes (see Bourne Ultimatum, Die Hard 4, Girl with Dragon Tattoo, The Listening, 13: Game of Death, Battle Royale, Broken Saints, and on and on)."</em></p>
<p>While GMUNK's crew focused on bringing elements of interface design that are relevant and credible to programming, and more importantly hacking, they also had the tough job of picking up design cues from the groundbreaking art direction of the external (really internal, in-device) environments in the new film while staying connected to the original Tron's attempt at same&mdash;effectively bridging the credible present with a stimulating near future, while giving a nod to the past. Dizzy yet?</p>

Eagle-eyed <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/futuryst">Stuart Candy</a> asked if I had explained the backstory, which I hadn't officially done. It's also good timing as <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cotton">Ed Cotton</a> at <a href="http://www.influxinsights.com/blog/">Influx Insights</a> has asked a different question: <a href="http://www.influxinsights.com/blog/article/2742/no-to-labs-yes-to-incubators-.html">are labs or incubators better</a>? I'll try to take on both questions here.</p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;">So, why labs, why pop-up, and why us? The answers, like the questions, are multifold. Since it was founded almost four years ago, Changeist has had a dual personality. My intention in creating a formal company was to explore and create, not just to write and muse. I wanted to turn the research shop model I'd spent over a dozen years working within, inside out&mdash;to use the real world as a resource and to explore the future via experience and interaction with its probable inhabitants. I also wanted to explore more thoroughly the values of collaboration and experimentation, pushing futures thinking in new directions and into closer interaction with other disciplines&mdash;experience design, game design, social sciences, urban planning, engineering, the list goes on. In short, gene splicing and crossbreeding as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;"><strong>Venture Research</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #181818;">All along, we have also been focused on the more traditional problem solving metrics. You just can't take the technicians out of us, so we've produced an enormous amount of research, synthesis and forecasting for clients. The process typically takes three to four months from RFP to final briefing to find, frame and explain emerging possibilities. We can, and do, handle projects in a very linear and process-oriented way. All of this comes after the client takes three to six months to wrestle with strategic imperatives and figure out which ones it can fund. The results frequently find their way into hefty documents, though we manage to&nbsp;<span style="color: #114170;">develop more artifacts</span>&nbsp;than I might have expected. </span><span style="color: #222222;">The direction of work remains the traditional: tightly defined strategic question or worry, months of highly focused investigation, and a deliverable. </span><span style="color: #181818;">It's a process not unlike investing in start-ups, only these are&nbsp;<em>start-up questions</em>, not companies. From the client's point of view, it's a pageant to select the problem most worthy of funding exploration of, backing it with an "investment" and commercializing the insights that result. To Ed's question, it's more like the incubator/VC model of research.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimdowning/"><img src="http://www.changeist.com/storage/2432959023_68ff296f6d_z.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1301517178827" alt="" /></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>To the Lab</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;">To us, the lab model has equal, but different merit. For every "known unknown" approached through the process above, organizations are faced with dozens of other "unknown unknowns," some of which could be the source of creative sparks, and new opportunities they never knew they might face. The lab approach is less about fixing a problem or filling a gap and more about finding totally new spaces to define. In the areas of foresight and innovation, the discovery of <em>possibility</em> is critical&mdash;to us, as critical as identifying a hidden threat or knocking down a barrier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;">Setting up a lab allows us, together with a client, to define a general problem or exploration space and then mine it for possibilities. This is done both physically, through ringfencing of budget, staff, space and time (think Google 20% Time) and culturally, with a formal decision to allow resources to be given to finding the new. Foresight R&amp;D, it might be called. Labs allow an organization to switch from problem-finding to opportunity creation. Labs can also be elastic, interdisciplinary and most of all, experimental&mdash;a space to try out "what ifs." In Lab mode, Changeist can bring something to the table that has become one of our specialties, a seed stock of new ideas, insights and approaches we can then mix with a client's internal culture to create something fresh and new.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #181818;">We need new ideas, now, more than ever. Not all organizations can afford to set up an elaborate new insight generation machine but many can manage an injection of this type of thinking and the accompanying toolsets. Creating temporary Pop-up Labs allows a safe way to explore foresight and innovation with some broad boundaries, mixing in the most interesting skills and ideas and can provide a foundation for a larger, more formal structure and process when it makes sense.</span></p>
<p>So, while incubation is important, to me it isn't an either/or question. Organizations need to be able to step back from the risk-averse hyperfocus on answering questions about known problems, and be able to open up the frame to explore possibilities, but they need ways to do that, and labs present one possible way to do this&mdash;creatively, constructively, and with broad broundaries. People need to have the opportunity to grapple with possible futures, not just have one or two presented to them for a thumbs up/thumbs down vote. After all, some of history's greatest inventions have come from a moment of asking "What if?" We'd like to think that's what we do best.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.changeist.com/changeism/rss-comments-entry-10972896.xml</wfw:commentRss></item></channel></rss>
