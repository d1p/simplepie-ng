<p>For a moment, or rather from this day forth, let your mind forget about this man&#8217;s association with the OFWGKTA camp or whatever &#8220;beef&#8221; that may have ensued. None of that is pertinent at all; to either partys&#8217; music, to hip-hop and most importantly, yourself. <strong>brandUn DeShay</strong>s&#8217; debut album can&#8217;t be measured by the kind of pithy quid pro quo you would find on the album of a bitter artist. He has no reason to be bitter. Nor is it some magnanimous, self-abasing metaphorical white flag. He has no reason to apologize. Simply put, he&#8217;s back and it&#8217;s like he never left, but really, did he ever leave? The answer to that is a resounding &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>It has been a year and a half since DeShay dropped his anomalous <a href="http://www.earmilk.com/2010/06/11/brandun-deshay-volume-three-to-get-ready-mixtape/" target="_blank"><em>Volume: Three! To Get Ready</em></a> mixtape. With the exception of a few, in fact a very few, notable production credits in the last year not a lot has been heard from the up and comer. Leaving listeners to wonder if he had something brewing in his own musical cauldron, or if he was lost in a cave somewhere buggin&#8217; out with Smeagle. Thank God it was the former.</p>
<p><em>All Day DeShay AM</em> couldn&#8217;t have a more fitting title. While many listeners may think to hear something new within the content of his lyrics after such a hiatus, he really doesn&#8217;t offer much more than he did on his last mix tape, but this isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Make no mistake, his flow and wordplay have certainly grown and, as always, the production is superb. Swagger is definitely  an element of DeShay&#8217;s music, but what separates him from that lexicon of braggadocios emcees is his humility. For that characteristic alone this body of work is, for lack of a better phrase, &#8220;a breath of fresh air&#8221;. </p>
<p>From start to finish, the central theme and message throughout screams perseverance. On the intro track &#8220;Shay loves to ball&#8221;, brandUn wraps up his verse by saying, &#8220;New Collab, but this is far from a game, you can&#8217;t win, you can&#8217;t lose , you can only remain. I give thanks to all the cat&#8217;s like Hov that&#8217;s still in it, giving me a harder record to break, I&#8217;m gone win it.&#8221; Here, not only has he acknowledged that his goals are still a work in progress, but he also pays homage to those that set a new standard for hip-hop and thanks them for giving him something more to work towards. </p>
<p>DeShay recruits the talents of fellow Chicago native <strong>Rockie Fresh</strong> on the track &#8220;They Notice&#8221;, a mellow, jazzed out head nodder.<br />
<strong>Stream Only:</strong> <strong>brandUn DeShay</strong> &#8211; They Notice (starring Rockie Fresh)</p>
<p>A recurring theme in DeShay&#8217;s work are the interlude&#8217;s. A reflection of his own apprehensions, these segues serve as interesting and refreshing food for thought. On &#8220;Now! OVA&#8221;, DeShay cites the renown author Shel Silverstein on his poem &#8220;If The World Was Crazy&#8221;. <em>All Day Deshay AM</em> surely isn&#8217;t a concept album, but the breaks within each body of work help to add to a building idea overall, giving listeners something familiar to look towards next time.</p>
<p>The following track, &#8220;Ur Fresh!&#8221;, hits like a ballad-rap from hip-hop&#8217;s golden age. Although his space-age influenced sound design bleeds through on every track, it is safe to say that the man knows his history. To make an analogy, DeShay is the Plato to Pharrells&#8217; Socrates. As he has proven time and time again with songs like Dom Kennedys&#8217; &#8220;Locals Only&#8221; and Sir Michael Rocks&#8217; &#8220;Ground Up&#8221;, boom bap is a term not foreign to his vocabulary or musical ability. Add a beat like that with witty lyrics and a flow with a solid cadence, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a jam.      </p>
<p><strong>Stream Only:</strong> <strong>brandUn DeShay</strong> &#8211; Ur Fresh!</p>
<p>&#8220;Canopy&#8221;, another banger on the album designed to keep your head bobbing reiterates DeShay&#8217;s everyday struggle to change his life for the better; something we can all relate to. He begins, &#8220;I had to ask God why do he be testing me daily, coming home to a zoo like it was Barnum and Bailey&#8217;s. Work is bullshit too, these fuckers driving me crazy. Askin&#8217; me for the same shit, don&#8217;t they know what my aim is? I am more than this retail. At the point of no return like I ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for resale.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stream Only:</strong> <strong>brandUn DeShay</strong> &#8211; Canopy</p>
<p>What this album makes clear is DeShay&#8217;s understanding that achieving any dream takes patience, persistance and a little talent. Albeit, DeShay hasn&#8217;t quite reached his peak, <em>All Day DeShay AM</em> affirms that hes moving into that position, but more importantly, he&#8217;s enjoying the ride on the way there. One could argue that brandUn is one of, if not, the most influential up and coming producer to bless the hip-hop world producing hits that have helped bring rise to artists like <strong>Curren$y</strong>, <strong>Dom Kennedy</strong>, <strong>Sir Michael Rocks</strong>, <strong>Danny Brown</strong> and L.A. emcee <strong>Casey Veggies</strong>. This just demonstrates that he is far more than a producer. Not bad for a guy that took a year and a half off.   </p>

<p>Toronto stand up &#8211; beat cook <strong>Poupon</strong> is serving up another one to scarf today on UK label <strong>DubNoir Music</strong>. A four track EP baked with three originals and a remix for the icing on top. Expect four on the floor kick with that bassy oomph, a signature Poupon recipe. It calls for savory 909s and a zesty garnishing of diced vocal samples sprouted from R&amp;B hits of the past. Have a taste from the teaser below which starts off with <em>Lima</em>, a subtle delicatessen that sets out to chill with an aroma to provoke your senses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.earmilk.com/2011/10/03/poupon-searching-ep/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s undeniable that the scent that leaves a trail on this release emanates from the titled track <em>Searching</em>. With it&#8217;s klezmer bounce and clever sampling techniques, it aims to satiate old school cravings and deep house bliss. A track true to his gusto, the master chef continues to skim through the plateaus and tune his method in an uphill progression. Consider this his best plate to date, and through the waitressing of <strong>Mary J Blige</strong> a stinging course leaving you with a soulful aftertaste.</p>

<p><strong>Curren$y </strong>has always given his fans with what they ask for; a lot of good music. He&#8217;s always on his grind, and about to release his fourth studio album of 2011. This new track &#8220;Light Snacks&#8221; hasn&#8217;t been confirmed on <em>Muscle Car Chronicles </em>but because of the title, it might just be a &#8220;light snack&#8221; until we can get the whole meal when the track drops. Check this song out, it&#8217;s pretty dope and I hope you enjoy it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.earmilk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Hly1P1.png" alt="ill.Gates" width="500" height="300" /></p>
<p>When <a title="ill.Gates, Earmilk, July 7th, 2011" href="http://www.earmilk.com/2011/07/07/fresh-cornbread-with-ill-gates-and-our-ticket-winners-for-atlanta/" target="_blank">we last checked in</a> with <strong>ill.Gates</strong>, he was hard at work in <strong>Bassnectar Studios</strong> (way up in some cold, icy hell also known as Canada) working on his new album &#8220;<strong>The ill.Methodology</strong>&#8221; with some guy you&#8217;ve probably never heard of named Lorin&#8230; oh wait, no his name is <strong>Bassnectar</strong>. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/mp3/2011-10/ill.Gates  Mimosa - Never Alone.mp3"><strong>ill.Gates &#038; Mimosa</strong> &#8211; Never Alone</a></p>
<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/mp3/2011-10/ill.Gates - Pick It Up (feat. Bakaman  Masia One).mp3"><strong>ill.Gates</strong> &#8211; Pick It Up (feat. Masia One &#038; Bakaman)</a></p>
<p>Since I first spoke with ill.Gates, I have felt nothing but respect for truly the most underrated man in electronic music. Working alongside Bassnectar has obviously rubbed off a bit on the man &#8211; and I&#8217;m not here to pick favorites, because (<em>Lorin, I love you dawg, so I hate to say this</em>)&#8230; ill.Gates might be getting better than the man he lives in the shadow of. When two great artists are together, developing music, you&#8217;re bound to come up with amazing projects from each of them.</p>
<p>ill.Gates is a self described &#8220;bass music artist&#8221;, and after listening to his new album&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty much ready to declare &#8220;The ill.Methodology&#8221; the best electronic album of 2011. You have no idea how tired I am of listening to &#8220;laptop/dorm room dubstep&#8221; by hobby producers. ill.Gates has been around since breakbeats were still new, and Gabber was hot &#8211; when our dorm room kids were still in diapers. And it shows.</p>
<p>When his management told me his new album would be out soon, I did what any normal person would do &#8211; get on Skype and hit up my boy: &#8220;<em>Dylan. I love you. Make sure Earmilk can get some exclusives on this. Pretty please. I&#8217;ll make you a charm bracelet. Be my BFF?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t call this a dubstep album. It&#8217;s bass heavy, for sure, but not in the way dubstep is heavy. You&#8217;ll hear some wobble, some drum &amp; bass breaks, even some sounds that obviously have some bass lines like Dutch New Beat. (Yeah, <strong>Patrick De Meyer</strong>, <a title="Tragic Error - Tanzen (1989)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txq736EVa80" target="_blank">this is for your in your Tanzen days</a>&#8230;) It&#8217;s a complete idea. Everything works. These aren&#8217;t remixes. This is a genius at work.</p>
<p>Am I doing an album review? Fuck yes I am &#8211; let&#8217;s do it like Spinal Tap: <strong>11 stars out of 11. </strong></p>
<p>The ill.Methodology is out TODAY. You can grab wherever you want &#8211; just make sure you get a copy, because it&#8217;s than damn good. Secondly, this man puts on a wild show, <a title="ill.Gates on Tour" href="http://illgates.com/tour/" target="_blank">so check his tour schedule</a> and find out when he&#8217;s going to be in your city.</p>

<p>Nobody, literally nobody does events quite like <strong><a href="http://redbullmusicacademyradio.com/" target="_blank">Red Bull Music Academy</a></strong>. Partly due to their enormous budget but also a lot to do with the people they have behind the scenes. I&#8217;ve made it to both Culture Clashes in London and both were insanely good.</p>
<p>For their next London event they are taking over the London Eye. Yeh. That enormous wheel by the river. They are doing 30 gigs, one in each pod, streaming all of it live, plus having a silent disco underneath it, where you can choose which pod you tune into. Yeh. Details <a href="http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/worldtour/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This time round though they rocked into Toronto and pitted  <strong>Zulu Nation </strong>vs.<strong> LuckyMe</strong> (<strong>Rustie, Hudson Mohawke, Lunice, plus special guest Just Blaze</strong>) vs. <strong>Mad Decent</strong> (<strong>South Rakkas Crew, Dillon Francis, Paul Devro, and DJ Sega</strong>) vs. <strong>Toronto All Stars (Lissa Monet, DJ Mensa, Lindo P, Starting From Scratch) </strong>against each other. The result is ridiculous! Check the stream below.</p>
<p>Who do you reckon won it?</p>

<p>This is your <strong>Daily 2% – Chilled and Ready to Serve</strong>. We will try to bring you one “chill” track every day. This is for when you get home and you are trying to unwind. You reach for that glass of wine or that unlit Black &#038; Mild or maybe you reach for something more herbal. This track is for those times. We are just your milkmen and I’m here to make a delivery. Chill…..</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s delivery is brought to you by Joker. This young UK producer never ceases to impress you with his releases. It&#8217;s amazing how consistently good his production is considering all of the influnces he is able to incorporate. He has announced the releases of his upcoming album, <em>The Visions, </em>and you&#8217;ll quickly hear influences from dubstep to trance, hip-hop, r&amp;b and grime. You&#8217;ll be able to pick up the album on October 31st. The track I&#8217;m bringing to you today is a little faster than the normal Daily 2% picks but it still definitely fits. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and its &#8220;chill&#8221; with a little influx of energy. Check out the track and chill&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Stream Only:</strong> <strong>Joker</strong> &#8211; Milky Way</p>
