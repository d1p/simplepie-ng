			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://northwestengland.pm.org/">NWE.pm</a>[1] Hackday Part Trois[2]</p>
<p>Once again, and for the third year running as the subtitle crudely suggests, the <a href="http://northwestengland.pm.org/">North West England Perl Mongers</a> will be having a hackday to complete work on open source projects.</p>
<p>The hackday is traditionally held at the <a href="http://www.shadow.cat">Shadowcat Systems</a> offices in Lancaster, though physical attendance is not absolutely required as we will also be inviting virtual attendance to help work on projects. To gather as many people as possible we have chosen two dates in November to potentially hold the hackday and if you visit: <a href="http://www.doodle.com/7hrfz29pyx28usi5">http://www.doodle.com/7hrfz29pyx28usi5</a> you can vote on which one we use (either the 19th or the 26th).</p>
<p>This year we have chosen to do some major revamping of two community projects, <a href="http://www.presentingperl.org/">Presenting Perl</a> will have a host of features added and <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">ironman.enlightenedperl.org</a> will complete its transition to all.things.per.ly and have a major overhaul of features and look. You can join in the discussion of these on the irc channels #presentingperl, #epo-ironman and #northwestengland.pm on irc.perl.org and on the wiki at <a href="http://www.nwewiki.markkeating.me.uk/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://www.nwewiki.markkeating.me.uk/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>.</p>
<p>The projects will be managed by Ian &#8216;idn&#8217; Norton (Ironman) and Jess &#8216;castaway&#8217; Robinson (Presenting Perl) who will decide on features, technology and place people on tasks.</p>
<p>If you would like to attend this event, either physically or virtually then make sure to use <a href="http://www.doodle.com/7hrfz29pyx28usi5">http://www.doodle.com/7hrfz29pyx28usi5</a> before Friday 7th October so we can choose the best date to suit the most people to attend. Once we have chosen the date we will put up an event listing so you can choose physical/virtual attendance so we can get an idea of numbers (so <a href="http://www.shadow.cat">Shadowcat</a> can buy the appropriate number of snacks and pizzas)[3].</p>
<p>[1] North West England Perl Mongers</p>
<p>[2] How could there be only two, and jumping straight to four would just be obtuse.</p>
<p>[3] Snacks, pizzas etc. will only be provided for those in physical attendance, virtual attendees will have to find their own bites[4].</p>
<p>[4] Bites/Bytes geddit?[5]</p>
<p>[5] <strong>Groan.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a personal reflection on the second and third day of the YAPC Europe 2011, it is not intended to be a guide to what was on or a significant critique of the event, it is just a personal journal).</p>
<h2>Day Two</h2>
<p>Day Two of YAPC was started by Alexei who quickly welcomed us all and then introduced Damian Conway who was talking about converting some of his Perl 5 modules to work with Perl 6. Damian is a witty, engaging and experienced speaker and it shows in his delivery style and the quality of his talk and slides. he makes the whole process of presenting look effortless. Of course, if you had attended his talk on presentations you would know that he had already practiced his talk at least three times in the week of the YAPC, that was an important lesson and it does help as it makes you confident and knowledgable about the flow of your talk. There were several other tricks that Damian gave in that presentation and if you get a chance to attend a lesson in Speaking I recommend you take it (though Damian would probably chase me with a recursive stick if I didn&#8217;t point out that there were five things to remember from his presentation and that knowing there were five was one of the five).</p>
<div id="attachment_1325" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1325" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/24/ye2011days-two-and-three/yapc21/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1325 " title="A Gaggle of Attendees" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/yapc21-300x120.jpg" alt="A Gaggle of Attendees" width="500" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Gaggle of Attendees</p></div>
<p>Damian&#8217;s central message was clear, he has been able to successfully update and/or reproduce some of his modules in Perl 5 in Perl 6 and it presented a learning process. He also had some excellent metaphors using popular sic-fi (which was lost on the likes of Tux and Smylers), to illustrate the relationship between Perl 5&#038;6 and CPAN (being a Star Wars fan more than a Trek fan i appreciated those gags the most).</p>
<h3>Mojo (not Jojo)</h3>
<p>I went to see Marcus talking on Mojolicious, this is a project that gives a different way of working in Perl and is an important project in bringing new people to Perl. My loss at this conference was in missing the Dancer talks as I wanted to hear more about this project as well as it is also a great new Perl project that is getting a lot of attention and support. Marcus gave a good introduction to the history and manner of Mojolicious and the way in which you can manage project development using the various tools and plugins.</p>
<h3>Mark Keating = marketing</h3>
<p>Then it was my talk. I was nervous giving my talk as it was the first time I had spoken about marketing since taking on my new role and I knew a lot of people were curious as to what I had done and where we are going. Hopefully I have started to show the way we need to take and that my message about all of us joining in was conveyed. Also I hope I gave enough praise to all those people (davorg, getty, Gabor, Ranguard, JJ, Barbie, Karen Pauley, Obra amongst others) who have already been doing a great job thus far. It is easy to look and say we need to do &#8220;x&#8221; or there should be more &#8220;y&#8221; but saying something and doing something are polar opposites and the people who have been chugging away at the mammoth task need to be held up and recognised as they are setting the high standard we all have to follow.</p>
<p>I received some feedback about my talk which was encouraging, also Josette and Marc Chantreaux (French Perler) asked if I could write out the talk so that it could be translated/used by non-native English speakers who would have some trouble understanding my accent and the fact that I talk a little too fast. Josette has offered to put the text on her blog (with me being a guest blogger) so you can expect there to be some rambling discursive in the near future, I promise not to be terse or concise as that would break a trend.</p>
<p>Once again I was involved in a number of conversations about marketing including talking to the members of Net-a-Porter &#8211; it is possible we may be able to put together an event using NAP and maybe one using LoveFilm in London in the near future. My conversation with NAP was about the big news of the day that I would be involved with by making sure the TPF site was uptodate at the time of the announcement (see below).</p>
<p>The Lightning Talks on day Two lived up to the fun of day one and again there were some announcements, the biggest of which was Karen announcing the generous donation of $10,000 (USD) to P5 CMF (Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund) by NAP. This was then surpassed (for me at least as I love these two people and if you do Perl in Europe you know and love them also) when Liz and Wendy announced they would also be giving $5,000 to this important project. The fund is in full swing now and hopefully we can maintain a pace of donations.</p>
<h3>Food and talk</h3>
<p>Today was the day of the attendees dinner and we went to the Ludo for some traditional and non-traditional Latvian food and drinks. Once again I managed to talk to lots of great people and got a quick word about next years QA Conference with Daxim and put forward my thoughts about the hosting and running of the event and how I might be able to help. QA is a great  conference/hackathon idea and needs a lot of support. In the Perl world we can now be a little blase about our testing culture as we have CPAN Testers who run tests on 23,000 modules, have passed over 14 million tests and I believe will pass/have passed 1 million tests in a single month (August). But our relaxed attitude is built on the strengths of events like QA and CPAN Testers and any event that promotes furthers that cause is worthwhile.</p>
<div id="attachment_1326" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1326" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/24/ye2011days-two-and-three/yapc22/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1326" title="Perl people take everything very seriously" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/yapc22-300x182.jpg" alt="Perl people take everything very seriously" width="300" height="182" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Perl people take everything very seriouslyq</p></div>
<p>The evening finished with me speaking to Barbie and JJ about Perl and life in general and then celebrating Getty&#8217;s news (as Community Manager for DDG) with Marcus and others.</p>
<h2>Day Three</h2>
<p>I skipped this mornings keynote, which is a shame as I really wanted to see it, but I also needed to talk to Josette, Wendy and Liz and to work out some writing I needed to do. I always feel bad going into someones talk and just ignoring them to do some writing, especially if it is someone I want to listen to as I feel I am doing two jobs badly (that&#8217;s not to say that I haven&#8217;t done that, but I really didn&#8217;t want to do it to Jesse!).</p>
<p>I managed to get myself sorted to go and listen to Matt speaking about DBIx::Class and in particular the current work to evolve the project. He did this by giving an overview of the whole history of Dbic so that the audience knew how and why the decisions that were made came to be.</p>
<div id="attachment_1327" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1327" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/24/ye2011days-two-and-three/yapc23/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1327" title="Matt talks on Dbic" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/yapc23-200x300.jpg" alt="Matt talks on Dbic" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt talks on Dbic</p></div>
<h3>Loving my Community</h3>
<p>After lunch I gave my second (third if we count my lightning talk on day one) talk of the conference. This time I was talking on how &#8220;I <3 my Community". I have presented this talk before at Perl Oasis and at NWE Technical Meeting, but I updated it for this conference. I may do a sequel to this talk as it is good fun and I think I can use a different anecdote and social model to talk about the community. It is also a chance to mention all the people that inspire me and I like and/or respect (and at this point I must shout "I <3 RIBASUSHI" and I hope he gets the message <img src='http://mdk.per.ly/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ).</p>
<p>Once my talks were done with I felt much more relaxed. Actually during my talk I was feeling quite chilled, I have done the talk twice previously, I liked the subject and I had done as Damian suggested and rehearsed at least three times and I felt "like a lion" (and now that's 4 of the things that I learned from him mentioned). I also didn't stand behind my laptop as a shield but moved about and held the stage (there we go, that's another).</p>
<h3>End times</h3>
<p>As the conference was heading to a close I was starting to feel a little mournful. I had attended a good number of talks, but I felt it was not enough. I had talked to a good number of people but I wished I had spoken to more. I did feel that I had made progress in my personal development and thinking about subjects, and been inspired by the people I had spoken to and this was very encouraging.</p>
<p>Soon it was time for the final set of lightning talks and as usual they were of a very high quality. During the talks we had several great announcements. Brian d. foy presented the White Camel awards to Andrew Shitov, Leo Lapworth and Daisuke Maki, Salve from Oslo Perl Mongers announced that this Monger group would be donating 1,000 euros to the P5 CMF. As with Net-A-Porter I had prior notice of this, from Salve, so was ready to retweet his live tweet on the subject and to put a small thanks on the front page of the TPF site. It is really amazing that another Perl Monger group have made a generous contribution to the fund.</p>
<div id="attachment_1328" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1328" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/24/ye2011days-two-and-three/yapc24/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1328" title="Matt's 'State of the Velociraptor' discusses vital things" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/yapc24-300x200.jpg" alt="Matt's 'State of the Velociraptor' discusses vital things" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt's 'State of the Velociraptor' discusses vital things</p></div>
<p>Matt rounded off the conference with another State of the Velociraptor talk on the events happening in the Perl 5 world and was followed across the Atlantic by several soft toys that were once again used as projectiles.</p>
<h2>Ending&#8230;</h2>
<p>After the event it was time to say goodbye to Riga, I didn&#8217;t go to the after conference drinking as I needed to get some rest and put some thoughts down on paper. I did however manage to have a good meal with some of the other attendees, so thanks to Ribasushi, Ilmari, JJL, MST and Getty for joining me at dinner.</p>
<p>A big round of thanks should be given to the conference organisers, Andrew Shitov &#8211; Dan Makarov &#8211; Alex Kapranov &#8211; Dmitry Karasik &#8211; Sergey Zhavoronkov &#8211; for putting on a truly great event. This year saw a good number of new attendees along with a lot of familiar faces and it was good to be a part of it. Now we have a year to wait and prepare for the fun and excitement that will be YAPC::EU::2012::Frankfurt.</p>
<div id="attachment_1329" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1329" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/24/ye2011days-two-and-three/yapc25/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1329" title="Frankfurt 2012" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/yapc25-300x200.jpg" alt="Frankfurt 2012" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Frankfurt 2012</p></div>

<p>I arrived early on Day One and was greeted by the usual long conference queue for registration and sign-up. That was fun to view and I grabbed a sticker from one of the people already signed up and hand wrote my name onto it so that I wouldn&#8217;t have to instantly sign in and could do it later.</p>
<p>Andrew Shitov started the ball rolling by welcoming us all to the conference and then introducing the next year&#8217;s YAPC::EU winners.</p>
<p>Well you probably all know by now that next years YAPC::EU will be held in the wonderful city of Frankfurt in Germany, sorry that Sofia lost out but also slightly pleased as it is closer and I know many people who will be able to make it just because of the central location. Hopefully Sophia will once again bid and get this event at a future date.</p>
<div id="attachment_1302" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1302" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/16/ye2011day-one/img_3001/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1302" title="YAPC::EU::2012 orgas receive their kickstart donation" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/IMG_3001-300x200.jpg" alt="YAPC::EU::2012 orgas receive their kickstart donation" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">YAPC::EU::2012 orgas receive their kickstart donation</p></div>
<p>I saw Larry&#8217;s keynote, he spoke on modernism and post-modernism and in respect to that he mentioned Architecture, Music, Literature and I love art. Larry was being wonderfully discursive and used a lot of individual perspectives on those areas and punctuated his talk with many great pictures of Riga and started a meme about Piranha Ducks. It has been a couple of years since I saw a keynote from Larry and it is nice to know that this one will vary so much from his OSCON and YAPC::NA talks that it is worth seeking out recordings of those.</p>
<p>Matt gave an interesting talk on Philosophy and documentation and I managed to see a great talk on HTML 5 before lunch.</p>
<p>At lunch I was talking to Barbie about the CPAN Testers and catching up with him and then JJ (Jon Allen) found me with an apology for not being in touch as he has been very busy with moving house so hasn&#8217;t been able to catch up, added to that I think I was bouncing into his Spam box with my messages. JJ and I then went and found a quiet space and we, well I say we it was mostly JJ, went and further updated the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org">TPF website</a> which is now looking much shinier and JJ also updated the small style changes I wanted into the other sites so we have a consistency of design.</p>
<div id="attachment_1304" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1304" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/08/16/ye2011day-one/img_3018/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1304" title="Wes Johnson gives his first talk and is up first" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/08/IMG_3018-300x201.jpg" alt="Wes Johnson gives his first talk and is up first" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wes Johnson gives his first talk and is up first</p></div>
<p>The Lightning Talks were the usual fun, I was up third after Wes Johnson, who was giving his first ever talk at a Perl Conference and was up in front of everyone as first LT speaker, he was very nervous but delivered an excellent presentation on the GCI. So a future speaker is born, I hope he comes back with a longer talk for next year or maybe he can be persuaded to run the effort for GCI next year.</p>
<p>My Lightning talk was on An Armful of Announcements. Firstly I spoke about the GSoC and in particular how the efforts of rafl, the students and the mentors (with particular reference on the organisational efforts of rafl) have resulted in a 100% success for us this year. Then I spoke on <a href="http://www.send-a-newbie.enlightenedperl.org/">Send-A-Newbie</a> and the efforts for this year and next year, I mentioned the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2011/">London Perl Workshop </a>and the plans to do more training at the event and finally spoke about the need for people to start a grass roots movement to <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/press_releases">distribute flyers</a> and material about Perl that I will be continuing this year.</p>

<p>One of the best, and most controversial it seems, Lightning Talks was Dave Cross&#8217; wonderful A Modest Proposal. DC was nicely running a Swiftian satire on the state of the Perlverse, it was fun for me as he used the marketing-&gt;Mark Keating transformation and the great line &#8220;Say no to marketing and say yes to Perl Masons&#8221;. The notion that we go underground and run hidden Perl clubs is so much fun and nicely acts as the antithesis to what we should really be doing. So Swift-The Masons-Fight Club all nicely mocked and homaged.</p>
<p>After this I had a few more conversations with Karen, Abigail and Ribasushi and then headed back to the hotel to do some $work, some TPF matters and to rehearse my talk for the next day.</p>
<p>I also posted some<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29379919@N07/sets/72157627440577026/"> images from the conference here on Flickr</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Caution this post may contain personal opinion, emotional choice and  some casually rambling rhetoric, a longer version can be found at <a href="http://www.markkeating.me.uk/2011/08/07/do-what-thou-wilt/">http://www.markkeating.me.uk/2011/08/07/do-what-thou-wilt/</a>)</p>
<p>I  was asked, online in Twitter(1) by a friend (@techpractical is their   twitter ident) if I would support their efforts to form a LGBT.pm. @techpractical had decided that Perl  needed a specific group to represent these people, the .pm groups are traditionally regional matters but there are  precedents for their being other types of groups as shown by the  drinkers.pm and Dahut.pm groups amongst others.</p>
<p>My initial response via Twitter  (scroll to  the end of the article for the tweets) was to clearly state that there  were precedents for having groups that were not location based but based  on identity or lifestyle so I had to support that. That is when I hit  the usual &#8217;140 characters is not nearly long enough for a good response&#8217;  as it seemed a cold response. I sounded as if I supported a general  concept based on the fact that there was historical bias. I wasn&#8217;t. I  was trying to indicate that we had a good case for it in the first part  and that identity based Monger groups already existed. The Perl  community supports at least two identity based Monger groups to my  knowledge. There is the infamous &#8216;drinkers.pm&#8217; who meet at  conferences and troll the bars after the event has finished, in this way  they do become a geographical group when they meet but they are  divergent otherwise. Then there is &#8216;Dahut.pm&#8217; who organised the 2011  YAPC::NA conference and are comprised mostly of organisers. I could also  mention that unlike most other groups my own northwestengland.pm covers  a whole region and not just a city due to the diversity of locations we  all reside in.</p>
<p>So in my very next tweet I mentioned that the  subject needed support and that this would be a good way of showing the  support for equality in our community. Though I should still relate that I have a concern that  we might appear to be over politicising the Monger groups and a  distributed community of interest is not the place to create communities  and pseudo communities based on identity. One could respond that it  is impossible to remove identity from community and that we already  share these things and it is why and how we form such close bonds. One  could equally argue that this is just a feature of similar interest not  identity or lifestyle choice which is arguably what this group would  be.</p>
<p>However, I am not opposed to there being  some political stance, this isn&#8217;t about posturing or forcing people to  accept that stance it is about recognising it exists. We have a  community that has members who clearly identify with this issue, some of  us live in a society and mix in cultures that classifies these people  with derogatory labels, reduces their rights and in some locales  criminalises their behaviour. If we are to allow people the right to  form groups that have a similarity based upon the worship of that sweet  nectar we call alcohol we have to allow groups that identify themselves  with mythical beasts amongst other ways. It is progressive to be  inclusive and not exclusive, it is also a natural evolution of a  community, from a community of interest to one that shares identity and  celebrates individuality and the choices of it&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>So when asked to support  lifestyle choice, and the freedom to express and to encourage  participation based on identity then I have to support it.</p>
<p>-mdk</p>
<p>Post Scriptum: The request was officially accepted and there is indeed now a LGBT.pm (<a href="http://www.pm.org/groups/757.html">http://www.pm.org/groups/757.html</a>)</p>

<p><strong>shadowcat_mdk:</strong><br />
@techpractical  we have groups such as Dahut.pm and drinkers.pm, it is established that  some groups are identity not location. I support it.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been at a Perl conference in Europe or North America in the past few years, and more specifically if you have been an organiser of a Perl conference then you will have an Act login and will have encountered this system.</p>
<h2>What is <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a>?</h2>
<p>Well its creators describe <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a> as &#8220;<a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a> (A Conference Toolkit) is a multilingual, template-driven, multi-conference web site that can manage the users, talks, schedule and payment for your conference&#8221;. What it is for organisers is a Godsend, it successfully manages just about everything a conference organiser needs and it is styleable via template. Added to this the managers and creators of Act are helpful and professional and make the experience of managing a conference a lot easier.</p>
<h2>Well that&#8217;s good then</h2>
<p>It is good, though of course as good as Act is there are things that could be better. During this years YAPC::NA some of the attendees had a discussion to talk about how the system could be improved. Take note, this wasn&#8217;t that the existing system had a fault, it was that the needs of organisers has evolved along with the management of projects. They were looking for ways to improve a good system and modernise it to make a great system.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The first step was to move the existing code to Github which would allow an easier community integration, this has now been done and is found at:<a href="https://github.com/book/Act"> https://github.com/book/Act</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a list of currently requested issues: <a href="https://github.com/book/Act/issues">https://github.com/book/Act/issues</a>, that you can read and add to or comment upon.</p>
<p>Remember that this is being maintained by the community and if you would like to contribute you can do so by joining the mailing list, for users (<a href="http://listes.mongueurs.net/mailman/listinfo/act">http://listes.mongueurs.net/mailman/listinfo/act</a>) and developers (<a href="http://listes.mongueurs.net/mailman/listinfo/act-dev">http://listes.mongueurs.net/mailman/listinfo/act-dev</a>), and by helping to fix code, develop new code and expand the existing (unfortunately slightly sparse) documentation.</p>
<p>Act is provided free to use and is a brilliant project written in Perl but available to the open source community, it has been used to power non Perl events such as the OSDC and the Dynamic Languages Conference. There are a number of ways in which you can help further the cause so if you have the tuits come along and join in.</p>
<p>1. Though, I feel this title should be more the Achieving the Zen of Organisation as it concerns using Act to achieve this aim, the Act of&#8230; seemed so much nicer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am writing this post as I sit in the <a href="http://theyorkshirehouse.co.uk/">Yorkshire House</a> (and then later as I edit and add to it at home) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Lancashire">Lancaster</a> after just attending the <a href="http://northwestengland.pm.org/">North West England Perl Mongers</a> meeting in which two wonderful makers(2) demonstrated their <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">3D printer</a> at the <a href="http://www.shadow.cat">Shadowcat</a> offices.</p>
<p>The two people in question are the wonderful <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/theorbtwo">theorbtwo</a> (James Mastros) and huggable <a href="http://desert-island.me.uk/~castaway/web/index.html">Castaway</a> (Jess Robinson).(3) They have a fork of the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">RepRap</a> machine (in fact this is a <a href="http://shapercube.com/start/index">Shaper Cube</a> variant), done in a shiny aluminum, which they are using to make items are also buildings a service so that you can upload and create items and they will ship it to you, cottage industry for the 21st century.</p>
<p>I am not going to talk too much about the presentation here as there was a video and as soon as that is processed there will be a link to it, there are a few pictures though and you can view them below. The night was cool, with Jess and James (who spoke the most) giving an interesting and informative introduction to the 3D printing world, the device they use and its evolution and the software they manipulate it with. They then spoke about how they are building a web service (link to be provided when I have one <img src='http://mdk.per.ly/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  )to order custom one-off items on, then the fun part where we got a hands on practical demonstration.</p>

<p>(1) For the unitiated a Nerpie is a word I created and have been using to describe an enthusiast about something. Their enthusiasm seems like obsession of the true nerd kind, but in fact it is not. They attend conventions and indulge in passions and they may be individual and dress up occasionally in costumes at dress balls. But they don&#8217;t walk around the convention as their favourite character for the entire time. They have memorabilia but it is on a shelf gathering dust not categorised and kept unloved and unplanned with in it s original package. They are not OCD enough to care that they know every detail of something, but they like to know a heck of a lot more than the general shape. These are the nerpies and their numbers are vast.</p>
<p>(2) I call them makers but they are boffins at heart, they are the gentle, loveable crackpots who emerge from sheds blinking into the light giggling and holding a floating car being driven by the cat. They are our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_Wallis">Wallis&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbage">Babbages</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing">Turings</a>, embrace them as they murble gently at you, they are going to shape the future.</p>
<p>(3) you can of course interchange those adjectives.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth year that I have dived head first into organising the London Perl Workshop (The UK&#8217;s Perl Workshop) and the first in which I am writing this type of post before the official launch of the site. Why is that i hear you call&#8230;</p>
<p>It is because I love our sponsors.[1]</p>
<h2>A little history&#8230;</h2>
<p>The London Perl Workshop (LPW) which is really the UK Perl Workshop (UKPW) has been supported for many years by the kind donations of a small pool of dedicated sponsors and by the generous hosting of the event by the University of Westminster.</p>
<p>Due to the shift in the UK economic scene and in particular the change in University management and funding there is now no ability for the Department to host our event for zero cost, until now we have been an extra in their normal budget as they sought to support the local community. Last year we were informed it was likely to be the final year of free sponsorship, this year that came true. Sean, our contact and eternal friend at the university, has managed to secure us a generous discount for rooms but we must still provide funds to cover the hiring.</p>
<h2>My Plan&#8230;</h2>
<p>So, before I started to work on dates, website and associated paraphernalia this year I approached the previous year&#8217;s sponsors and did a call for the date and a shout for new sponsors. I also offered sponsors the chance to brand and be associated with specific elements of the day.[2] I have received a generous response which was helped by people bringing me new sponsors (I love you all) to help with the event.</p>
<p>So much so that the majority of costs are covered&#8230;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet launched the site, or done the first of the regular news letters or called for speakers and we have a pretty much paid for event. You have to love these sponsors.  And with that in mind let me introduce you to them,[3] and let you know what they have provided the event with.</p>
<h3>antibodyMX</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1206" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/ablogo/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1206" title="ablogo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/ablogo.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="111" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Evening Sponsors (Beer and Food)</strong></em></p>
<p>Not a year goes by without Martin of antibodyMX jumping up and shouting that he will organise the event location for the evening beer and food and that his company will put in the first part of the sponsorship. This year is no different. antibodyMX provide a quality service which is not just sponsoring drinking at community events <img src='http://mdk.per.ly/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . It wouldn&#8217;t be a conference without them.</p>
<p>antibodyMX is a hosted antispam and antivirus email filtering service based entirely on a proven open source platform, Perl being one very important component. Users of the platform see a near-instant, near-total reduction in the amount of spam, phishing and malware content arriving at the mail server.  We offer a free 30 day trial of the service to new customers.  Please email info@antibodyMX.net for more information.</p>
<h3>Booking.com</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1208" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/booking-logo/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1208 aligncenter" title="booking-logo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/booking-logo.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="129" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Sponsored Lecture Theatre 2, Evening Sponsors (Beer and Food)</strong></em></p>
<p>Booking.com are synonymous with sponsoring and the Perl community, it seems that almost every event has them as a major sponsor and contributor. They are passionate about using Perl and returning value to the community. Once again it is a pleasure to have them with us.</p>
<p>Booking.com B.V., part of Priceline.com (Nasdaq:PCLN), owns and operates Booking.com(TM), one of the world&#8217;s leading online hotel reservations companies by room nights sold, attracting over 30 million unique visitors each month via the Internet from both leisure and business markets worldwide.</p>
<p>Established in 1996, Booking.com B.V. guarantees the best prices for any type of property, ranging from small independent hotels to five star luxuries. The Booking.com website is available in 43 languages and offers over 135,000 hotels in 101 countries with more than 40 offices worldwide.</p>
<h3>Bytemark</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1209" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/bytemark/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1209 aligncenter" title="bytemark" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/bytemark.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="56" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Marketing Sponsor, Lecture Theatre 1</strong></em></p>
<p>During my tenure as the organiser of this event I have been able to rely on Bytemark for their consistent support, this year was no different in fact they surpassed themselves by being sponsors of the main lecture theatre and the marketing budget. I really have few words to thank them enough, and they do this without hesitation as firm supporters of a community.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1207" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/bigv_logo/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1207 alignleft" title="bigv_logo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/bigv_logo.gif" alt="" width="158" height="75" /></a>Many of you are aware of Bytemark&#8217;s standing as a quality server service aimed at the technical market along with the browsing populace, but you might not know that they are soon to provide a very new service (hosting platform) and you can get in (and bring Perl with you) on the ground level. I know these guys, if we get Perl being used on their service they will work with us to do fun and excellent things with it, check it out at: <a href="http://bigv.io/">http://bigv.io/</a>.</p>
<p>At Bytemark we are the UK&#8217;s geek hosting outfit of choice, managing tens of thousands of domains, and thousands of servers, both dedicated and virtual. Since 2000 we&#8217;ve offered root access from fifteen pounds per month so that experts like you write their own code and have it run well, on a well-maintained network, without paying for more than you need. We can help you with sorting virtualisation, IPv6, migrating from virtual to dedicated and plenty of other difficult topics.</p>
<h3>Enlightened Perl Organisation</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1210" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/epo-lpw-logo/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1210" title="epo-lpw-logo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/epo-lpw-logo.png" alt="" width="302" height="84" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Business Services (Organisation)</strong></em></p>
<p>When you organise a conference that involves sponsors, the payment of funds and the tracking of these for the purposes of UK tax law there are one of two ways you can do it. You can do it as an individual but be prepared to pay tax on the purchases and  on your new found status as &#8216;being paid&#8217; or you can use an organisation like the EPO who support the community and will handle all these details for you in a nice, timely and legal fashion.</p>
<p>Once again the EPO have stepped in to help manage the everyday proper handling of sponsorship and payments.</p>
<p>The Enlightened Perl Organisation is dedicated to the promotion of Perl (in particular Raptor Perl or Perl 5) as a production language that is suited to an enterprise environment.</p>
<h3>Exonetric</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1211" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/exonetric/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211" title="exonetric" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/exonetric.png" alt="" width="150" height="28" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Coffee Morning</strong></em></p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s conference the wonderful chaps at Exonetric provided us with a coffee, teas, soft drinks and a generous number of excellent cupcakes. They have leapt at the chance to do so again this year and I will not be alone in smiling broadly at that news.</p>
<p>Exonetric Consulting Ltd is a UK based specialist in FreeBSD hosting, offering both individual jails and managed or unmanaged systems on dedicated hardware. In addition we provide colocation services in our London datacentre and are also able to offer assistance with capacity planning and recommendations for best-fit software components for larger systems. Our FreeBSD jails provide a great value, low-cost platform for hosting or developing Perl services and applications.</p>
<h3>Magnum Solutions</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1213" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/moonfruitlogo_large/"></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-1212" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/magnum/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1212" title="magnum" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/magnum-300x80.png" alt="" width="300" height="80" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Dave Cross-  Training Course</strong></em></p>
<p>Like the legend of the Ravens at the tower there is Dave Cross and the LPW. If we have to we shall nail him to a plank of wood and call him the Norwegian Dave. He is almost the institution and each year he surpasses himself by delivering high quality training (which he is commercially well known and regarded for) to the conference for no cost except to support the community he is a leader in. Once again, thank you Dave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Moonfruit</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1213" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/moonfruitlogo_large/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1213" title="MoonfruitLogo_large" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/MoonfruitLogo_large-300x80.png" alt="" width="300" height="80" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Evening Sponsors (Principal) (Beer and Food), Room 2 Sponsors</strong></em></p>
<p>Joining us for the first time this year and in such a generous fashion are the good people at Moonfruit. They have leapt in to be a principal sponsor for the evenings festivities and to sponsor the whole of Room 2. We hope this is the start of a great relationship between the community and Moonfruit.</p>
<p>Moonfruit is a London based team of developers, designers and entrepreneurs who are passionate about great design, great products and supporting small businesses, startups and design communities.</p>
<p>90% of Moonfruit’s customers are small businesses who want to build sites, their way. They expect a higher level of design tools to help build better designed sites for their customers. It is the no.1 hosted website builder in the UK and is growing rapidly in the rest of the world. A third of its users are in the US. Over 3.4 million sites have been built using their software</p>
<p>The software allows users, with no previous web design experience, to design and build sites optimized for web and mobile. Users customize the style and layout of their site so that it reflects their personal brand without having to understand any coding, HTML or CSS providing total design control for everyone.</p>
<p>The software features unique drag and drop tools allow literal design by users. Website features, like forums, shopping basket or social media integration, can be added from internal libraries or external sources. Moonfruit provides a variety of packages to suit users including free, standard and business premium subscriptions. The Moonfruit software uses Perl at its core.</p>
<h3>O’Reilly</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1214" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/oreilly/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1214" title="o'reilly" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/oreilly-300x79.png" alt="" width="300" height="79" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Book Sponsorship/Lanyards</strong></em></p>
<p>You mention Perl and O&#8217;Reilly together in one sentence and most people will think of a Camel. I do not. I think of the wonderful Josette and the fact that like Dave Cross a UK Perl event seems kind of wrong if she isn&#8217;t there. Each year Josette carts a good number of books into London to provide us with tasty treats to tempt our wallets and this year we see new Perl books on the O&#8217;Reilly shelves with new edition (revised and updated) of classic texts. I cannot wait for the event now as I will get to see Josette again</p>
<h3>Shadowcat Systems</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1215" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/shadowcat/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1215" title="shadowcat" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/shadowcat-300x81.png" alt="" width="300" height="81" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Sponsor Mark Keating (Organisation),</strong> <strong>Evening Sponsorship (Beer and Food)</strong></em></p>
<p>Without Shadowcat I would not have the time and funds to manage the organisational task that is the LPW, they are my constant guide to support, promote and aid me if anything goes awry and they love the community (we really do, PIMC).</p>
<p>Shadowcat Systems is a developer, sponsor of, and contributor to open source software projects including Catalyst, the elegant web framework, and DBIx::Class, an object-orientated database abstraction library. Shadowcat provides consultancy, training and support for these projects; systems management and automation; the design and implementation of network architecture; the development of proprietary and open source custom web applications; and offers Perl refactoring and project crisis management.<br />
Shadowcat Systems are based in the United Kingdom but we deliver solutions to a global community of clients via onsite supervision along with traditional and internet based communications.</p>
<h3>SureVOIP</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1227" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/surevoip_logo/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1227" title="surevoip_logo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/surevoip_logo.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Room 1 (With UK2)</strong></em></p>
<p>SureVoip are a business focused VOIP service with a strong dedication to providing &#8220;Open Telecoms for Business&#8221;. This is the first time they have sponsored the LPW directly though they were involved with us last year and we welcome them as they sponsor room 1 with UK2.</p>
<h3>UK2.Net</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1228" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/uk2-logo-new-rgbmaster/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1228" title="UK2-logo-NEW-RGBmaster" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/UK2-logo-NEW-RGBmaster-300x62.png" alt="" width="300" height="62" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Room 1 (with SureVoip), Training Room, Evening Sponsorship (Beer and Food)</strong></em></p>
<p>Another new sponsor to the London Perl Workshop this year is UK2.net, and like Moonfruit they decided to give us a generous fund to start their association with our event. Sponsoring the training room, a room with SureVoip and contributing funds towards the evenings food and drink (which I believe will now match the wonderful event we had last year). It is great to welcome them on board for this year.</p>
<p>UK2.net likes Perl, our entire platform is based on it, helping us to service hundreds of thousands of customers enjoying some of the best pricing for domains, web hosting and dedicated servers out there. We&#8217;ve been one of the largest players in the industry since 1998 and we&#8217;ve just launched a new VPS service allowing you to buy resources and launch as many smaller VPS as you wish on our cloud. These have auto failover, root access, an external console and loads more goodies for just £8.95 a month.  No need to tell you this is ideal for dev environments where you need to kill and redeploy your server in an instant. The platform even allows you to create your own virtual machine templates or choose from one of our instantly deployable stacks. Not bad for less than a tenner.</p>
<h3>University of Westminster</h3>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1216" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/07/06/london-perl-workshop-2011-sponsors/westminster_logo/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1216" title="westminster_logo" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/07/westminster_logo-300x35.png" alt="" width="300" height="35" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Hosts, Sean Tohill (Organisation)</strong></em></p>
<p>It is a complex and evolutionary time for UK Universities and one in which the boundaries of their operational existence must change. it is unfortunate that this means we have to find more sponsorship to cover room costs (though this was benefited by us attracting some awesome sponsors), however we were still given a generous discount.</p>
<p>Then there is Sean who has supported us for many years and gives his time and effort into securing appropriate dates, rooms and running as an interface buffer between us and the university. Again, for me Sean is a staple part of the LPW buffet and one that I look forward to each year. This year will be no different I am sure.</p>
<p>[1] This is a purely platonic thing don&#8217;t get any strange ideas.</p>
<p>[2] Lesson 1: never underestimate how many sponsors are wiling to sponsor beer <img src='http://mdk.per.ly/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce that this year the <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org">Enlightened Perl Organisation</a> will be sending two people to the <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/">YAPC::EU::2011</a> in Riga, Latvia. The two awardees are: Moritz Onken and Manzur Mukhitdinov.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://send-a-newbie.enlightenedperl.org">Send A Newbie initiative</a> was started in 2009 by Edmund Von Der Burg and has been organised by the Enlightened Perl Organisation under the auspicious gaze of Mark Keating since then. The aim of the initiative is to sponsor people to attend a YAPC who might otherwise not be financially able to attend and who have never attended a YAPC previously.</p>
<p>The initiative attempts to cover as much of the funds as possible and this year we are able to fully refund all flights and accommodation for the two awardees. If you see Moritz or Manzur at the event be sure to welcome them to their first YAPC with a smile, a hug and if possible a frothing mug of ale <img src='http://mdk.per.ly/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>As last year <a href="http://www.shadow.cat">Shadowcat Systems</a> will be providing the conference tickets as part of its Sponsorship package of the YAPC.</p>
<p>The initiative is now ended for this year and I would like to personally thank all of those people who contributed both corporate and individual, and to the organisations, organisers and volunteers who support it. The initiative will restart in September and begin the process of raising funds for next year&#8217;s YAPC::EU::2012.</p>
<p>For now, I hope to see you all in Latvia.</p>
<p>-mdk</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Marco Fontani and I decided last year that what Scotland needed was a conference to call its own that would be organised by a Perl person[1]. This decision was made over a jar or two of a comfortable real pop in a local Edinburgh hostelry. Marco, who is the leader of <a href="http://glasgow.pm.org">Glasgow.pm</a> and a keen programmer, was keen to help organise the event as there was a lack of lead volunteers at the time and he enlisted me to aid him as I had started the original conversation and am the organiser of the <a href="http://www.londonperlworkshop.org.uk">London Perl Workshop</a>[2].</p>
<p>So, after a brief bout of cogitation, deliberation and the usual exasperation the <a href="http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk">Dynamic Languages Conference </a>was born. Since then we have been hard at work securing both a venue, sponsorship and have aligned ourselves with the <a href="http://www.turingfestival.com">Turing Festival</a> to bring this event to life. Tonight I mailed a number of lists with the first mail out which is copied after this introduction. If you know of a list, a mail group, a Bulletin Board[3] where this text might be posted I would be honoured if you would post it for me.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/">Dynamic Languages Conference </a>is aimed at any dynamic language be it Perl, Python, Ruby (including Rails), PhP, Javascript etc., and not just one language. Our aim is to be inclusive not exclusive. If you belong, use or want to know more about these languages this may be the conference for you.</p>
<p>As always, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>-mdk</p>
<p>[1] The original concept was a Perl type event and then we moved on to the idea of having a more inclusive event based around the whole of the OSS sphere.</p>
<p>[2] It seems I am also a giant dupe as I fell for organising something once again.</p>
<p>[3] Yes, they do still exist.</p>
<h2>Mail Out</h2>
<p><em><strong>[Please copy from the following line to the end]</strong></em></p>
<p>The Dynamic Languages Conference has officially opened its website to  registrations at <a href="http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/">http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Languages Conference (26th-27th August) is a new, free of  charge, event held in Edinburgh to coincide with the parent festival,  the Turing Festival (<a href="http://www.turingfestival.com/">http://www.turingfestival.com</a>, 26th-28th August)  which is the European Festival of Digital Culture and Technology  (EFDCT), an official part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the world&#8217;s  greatest cultural and artistic event. Dynamic Languages Conference has  been sponsored by a number of organisations.</p>
<p>The conference is aimed at bringing the Open Source Dynamic Languages  together at one event where they can discuss in an open forum and  compare the various methods they employ to achieve similar goals. We  welcome people from any of the Dynamic Languages such as Perl, Ruby  (including the Rails community), Python, PhP, Javascript etc., our goal  is inclusion and sharing of experience and approach.</p>
<p>This year we are seeking speakers to talk on one of two subjects:</p>
<p>Dynamic Language and Application Development for the Internet which will  be the Friday track;</p>
<p>Dynamic Languages and System Administration which is the Saturday Track.</p>
<p>This event, Dynamic Languages, is free though you will need to register  to obtain a ticket to the whole of the event. The parent festival  (Turing Festival) which runs over the same period has also launched its  site and invites people to attend for a modest fee.</p>
<p>We are seeking speakers to attend the festival and they can also  register and submit talks through our website at  <a href="http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/">http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk</a>. There will be guest speakers talking  at both the Dynamic Languages and Turing Festival. We are pleased to  announce that the well known Richard Stallman will be our guest of  honour and will speak at both the Dynamic Languages and the Turing  Festival event.</p>
<p>If you do not have an Act account already please use the new user link  to register for this event, Act only keeps your details for conference  registration with other Act events it is not used for any other purpose  or passed to a third party, you can then submit a talk or make your  conference schedule when we publish. The closing date for talks is  Friday 29th July and the Schedule will be released on Monday 8th August.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Languages event will be held in the magnificent Surgeon&#8217;s  Hall on the Friday (26th August), and the Informatics Building on the  Saturday (27th August).</p>
<p>The Dynamic Languages event has been originally organised by members of  the Glasgow and NorthWestEngland Perl Mongers groups though we are  seeking help/support from any other open source language group, if you  are a member of such a group, or a leader then we would be happy to hear  from you and to work with you to invite your community to this event. We  are still seeking keynote speakers who may be able to gain sponsorship  to the event.</p>
<p>Please submit this to all mailing lists, user groups or message boards  that you know of or to any interested parties. If you have an idea for a  small event to be run in conjunction to this event, such as a hackathon  or BoF then please contact Mark or Marco who will be happy to try and  work with you to achieve this.</p>

<p>Before we begin I just wish to state that I haven&#8217;t gone insane I just have channeled the spirit of Baden Powell and am working in advance so that we can function efficiently later this year. So I am proud to present to you the current working copy of the Google Summer of Code flyer for Perl projects next year (and in fact this can be used in subsequent years).</p>
<h2>Choosing the look</h2>
<p>I would like to note a few of the decisions that affected the design:</p>
<p>1. The Google Logo is not released for usage, Google vigorously protect their brand image and don&#8217;t authorise its usage even in pargtner events such as the GSoC, unique branding is usually created for that purpose. For this reason I chose a similar but not same as font for the text and made no attempt to use the colour look;</p>
<p>2. Because of the above Google usually create a different logo/branding for each year&#8217;s GSoC, this year for instance has a faint Tron Legacy feel to it. This means that a standard look cannot be applied to any visual elements that will fit into the yearly theme, yet we must promote early if we are to increase the number of people who are aware of the scheme and wish to participate in it on behalf of Perl;</p>
<p>3. Any colours had to be evocative to the subject yet also be in keeping with the other logo elements that would be eventually placed upon the page;</p>
<p>4. Any block text had to be succinct and short, to grab attention and to ease in the translation.</p>
<p>The final poster looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1172" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 415px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1172" href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/06/21/gsoc-next-years-flyer/english-pages-basic-2/"><img class="size-large wp-image-1172  " title="GSoC Perl Flyer for 2012+" src="http://mdk.per.ly/files/2011/06/english-pages-basic1-563x800.jpg" alt="GSoC Perl Flyer for 2012+" width="405" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">GSoC Perl Flyer for 2012+</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">In Other Words&#8230;</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we now come to the task that the worldwide Perl community can help me with. In order to get as many prospective students onto the program for Perl in 2012 we will need to do two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. The poster will need to be translated in to other languages to spread the message, although a good level of English is usually found amongst computer programmers/students it is still good to spread the marketing word in the local languuage. So if you can translate the simple text on this flyer then please contact me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. I will need volunteers who are willing to print a few flyers off and distribute them at schools/colleges/universities by using mailing boards, pigeon holes and putting them on desks/buses if needed. So if you are a member of a local PM group, or a Perl person who can do this then please contact me so that I can build a list of people and places we are distributing to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks in advance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-mdk</p>
