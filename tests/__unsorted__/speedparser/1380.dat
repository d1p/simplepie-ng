It comes out as a mist in an airisole can. LIKEEE a super super fine foggy mist. &lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice hold, doesnt leave it feeling too sticky, and overly matifying the hair, but you would need to still set it with a hairspray like any other wax, paste product. &lt;br /&gt;It also has a finishing touch to it similar to bedhead masterpiece hairspray in a way that it does have a suble shining complex (like a shine/oil spray would give).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANDDDDD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://x4a.xanga.com/ef7f87e530233279036338/b222279111.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x4a.xanga.com/ef7f87e530233279036338/z222279111.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="300" alt="mikey" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why is Mikey so cute??&lt;br /&gt;He reminds me so much of a cute toy bobble head. aaawwwiiieee&lt;br /&gt;de de de de deeeeee</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/755426342/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Wednesday, September 21, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/755154727/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/755154727/item/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 03:54:46 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/6f48e278922662/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x6f.xanga.com/48ee113b37532278922662/z222188372.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="350" alt="DSC03942" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My littllee puppppyyy ready for halloweeeen!!!</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/755154727/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Thursday, September 01, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754736400/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754736400/item/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 11:04:13 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/0c088278638637/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x0c.xanga.com/088e056517c34278638637/z221953406.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="150" alt="w-english-herringbone-s-f11" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/78c86278638638/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x78.xanga.com/c86e336537c34278638638/z221953407.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="150" alt="W-Navy-Canvas-S" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/6be43278638639/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x6b.xanga.com/e43e3765d7c34278638639/z221953408.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="150" alt="W-Red-Canvas-S" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased these Toms. &lt;br /&gt;I really wasnt going to get the red, But i dont really own any red shoes so go figure.&lt;br /&gt;:] &lt;br /&gt;</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754736400/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Monday, August 29, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754666477/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754666477/item/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2011 22:59:50 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/82ae2278602878/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x82.xanga.com/ae2e346322d34278602878/z221923898.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" height="200" alt="marimo in jar" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 10 marimos on a bulk sale on ebay!&lt;br /&gt;Along with that! I've purchased a jars. and I will buy cute gravel and decoration shit later to make it look cute.&lt;br /&gt;talk about expensive.... They marimos were $33 dollars, and the jars were $7.36 each. Thats with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that photo above is just something i found on google images, and the marimo balls i've purchase are a little on the bigger and fatter side... it might even take up like 70% of the jar.... OH WELL, ALL IN EFFORT... I'll make sure it looks cute. I even messaged the seller if he was able to send me the smaller sized marimos...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be re-gifted too people I think are most importent! LETS SEE WHICH 9 (ones for myself) will recieve it! :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT AUG 30:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought like 12 more marimos... but there the extra small ones... I also found a site for bulk sale glass jars.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THESE EXTRAS?!??!?!! sell them maybe???</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754666477/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Sunday, August 28, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754594421/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754594421/item/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2011 07:33:31 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://okchristiney.xanga.com/photos/3d0a5278575146/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://x3d.xanga.com/0a5f8a6759632278575146/z221900433.jpg" style=" border-width: 0px;" width="300" alt="IMG_1132(3)" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really need to use my camera more often.

A young pure love that will never again be experienced as I feel my woman hood kicking in. &lt;br /&gt;There will be new loves to be witnessed, and ill probably find someone ill love unconditionally, &lt;br /&gt;But its like saying a young child and their parent, or an older child a a step parent.&lt;br /&gt;to love just because you can, or to grow into loving.&lt;br /&gt;Just slowly nursing my heavy heart back to normal, or if it will ever be considered normal again.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly all that's left to do is too carry on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have loved before? But this was the first real relationship where I experienced most things.&lt;br /&gt;geez, I sound like a love sap..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats okay though cause no matter what, if thats what fate decides, then it's how it's suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;For growth and for strength.&lt;br /&gt;</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754248289/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Wednesday, August 17, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754163146/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754163146/item/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2011 03:38:43 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but yeah, talk about separation anxiety...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754163146/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Sunday, August 14, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754058476/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754058476/item/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2011 06:01:18 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I REALLY WANT TO SAY I HATE YOU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I cant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deleted from phone contacts list and FB. &lt;br /&gt;It's a start.&lt;br /&gt;</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754058476/item/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>Saturday, August 13, 2011</title><link>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754028635/item/</link><guid>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754028635/item/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2011 07:30:16 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like being alone.&lt;br /&gt;Glad im not the only one in this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL, I have my phone now. txt it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><comments>http://okchristiney.xanga.com/754028635/item/#firstcomment</comments></item></channel></rss>
