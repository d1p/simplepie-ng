			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Van Buren county, located in the very south east corner of Iowa is famous for its beauty and relaxing vibe.  What can you find to do in a county that has neither fast food restaurants or a single stoplight?  Quite a bit, as I found on a recent visit.</p>
<h3>Relax, You&#8217;re in Van Buren County</h3>
<div id="attachment_14376" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14376" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-tourism-historic-villages-14373.html/web-images-4-page-061-800x598"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14376 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/09/Web-Images-4-Page-061-800x598-600x448.jpg" alt="The Bonaparte Inn, Villages of Van Buren, Iowa" width="600" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bonaparte Inn</p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get away from it all, this is the place to come.  No high priced spa treatments will restore you like a weekend of pure peace.  Pamper yourself with a stay at the <a href="http://hotels.uptake.com/iowa/bonaparte/the_bonaparte_inn_7297931.html" target="_blank">Bonaparte Inn</a>.  Once the Fairfield Glove Factory, the building has been lovingly restored and houses 9 spacious room and 4 sumptuous suites.  Afternoon refreshments and your morning breakfast are served in the beautifully appointed Hanson Commons.  The only nods to the 21<sup>st</sup> century you&#8217;ll find here are flat screen satellite TVs and free wifi, everything else is timeless elegance.<span id="more-14373"></span></p>
<h3>Stay Where Things Can Get a Little Spooky</h3>
<p>The Today Show says the Mason House Inn of Bentonsport is one of the most haunted places in America.  Now the inn hosts ghost hunting classes led by Christopher Moon.  Past classes have led students to Underground Railroad hiding places.</p>
<p>Or take a self drive tour of the<a href="http://www.uptake.com/blog/family_vacations/ghost-towns-of-montana_5099.html" target="_blank"> ghost towns</a> of Van Buren County.  There are approximately 110 scattered throughout, 35 of which have been recognized by the Historical Preservation Commission.</p>
<p>If ghosts aren&#8217;t your thing but trains are, the Mason House Inn also has the Caboose Cottage, a 1952 caboose which has been converted a fun cottage.</p>
<div id="attachment_14377" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 385px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14377" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-tourism-historic-villages-14373.html/web-images-4-page-071-601x800"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14377" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/09/Web-Images-4-Page-071-601x800-375x500.jpg" alt="Caboose Cottage at Mason Inn, Villages of Van Buren, Iowa" width="375" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caboose Cottage at Mason Inn</p></div>
<h3>Step Back in Time</h3>
<p>All around the Villages of Van Buren you&#8217;ll find history waiting for you to explore.  The Indian Artifact Museum in Bentonsport has one of the largest displays of Indian artifacts you&#8217;re likely to find in the Midwest.  You&#8217;ll find more Indian lore near Selma and Iowaville where a battle was fought when a Sac &amp; Fox war party attacked settlers.</p>
<p>Buckskinner&#8217;s Rendezvous takes to back to pre-1840 days with period events, while the Pearson House Museum in Keosauqua was a station on the Underground Railroad.  More gristly events happened nearby at the Van Buren County Courthouse where the first legal death sentencing and hanging in Iowa took place.</p>
<h3>Antiques Galore</h3>
<p>For some there is nothing quite like the hunt for antiques, and you&#8217;ll find quite a few shops scattered throughout the villages.   I found beautifully cut crystal glasses in original boxes, books over 130 years old and items I&#8217;m sure I saw in my grandmother&#8217;s attic last weekend (hmmm,  I wonder how much that stuff is worth?)</p>
<h3>And More Shopping</h3>
<div id="attachment_14378" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14378" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-tourism-historic-villages-14373.html/web-images-4-page-078-800x599"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14378" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/09/Web-Images-4-Page-078-800x599-600x449.jpg" alt="Sign at the Dutchman's Store, Cantril, Villages of Van Buren, Iowa" width="600" height="449" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sign at the Dutchman&#039;s Store</p></div>
<p>The Dutchman&#8217;s Store in the village of Cantril is a destination for many.  Even on a weekday you&#8217;ll have to search up and down the street for a parking place as license plates from as far away as Washington state and Texas share space with Iowa and Missouri vehicles outside this Mennonite owned and operated general store.  Everything from fabric to intricate clocks, overalls to crafting items, bulk food to local cheese, you&#8217;ll find it here.</p>
<h3>Take a Drive</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t get around the villages without a car and the scenery is so beautiful you won&#8217;t mind the drive.  The Des Moines River Valley is absolutely breathtaking and if you keep your eyes open you&#8217;ll likely see wild turkeys and eagles.</p>
<h3>Get Back to Nature</h3>
<div id="attachment_14379" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14379" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-tourism-historic-villages-14373.html/web-images-4-page-079-800x447"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14379" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/09/Web-Images-4-Page-079-800x447-600x335.jpg" alt="Historic Bridge, Bentonsport, Villages of Van Buren, Iowa" width="600" height="335" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Historic Bridge in Bentonsport</p></div>
<p>Van Buren County is filled with conservation areas, state parks and trails.  Canoeing, kayaking, camping, hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, snowmobiling&#8230;  If there is an outdoor sport you&#8217;ll find a place to enjoy it.</p>
<h3>Horse Around</h3>
<p>Bring your equine pal along and stay at River Valley Lodge, Campground and Horse Camp adjacent to Shimek State Forest and its extensive trail system.  Or visit Rent a Horse and take a 3 hour trail ride!</p>
<h3>Get Crafty</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been wanting to learn to knit and purl, turn pulp into paper, spin a potters wheel or bake bread, you want to see what classes are taking place at the Villages Folk School.  Hands on classes take place around the colonies and offer a return to tradition, when things were made with love, not plastic.</p>
<h3>Fare for Foodies</h3>
<p>The “new” movement in food is all about fresh, but here is Van Buren County it&#8217;s nothing new.  Locally sourced and home cooking are just how it has always been done.  Some of the best “Ma &amp; Pa” restaurants in the state can be found here, as well as family owned wineries and award winning artisan cheeses.</p>
<h3>A Life Lived Simply</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll undoubtedly pass at least one buggy as you spend time around Van Buren County; you may even visit the E&amp;T Variety store, an Amish owned and operated general store.  As you spend time around Van Buren County and enjoy life&#8217;s simple pleasures you may just wonder if they haven&#8217;t got the right idea.<em> (Please remember that the Amish do not want attention drawn to themselves and will decline to be photographed.)</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>School has begun, the nights are getting cool and farmers are preparing to harvest their fields.  Thoughts begin to turn to apple picking, pumpkin patches and corn mazes.</p>
<h2>Corn Mazes by the Light of the Moon</h2>
<div id="attachment_14277" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 213px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14277" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/night-time-corn-maze-14276.html/web-images-4-page-046-465x800"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14277 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-4-Page-046-465x800-290x500.jpg" alt="Night Time Corn Maze" width="203" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Night Time Corn Maze</p></div>
<p>While a corn maze by day can be fun and challenging, a corn maze at night takes on a whole new dimension.  If the maze is open during the Harvest Moon (traditionally the full moon used by farmers to harvest their crops late into the night before the days of headlights on tractors) you may not need a flashlight to navigate the twists and turns of the maze.  But bring one- just in case.</p>
<p>My family has an annual tradition of visiting a local maze at <a href="http://www.growingfamilyfun.com/fall-fun/" target="_blank">Geisler Farms</a> near <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/iowa/des_moines/262450057.html" target="_blank">Des Moines,</a> Iowa.  We contact a group of friends, grill hot dogs over a fire pit, toast smores and as the moon rises in the sky groups of people begin disappearing into the maze.</p>
<p>This year Geisler Farms Harvest Moon maze is October 11 &amp; 12.  Entry is $7 per person.</p>
<h2>More Night Time Corn Mazes</h2>
<p>Not everyone is lucky enough to live in Iowa, so here are a few more night time corn mazes around the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alstedefarms.com/content.php?id=336" target="_blank">Alstede Farms</a> in Chester New Jersey has Harvest Moon Hayrides &amp; Night Time Corn Mazes on October 14 &amp; 15, 21 &amp; 22, 28 &amp; 29 from 6-10 pm.  $14.95 for kids, $16.95 for adults.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dairyfarmtours.com/seasonsandevents/fallharvesttime.html" target="_blank">Hinchley&#8217;s Dairy Farm</a> in Cambridge, Wisconsin has &#8220;Flashlight Fun&#8221; every Friday and Saturday night in October.  You&#8217;ll even get a free pumpkin!  $8 per person.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bowlesfarms.com/" target="_blank">Bowles Farms</a> in southern Maryland have done moonlight mazes in the past though I don&#8217;t see one on their schedule for this year&#8230;  $10 per person</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.niedermanfamilyfarm.com/fall-activities.htm" target="_blank">Niederman Farm</a> in Liberty Township, Ohio is open until 10pm every Friday and Saturday in October.  $9 per person; ages 2 and under free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niedermanfamilyfarm.com/fall-activities.htm" target="_blank">Cooper&#8217;s Farm &amp; Maze</a> in Uxbridge Township, Ontario is hosting full moon mazes on September 12 and October 11 and are also open Saturday evenings til 10pm.</p>
<div id="attachment_14278" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14278" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/night-time-corn-maze-14276.html/web-images-4-page-047-800x588"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14278 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-4-Page-047-800x588-600x441.jpg" alt="Corn Maze" width="600" height="441" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Corn Maze</p></div>
<p>If finding your way through a maze at night isn&#8217;t enough of a challenge, you may want to check out this list of <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/top-10-haunted-corn-mazes-281.html" target="_blank">Haunted Corn Mazes.</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget a flashlight- one for every member of the family.  Or at least one for each child.  And a jacket.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you ask people why they visit a state fair you&#8217;ll hear things like, &#8220;We love to see the animals&#8221; or &#8220;The people watching is hilarious!&#8221;.  And while these answers are all well and good we all know why people visit a state fair.</p>
<h3>You go for the food.</h3>
<p>Admit it.  Dozens of items &#8220;on a stick&#8221;, dozens more deep fried and most of them available only once a year- at the state fair.  To celebrate state fair food I visited the <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-state-fair-desmoines-5146.html" target="_blank">Iowa State Fair</a> on a video fact finding mission and got the low down on some of the most popular eats this year.</p>
<h2>Deep Fried Butter on a Stick</h2>
<p>Probably the most talked about new food at the fair.  A half stick of butter, halved the long way, dipped in batter, and flash fried.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/XXNYI5qfX8s&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="movie"  value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XXNYI5qfX8s&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param></object></p>
<p>What you end up with is melted butter inside a cinnamon/sugar sprinkled dough, which tastes suspiciously like a cinnamon roll!<span id="more-14227"></span></p>
<h2>Red Velvet Funnel Cake</h2>
<p>Another fair favorite, funnel cakes, got a makeover this year with the addition of the hottest cake batter around: red velvet.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/tuCzVqCg-hA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="movie"  value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tuCzVqCg-hA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param></object></p>
<p>Sadly this tasted more like a regular funnel cake in a different color.  It was heavier, texture wise, and had a slight chocolate taste, but not as much as this red velvet cake consumer would have liked.  The cream cheese icing was delightful, though.</p>
<h2>Hot Beef Sundae</h2>
<p>The Cattleman&#8217;s Quarters is the only place to get this delicious concoction: mashed potatoes topped with roast beef, gravy cheese and a cherry tomato on top.  It&#8217;s the best food at the Iowa State Fair.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/uTDKXPlRAjs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="movie"  value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uTDKXPlRAjs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param></object></p>
<p>Lines form around the building for the two hours around lunch and dinner, so I recommend visiting in the &#8220;off times&#8221; of mid-afternoon or near 8pm.</p>
<h2>Corn Dog Ale</h2>
<p>What do you wash all this down with?  The specially created Corn Dog Ale at the craft beer tent, of course!</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/JUhlSiLkSf8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="movie"  value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JUhlSiLkSf8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param></object></p>
<p>Lovingly crafted at <a href="http://restaurants.uptake.com/iowa/des_moines/court_avenue_restaurant_brewing_co_23325041.html" target="_blank">Court Avenue Brewing Company</a> in honor of all food served on a stick.  (Just don&#8217;t add ketchup or mustard.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">What are your favorite fair foods?  Have you tried something new this year- or do you plan to?</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a sight you grow accustomed to in the Midwest, the ubiquitous green and yellow farm machinery dotting fields, tooling along rural roads or, in the case of the antique models, brilliantly restored for local parades.  John Deere is an international company that began with one man, Mr. John Deere, a blacksmith in Illinois.</p>
<div id="attachment_14192" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14192" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/john-deere-moline-illinois-14191.html/web-images-4-page-021-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14192" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-4-Page-021-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Inside the John Deere Pavilion in Moline, Illinois" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the John Deere Pavilion </p></div>
<h3>Nothing Runs Like A Deere</h3>
<p>John Deere created the first commercially successful steel plow- one that the rich, moist topsoil of the Midwest wouldn&#8217;t stick to- which made the farmers more productive.  Today you can visit the John Deere Pavilion in Moline, Illinois and get a first had look at how far that blacksmith shop has come and the levels of productivity those green and yellow “factories on wheels” are capable of.<span id="more-14191"></span></p>
<h3>Visiting the John Deere Pavilion in Moline, Illinois</h3>
<p>Looking toward Iowa across the Mississippi River, the <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/illinois/moline/john_deere_pavilion_8042849.html" target="_blank">John Deere Pavilion</a> is very easy to find.  You&#8217;ll find free parking nearby and, usually, a tour bus or two filled with retired farmers who will share their memories of their first John Deere tractor if you only ask.</p>
<div id="attachment_14193" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14193" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/john-deere-moline-illinois-14191.html/web-images-4-page-001-800x600"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14193" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-4-Page-001-800x600-600x450.jpg" alt="Restored John Deere Tractor at John Deere Pavilion" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Restored John Deere Tractor</p></div>
<p>A few beautifully restored tractors greet you as you enter the glass-walled pavilion, but it is the new behemoth machines that will astound you.  Sitting in one of these massive pieces of machinery you wonder just how long it takes to learn to drive one.  GPS systems that allow the machine to self-drive, others that monitor the soil and know when it needs more-or less- of a nutrient, combines that do the work it took three contrivances to do when my daddy farmed.  I felt like I was sitting in the cockpit of an airplane- and almost as high up!</p>
<p>After the awe of the machinery has depleted a bit, you notice the John Deere timeline along the wall.  Large images line the wall above the timeline, giving a visual reminder to just how far farm technology has come in such a short time.</p>
<p>When the kids get antsy you can take them to the children&#8217;s area where they will find toys, coloring, a “guess the grain” game and fun photo opportunities.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also find some friendly John Deere employees on hand to answer your questions.</p>
<div id="attachment_14194" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14194" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/john-deere-moline-illinois-14191.html/web-images-4-page-025-800x605"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14194" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-4-Page-025-800x605-600x453.jpg" alt="John Deere Store at the John Deere Pavilion" width="600" height="453" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">John Deere Store </p></div>
<p>After you finish in the pavilion make sure to visit the John Deere Store.  You&#8217;ll find everything from clothing to keepsakes- and more<a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/25-things-to-do-vacation-iowa-11340.html" target="_blank"> toy tractors </a>than you&#8217;ve seen anywhere.</p>
<p>The John Deere Pavilion is open daily; admission is free.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my family relocated to Massachusetts for a few months I had lots of ideas of things we would see&#8230; the <a href="http://www.uptake.com/blog/family_vacations/bostons-freedom-trail_6161.html" target="_blank">Freedom Trail</a> and Salem were at the top of the list.  Nowhere on my list was the town of Fall River- or its naval ship exhibit, Battleship Cove.  My husband, a history geek and retired military, talked about visiting (a lot) so I planned a day for us.</p>
<h2>The World&#8217;s Largest Naval Ship Exhibit</h2>
<div id="attachment_14108" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14108" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/battleships-navy-massachusetts-14107.html/web-images-3-page-094-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14108" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-3-Page-094-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Battleship Cove, Fall River, Massachusetts" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">USS Massachusetts </p></div>
<p>At <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/museums/massachusetts/fall_river/battleship_cove_8077703.html" target="_blank">Battleship Cove </a>you can explore four ships, practically from top to bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Battleship, the USS Massachusetts, built in Quincy, Massachusetts </li>
<li>Destroyer, the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., also built in Quincy, Massachusetts</li>
<li>Balao-class Submarine, the USS Lionfish</li>
<li> Tarantul I class corvette, the Hiddensee, built near St. Petersburg and commissioned by the East German People’s Navy </li>
<li> The bow of the USS Fall River, at the entrance of Battleship Cove</li>
</ul>
<p>Walking through these ships is a bit intimidating.  It also gives you a very tiny idea of how our seamen live; how isolated they must feel- especially on something as small and enclosed as a submarine.  Even the USS Massachusetts, a floating city if there ever was one, had to feel small and impersonal after an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Now the USS Massachusetts is a floating museum complete with a restaurant/snack bar area, a Memorial Room, a Crewmember’s Exhibit, a Women’s Veteran’s Exhibit,and much more. We wandered through the Officers’ Mess, the kitchens, the Main Galley, the Machine Shop&#8230; but the ship was so large, its hallways a maze, I&#8217;m not sure we saw everything.</p>
<div id="attachment_14109" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14109" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/battleships-navy-massachusetts-14107.html/web-images-3-page-097-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14109" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-3-Page-097-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Anchor on the USS Massachusetts" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anchor on the USS Massachusetts</p></div>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure I would even be able to enter the submarine- I&#8217;ve never experienced claustrophobia before, but walking into such cramped spaces threatened to bring it on.  I couldn&#8217;t imagine living in such tight quarters, underwater no less!  It gave me a new respect for the men who sailed this &#8220;invisible&#8221; ship.</p>
<p>In addition to the ships you&#8217;ll also see a PT Boat exhibit hall, a mechanized landing  craft, a Japanese motorboat (for suicide missions), a Cobra attack  helicopter, a Huey helicopter, an anti-sub helicopter and a T-28 trainer  plane and a very beautiful 9/11 memorial.</p>
<div id="attachment_14111" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 381px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14111" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/battleships-navy-massachusetts-14107.html/web-images-3-page-096-594x800"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14111" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-3-Page-096-594x800-371x500.jpg" alt="Japanese Motorboat used for Suicide Missions" width="371" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Motorboat used for Suicide Missions</p></div>
<p>Just under an hour from Boston, Battleship Cove is an interesting- and educational- day trip..  A really cool feature is that organized youth groups can actually stay overnight on the ships- they are even assigned shipboard duties and learn handy naval techniques, like knot tying.</p>
<div id="attachment_14110" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14110" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/battleships-navy-massachusetts-14107.html/web-images-3-page-095-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14110" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-3-Page-095-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Trying a bunk on the USS Joseph P Kennedy, Jr." width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Trying a bunk on the USS Joseph P Kennedy, Jr.</p></div>
<h2>Stay at an Infamous Inn in Fall River</h2>
<div id="attachment_14112" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 386px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14112" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/battleships-navy-massachusetts-14107.html/web-images-3-page-100"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14112" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/08/Web-Images-3-Page-100-376x500.jpg" alt="Lizzie Borden House, now a B&amp;B" width="376" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lizzie Borden House</p></div>
<p>Planning to overnight in Fall River?  You might want to consider staying at the<a href="http://lodging.uptake.com/bed_and_breakfasts/massachusetts/fall_river/lizzie_borden_b_b_museum_14495287.html" target="_blank"> Lizzie Borden House</a>, now a B&amp;B.  Afternoon tours are available if you don&#8217;t want to take the chance.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of summer brings a ritual to the Midwest United States: <strong>the State Fair</strong>.  State fairs began as an exposition of sorts; a way to showcase the best in agriculture and entertainment while allowing manufacturers and industry to introduce their products to thousands of people.  <a href="http://www.uptake.com/blog/cheap-and-free-things-to-do/the-midwest-cheap-and-fun_649.html" target="_blank">Midwest </a>state fairs hold on to traditions; you&#8217;ll still find huge animal barns, local talent and timeless treats comfortably cohabitating beside combines with instrument panels that belong in a space shuttle and the latest food on a stick.</p>
<h2>The Iowa State Fair</h2>
<div id="attachment_14022" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14022" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/midwest-state-fairs-info-14019.html/2772581555_6152016139_z"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14022" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/2772581555_6152016139_z-600x450.jpg" alt="Iowa State Fair Butter Cow" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Iowa State Fair Butter Cow</p></div>
<p>I begin with the Iowa State Fair because it is America&#8217;s <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-state-fair-desmoines-5146.html" target="_blank">most famous state fair</a>.  The subject of a book, musical and movies, over 1 million visitors descend on <a href="http://www.uptake.com/iowa/des_moines.html" target="_blank">Des Moines </a>annually to stroll past the butter cow, eat pork chops <a href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/iowa-state-fair-food-11685.html" target="_blank">&#8220;on a stick&#8221;</a> and gawk at the largest pig in the state.  Plenty of free entertainment, popular grandstand acts, air conditioned buildings and a few fountains- perfect for splashing around- make this a great family fair.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.iowastatefair.org/" target="_blank"> Iowa State Fair </a>runs for 10 days each August, beginning on the second Thursday of the month.<span id="more-14019"></span></p>
<h2>Minnesota State Fair</h2>
<p>Iowa&#8217;s neighbor to the north hosts a great state fair that begins at the end of August and runs through Labor Day.  While agriculture still plays a big role in the &#8220;Great Minnesota Get Together&#8221;, the focus has shifted to include education and industrial exhibits.  A brilliant addition: the <a href="http://www.mnstatefair.org/find/food/" target="_blank">Food Finder</a>! This interactive map can help you find Big Fat Bacon (one-third pound slice of bacon fried and carmelized with maple syrup, served on-a-stick with dipping sauces- YUM!), Granny&#8217;s Caramel Apple Sundaes, or one of the dozens of other tasty offerings.  A Fun Finder is due to go live before the fair begins- to help you find the perfect family fun at the<a href="http://www.mnstatefair.org/" target="_blank"> Minnesota State Fair</a>.</p>
<h2>North Dakota State Fair</h2>
<p>Usually held at the end of July, the <a href="http://www.ndstatefair.com/index.asp" target="_blank">North Dakota State Fair </a>was cancelled this year due to heavy flooding of the Mouse River.  With a strong focus on North Dakota&#8217;s agricultural heritage while looking toward the future, free entertainment and a family friendly atmosphere this is a state fair to consider in the years to come.</p>
<h2>South Dakota State Fair</h2>
<div id="attachment_14023" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14023" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/midwest-state-fairs-info-14019.html/3765950253_a90d13c705"><img class="size-full wp-image-14023" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/3765950253_a90d13c705.jpg" alt="South Dakota State Fair" width="500" height="335" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">South Dakota State Fair</p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for state fair fun at an affordable price, the<a href="http://www.sdstatefair.com/" target="_blank"> South Dakota State Fair</a> is for you!  With adult admission only $5 per day you&#8217;ll have a bit extra for the jumbo corn dog or an extra ride at the carnival.  Check out the rodeo in the grand stand or one of the many free stages.  The South Dakota State Fair begins the Thursday before Labor Day.</p>
<h2>Nebraska State Fair</h2>
<p>Beginning in late August and running just past Labor Day, the <a href="http://www.statefair.org/fair/" target="_blank">Nebraska State Fair</a> history stretches beyond the statehood of Nebraska.  A time of state pride and competition, you&#8217;ll find entertainers, exhibits, a carnival and plenty of food!  If you&#8217;re planning to visit be sure to use the handy <a href="http://www.statefair.org/fair/thingstodo/daily_calendar.asp" target="_blank">&#8220;Create Your Day</a>&#8221; feature so you don&#8217;t miss anything you really want to do.</p>
<h2>Kansas State Fair</h2>
<p>Just after Labor Day the<a href="http://www.kansasstatefair.com/" target="_blank"> Kansas State Fair </a>begins its 10 day run.  Since this fair takes place after the school year has begun, the Kansas&#8217; Largest Classroom program supplies teachers with all the information they need to supply their classes with teachable moments- while having the kind of fun only the fair can provide!  Teachers can also register their classes for the spelling bee, debate and marching band competitions.  All that information is available on the website so even we non-teachers can learn (and teach) a few things.</p>
<h2>Missouri State Fair</h2>
<p>Running in tandem with the Iowa State Fair, the <a href="http://www.mostatefair.com/" target="_blank">Missouri State Fair </a>begins the second Thursday in August and runs for 10 days.  The Rural Lifestyle Showcase offers the how-to&#8217;s of rural traditions to all ages, while the rest of the fair buzzes with latest and greatest technology can offer.  A Kids Zone play area will help keep the grumpies away when the kids just don&#8217;t want to see another animal, tractor or gadget.</p>
<h2>Illinois State Fair</h2>
<p>Apparently the Iowa State Fair dates are popular ones, as the <a href="http://www.agr.state.il.us/isf/index.php" target="_blank">Illinois State Fair</a> runs at exactly the same time.  Taking place in the capital of Springfield, you&#8217;ll find a dozen free entertainment stages in addition to the Arena and the Grandstand shows.  Each day has a special theme, including Futures for Kids Day and Family Day.</p>
<h2>Wisconsin State Fair</h2>
<div id="attachment_14024" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-14024" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/midwest-state-fairs-info-14019.html/2735848234_943b34c45b_z"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14024" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/2735848234_943b34c45b_z-600x450.jpg" alt="Racing Pigs at Wisconsin State Fair" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Racing Pigs at Wisconsin State Fair</p></div>
<p>In 2010 338,337 cream puffs were sold and over 115,000 people rode the Giant Slide at the <a href="http://www.wistatefair.com/11_web/index.asp" target="_blank">Wisconsin State Fair. </a>A really great idea here is the <a href="http://www.wistatefair.com/11_web/discounts/bargain_book.html" target="_blank">Fair Deals Bargain Book</a>; for $3 you receive savings on everything from corn dogs and lemonade to hot tubs.  Don&#8217;t miss Saz&#8217;s Racing Pigs in the Racing Pigs Arena (of course); they race 5 times daily for the prize of a frosted oatmeal cookie.  Great fun for everyone!</p>
<p>The Wisconsin State Fair begins the first Thursday in August and runs for 10 days.</p>
<h2>Michigan Upper Peninsula State Fair</h2>
<p>Since the Michigan State Fair lost state funding in 2009, the <a href="http://upstatefair.org/" target="_blank">UP State Fair</a> has become Michigan&#8217;s only state fair.  Running for 6 days in mid-August you&#8217;ll find free grandstand shows included with fair entry.  Kids will be in awe at the Miracle of Life Birthing Pavilion and the Fantazia Circus will amaze all ages.  Fire dancers, magicians and chainsaw carving are only a few of the free shows you&#8217;ll find throughout the Midway.</p>
<h2>Indiana State Fair</h2>
<p>Running for an incredible 17 days, beginning the first weekend of August, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/statefair/fair/" target="_blank">Indiana State Fair </a>was begun to &#8220;encourage agriculture&#8221;.  Having grown from humble beginnings you&#8217;ll find everything from horse pulls to hot air balloon races.  Take a break and visit the adorable animals in the Livestock Nursery and step back in time at Pioneer Village.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.uptake.com/arkansas/eureka_springs.html" target="_blank">Eureka Springs</a> has been a destination for hundreds of years.  Native American tribes believed the cold spring water could cure a variety of ailments.  Health-seekers of the Victorian era flocked to Eureka Springs to &#8220;take the waters&#8221;, creating a popular retreat.</p>
<p>Streets in the center of town are very narrow and steep, smoothly climbing the Ozark stone the city was built upon.  Colorful shops, classic bathhouses and <a href="http://hotels.uptake.com/blog/eureka-springs-hotels-660.html" target="_blank">historic hotels</a> line the downtown streets.  Walking paths lead you from one garden adorned spring to the next.  As you move into residential areas houses appear tiny, built to the edge of a cliff; a view of the house from another angle will show that it has been built along side-or even into the sheer stone and has two, or even three, stories.  Grand Victorian Bed &amp; Breakfasts stand regally atop the cliffs, their gardens an oasis of tranquility.</p>
<h2>The 1886 Crescent Hotel</h2>
<div id="attachment_13963" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13963" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/eureka-springs-hotel-13961.html/crescentfall-800x600"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13963" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/crescentfall-800x600-600x450.jpg" alt="Crescent Hotel Fall" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crescent Hotel in Fall</p></div>
<p>Staying in a historic property isn&#8217;t for everyone.  The Crescent Hotel, built of native stone, seems to rise from the highest point of Eureka Springs as a guardian.  The Crescent was billed as &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Luxurious Hotel&#8221; when it was built and it remains as intriguing today.</p>
<div id="attachment_13964" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 170px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13964" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/eureka-springs-hotel-13961.html/web-images-page-070-800x594"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-13964 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-Page-070-800x594-200x200.jpg" alt="Crescent Hotel Key" width="160" height="160" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crescent Hotel Key</p></div>
<p>Rooms at the Crescent Hotel have been modernized, but are not modern.  The decor has an air of the mystical about it as rooms have been repainted to reflect the few years Norman Baker operated a &#8220;cancer hospital&#8221; within the grand walls.  Our room was large, with two double beds, a roomy bath and closet.  Most charming was the key- made of heavy metal with a brass keyring stamped with our room number.</p>
<p>On top of your room rate is a daily resort fee ($7.75).  For this low fee you can join daily activities at the hotel such as hikes, socials history tors or send the children to Kids Kamp, get free premium parking at the downtown Basin Hotel, access the high speed internet and utilize the hotel shuttle.<em> My only confusion with this is why it is a resort fee; why not raise the room rates a tiny bit and make these amenities &#8220;free&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>Even if you aren&#8217;t staying at the Crescent Hotel it is well worth a hike up the hill for their Sunday Brunch.  Tables in the Crystal Dining Room are draped with crisp white table cloths and attentive waitstaff await to take drink orders.  As you are led to your table you are given a tour of the offerings: breakfast meats, eggs, an omelet, potatoes, and biscuits, luncheon salads, roast beef, vegetables, pork loin, cheeses and crackers, and incredible desserts including Cherries Jubilee  and a chocolate fountain.  Pamper yourself with a mimosa as you consider your options.  And because it&#8217;s a buffet no one- except maybe your waiter- will know you had chocolate covered strawberries first.</p>
<div id="attachment_13965" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13965" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/eureka-springs-hotel-13961.html/web-images-page-087-800x550"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13965" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-Page-087-800x550-600x412.jpg" alt="Chocolate Fountain at Buffet, Crescent Hotel, Eureka Springs" width="600" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chocolate on the Buffet</p></div>
<h2>One of America&#8217;s Most Haunted Hotels</h2>
<p>Every evening, at 8pm sharp, guests and non guests have the opportunity to join the ghost tour.  An entertaining guide leads you through the hotel sharing history, sightings and even the names of guests who checked in &#8211; but never checked out.  This fun tour is not for small children, but is great fun for teens and adults.</p>
<h2>Relax in the New Moon Spa</h2>
<p>Located on the Garden Level of the hotel, the New Moon Spa offers everything from massages and facials to hair cuts and makeovers.  It&#8217;s perfect when you really want to spoil yourself.  Even if you don&#8217;t have a service done wander down and shop.  You&#8217;ll find natural products with relaxing scents to give as gifts or remember your stay at this enchanting hotel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes diner food just sounds good.  Like after you leave a club. Or a graduation.  OK, I&#8217;ve never had a time when diner food <em>didn&#8217;t </em>sound good.  And after a night of driving in terrible storms, followed by too little sleep and a long law school graduation I&#8217;ll admit that I may have started to drool when I searched Yelp for a place to eat on our way out of <a href="Starlite Diner, Little Rock, Arkansas" target="_blank">Little Rock </a>and the Starlite Diner appeared on my screen.</p>
<h3>Nostalgia, But Nicer</h3>
<div id="attachment_13949" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13949" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/little-rock-diner-restaurant-13948.html/web-images-3-page-076-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13949" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-076-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Starlite Diner, Little Rock, Arkansas" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Starlite Diner Exterior</p></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, one of the attractions of <a href="http://restaurants.uptake.com/blog/dedham-50s-diner-hidden-gem-massachusetts.html" target="_blank">diner food</a> is the grease.  And while it is great on your food, it&#8217;s not so nice layered over everything else.  From the gleaming aluminum exterior to the bright interior, the Starlite Diner has the aura of a much loved business.  It was spotless.  With only eight booths and half a dozen counter seats inside I imagine it can feel a bit packed during busy times, but on the Saturday afternoon we visited only half the booths were full.  Our waitress told us that it would get quite busy as the evening approached and continue until closing time.<span id="more-13948"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_13950" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13950" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/little-rock-diner-restaurant-13948.html/web-images-3-page-072-800x594"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13950" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-072-800x594-600x445.jpg" alt="Starlite Diner, Little Rock, Arkansas" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Starlite Diner interior</p></div>
<p>The interior waxes nostalgic with tattoo art that would look at place on the arm of a burly Navy veteran.  The classic signs around the counter increase the wistful longings of a simpler time many of us remember from Happy Days reruns.  The pleasant sounds of burgers frying and fry pans dropping in hot oil were music to our hungry bellies as we perused the menu.</p>
<h3>Diner Fare- But Fresh</h3>
<p>The menu is filled with your typical diner fare.  Thick burgers, all day breakfasts, french fries, onion rings and hash browns.  But one taste makes you realize that your food wasn&#8217;t dumped out of a 5 pound bag.  Hand cut french fries are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  Fresh hamburger is cooked to perfection.  Fresh herbs perfectly season the massive omelets.</p>
<div id="attachment_13951" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13951" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/little-rock-diner-restaurant-13948.html/web-images-3-page-073-800x582"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13951" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-073-800x582-600x436.jpg" alt="Food at Starlite Diner, Little Rock, Arkansas" width="600" height="436" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Delicious Food at Starlite Diner</p></div>
<p>Before you leave order a hand dipped shake for the road.  So thick you may need a spoon. <em> Ahhh, now that&#8217;s how they made them in the good old days&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><strong> Quick Facts:</strong></p>
<p>Starlite Diner is located at 250 Military Road, North Little Rock, Arkansas</p>
<p>Hours: 6am-8pm Monday thru Saturday, 6am-2pm Sunday</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is often very easy to take for granted what is around us.  In my community it is very easy to take for granted the wide bike paths, parks within walking distance of every home and family friendly community activities.  Because my town has &#8220;taken action for play&#8221; it has been designated a &#8220;Playful City&#8221; by KaBoom!, a national non-profit organization dedicated to saving play for children.</p>
<div id="attachment_13866" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13866" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/playful-city-vacation-13865.html/web-images-3-page-068"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13866" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-068-600x445.jpg" alt="Playground Ankeny Iowa" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Local Playground with Baseball Fields Behind It</p></div>
<h3>What Makes a City Playful?</h3>
<p>To become officially playful, cities must commit to 5 key points, including creating a play task force, conducting a play-space audit and celebrating an annual &#8220;Play Day&#8221;.  Playful Cities stretch across the United States.  In 2010, the most recent compilation, the list included <a href="http://kaboom.org/take_action/playful_city_usa" target="_blank">118 cities in 36 states</a>.<span id="more-13865"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_13869" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 484px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13869" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/playful-city-vacation-13865.html/web-images-3-page-067"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13869" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-067-474x500.jpg" alt="Tennis in Playful City Ankeny, Iowa" width="474" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tennis</p></div>
<h3>Activities in Playful Cities</h3>
<p>While each city will have it&#8217;s own type of play you&#8217;re likely to find activities including large scale playground equipment, tennis courts and baseball fields to biking and walking paths, lakes for canoeing and volleyball courts.  The aim of the playful city is to provide play spaces for children of all ages, activities and energy levels.</p>
<p>My hometown of <a href="http://www.uptake.com/iowa/ankeny.html" target="_blank">Ankeny, Iowa, </a>has all of the above with, at the very least, a small park within walking distance of every neighborhood in the city.  Favorite travel destinations such as San Antonio, Texas, <a href="http://hotels.uptake.com/blog/family-friendly-suite-resort-in-phoenix-arizona-11587.html" target="_blank">Phoenix, Arizona</a> and San Francisco, California have also received the Playful City designation.</p>
<div id="attachment_13870" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13870" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/playful-city-vacation-13865.html/web-images-3-page-066"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13870" src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-066-600x445.jpg" alt="Canoeing at All City Play Day in Ankeny" width="600" height="445" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canoeing</p></div>
<h3>Finding Parks Playful Cities (or Any City)</h3>
<p>While the <a href="http://kaboom.org/take_action/playful_city_usa" target="_blank">map of Playful Cities </a>is helpful, KaBoom! and Parents magazine have created the Playgrounds! app for the iPhone.  If, like me, you have an Android device I found a Playgrounds 411 app available.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">No matter your destination or itinerary, a stop at a park is sure to cure a cranky child, allow the escape of excess energy and fill even the most active child with enough fresh air to promise a long night of sleep.  A playground is the handiest- and most frugal- tool in the traveling parents&#8217; arsenal.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drive in theater is wrapped in nostalgia for many of us.  Images of Danny and Sandy in Grease spring to mind.  While I&#8217;ve yet to see choreographed song and dance break out at any of the drive-in theaters we&#8217;ve visited, every visit to a drive-in theater brings its own sense of excitement and family fun.</p>
<p>Drive-in theaters were once plentiful across the <a href="http://www.uptake.com/blog/cheap-and-free-things-to-do/the-midwest-cheap-and-fun_649.html" target="_blank">Midwest</a>; now you can count the number of open theaters per state on one hand.  Drive-in theater etiquette varies by theater.  So will allow grilling, while others ask you not to bring in outside food.  But all feature lower prices than you&#8217;ll find in a multi-plex and open areas for fun and games while you wait for the sun to go down.</p>
<div id="attachment_13855" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13855" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/drive-in-theaters-midwest-13854.html/web-images-3-page-058-800x594"><img class="size-full wp-image-13855 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-058-800x594.jpg" alt="Cars waiting for a movie at the drive in" width="480" height="356" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cars waiting for a movie at the drive in</p></div>
<h3><span id="more-13854"></span>Iowa</h3>
<p>The Valle Drive -In near <a href="http://www.uptake.com/iowa/newton.html" target="_blank">Newton </a>is a favorite with families.  With plenty of grassy area to play, families arrive when gates open at 6:30pm to stake their spot, let kids play and gather with friends.  Ticket prices are per person; movies begin at dusk.</p>
<h3>Illinios</h3>
<p>Harvest Moon Drive In near Gibson City opened in 1954 as a single screen theater.  No boasting two screens, Harvest Moon is also the only wind powered drive-in in the US.   Open 6 nights a week, ticket prices are per person.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<div id="attachment_13856" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-13856" href="http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/drive-in-theaters-midwest-13854.html/web-images-3-page-059-451x800"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13856 " src="http://uptake-mu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/attractions.uptake.com/files/2011/07/Web-Images-3-Page-059-451x800-281x500.jpg" alt="Drive In Movie Speakers" width="225" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Drive In Movie Speakers</p></div>
<p>Highway 18 Outdoor Theater in Jefferson was built in 1953.  After the screen went dark it was sold- to a buyer who restored it and re-lit the screen.  WHile the speakers remain, they are for nostalgia purposes only.  No outside food or drink is allowed at this theater, but it does have wi-fi to help while away the time waiting for your show to begin.  Tickets prices are per person and the concession stand is one of the most extensive I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>Vali-Hi Drive In lies between Hudson, WI and St. Paul, MN in Lake Elmo.  For a single, per person admission you get a triple feature.  You can bring in your own food- even a grill!- or enjoy the concessions.  A large arcade is available to amuse the kids.  Movies run, rain or shine, seven nights a week during the season.</p>
<h3>North Dakota</h3>
<p>Lake Park Drive-In in Williston has the honor of being the only drive-in theater in North Dakota.  If it still exists.  The last record of this theater came from a July 2010 article, but no recent information can be found.  At that time the Lake Park Drive-In was open only on weekends and running a single feature.  (I would love more info on this theater!  Please leave a note in the comments.)</p>
<h3>South Dakota</h3>
<p>Not even a flood could shut down the drive-in theater in Mobridge.  The Pheasant Drive-In&#8217;s season runs May-September.  Gates open at 9pm, and the movie begins at 9:30.</p>
<h3>Nebraska</h3>
<p>The newest drive-in in Nebraska, Sandhills Drive-In outside Alliance has a single screen and can accommodate 250 cars.  Movies show June- September, entry charges are per person.</p>
<h3>Kansas</h3>
<p>The oldest drive-in theater in Kansas is also one of the few that charges by the car load. April thru October the single screen shows double features on weekends only, Friday thru Sunday.</p>
<h3>Missouri</h3>
<p>The 66 Drive-In in Carthage opened in 1949, after the war, but eventually closed.  Restored and re-opened in 1997 you&#8217;ll find locals and road-trippers cruising the famed Route 66 parking here during the season.  Prices are per person, but some of the lowest I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
