		<title>Adding a subdomain for files...</title>
		<link>http://www.effectiveict.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=2429</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hi!I have moodle on my main site. (<a href='http://TreasuresReadingTeachers.us' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>TreasuresReadingTeachers.us</a>)  What I'd like to do is add a subdomain for files that I can use in different courses, instead of reuploading the files in each course. Also, moodle times out when I try to upload larger files. Of course, I'm talking about hot potato files & other games.... ones that use javascript or just html and of course, Content Generator games ;0)   as well as others that I can embed.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is what kind of cms can I use that will make it easy to upload files & make pages for them. I have no experience uploading games in a zip file, unpacking & linking to them on anything EXCEPT moodle. (That's why I choose moodle, because it makes things like that sooo EASY!)<br />
<br />
Thank any & all of you for any help you give!<br />

		<title>wordpress blog hacked</title>
		<link>http://www.effectiveict.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=1779</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Any ideas how this happened? Most perturbing. I run a wordpress blog for a local councillor - hosted on his own domain - and got alerted the other day that it 'didn't look right' Went to check and in short, my header . php file had been replaced with one with messages about credit cards etc.. I put the original file back and it is ok again but... how on earth can anyone have got into my ftp or into the site admin to do this? Only I have the ftp details and only two other totally reliable people have logins to write posts - nobody else is allowed to register. How else can this have happened?]]></description>

		<title>The problem with ICT....</title>
		<link>http://www.effectiveict.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=2408</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Currently ICT is very much in a state of flux in the English & Welsh National Curriculum.  There are debates about what is important, what is necessary and what is no longer needed.  Personally I feel we've seen an utterly disappointing drift towards pure 'Office skills' and the near complete loss of real programming and development.  To me this is where the real student interest is - give students a glimpse into programming and you light the touchpaper.  Give them another PowerPoint based task and you might as well start singing a lullaby as they drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
I've been so impressed to see other ICT colleagues helping construct the fightback.  We've already been pushing for more and more programming work at Neale-Wade and I've been very pleased with the work that we've done with Flash programming, exploration of 'proper' web design,  coverage of computing history, begun with Steve Fone's (ICT colleague at Neale-Wade - @stevo39x) work on Internet history, with Andy Willetts' (another ICT colleague at Neale-Wade) work on Gamemaker, SCRATCH work (initially provided by one of our cover teachers) as well as the enthusiasm for the 'proper' computing elements of the IT Diploma via Trevor Hughes (IT & business teacher at Neale-Wade, responsible for the diploma).  We will continue to share all the work that we develop as a faculty via the <a href='http://twitter.com/#%21/search/%23ictcurric' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>#ictcurric hashtag</a> and related sites: <a href='http://ictcurric.org.uk/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>http://ictcurric.org.uk/</a> and <a href='http://moodle.ictcurric.org.uk/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>http://moodle.ictcurric.org.uk/</a><br />
<br />
I strongly believe that ICT needs to be positioned at the centre of a successful school curriculum.  It can be a subject that pressurises and enhances students' higher level Maths skills, puts the imagination, reasoned arguments and communication expertise from English, Media & PSHE into real-life practice, enhances and develops their inquisitive, problem-solving, investigative Science and Humanities skills, builds on their design & creativity from DT, Art, Music & Drama, even providing them with opportunities to put kinaesthetic and reaction from PE / Sports studies into games-programming & playing action. ICT should equip students with the confidence, the creative enthusiasm, and ferocious expertise to succeed in the later 2050s and beyond.<br />
<br />
To me, as a history graduate, I see IT (drop the C) as a subject as being very closely connected to history - the true historical skill of being an effective 'crap detector' (as posed by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>Neil Postman</a> and <a href='http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=2536' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow'>see this discussion</a>)- is such an important factor for us as IT teachers, helping students handle information intelligently as the potential for it to become manipulated increases in an ever more sophisticated way.<br />
<br />
We need our students not to be consumers of cloud technology or  'App-eaters', we need them to be the confident and enthusiastic creators  of next, higher-level game changing technology.  They need to equipped  with the ability to react to unexpected events, deal with creative  hurdles and possess the strength of inner confidence backed by  intellectual rigour - they don't need to be taught how to make a  presentation look nice.<br />
<br />
Yet this is more about a discussion about where IT should be as a subject - the current curriculum review is now receiving some excellent and wide-ranging attention from a whole host of interested parties.  Do see the following blog posts and related sites:<br />

		<title><![CDATA[Somehow I've REALLY messed up this course...]]></title>
		<link>http://www.effectiveict.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=2418</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I was making a label & adding a table.<br />
After saving it, it incorporated everything on the right side of my page, as well as everything that was below it.<br />
Initially, it was topic 5. I was able to move it down to topic 22- however- all my right hand column is on it.<br />
<br />
Can you take a look & help me figure out how to fix this? <br />
I don't even have the option to edit  the 'table'.<br />
