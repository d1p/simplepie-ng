			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Language Log readers may be wondering why there has been no coverage of the achievement of Jesse Anderson, who has managed to get millions of monkeys, as computationally simulated on Amazon servers, to reproduce 99.9 percent of the works of Shakespeare (his own account is <a href="http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2011/09/a-few-million-monkeys-randomly-recreate-shakespeare/">here on his blog</a>, and various journalistic sheep have obediently reproduced his account in the newspapers).  I'll tell you why. <span id="more-3471"></span></p>
<p>The reason is that this seems to be a bit of self-promoting nonsense, comparable to Paul JJ Payack's silly claims to have an algorithm that has found a million words in English (no links; you can look him up). What Anderson has done is to generate 9-byte sequences randomly and check them against the works of Shakespeare.  If he gets a match, he counts that bit of Shakespeare as done and marks it off.  When all the text of all the plays and poems has been marked off, he has succeeded in his quest. </p>
<p>To see how dumb this project is, consider doing it with 1-letter sequences. You basically get a match every single time.  So the task would be over in a few minutes at modern server speeds.  Now imagine doing it on bigrams (2-letter sequences): it would take longer, but would still be trivial and guaranteed to succeed fairly swiftly.  For any <i>k</i>&thinsp;&gt;&thinsp;0, the task would be quite straightforward, but as you choose larger <i>k</i> it takes longer and longer.  So he's wasting CPU cycles doing it for <i>k</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;9. </p>
<p>The number of 9-letter sequences over the alphabetic characters <i>a</i> to <i>z</i> is 5,429,503,678,976 (and that figure of 5.5 trillion is being mentioned in the press stories it looks like he's ignoring spaces, punctuation, case, fonts, paragraph breaks, etc., but what the heck, let's pretend Shakespeare's work is a bunch of strings over {<i>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</i>).  There are a few scientific curlicues in the way Anderson does things, but basically he just takes random 9-grams and does a fixed-string search over the Shakespearean corpus to see if he has 9 more letters he can mark off as done. </p>
<p>Language Log has spent some time trying to care about this, honestly, and it's not working.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA627#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">entry for <em>me</em></a> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Dictionary-English-Usage-Merriam-Webster/dp/0877791325/"><em>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage</em></a> notes that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Everyone expects <em>me</em> to turn up as the object of a preposition or a verb [&#8230;] But <em>me</em> also turns up in a number of place where traditional grammarians and commentators prescribe<em> I</em>. [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">While traditional opinion prescribes <em>someone and I </em>for subject use &#8211;<em> I and someone</em> seems a bit impolite &#8212; in actual practice we also find <em>me and someone </em>and <em>someone and me</em> [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Both are speech forms, often associated with the speech of children, and likely to be unfavorably noticed in the speech and writing of adults except when used facetiously.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"><em>The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language</em></a> gives the following four examples to illustrate "Coordinate accusatives corresponding to non-coordinate nominatives", p. 462, commenting that "The accusatives in [22] are non-standard and strongly stigmatized, especially the pattern in [ii]":</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: #800000;">[22]</span></td>
<td><span style="color: #800000;">i</span></td>
<td><span style="color: #800000;">a.</span></td>
<td><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tina and me</span> sat by the window looking down on all the twinkling lights.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><span style="color: #800000;">b.</span></td>
<td><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">She and us</span> are going to be good friends</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But reader SN has pointed out to me that there are some reliable facts about the relative frequency of (some of) the alternatives that these authorities don't directly mention.<br />
<span id="more-3469"></span><br />
Specifically, "me and someone" is about three times more common than "someone and me"; whereas "I and someone" is more than "slightly impolite" &#8212; it hardly ever occurs. Thus (with corpus.byu.edu search strings, in which '.' means "start of sentence" and [np*] means "proper noun"):</p>
<table style="text-align: center;" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>COCA</strong></td>
<td><strong>BNC</strong></td>
<td><strong>TIME</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. me and [np*]</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">124</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. I and [np*]</strong></td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. [np*] and me</strong></td>
<td>51</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. [np*] and I</strong></td>
<td>1395</td>
<td>303</td>
<td>51</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Or here, where "[n*]" means "noun":</p>
<table style="text-align: center;" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>COCA</strong></td>
<td><strong>BNC</strong></td>
<td><strong>TIME</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. me and the [n*]</strong></td>
<td>38</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. I and the [n*]</strong></td>
<td>8</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. the [n*] and me</strong></td>
<td>6</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. the [n*] and I</strong></td>
<td>169</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>19</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Summing up:</p>
<table style="text-align: center;" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Ego="I"</strong></td>
<td><strong>Ego="me"</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ego first</strong></td>
<td>16</td>
<td>215</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ego second</strong></td>
<td>1965</td>
<td>73</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The pattern for coordinate subjects with <em>he|him ~ she|her </em>is somewhat different. "Him and someone" is again much (five times) more common than "Someone and him"; but now "He and someone" is much commoner (11 times) than "Someone and he":</p>
<table style="text-align: center;" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>COCA</strong></td>
<td><strong>BNC</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>. him and [np*]</strong></td>
<td>13</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>. he and [np*]</strong></td>
<td>400</td>
<td>143</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. [np*] and him</strong></td>
<td>4</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>. [np*] and he</strong></td>
<td>34</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(I've limited this table to the masculine pronouns, since <em>her</em> can also be possessive, and we would need to eliminate common things like "Susan and her mother" in order to include the feminine forms.)</p>
<p>One theory would be that in some varieties of English <em>me</em> is an emphatic form rather than (or in addition to) an accusative form. Thus in the same way that French has "Jean et moi" rather than "*Jean et je", this kind of English has "John and me" rather than "*John and I".</p>
<p>But this in itself doesn't explain why "me and John" is preferred to "John and me" by a factor of three; nor (especially) why the prescription against the order "I and John" (justified on post-hoc grounds of politeness) is so much more strongly obeyed (875 to 1) than the prescription against <em>me</em> anywhere in coordinate subjects (7 to 1).</p>
<p>Obviously, the choice among these alternatives will have very different proportions in different registers, as well as in different regions and classes of speakers and writers. Any serious investigation would need to break these factors down in a systematic way. But I feel that the numbers shown so far are enough to establish that there's something interesting going on here.</p>
<p>One direction towards a solution might be to adopt the theory put forward in Joseph Emonds, "Grammatically deviant prestige constructions", 1986, and adopted e.g. by Nicholas Sobin, "<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4178979">Agreement, Default Rules, and Grammatical Viruses</a>",<em> Linguistic Inquiry</em> 29(2) 1997. This theory says that "nominative" pronouns in coordinate subjects are actually ungrammatical in English ("grammatically deviant") and must be introduced by extra-grammatical editing rules ("grammatical viruses", in Sobin's terminology).</p>
<p>A version of this approach can explain why "I and NP" is hardly ever found, as follows:</p>
<p>1) The natural state of all pronouns in coordinate subjects is accusative.<br />
2) There is a rule (of prestigious deviance) turning "and me" into "and I".</p>
<p>On this view, there's no way to generate "I and someone" (or perhaps there's only another and much more marginal prestigious-deviance rule) and so it should never (or hardly ever) occur. This also explains object forms like "between you and I".</p>
<p>But this theory doesn't explain (without further stipulation) why "he and someone" is so common.</p>
<p>A somewhat different approach is taken by Philipp Angermeyer and John Singler, "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954394503152027">The case for politeness: Pronoun  variation in co-ordinate NPs in object position in English</a>", <em>Language Variation and Change</em> 15, 2003, which makes a three-way distinction (in object position) among "vernacular" <em>me and X</em>, "standard" <em>X and me</em>, and "polite" <em>X and I</em>.</p>
<p>Also relevant is this back-and-forth:</p>
<p>Frank Parker, Kathryn Riley, and Charles Meyer, "<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/454819">Case Assignment and the Ordering of Constituents in Coordinate Constructions</a>", American Speech 63(3) 1988.<br />
Graham Shorrocks, "<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/455850">Case Assignment in Simple and Coordinate Constructions in Present-Day English</a>", American Speech 67(4) 1992.<br />
Frank Parker, Kathryn Riley, and Charles Meyer, "<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/455862">Here us go again</a>", American Speech 69(4) 1994.</p>
<p>Parker et al. also explain nominative pronouns in conjoined subjects as the result of prescriptivist editing, but argue that the order of conjuncts is explained by general principles of "empathy".</p>
<p>I haven't seen any attempts to survey and explain the extensive corpus data that is now available. This would include looking at the large available collections of transcribed conversational speech, at dialog in out-of-copyright novels now available in digital form, and so on.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just now stepped out of a Singapore cab.  There are many different ethnic  groups in this cosmopolitan city, including Chinese (Hokkien,  Cantonese, Hakka, etc.), Indian, Malay, and so on.  The driver of this  particular taxi was Chinese.  He was slight of build and very high  strung.  He asked me what I was doing on the campus of the National  University of Singapore.  "Were you here to give a lecture?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "and to do research."</p>
<p>"On what subject?"  Since I got into the cab in front of the business  school, he probably thought I was there to give lectures and do research  on finance, marketing, or the like.</p>
<p>"On Chinese language, literature, thought, religion, and culture."</p>
<p>"What?" he said with incredulity.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said matter-of-factly.  "Mainly I teach Chinese language and literature."</p>
<p>"What?  You know Mandarin?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "but I usually teach Classical Chinese."</p>
<p>"How is that possible?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It's my job, my vocation."</p>
<p>He was stunned.</p>
<p><span id="more-3470"></span></p>
<p>As he drove me back to my apartment, I noticed a strangely conspicuous,  handwritten sign hanging from the middle of his dashboard.  In big, red  characters that were easily visible from the back seat of the cab, the  sign listed about ten categories of jiǎ 假  ("fake; false") individuals  that he didn't like to have in his cab, including jiǎ shàngděng rén 假上等人  ("fake gentlemen") and jiǎ gāojí rén 假高级人 ("fake high class people").   But the most severe scorn of all was reserved for the last category on  the list:  the dreaded jiǎ yángrén 假洋人 ("fake foreigners").</p>
<p>When I started to read out the categories of fake persons that the cabby  detested, he almost crashed the car.  After he composed himself, he  blurted out, "You can read that stuff?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I said.  "That's what I do for a living."  Whereupon we  switched into Mandarin and there ensued a most animated discussion about why he hated  all of those different types of fakers listed on the sign.  Finally, we  got down to the last one, the jiǎ yángrén 假洋人 ("fake foreigners"), and I  asked him what he meant by that.  "A 'fake foreigner,'" he said, "is a  Chinese who comes into my cab and speaks English to me.  A 'fake  foreigner' is also a Chinese who speaks English to his / her children.   Such people are beneath contempt."</p>
<p>"But what about the Minister Mentor [Lee Kuan Yew]?" I asked.  "He  doesn't really speak Chinese, does he?  Is he a 'fake foreigner'?"</p>
<p>The cabdriver very quickly changed the topic (it is against the law in  Singapore to slander the Minister Mentor).  Not wanting to get the cabby  in trouble, but still wishing to urge him not to be so unremittingly  negative, I suggested, "Why don't you put up a new category on your  list, the zhēn yángrén 真洋人 ('true foreigner')?  Am I not a 'true foreigner'?"</p>
<p>He looked at me with wide open eyes, thought for a moment, then laughed  (I felt triumphant in getting him to crack a smile), and exclaimed,  "Nope! You're a jiǎ huárén (<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps">'fake</span> <span class="hps">Chinese')</span></span>!"</p>
<p>Whereupon we reached my apartment and I got out of the taxi.  "Have a good day," he shouted out merrily &#8212; in English.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After almost a month, I'm finally following up on the results of <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3411">the single-question surveys</a> that I asked Language Log readers to participate in. Each survey received an overwhelming 1500+ responses, and I didn't realize that I needed a "pro" (= "paid") account on SurveyMonkey in order to view more than the first 100. I owe special thanks to [someone with a pro account who has not yet allowed or disallowed that I mention their name here], to whom I transfered the surveys and who kindly sent me the overall percentages. As it happens, the results did not change all that much after the first 100 responses: here are the survey questions and answers, with the percentage of all 1500+ respondents who selected each answer indicated to the left and the percentage of the first 100 respondents who selected each answer indicated in parentheses to the right.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Survey 1.</b> Which of the following three conclusions can you draw from the following statement?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The final exam for that class was deceptively easy.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>56.8% The final exam was easy. (60%)<br />
36.0% The final exam was hard. (32%)<br />
7.2% The final exam was neither easy nor hard. (8%)</p>
<p><b>Survey 2.</b> Which of the following three conclusions can you draw from the following statement?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The final exam for that class was deceptively hard.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>11.8% The final exam was easy. (12%)<br />
84.0% The final exam was hard. (84%)<br />
4.2% The final exam was neither easy nor hard. (4%)
</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-3468"></span></p>
<p>Several of you wrote to me to point out that, at least for you, none of the answers provided was really an accurate reflection of your personal intuitions. This led some of you to simply not answer the question, and others to struggle to find what they considered to be the best (or "least bad") answer. I freely admit that there are several methodological problems with these surveys, but I think that the results reveal two interesting things:</p>
<ol>
<li>People's intuitions about what <i>deceptively ADJ</i> means are surprisingly variable. (This was pointed out to me by John Hawthorn, and is what originally led me to post the surveys.)</li>
<li>There appear to be significant differences between people's intuitions about what <i>deceptively ADJ</i> means and what <i>deceptively not-ADJ</i> means, for at least some <i>ADJ/not-ADJ</i> pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>With regard to the variability, Simon Spero (whose email subject line is the title of my post here) writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Houghton/Mifflin <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> notes that for the sentence <i>The pool is deceptively shallow</i>, judgement of their usage panel was 50% for the logical reading, 32% for the opposite reading, with 18% finding it impossible to judge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>(Language Log's own Geoff Nunberg was chair of the usage panel of the <i>AHD</i> at the time, as he discusses toward the end of <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/upandup.html">this <i>Fresh Air</i> piece</a> from October 2003.)</p>
<p>Lauren Gawne also wrote to point me to <a href="http://www.superlinguo.com/post/8102577419/deceptively-deceptive">this post she wrote on the topic</a> (which was the first I'd heard of the excellent <a href="http://www.superlinguo.com/">Superlinguo</a> blog "for those who like and use language" &#8212; check it out). Lauren teases apart three meanings of <i>deceptively</i> there that may account for the observed variability in people's intuitions. I should note that even though my surveys only allowed for one interpretation per respondent, I believe that individuals have some access to the different meanings of <i>deceptively</i> and that these can be pragmatically manipulated. (More fodder for those interested in the methodological problems with my survey.)</p>
<p>As interesting as I think the variability is on its own, I'm even more interested in the stark difference between <i>deceptively easy</i> (56.8% = "easy") and <i>deceptively hard</i> (84% = "hard"). I think that overnegation (<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=overnegation">discussed a lot</a> here on Language Log) is playing a role here. In response to this conjecture, John Lawler writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As for overnegation, note that "hard" but not "easy" triggers NPI [<i>= <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_item">negative polarity items</a>; this is a common test for negative elements&#8211;EB</i>]:</p>
<p>It's hard to believe anybody ever loved this place.<br />
*It's easy to believe anybody ever loved this place.</p>
<p>And while "deceptive" doesn't, it still sets up an alternation between a "perceived" and a "real" mental space, just the way negatives do. (See <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/negsinspace.pdf">http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/negsinspace.pdf</a> for more details.) So I think overnegation of one sort or another is a good candidate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm ill-equipped to delve into this hypothesis deeply enough, both in terms of my available time and in terms of my expertise (I'm a phonologist, after all, not a lexical semanticist). But the idea would be that <i>deceptively easy</i> involves only the alternation between a "perceived" and a "real" mental space set up by <i>deceptively</i>, leading to the ambiguity between the "easy" and "not-easy = hard" interpretations; by contrast, <i>deceptively hard</i> involves both that alternation and the negation inherent to <i>hard</i>, thus… wait, I just lost it. Damn.</p>
<p>And Lauren Gawne writes again:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I've often wondered with these if the pairings change the relationship &#8212; for example whether "deceptively hard/easy" are more likely to be analysed with different properties than "deceptively small/big."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Me, too. Sadly, my time and expertise limitations prevent me from pursuing any of this any further. Anyone who desires to do so is free to report back in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by Mark Liberman's post, "<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3465">Putting the X in AXB</a>," I spent some time trying to find the origin for this venerable <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html">snowclone</a>. A quick check of newspaper databases uncovered "putting the <em>fun</em> in <em>fundamentals</em>" from <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3465#comment-141955">November 1912</a>, and it turns out that the fall of 1912 was when the snowclone snowballed. It's a nice example of how, even a century ago, lingua-memes could "go viral" (and go stale).<br />
<span id="more-3466"></span><br />
<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3465#comment-142047">Kylopod</a> surmised that the roots of the snowclone were vaudevillian, and performers in the vaudeville tradition may very well have played a key role. But apparently so did the cartoonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tad_Dorgan">Thomas Aloysius "TAD" Dorgan</a>. Dorgan has been credited with many neologisms, even when the credit was undeserved &#8212; most notably <a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2847/"><em>hot dog</em></a>, which long predated his cartooning career. His slangy usage was undoubtedly influential, though, and one reflection of that was the humorous formula, "I'm the guy who&#8230;" One <a href="http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~dan/P3/info.html">page on Dorgan</a> explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">He coined the gag phrase "I'm the guy who&#8230;" around 1910, using it as a stock saying by one of the characters in a comic strip he was drawing. The phrase became quite popular and innumerable variations were made to the original concept. </span></p>
<p>And S.J. Perelman, in a reminiscence of Dorgan in the Apr. 23, 1978 <em>New York Times Sunday Magazine</em> ("How I Learned to Wink and Leer"), wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">About that time, Tad started popularizing his "I'm the guy" sayings, and I promptly added two socko examples to my persiflage, "I'm the guy who put salt in the ocean" and "I'm the guy who put the pep in pepper."</span></p>
<p>As Perelman's examples illustrate, Dorgan used a more general boastful formula ("put [the] salt in the ocean") as well as the now-familiar "X in AXB" format ("put the pep in pepper"). I'm not sure when exactly Dorgan started using these, but 1910 seems about right. Here's a description of a vaudeville performer in Atlantic City, NJ from that year, indicating that the general formula was in use (though perhaps not yet in the "X in AXB" form):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Beginning Monday, Eva Tanguay will be the topline performer at the shore &#8212; on the stage at least. It is surely not going too far to predict that she will score a hit, for although there are some who insist that she is not the one who put the salt in the ocean, it is generally agreed that it was she who put the ginger into vaudeville.<br />
("Sea-going Washington Ripples," <em>Washington Post</em>, July 10, 1910, p. S3)</span></p>
<p>There was evidently a Dorgan-inspired vaudeville song with the title "I'm the Guy Who Put the Salt in the Ocean" at the time. I haven't seen lyrics from it, but it probably approximated this verse of boasts from 1912:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>I'm The Guy</em><br />
Who?<br />
Me?<br />
Oh! I'm his nibs who put the ribs<br />
In umbrella;<br />
I'm the gink who gave the stink<br />
To gasolene;<br />
I'm the chap who put the snap<br />
In sarsaparilla;<br />
Why, I'm the guy who put the fry<br />
In cottolene!<br />
[etc.]<br />
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NwRQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR4-IA248"><em>The Summary</em></a>, Oct. 19, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p>Though Dorgan's "I'm the guy who put the pep in pepper" may have been the pioneer of the "X in AXB" form c. 1910, the formula spread like wildfire beginning in the summer of 1912. Here are some of the examples I've found from that year:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">An exchange in referring to a noted introduction made during the Democratic National convention at Baltimore quotes it thusly: "I take great pleasure in introducing Mayor Fitzgerald, of the Hub &#8212; the guy who put the Boss in Boston." ("Retort and Comment," <em>Daily Independent</em>, Monessen, Pa., June 28, 1912, p. 4)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Sam Finkelman, better known to his cronies as "Battling" Shea, because real fighters are all "Irishers," essayed another feat of swimming yesterday. Sam is the guy who put the "swim" in swimming. ("Sam, He's A Towboat," <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 22, 1912, p. 5)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">"Don't you know who that is?" returned her escort. "He's the guy who put the din in dinner." (<em>Daily Gazette</em>, Xenia, Ohio, Aug. 23, 1912, p. 4)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hen Dill, engineer of the coal barge "Pickel," is dead set on finding the party who put the missis in the Mississippi. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JLwfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA347"><em>Platts Power</em></a>, Sep. 3, 1912, p. 347)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Larry Doyle is the anarchist who put the might in dynamite. ("Larry's Day of Labor," <em>New York Times</em>, Sep. 3, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The weather man is the guy who put air in fair. (<em>Indianapolis Star</em>, Sep. 4, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Post office patrons are looking for the guy who put ail in mail. (<em>Indianapolis Star</em>, Sep. 5, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">T.R. is the man who put the surge in "insurgent." (<em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>, Sep. 9, 1912, p. 6)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Pseudo-humorists have strained their imaginations in the attempt to tributize those fanciful characters who "put salt in the ocean," the "moo" in the moose movement, and other pale inanities, and all the time they have allowed the man who put the pink in lemonade to go down, unrhapsodized, to the grave. ("He Put Pink in Lemonade," <em>Washington Post</em>, Oct. 6, 1912, p. E4)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">We are informed that a man named Woodward is the person who put the stir in registers. (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iY5MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA727">Electric Railway Journal</a></em>, Oct. 10, 1912, p. 727)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Each party claims it was the other that put the boss in Boston. ("Editorial Points," <em>Boston Daily Globe</em>, Oct. 25, 1912, p. 12)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Coming straight to the point in the first paragraph, Alfred P. Edge introduces himself as the guy who put the leg, or the horn &#8212; maybe both &#8212; in the White Leghorn. (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gjgfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA12">Advertising and Selling</a></em>, Nov. 1912, p. 12)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">I now know that Dixon's Eterno and Dixon's Endurance are the guys who put the pen in pencils. (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJ3mAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3515">Graphite</a></em>, Nov. 1912, p. 3515) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The attendance this year broke all records, and is 30 per cent larger than that of last year, which proves, beyond all doubt, that Dr. Denny is the man "who put the crease in increase." (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DyrPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA317">Phi Gamma Delta</a></em>, Nov. 1912, p. 317)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Mr. D.</em> Who put the pie in Pioneer? <em>A.</em> They won't tell. (<a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064640137;view=1up;seq=298;start=1;size=10;page=search"><em>Telephone Review</em></a>, Nov. 1912, p. 298)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is decidedly adventitious for Aleck Smart to ask who put the vent in ventilator. Why not interrogate us as to the identity of the individual who put the nick in our last nickel and made us walk home? (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JLwfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA695">Platts Power</a></em>, Nov. 5, 1912, p. 695)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The other day, down on Yale Field, Johnny Mack, the trainer, was chasing after the squad, yelling: "Fundamentals, boys, fundamentals: look out for your fundamentals," when one of the husky ones stopped running and said to Mack: "Say, John. I would give a whole lot to see the man who put the 'fun' in fundamentals." ("Football Notes," <em>Boston Daily Globe</em>, Nov. 7, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Because, therefore, of the prompt and efficient action of the Southern gentleman, our justly celebrated Mayor appears, according to the Bull Moose paragrapher, to be "the guy who put the 'shun' in auction." (<em>New York Tribune</em>, Nov. 10, 1912, p. 2)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The directors of the Pennsylvania railroad have elected Mr. Rea president to succeed Mr. McCrea. You hear a good deal about the persons who put the this in that, but the Pennsy directors are the men who took the Mac out of McCrea. ("A Line-o'-Type or Two," <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>, Nov. 15, 1912, p. 6)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">[Harvard crew coach Percy Haughton:] "Perhaps, the Yale men get too much training, and have to hunt to find who put the 'fun' in fundamentals; but don't forget two years ago, when everything pointed to a sweeping Harvard victory and Yale got a scoreless tie and a virtual victory." ("Harvard Club Celebrates Crew's Victory," <em>Boston Daily Globe</em>, Nov. 20, 1912, p. 8)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The Colonial asserts that the guy who put the can in canvass is H.R. Henry, its assistant manager in Elizabeth. (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mURJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294">Insurance Press</a></em>, Nov. 20, 1912, p. 12)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">A new member of the House who will leap into promeince because of the prominence of the man he defeated is Stanly Bowdin of Ohio. He is the man who put the nick in "Nick" Longworth. ("The Man That Beat 'Nick' Longworth," <em>Hartford Courant</em>, Nov. 27, 1912, p. 18)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">What we want is the man who put the organ in organize. (<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dpM1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA21">The Paper Maker's Journal</a></em>, Dec. 1912, p. 21)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">You could then consider Pickerill, in the language of the "funny men" in our newspapers, as the man who put the dent in a fortunate dental incident. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qbazAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA408"><em>Journal of the Allied Dental Societies</em></a>, Dec. 1912, p. 408)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Louis Hess, the man who put the V in vests, devoted his evenings to writing letters home and studying Esperanto. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7wZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA67"><em>The Packages</em></a>, Dec. 1912, p. 67)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">E.T. Allen, of Portland, introduced as "the man who put the 'con' in conservation." (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NA5UAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA47"><em>Proceedings of the Western Forestry Conference</em></a>, Dec. 1912, p. 47)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">With the completion of the recent tranquil champai&#8211; I mean campaign&#8211; the transformation of the steam roller into a moving van, and the evolution of the indisputable reality that I am the guy who put the Sag in Sagamore and the Aft in Taft, we must seriously consider the genesis of the administration thrust upon my academic capabilities through the kind auspices of Mr. Theodore Roosevelt; I thank Mr. Roosevelt profusely for my election. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=m-INAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA7-PA26"><em>Chicago Commerce</em></a>, Dec. 6, 1912, p. 26)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">As we understand the situation, it was the Servians who put the "stir" in Monastir. ("Pen Points," <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Dec. 7, 1912, p. II6)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">"Who Put the Con in Conversation?" (<em>Boston Daily Globe</em>, Dec. 13, 1912, p. 10)</span></p>
<p>Note that by October 6, according to the <em>Washington Post</em>, the formula had already descended into "pale inanities" from "pseudo-humorists." There were more creative examples in circulation, though. In early 1913, Allen S. Olmsted advertised an antiseptic powder called "Allen's Foot-Ease." Olmsted called himself "The Man who put the EEs in FEET":</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z7dZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA10&amp;ci=35%2C795%2C451%2C209&amp;source=bookclip"><img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/footease.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's a nice chiastic example from the <em>Berkshire Eagle</em> (by way of <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rDhDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA34">The Vocationist</a></em>, Oct. 1913):</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Josh Fruhlinger was morpho-syntactically unhappy about <em>Shoe</em> for 9/21/2011 ("<a href="http://joshreads.com/?p=10927">Josh puts the 'long' in 'long-winded'</a>", The Comics Curmudgeon 9/21/2011):</p>
<p><a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CrankInCranky.gif"><img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CrankInCranky.gif" alt="" width="490" /></a><a></a><br />
<span id="more-3465"></span></p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Here’s the thing about jokes of the form “you put the X in Y,” where X represents one or more syllables in Y: the humor only works if the X makes up a part of Y even though the two words are not related semantically. For instance, if your significant other had travelled into orbit as part of the U.S. space program, it would be funny if, after admiring their attractive backside, you said, “Baby, you put the ‘ass’ in ‘astronaut.’” However, if you were dating an Olympic champion, you shouldn’t say, “Baby, you put the ‘win’ in ‘winner,’” as that would sound very, very stupid. “Crank,” in the sense of an eccentric, obsessive person, is actually derived from “cranky,” so the level of wordplay here is pretty disappointing to say the least.</span></p>
<p>Josh's analysis rings true, although he confesses that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">OK, I admit that I launched into that etymological and linguistic lecture entirely because I’m particularly proud of the “you put the ‘ass’ in ‘astronaut’” joke I thought up.</span></p>
<p>But there's at least one famous source of "put the X in Y" examples, where X and Y are not only "related semantically" but in fact are semantically identical (at least in the sense that both are semantically null) &#8212; the 1961 doo-wop song "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXmsLe8t_gg">Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp</a>":</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="420" height="315" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lXmsLe8t_gg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lXmsLe8t_gg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?<br />
Who put the ram in the ram a lam a ding dong?<br />
Who put the bop in the bop shoo bop shoo bop?<br />
Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?</span></p>
<p>Of course, there will be some objections to the idea that these phrases have no meaning, starting with this passage from the song itself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">When my baby heard<br />
"bomp bah bah bomp bah bomp bah bomp bah"<br />
every word went right into her heart</span></p>
<p>The argument is even more strongly supported by the song's ending, which directly challenges the widespread view that music is non-referential:</p>
<p>These examples from the current Google News archive can't compare in eloquence and wit, although they conform to Josh's rule:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Caps still need to put the 'pow' in power play<br />
Put the 'O' in October.<br />
Females Put the “Cheat” in Cheetahs</span></p>
<p>And as a Simpsons' fan, I'm a bit disappointed in the title of this musical <a href="http://broadwayworld.com/article/WE-PUT-THE-SPRING-IN-SPRINGFIELD-Simpsons-Tribute-Plays-the-Triad-101312-20110928">coming soon to New York City</a>, although it again obeys Josh's dictum:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">3 Nerds and a Girl productions will present a one-night-only performance of WE PUT THE SPRING IN SPRINGFIELD: THE MUSIC OF THE SIMPSONS, a tribute to the most successful animated show of all time - on Thursday, October 13, 2011 at 7PM at the Triad Theatre, 158 West 72nd St. in New York City.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to John Burns, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/world/europe/reporter-threatens-to-disclose-who-ordered-phone-hacking-at-british-paper.html">Reporter Threatens to Name Names in Phone Hacking Scandal</a>", NYT 9/30/2011:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">A reporter who is among the 16 people arrested and then freed on bail in the phone hacking case that has shaken Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in Britain warned his former bosses on Friday that he planned to break his silence on the scandal in a civil court case. He said that he would reveal those who were responsible for the phone hacking.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">The reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, 49, who was the chief reporter for the now-defunct tabloid The News of the World, gave the warning in a statement issued through his lawyers in connection with his wrongful-dismissal lawsuit against News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation. [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">“There is so much I could have said publicly to the detriment of News International but so far have chosen not to,” he said. “<strong>At the length</strong>, truth will out.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-3463"></span></p>
<p>It's obvious what Mr. Thurlbeck means by "at the length" &#8212;  "eventually", or perhaps "in the end". But "at the length", with this meaning, is an idiom that I don't recall having encountered before. {Though I should remember its use in The Merchant of Venice &#8212; see the <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3463#comment-141808">comment</a> by Ian Preston.]</p>
<p>The British National Corpus has 14 hits for "at the length", but they are all things like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">A number of the firms express concern at the length of the proposed report.<br />
Doctor Braby[&#8230;] boldly essayed a guess at the length of time it had actually been in the water.<br />
Experienced angel breeders look at the length difference of the finnage<br />
You may be surprised at the length and diversity of this list.</span></p>
<p>And similarly for the 17 hits in the COCA (contemporary American) corpus.</p>
<p>However, when we turn to the LION ("Literature Online") corpus, we find plenty of relevant hits from the 16th and early 17th centuries. Thus William Baldwin,  "Christe to his Spouse", from <em>The canticles of Salomon</em> (1549):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Of all the gydes that Israel euer had,<br />
In wyt, in welth, in peace, prince Salomon<br />
The chyefest Kyng, was not a litle glad<br />
Of a vineyard he had at Baalhamon.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Whiche vineyard though it pleased his desyer,<br />
Yet <strong>at the length</strong> he let it furth to hyer<br />
To kepers suche, who yerely euery one<br />
Should for suche frute as they tooke thence away,<br />
Of syluer good a thousand pieces paye.</span></p>
<p>Or Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, <em>Of the Vanitie and vncertaintie of Artes and Sciences, Englished by Ia. San. Gent</em> (1530), chapter 48, "Of Iuglinge":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">I being also a yonge man wrote of Magicall matters three bookes in a sufficiet large volume, whiche I haue entituled of hidden Philosophie, in whiche bookes whatsoeuer was then done amisse thorough curious youth, now beinge more aduised I wil that it be recanted with this retractation, for I haue in times paste consumed very much time and substaunce in these vanities. <strong>At the length</strong> I gotte this profit thereby, that I knowe by what meanes I shoulde discourage and dissuade others from this destruction. For all they that presume to diuine and prophecie not in the truthe, not in the vertue of God, but in the elusion of deuils, according to the operation of wicked sprites, and exercisiug deceits of Idolatrie, and shewinge illusions and vayne visions, the whiche sodainely ceasinge, they auaunt that they can woorke miracles, by Magicall vanities, exorcismes, inchauntments, drinkes of loue Agogimes, and other diuelish, woorkes, al these with Iamnes and Mambres and Simon Magus shalbe condemned to the paynes of euerlastinge fire.</span></p>
<p>At the length" occurs three times in the King James Bible (1611) &#8212; twice in  "The Translators to the Readers", first here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Now the Church of Rome would seeme <strong>at the length</strong> to beare a motherly affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in their mother tongue: but indeed it is a gift, not deseruing to be called a gift, an vnprofitable gift: they must first get a License in writing before they may vse them, and to get that, they must approue themselues to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if not frozen in the dregs, yet sowred with the leauen of their superstition.</span></p>
<p>And then here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Neither did wee thinke much to consult the Translators or Commentators, <em>Chaldee, Hebrewe, Syrian, Greeke</em>, or <em>Latine</em>, no nor the <em>Spanish, French, Italian</em>, or <em>Dutch</em>; neither did we disdaine to reuise that which we had done, and to bring backe to the anuill that which we had hammered: but hauing and vsing as great helpes as were needfull, and fearing no reproch for slownesse, nor coueting praise for expedition, wee haue <strong>at the length</strong>, through the good hand of the Lord vpon vs, brought the worke to that passe that you see.</span></p>
<p>And once in Proverbs 29:21</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">He that delicately bringeth vp his seruant from a child, shall haue him become his sonne <strong>at the length</strong>.</span></p>
<p>The OED gives several senses for the phrase "at length",of which this is the relevant one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>b.</strong> After a long time; at or in the end; in the long run. †Also <strong>at the length.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>But the only example with the is the biblical one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>1611 </strong> <em> Bible (A.V.) </em>Prov. xxix. 21   He that delicately bringeth vp his seruant from a child, shall haue him become his sonne at the length.</span></p>
<p>So, in sum, "at the length" seems to be an idiom that was current in the English of four or five centuries ago, and has apparently survived in some regional variety or professional cant, from which it surfaced yesterday in Mr. Thurlbeck's statement.</p>

<p>There was a fair amount of amused commentary in the media and the blogosphere &#8212; see "<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3428">A movement too far</a>", 9/14/2011. And as I noted then, a Kindle e-book bought and downloaded as of that date still contained the error:</p>

<p>Yesterday evening at 7:07 p.m. &#8212; on 9/30/2011, exactly 23 days, 23 hours and 42 minutes after Susan's Facebook post &#8212; I got a nice note from amazon's Customer Service Department, which begins:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Hello,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">We're writing about your past Kindle purchase of Baby, I'm Yours by Susan Andersen. The version you received had Typos that have been corrected.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">An updated version of Baby, I'm Yours (ASIN:B000MAHC1S) is now available.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">You can receive the new version by replying to this email with the word "Yes" in the first line of your response. Within 2 hours, any device with an active wireless connection that is registered to your account and that has the eBook currently downloaded will be updated automatically.</span></p>
<p>It turns out that there are some issues involved that had never occurred to me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">In order to ensure that your notes, highlights, bookmarks and furthest reading location are retained in the new version, please check to see that all of your devices that you have used to read this book are connected to a network and that their Annotations Backup settings are turned on. For help with modifying settings, go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindlesupport" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/kindlesupport</a> and check the help pages for the devices or applications you are using.</span></p>
<p>As it happens, I have no notes, highlights, bookmarks or furthest reading locations to retain &#8212; all that I did with the book was to buy it and do a screencopy of the crucial segment. Anyhow, I'm sticking with my original version, even if I can't sell it to someone else as if it were a stamp with part of the image printed upside-down. Maybe I'll develop a taste for romance novels.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I missed this when it came out &#8212; Virgina Morell, "<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/elephants-have-an-alarm-call-for.html">Elephants Have an Alarm Call for Bees</a>", Science Now 4/26/2011:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">East Africa’s elephants face few threats in their savanna home, aside from humans and lions. But the behemoths are terrified of African bees, and with good reason. An angry swarm can sting elephants around their eyes and inside their trunks and pierce the skin of young calves. Now, a new study shows that the pachyderms utter a distinctive rumble in response to the sound of bees, the first time an alarm call has been identified in elephants.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8230; [T]he study suggests that this alarm call isn’t just a generalized vocalization but means specifically, “Bees!” says Lucy King, a postgraduate zoologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom and the study’s lead author.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">When they hear buzzing bees, the pachyderms turn and run away, shaking their heads while making a call that King terms the “bee rumble."</span></p>
<p><span id="more-3461"></span></p>
<p>The associated scientific paper is Lucy King et al., "<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010346">Bee Threat Elicits Alarm Call in African Elephants</a>", PLoS ONE 5(3) 2010. Here's what the "bee rumble" sounds like:</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was not much media uptake for this story &#8212; aside from Science, only New Scientist seems to have <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18821-elephantspeak-for-beware-of-the-bees.html">responded</a> to the press release.</p>
<p>At the other end of the acoustic spectrum, there are the ultrasonic vocalizations of rats, which alleged have a simple relationship to their neurochemistry. Thus  S.M. Brudzynski, "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106451/">Communication of adult rats by ultrasonic vocalization: biological, sociobiological, and neuroscience approaches</a>", ILAR J 2009:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">Rats have developed antipredator defensive adaptations to protect themselves from the large number of animals that prey on them. One such adaptation is the ability to communicate by ultrasonic vocalization, which decreases the likelihood of detection by a predator. [&#8230;] Adult rats emit two types of ultrasonic calls: alarm (22 kHz) calls, in aversive and dangerous situations, and appetitive (50 kHz) calls, in appetitive or "friendly" (i.e., nonaggressive) behavioral situations. These two types of calls differ in all acoustic parameters, and their initiation depends on activity in different ascending tegmental pathways to the forebrain: 22 kHz calls require activity in the cholinergic system, and 50 kHz calls in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The release of acetylcholine in the diencephalon and forebrain is associated with the emission of 22 kHz vocalizations, and the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens with 50 kHz calls. Thus the two calls are reliable predictors of increased cholinergic or dopaminergic activity in the brain. The calls serve as indices of the rat's state, including its affective state, induced by activity of one or the other neurochemical system.</span></p>
<p>Here's 22 kHz rat vocalization, identified as a "distress call", and slowed way down:</p>
<p>Some similarly slowed-down calls in the 40-50-kHz neighborhood:</p>
<p>And here's a 60+ kHz vocalization, also slowed down:</p>
<p>A suggestion that things might not be so simple can be found in Ronald J. Barfield et al., "<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3882327">Ultrasonic Vocalizations in Rat Sexual Behavior</a>", <em>American Zoologist </em>19(2) 1979:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Ultrasonic vocalizations are very conspicuous during rat mating  activity. Two types of calls are produced by both sexes. The                      first, brief complex calls with the main frequency  centered about 50 kHz, occur primarily in conjunction with solicitation                      and mounting activity. The second type of call is  the long, 22 kHz whistle which is emitted mainly by the male during the                      postejaculatory refractory period, but also by both  male and female at other times during the copulatory sequence. [&#8230;] Following ejaculation, the male  characteristically emits 22 kHz vocalizations and exhibits a sleep-like  EEG pattern.                      The function of the postejaculatory vocalization  may be to enforce separation between the mating pair, while at the same time                      maintaining contact between the partners. </span></p>
<p>An experiment sure to make it big in the media: the effect of humanized FOXP2  on rodent sexual vocalizations. The 2009 study of mice with humanized FOXP2 was sort of a disappointment ("<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1478">Mice with the "language gene" stay mum</a>", 6/4/2009), because pretty much the only measured effect was to make the separation cries of pups somewhat lower and flatter in pitch. Nevertheless, the study got wide coverage in the mass media. Can you imagine the impact if they had studied sex vocalizations instead?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago, Greta van Susteren interviewed Sarah Palin on Fox ("<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/index.html#/v/1185953046001/maverick-palin-vs-quasi-reality-show/">'Maverick' Palin vs. 'Quasi Reality Show'</a>", 9/27/2011).  Out of the whole 16-minute segment, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;btnmeta_news_search=1&amp;q=shackle-y">one word got the lion's share of the coverage</a>.  Thus Sheila Marikar, "<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/sarah-palin-is-a-campaign-too-shackle-y/">Sarah Palin: ‘Is a Title and Campaign Too Shackle-y?</a>’", ABC News 9/27/2011:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">A Palin presidency: Too “shackle-y?”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">That’s what Sarah Palin suggested on Fox News’ “On The Record with Greta VanSusteren” tonight [&#8230;] “Is a title worth it?” she asked, rhetorically. “Does a title shackle a person? Are they someone like me who’s maverick? I do go rogue and I call it like I see it and I don’t mind stirring it up in order to get people to think and debate aggressively.” </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">“Is a title and a campaign too shackle-y?,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-3459"></span>Andrew Sullivan picked up the thread ("<a href="http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/09/q-2.html">It's Not A Miss Universe Contest, Mrs Palin</a>", 9/28/2011):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #800000;">"Shackle-y" now joins "refudiate".</span></span></p>
<p>The Economist's Johnson Blog promptly refudiated Sullivan ("<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2011/09/neologisms">Shackle-y, sir, is no refudiate</a>", 9/28/2011)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Andrew Sullivan [&#8230;] lumped "shackle-y" with her "refudiate" moment, in which she conflated "repudiate" and "refute". They're not the same thing at all, though. Ms Palin clearly made a mistake with "refudiate".  "Shackle-y", though not in dictionaries, is the kind of thing available to English speakers with a knowledge of their language's word-building rules. Nonce coinages from squidlike to unputdownable to Vampire Weekend-esque are all allowed in English. They aren't malapropisms, any more than "malapropism" is: the word comes from a tongue-tied literary character, Mrs Malaprop, and a common English suffix, "-ism". Being able to coin words on the fly as needed, within certain rules-governed boundaries, is one of the things that makes English English, not to mention fun. I'm no fan of Ms Palin's politics, but she is interesting to watch. It's precisely things like "shackle-y" that delight her fans and drive her foes up the wall.</span></p>
<p>'Johnson' is entirely right about English morphology, but I believe that all of these articles are wrong about what Ms. Palin actually said.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant passage as a whole:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">I'm going to keep repeating though, Greta,<br />
through my process of decision making with my family and with my close friends as to whether I should throw my name in the hat for<br />
the GOP<br />
nomination or not um for twenty twelve.<br />
Is a title<br />
worth it? It- it-<br />
Does a title shackle a person?<br />
Are they- someone like me, who's maverick, you know, I do go rogue and I call it like I see it and I don't mind stirring it up in order to get people to think and debate aggressively<br />
and- and um to find solutions to the problems that our- our country's facing.<br />
Somebody like me,  is a title and is a campaign too shackling?<br />
Does that prohibit me from being out there<br />
um out of a box<br />
not allowing handlers<br />
to shape me and to<br />
um force my message to be what<br />
donors or what contributors or what political pundits want it to be?<br />
uh- uh- does a title  take away my freedom to call it like I see it<br />
and to affect positive change that we (('ve seen)) need in this country.<br />
That's the biggest uh contemplation piece in my process.</span></p>
<p>Here's the crucial sentence:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #800000;">Somebody like me, is a title and is a campaign too shackling?</span></span></p>
<p>And the crucial pair of words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">&#8230; too shackling?</span></p>
<p>It's clear that Ms. Palin says "shackling", not "shackle-y". The way that she said it is still interesting, however, even if it's not nearly as entrancingly idiosyncratic as The Economist's blogger took it to be. It's a nice example of a phenomenon discussed in an earlier LL post "<a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3037">Symbols and signals in g-dropping</a>", 3/23/2011. In that case, the speaker was Tim Pawlenty, someone else whose English pronunciation hails from the upper midwest.</p>
<p>If you listen carefully, you'll hear that Ms. Palin pronounces "shackling" as [ˈʃæklin]. This variant of the<em> -ing</em> ending has the coronal nasal of the form often written <em>-in</em>', but it has the vowel of <em>seen</em> rather than the vowel of <em>sin</em>. As a result, it's often perceived and transcribed as the standard version of -ing &#8212; here [ˈʃæklɪŋ] &#8212; rather than as the "g-dropping" variant, which here would be [ˈʃæklɪn].</p>
<p>Those of you who are familiar with reading spectrograms may find this plot of "shackling" helpful &#8212; I've marked the second formant in -ing in acqua, and you can see that it's at around 2700 Hz near the nasal, whereas her KIT vowel has F2 around 1900 or 2000:</p>
<p><a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PalinShackling1.png"><img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PalinShackling1.png" alt="" width="490" /></a></p>
<p>As you can also see (as well as hear), she renders the word with three syllables, with a syllabic /l/ as the nucleus of the second one.</p>
<p>So to sum up, Ms. Palin says "shackle-ing", not "shackle-y", but she gives the /l/ its own syllable, and pronounces the <em>-ing</em> with the high front vowel of <em>lea</em>n rather than the lower and backer vowel of <em>Lynn. </em>And the context is one where an adjective is expected ("Is a title and is a campaign too ___?"),  so it's not surprising that someone unfamiliar with this variety of English might have transcribed it as "shackle-y".</p>

<p>Mouseover title: "Funding was quickly restored to the NHC and the APA was taken back off hurricane forecast duty."</p>
<p><span id="more-3458"></span></p>
<p>This strip illustrates an important linguistic concept: acronyms and proper names are words too. At least, you need acronyms and proper names in your mental lexicon in order to appreciate this joke.</p>
<p>Specifically, you can't understand why this is strip is funny unless you know that Piaget was a psychologist who developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget_stages">a theory of the stages of children's cognitive development</a>, that the NHC is the National Hurricane Center, and that the APA is the American Psychological Association. (And yet, there are no acronyms or proper names in the word lists that people use in order to estimate passive vocabulary. More on this in a later post&#8230;)</p>
<p>I like the idea that budgetary exigencies might require new kinds of interdisciplinary cooperation. This would be a sort of grown-up version of <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_1997/ling001/percy.html">Walker Percy's recipe</a> for improving the teaching of literature and biology:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">I wish to propose the following educational technique which should prove equally effective for Harvard and Shreveport High School. I propose that English poetry and biology should be taught as usual, but that at irregular intervals, poetry students should find dogfishes on their desks and biology students should find Shakespeare sonnets on their dissecting boards &#8230; </span></p>
<p>So sure, put those Piagetians to work tracking hurricanes, and let the out-of-work atmospheric scientists try to predict the behavior of toddlers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Malcolm, "<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/09/obama-congressional-black-caucus-video-gaffe.html">New gaffe: Obama confuses Jews with janitors</a>", LA Times 9/26/2011:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Here is what the president actually said, catching himself almost in time but not quite:<br />
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #000080;">If asking a billionaire to pay the same tax rate as a Jew, uh, as a janitor makes me a warrior for the working class, I wear that with a badge of honor. I have no problem with that. [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Maybe in Saturday night's speech Obama was thinking about all those talks on Israel in New York.</span></p>
<p>This has gotten <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;btnmeta_news_search=1&amp;q=Obama+billionaire+Jew">quite a bit of play</a> in the media as well as in the blogosphere.  The trouble is, I'm not at all sure that Mr. Malcolm's version of the president's speech error is accurate.</p>
<p><span id="more-3457"></span></p>
<p>The full audio, video and transcript are available from whitehouse.gov: "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2011/09/24/congressional-black-caucus-foundation-phoenix-awards-dinner">Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Phoenix Awards Dinner</a>". Here's the audio and my transcript for the relevant bit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">If- if asking a billionaire to pay the same tax rate<br />
as a [dʒũnʔ] uh as- as a janitor<br />
makes me a warrior<br />
for the working class<br />
I wear that with a badge of honor</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/24/remarks-president-congressional-black-caucus-foundation-annual-phoenix-a"></a></p>
<p>Here's just the phrase with the speech error in it:</p>
<p>And just the substitution error itself:</p>
<p>If you listen carefully with headphones, I believe that you'll hear not only nasalization of the [u] vowel, but also a short [n] (which is somewhat glottalized due to being cut off by his self-correction).</p>
<p>The nasal murmur is fairly clear in a spectrogram &#8212; I've underlined it in red in the plot below, which covers the sequence <span style="color: #800000;">[dʒũnʔ] uh<span style="color: #000000;">:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ObamaBillionaireJanitor.png"><img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ObamaBillionaireJanitor.png" alt="" width="490" /></a></p>
<p>Note also the falling F2 in the first 30-40 msec of the "uh", which is consistent with a preceding coronal articulation (i.e. the [n]), but not with a preceding [u] or [w] off-glide, which should cause all the formants to be rising at the start of the vowel.</p>
<p>So my diagnosis is that Mr. Obama started to say a version of <em>janitor</em> with [u] substituted for [æ] in the first syllable, but cut himself off immediately after the error, and produced the word that he intended.</p>
<p>Why that substitution? I guess it's possible that there was interference from the word <em>Jew</em> &#8212; but I don't think it was a simple lexical substitution, because the nasal from<em> janitor</em> is apparently already there. And there's no obvious reason for <em>Jew</em> to be activated in that context. Of course, none of the alternative sources of lexical interference strike me as being especially plausible either &#8212; June? junior? juniper? jupiter? &#8212; but not every segmental substitution error has a clear lexical source.</p>
<p>At this point, I should repeat my long-standing conviction that speech errors, by politicians and others, are rarely if ever worth the fuss that they sometimes generate:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's some interesting socio-politico-linguistic discussion, along with links to a lot more of the same, in Dylan Stableford's post "<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/associated-press-transcription-obama-cbc-speech-racist-173438340.html">Was the Associated Press transcription of Obama’s CBC speech ‘racist’?</a>", The Cutline 9/26/2011.

<p><span id="more-3456"></span></p>
<p>Stableford is referring to a discussion of the issue on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/282400/the-obama-administration-obama-tells-cbc-audience-to-stop-complainin#161:466">Chris Hayes' MSNBC show</a>. I generally agree with  John McWhorter's side in that discussion, rather than Karen Hunter's side.</p>
<p>But it's worth noting that if you hold your nose and wade into the comments sections of various sites to look at the reactions to this issue, you'll find stuff like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8230;&#8230;..stop complainin' (drop the g)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.git to workin' (drop the g)&#8230;&#8230;..git outen them slippers y'all been wearin' (drop the g) all day an' hep me git y'all some jobs &#8230;&#8230;.whatever a "job" is&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;'cause ah ain't never had one&#8230;&#8230;don'cha see ?&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Notice the Chimp is Wearing his Dark Shade Face make up, and he’s working his Best Buckwheat ‘Pork N Beans’ Semi Sambo Accent for the Moronic Mutants to eat up like a bowl of steaming chitlins and collar greens…..y-all god’s childrens loves chitlins…</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Feel the rage, feel the hatred of the darling negro. It’s all about the negrofication of America.</span></p>
<p>Those are from Andrew Breitbart's site, but you can find similar stuff  in many other places, including in ineffectively moderated comments  sections of mainstream media outlets. For example, the comments at news.yahoo.com on the Stableford post include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">Plain and Simple&#8230;.This Kenyan Pimp can not SPEAK without the aid of his trusty teleprompter&#8230;.<br />
His 'Uhh's, Ahhh's, Ummm's, ect, ect. make him sound dumber than a pro sports athlete&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">Didi anyone notice he didn't say, "we have work to do" as is stated by  the AP version? He said, "we got work to do". Now, if they had stated  that little goof can you imagine how they blacks would be yelling  racism. Why don't they just learn to speak english and then there won't  be any problems.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">blacks are capable of speaking correctly, but they have CHOSEN to use  their own "black dialect" for years because they want to separate  themselves from whitey. Most blacks in America are the most racist  people you will ever meet.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;">No speech by anyone should be cleaned up!!! It should be printed letter  for letter, word for word  how it is said!! Why cover up bad grammer??   that's covering up stupidity!!</span></p>
<p>Summing up briefly: "Eye dialect" in transcriptions is a questionable journalistic choice, whether the speaker is Sarah Palin, Tim Pawlenty, or Barack Obama; but it's not necessarily a racist choice, and I don't think that it was a racist choice in this case. However, there are a lot of racists out there; and many of them use eye dialect as a focus for their feelings of disgust and hated.</p>
<p>[I've left comments closed on this post, because I'm going to be in meetings or classes most of the day. As Anil Dash explains, "<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html">If your website's full of assholes, it's your fault</a>"; and I won't have time today to carry out his anti-asshole prescriptions. But if you have something substantive to say, send it to me by email and I'll add it.]</p>
<p>Update &#8212; More here: Tommy Christopher, "<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ap-reporter-responds-to-panel-debate-on-racism-of-droppin-gs/">AP Reporter Responds To Chris Hayes Panel Debate On Racism Of Droppin’ G’s From Obama Speech</a>". Mediaite 9/25/2011, which quotes the AP reporter in question, Mark Smith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Normally, I lean toward the clean-it-up school of quote transcribing –  for everyone. But in this case, the President appeared to be making such  a point of dropping Gs, and doing so in a rhythmic fashion, that for me  to insert them would run clearly counter to his meaning. I believe I  was respecting his intent in this. Certainly disrespect was the last  thing I intended.</span></p>
<p>[As of 9:00 p.m. Philadelphia time, I'm opening comments for a while. We'll see how it goes.]</p>
