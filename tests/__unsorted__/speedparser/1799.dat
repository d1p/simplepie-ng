Girls clutched at each other in tears, while a group of young men stood in silence reading the tributes to their dead friend, the eighth teenager to die violently in London this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this spot on Friday during the late afternoon bustle that Yemurai Lovemore Kanyangarara, a 16-year-old with hopes of going to university, was stabbed in the neck in broad daylight as shoppers looked on, a brazen attack that left even police shocked. The blow severed an artery and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After laying a bouquet of flowers with a card which stated "Gonna miss you a lot Yemz", Shaquille Keith, 16, said his friend kept out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His face streaked with tears, he said: "You couldn't not like him, he was so kind." Asked why he thought Kanyangarara had been targeted, Keith articulated how disturbingly common deaths caused by knife crime have become, and the impact they are having on south London communities. "It was just one of those things," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are hunting for three teenagers, who they said had gone on the run from their homes after the attack and were still fugitives on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne urged them to think of Kanyangarara's family, who fled violence in Zimbabwe when he was a toddler, and give themselves up. "We currently have three frightened teenage boys who we know have left home and are on the run from police, possibly hiding in the Greater London area. This cannot go on forever and sooner or later they will have to speak to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am appealing for them to come forward now for the sake of Yemurai's family who, needless to say, are absolutely devastated by his death." The attack, described by Dunne as one of the worst killings he has investigated, happened on the busy high street at 5pm, moments after Kanyangarara had stepped off a bus with a friend. Police believe his neck was slashed, before three teenage boys ran from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Donn, co-owner of the nearby Loose Linen shop, described holding a towel to Kanyangarara's neck to stem the blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I tried talking to him but he was not at all responsive. I asked what his name was, but his eyes were closed," he said. "No one could have saved that boy, he was gone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are believed to have identified the attackers. Friends said Kanyangarara, a keen footballer, had no links to local gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was always the calm one, he didn't get into fights. He was just so talented, he didn't deserve this," said friend Natalie Miller, 16. "He wasn't in a gang, he didn't do anything wrong. They need to find the killer. It wasn't his time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigel Fisher, headteacher at St Columba's Roman Catholic boys' school in Bexleyheath, where Kanyangararaich  had attended, said he had been planning to go on to university. "He had ability and he was going to use it," he said. "His death is, in a true sense, completely tragic. What a waste of a wonderful life that lay ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/knifecrime"&gt;Knife crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping"&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The story is the same for the troubled Finnish phone manufacturer in every country over a 12-month or six-month period, with a collapse in market share that bodes badly ahead of its quarterly financial results due this Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is no more encouraging for RIM, which according to Kantar has seen a huge fall in the number of sales in the US, the world's biggest smartphone market. There its share has fallen from 32.5% in June 2010 to just 10.6% in March 2011, meaning that it only sold an estimated 1.4m devices there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is also being rapidly eclipsed by Android devices, though Kantar notes that the introduction in the US of its iPhone to the Verizon network provided an uplift to sales, so that it actually increased its market share there. But in other countries, notably the UK, Germany, France and Japan, the iPhone saw double-digit falls in market share - which could mean that even if it is selling more phones, it is not growing the number as quickly as the market is expanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Microsoft's Windows Phone launch has made barely a ripple, with the company's share of the market falling in every country as the last of its previous-generation Windows Mobile phones are phased out. Kantar's figures suggest that only 1m Windows Phone devices were sold since they launched - around half the number that Microsoft has repeatedly said have been "shipped". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key underlying trend is that Android is growing in every country," said Dominic Sunnebo, consumer insight director for Kantar. "Windows Phone handsets have had virtually no impact on the market; until Nokia starts to produce versions of them, I don't think that we are going to see anything, because there's no key reason why you could choose one over an iPhone or Android phone - those can already do everything you might want to do with a Windows Phone handset."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunnebo warned that Apple faces serious dilution of its market share unless it expands its handset range quickly. "The lesson of Android is that if you release enough handsets, they are going to sell. It's hard for Apple to compete against that if they're only producing one new handset per year, especially when the growth in this market is among the low-end devices. Apple is profitable in the developed markets such as the US, but if you look into the future, at countries like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, there's no way that they can get serious penetration there because of the import duties adding to the sheer cost of the phone. Places like that are where [Nokia's] Symbian is dominant, and that's where Android is getting to be dominant now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumours have circulated for some time that Apple will try to expand its iPhone offering to take in low-end buyers, as it did when it expanded into the cheaper end of the digital music player market with its iPod mini in 2004. But at that time it controlled the music player market - a situation that doesn't apply with mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM faces problems because the ASP (average selling price) of its handsets is falling as it tries to expand sales - which keeps revenues strong but cuts profits. "They've realised that they can't compete with Apple and they're struggling against Android," said Sunnebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Windows Phone faces a difficult transition period while it waits for Nokia to make its move, announced in February, to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/11/nokia-microsoft-sign-strategic-tieup"&gt;bury Symbian on smartphones and replace it with Windows Phone&lt;/a&gt;. The Guardian has forecast that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/feb/17/nokia-windows-phones-october"&gt;Nokia will not be selling any Windows Phone devices before October&lt;/a&gt;, when Microsoft is expected to release a substantial upgrade to the OS, codenamed "Mango", with enhanced functionality that should put it on feature parity with iOS and Android's present capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kantar produces its figures from a global consumer panel, carrying out around 1m interviews per year in Europe alone. It tracks mobile phone purchasing and other behaviour. The data provided excludes enterprise sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones"&gt;Smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And to clarify the law around the existing defences of fair comment and justification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain will become the first country to ask parliament to set out its libel laws, and provide greater clarity, his officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wants large corporations to show they have suffered substantial damage before they sue individuals and non-governmental organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new limited privilege will be given to newspapers when reporting the proceedings of foreign parliaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft bill will also try to restrict libel tourism. The Commons select committee argued last year that it was humiliating that the US Congress was passing laws to prevent American citizens being sued in the UK courts. Anyone of any nationality can at present sue in the British courts as long as they can prove they have a reputation to defend in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill will also update defamation laws on the internet so as to provide greater defence for internet service providers. Government sources said they were still working on details of how to handle libel on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libel law experts were impressed by both the rhetoric and the detail in Clegg's remarks, saying Clegg has set himself a high bar. The bill is being prepared by Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat minister in the justice department, who has said libel law reform will be a chief test of how he judges his own ministerial career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source said the reforms collectively would have had the effect of putting the Guardian in a substantially better position in all its recent libel tussles, involving Tesco, Barclays, Trafigura, and Simon Singh, the science writer sued by the British Chiropractic Association for a piece written for Guardian comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg will say the British libel laws have had a chilling effect on investigative journalism and scientific inquiry. "It is simply not right when academics and journalists are effectively bullied into silence by the prospect of costly legal battles with wealthy individuals and big businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill will also find ways of limiting foreign claimants bringing cases against foreign defendants in English courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a move that is likely to be fiercely fought, the draft bill is likely to expect corporations taking action against individuals or not-for-profit organisations to have to prove that their reputation and profitability has been substantially damaged by criticism made of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Kampfner, chief executive of Index on Censorship, said last night: "Nick Clegg has set out an impressively robust agenda to change our defamation laws … the commitments he is making marks a victory for the more than 50,000 people who have backed the Libel Reform Campaign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/libel-reform"&gt;Libel reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/medialaw"&gt;Media law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp;amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/trafigura-probo-koala"&gt;Trafigura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/supermarkets"&gt;Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"It's the young gang members," she said. "They're reckless, they're fearless and they scare the older members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cope accused the prime minister, David Cameron, of failing to deliver on his promises to tackle the problem and warned that the coalition's public spending cuts would unleash "an era of terror".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: "What do they think is going to happen? This is just the tip of the iceberg. Once the cuts come in, crime is going to soar and there will be no resources to deal with it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives investigating the murder of the latest victim said he was found on the fourth floor stairwell of Gannet House on the Pelican estate in Peckham, south-east London, a little after 4.30pm yesterday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ambulance crew pronounced him dead at the scene 45 minutes later. Two other male teenagers, aged 17 and 18, were treated for stab wounds, and police believe the three attacks are linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three males – two 17-year-olds and an 18-year-old – have been arrested as part of the case, which is being investigated by officers from Operation Trident, the Metropolitan police unit that tackles violent crime in London's black community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who lives on the estate told reporters the area was dangerous and urged police to increase routine patrols. The mother of two, who did not want to be named, said problems with gangs had returned after seemingly ending a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny Jones, a member of the London assembly and the Metropolitan police authority, said she feared cuts might further damage deprived areas where gang violence was already problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything that the government is doing is just making things worse for the kids on these estates," she said. "What they need is education and entertainment to distract them from getting into these violent groups. It's not a police problem; it's a social problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, promised to crack down on soaring teenage crime when he was elected in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kit Malthouse, the deputy mayor of policing, said today that although progress had been made, far more still needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the numbers of teenagers dying on our streets is well down from two years ago, it does not lessen the shock of this horrible incident," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not had a teenage murder in the city for a couple of months, but this tragedy reminds us that we still have a problem with the minority of teenagers embroiled in gang culture and serious crime, who have no respect for life or indeed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mayor and I remain committed to doing everything in our power to tackle youth violence and bring long-term change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are having some success, I am under no illusion that this is a mission that will take some time to complete."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met also acknowledged there were no easy answers to the problems of youth violence. "We have always said we are in this for the long haul and can only tackle these issues working alongside all the communities in London," said Commander Simon Pountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The message to people who commit violence is clear – we will come after you and you will be arrested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2008, the mayor and the Metropolitan police launched Operation Blunt 2, an initiative designed to tackle serious youth violence by taking thousands of weapons off the streets, arresting offenders and working with different communities to dissuade young people from carrying guns and knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures are likely to re-open the debate on knife crime. Earlier this month, it emerged that the Conservatives had decided to drop a manifesto pledge to introduce mandatory prison sentences for those caught carrying knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the prime minister appointed the former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella – whose brother, Ben, was stabbed to death in 2008 – to examine schemes designed to stop young people carrying and using knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samjones"&gt;Sam Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nine months after being created in 2006, it had a few thousand users; now it's got more than a hundred million. How? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To answer that question I created a visual history of  Twitter's growth, feeding data from Dharmesh Shah (&lt;a href="http://twittergrader.com/"&gt;developer of TwitterGrader.com&lt;/a&gt;) into &lt;a href="http://www.openheatmap.com/"&gt;OpenHeatMap&lt;/a&gt; to produce an animated visualization of the service's growth, along with information on the earliest users for each region. That gave a broad overview of the spread of the network, but I also did some independent research on user numbers in the first few months, and approached some of those early users to discover exactly what made them sign up to the service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He notes that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was expecting to see a wave of adoption spreading out of the tech hubs of the West Coast, but even back in December 2006 I found 121 users in New York, compared to 404 around the mother-ship in San Francisco. There was even a healthy bunch of early-adopters in 'flyover country', with 6 users in Boise, 13 in Salt Lake City and 8 in Kansas City."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's clearly key is that Twitter underwent a viral explosion at a key point in its life. Winning an award at SXSW 2007 was key. Its first growth spurt came when it &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/"&gt;opened itself up to the public&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's clear from these monthly charts is that the service truly was viral, even in its early days. As it got more users, they drove more users, giving you the rocketing curve every entrepreneur dreams of. It looks like a service that users loved and shared with their friends, instead of one where traffic is driven by high-profile articles and hype."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what Warden finds even more important is that for an internet startup, where you are - and where your users are - doesn't necessarily matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What surprised me most was how little geography mattered for adoption. Even in today's world of ubiquitous internet access, I expected that real-life clusters of friends would be the main vectors by which the service would spread. I don't see the sort of city-specific growth spurts I'd expect if that were true, instead the network took root wherever there were people. That has some interesting implications for anyone starting their own service, it looks like focusing on virtual communities instead of physical ones can be very effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Added:) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd also never thought of Twitter as an aspirational service, but Neha nailed the atmosphere of the early days. There was an air of exclusivity, of access to an interesting group of Valley rockstars, that gave people a reason to check it out. This feels a lot like the way that Facebook started at Ivy League colleges and then opened up progressively to lower-status groups with the promise of mixing with a 'better class' of people. That might explain why companies like Google have such a hard time launching similar services, catering to the masses they can't pretend they're exclusive, but it bodes well for Quora's approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality of its rapid adoption all over the country is hard to square with its image as an exclusive Valley club, but maybe that contradiction is the sign of exquisite marketing. Apple gives their users that same sensation of belonging to an elite, even as they sell products in malls across the country. Twitter tapped into people whose dreams were in Silicon Valley, wherever they were in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So take heart, startup people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finally, one heartening thing for me and any other starving entrepreneur is how eclectic the initial growth was. There were spurts and slowdowns in the beginning, and while it was clearly a success story even at the time, the magnitude of their long-term trajectory wasn't obvious through the noise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in a startup, does that look like the sort of growth you're seeing? Or do you think that the geography of the US - where you immediately get access to a huge market - alters the rules for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/socialnetworking"&gt;Social networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/startups"&gt;Internet startups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This, after a &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone-app-rejected-current-gv-apps-lose-connectio/"&gt;fourteen month hiatus&lt;/a&gt; in which we saw an &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/31/fcc-now-inquiring-about-atandts-involvement-in-google-voices-iph/"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/21/fcc-to-look-into-google-voice-iphone-debacle-next-week/"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the matter that culminated in a &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/09/apple-backpedaling-on-some-ios-development-restrictions-will-al/"&gt;loosening&lt;/a&gt; of App Store restrictions. So far, we're only seeing the $3 GV Connect app in the store with GV Mobile + coming sometime Saturday morning according to its developer, Sean Kovacs. No word on when the official Google Voice iPhone app will make its appearance, but surely it can't be long -- Phil must have had a chance to study the app he personally &lt;strike&gt;rejected&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/18/google-says-phil-schiller-himself-rejected-google-voice-from-the/"&gt;didn't approve&lt;/a&gt; by now, right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We'd been checking our iPhones all day long to no avail, but it's finally here. As of 1:30AM ET, GV Mobile + has been formally approved and is now available for $2.99 on the iTunes App Store.&lt;p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/18/google-voice-apps-begin-returning-to-iphone-app-store/"&gt;Google Voice apps returning to iPhone app store (update: they're here!)&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; on Sat, 18 Sep 2010 23:59:00 EST.

				&lt;i&gt;Many of us are prone to using the Shazam music-identification service whenever we encounter unfamiliar songs. After all, it's just so easy to whip out our phones, open an app, and know everything about a mystery song in seconds. But how does Shazam gives us all this information so quickly?&lt;/i&gt;				&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5647458/how-shazam-works-to-identify-nearly-every-song-you-throw-at-it" title="Click here to read more about How Shazam Works To Identify (Nearly) Every Song You Throw At It [Music]"&gt;More »&lt;/a&gt;
