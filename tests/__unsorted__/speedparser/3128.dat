		<title>School&#8230;</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m back at school! Classes were cancelled on Monday due to Hurricane Irene and limited public transportation. I got back to campus this morning and had my first class (design procedures)! I&#8217;m quite proud of my area of the room. I&#8217;m a super clean-freak, and I love being very organized.

		<title>I Love Food</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I love food. Last week, I met up with my best friend, and pigged out (sort of). We went to a drama cafe (&#8220;Coffee Prince&#8221; was the theme) and had a waffle with fruits and ice cream, and we also ate at California Pizza Kitchen. I love: pizza, pasta, ddeokbokki/labboki, udon, ramen, salmon, cheese, fries&#8230; [...]]]></description>

		<title>Emma</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Penguin&#8217;s hardcover classics are gorgeous! I recently watched Emma, the BBC 2009 version. I loved it! As much as I love Joe Wright&#8217;s Pride &#038; Prejudice, which is one of my favorite movies. I watched it in one sitting, and enjoyed it immensely! Mr. Woodhouse is, hands down, my favorite character. He is an adorable [...]]]></description>

		<title>Consummately captivated</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t visited ZARA before! I have been feasting my eyes on the store&#8217;s online collection and I think I&#8217;m oh so very in love. Absolutely digging the turquoise wide waist mini-skirt and that gorgeous embroidered dress, and drooling over these two simple dresses: burnt orange two-tone and navy crêpe.]]></description>

		<title>We never laugh anymore</title>
		<description><![CDATA[(via purple knees) Summer romances begin for all kinds of reasons, but when all is said and done, they have one thing in common. They’re shooting stars, a spectacular moment of light in the heavens, fleeting glimpse of eternity, and in a flash they’re gone.]]></description>

		<title>I want&#8230;</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Thuy An bought a pair of yellow loafers, which I have fallen in love with, from Anthropologie. Also, I would love to get myself a new wallet! The one I have been using (for a very long time) is a hand-me-down Gucci from my aunt. It&#8217;s probably older than me! I&#8217;m very attached to it, [...]]]></description>

		<title>Goodbye, money!</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I purchased a Superheadz White Slim Angel Toy Camera, with four rolls of Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400. I absolutely cannot wait to receive them next week. Now that I&#8217;m earning myself a little extra cash, I&#8217;ve been more lenient on myself. I spend a little, but save the majority. I rarely treat myself like this [...]]]></description>

		<title>Ummmm macarons.</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I tried a banana caramel macaron today, from Financier Patisserie. Yesterday after work, I dropped by the bakery, but all the macarons were sold out, so during the afternoon today, I went to buy some.
