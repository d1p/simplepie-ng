			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>alking has been shown to release endorphins. Endorphins are a natural substance that your body releases to give you an overall sense of happiness.</p>
<p>High intensity aerobic exercise like running, bicycling, or kick boxing requires you to focus on what you are doing. When you are focused on what you are doing it takes your mind off stress in your life and helps you burn calories.</p>
<p>Social interaction can help to keep your mind and body focused when you are having a conversation with others. Some people really benefit from exercising with others.</p>
<p>Yoga<span id="more-10"></span> is a popular form of stress relief since it uses your mind, body and spirit all in one exercise. You increase your flexibility, strength and breath control to help you to feel relaxed.</p>
<p>No matter what exercise you are doing your body will release stress hormones. As you exercise you loose weight and gain a new confidence in yourself that allows you to feel more relaxed.</p>
<p>Exercise helps you to ward off those feelings of anxiety and depression. As you exercise you feel better about yourself and become more relaxed so the anxious and depressed feelings will slowly melt away leaving you feeling happier and healthier.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a baby is a joyous event for most mothers, but some suffer from a serious medical condition known as postpartum depression. Guilt, sadness and hopelessness are symptoms of this condition. Postpartum depression is fairly common and affects about 5-25 percent of all new mothers. This condition is very complex and health experts still do not fully understand what can cause it. Many believe that postpartum depression is caused by a woman not getting enough vitamins. Others believe that the hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy can cause Postpartum depression. There has also been evidence to suggest that<span id="more-9"></span> women who have a family history of a mental disorder are more likely to develop this condition.</p>
<p>It was previously thought that the lifestyle changes that women have to make after delivering their child can cause postpartum depression. However, researchers have found no evidence to support this hypothesis. The reason that they believe that lifestyle changes do not play a role in developing postpartum depression is because all mothers go through changes after having a baby, but only a small percentage of them develop postpartum depression.</p>
<p>Postpartum depression is a complex condition, but the key to overcoming it is seeking treatment early on.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most widely prescribed category of drugs in the modern medical profession is antidepressants. It seems like most of the civilized world is on some kind of prescription to relieve anxiety and control symptoms of depression. There are plenty of resources available if you are suffering from depression, without having to reach for a bottle of pills. Many studies have even shown that, in many cases, antidepressants have no greater effect than a placebo. </p>
<p>Many people are unaware that a few simple lifestyle<span id="more-8"></span> changes can alleviate depression effectively and without reliance on chemicals. Moderate daily exercise has been proven to have a significant impact on the chemicals in the brain.<a href'http://www.everydayhealth.com/depression-specialist/migraines-and-depression.aspx'>This/tag  helps explain it more.  Daily exercise should be the first defense against depression symptoms. Daily exercise can only help your state of mind. </p>
<p>Many of the processed foods we eat contain high levels of chemicals, which can be toxic to your body if consumed in large quantities. Eliminating these chemicals from the diet has improved overall health and mood disorders for many people. It&#8217;s always best to consult a physician with depression symptoms, but by working together, you and your doctor should be able to improve your depression by trying the natural alternatives first.</p>
