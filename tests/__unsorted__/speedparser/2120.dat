<p>Over the weekend, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/at-colleges-the-marketers-are-everywhere.html">this gem on the NY Times</a>. According to the article, the latest trend in corporatizing higher education is the &#8220;sponsored&#8221; move-in. An example they focused on quite a bit was American Eagle Outfitter&#8217;s sponsorship of this fall&#8217;s freshman move-in at UNC. The clothing company hired upperclassman to sport AE tee-shirts and hats and distribute schwag while helping freshmen move into their new dorms. These students (whose activities continue beyond move-in) even have official titles:  &#8220;brand ambassadors&#8221; or &#8220;campus evangelists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oy.</p>
<p>Further down, the <em>Times</em> actually interviews administrators at UNC and discovers that they were unaware of the sponsorship. Naturally, the administrator they spoke too Winston B. Crisp (vice chancellor for student affairs and @vicecripsy on Twitter) expressed concern about turning move-in into a day-long corporate commercial event:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“They are not supposed to be using the opportunity to help people move  in as a way of forwarding commercial ventures,” he said, standing near  the cash registers at Target that evening, as upperclassmen handed out  free VitaminWater, Combos and packages of macaroni and cheese. He added:  “So it’s a bit of a dilemma.”</p>
<p>Wait. Huh?</p>
<p>Oh! It seems Mr. Crisp is mostly upset because UNC had been arranging its <em>own</em> sponsored events around freshman move-in with Target since 2007! So, &#8220;using the opportunity to help people move  in as a way of forwarding commercial ventures&#8221; is a problem EXCEPT when it&#8217;s been officially arranged by the office of student affairs. (And it involves VitaminWater and Combos.)</p>
<p>In his explanation of why UNC set up a midnight shopping trip for freshman at Target, Crisp explains that &#8220;It’s an opportunity for us to gather them together on a Saturday night in a healthy, safe environment <em>while allowing another major corporate entity to further invade the space of higher education and create new, life-long customers who will promote their &#8216;brand&#8217; and spend lots and lots of money. Really, it&#8217;s a teachable moment.</em>&#8221; Okay, I lied. He didn&#8217;t actually say that last part.</p>
<p>Further down, there&#8217;s a money quote from UNC student Kiley Pontrelli:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“When you know that the company is not just there to get your money,  they’re actually willing to, like, help you as an individual in whatever  way possible, it makes you respect them a lot more,” Ms. Pontrelli  says. “I’m definitely going to give American Eagle, like, a second  thought when I go by next time.”</p>
<p>Once again, corporate America is helping educational institutions and students out of the<em> goodness of their heart!</em> They want to <em>HELP</em> students! As <em>INDIVIDUALS</em>! In <em>WHATEVER WAY POSSIBLE</em>! As long as said students can &#8220;engag[e] in real activities to move the needle on major brands.&#8221; That last quote is from Matt Britton, chief executive of Mr. Youth, a marketing agency who seems to consult with these companies that are looking for ways to help students . . .as individuals. . . in whatever way possible. . .oh, never mind.</p>
<p>(I didn&#8217;t actually know what &#8220;move the needle on major brands&#8221; meant. You know, because I&#8217;m a human being and not a marketer. So I Googled it. <a href="http://hubbub.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/office_talk_mov.html">Here&#8217;s a site I found that actually explains this stupid cliche</a>.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide what annoys me most: The companies that are creating &#8220;brand ambassadors&#8221; on college campuses because they know the power of peer pressure when it comes to getting young people to purchase stuff. The students who fall for this bullshit and think that these companies actually &#8220;care&#8221; about them. Or the colleges who are INVITING these businesses to become a part of students&#8217; experiences because it allows them to provide &#8220;safe, healthy&#8221; student events.</p>
<p>Actually, the last one is the one that annoys me most.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, a group of about 12 people met in DTLT&#8217;s office to discuss an online learning initiative that has been underway at UMW for the last several months. I&#8217;ve only recently been pulled into this conversation due to some staffing turnover, but I&#8217;ve been following it through conversations with <a href="http://pedablogy.stevegreenlaw.org/">Steve Greenlaw</a> (who has played an integral role in planning and imagining it) and <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com">Jim Groom</a> (who has represented DTLT in many of the meetings and conversations).</p>
<p>Generally, the goal of the initiative is to explore online learning within a liberal arts context &#8212; with an emphasis on thinking about how the values of the liberal arts can be explored. I think it&#8217;s an admirable goal, and I&#8217;ve been more intrigued by it than many other conversations about online learning that I&#8217;ve been part of in the past because its attempting to address online teaching and learning at a more fundamental level than just the use the Web as a delivery mechanism (more on this below).</p>
<p>The goal of last Tuesday&#8217;s meeting was to discuss the review of online courses that a few faculty members have signed up to teach next spring and summer. Part of the project has always included a process wherein colleagues from within UMW and from other institutions would be asked to review the course plans based on some set of criteria. This meeting was to further discuss what that criteria would be.</p>
<p>In preparation for the meeting, I spent some time reviewing three other review mechanisms &#8212; specifically rubrics developed by the <a href="http://www.ion.uillinois.edu/initiatives/qoci/rubric.asp">Illinois Online Network</a>, <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/celt/roi/">California State University, Chico</a>,  and the <a href="http://www.montereyinstitute.org/ocep/">Monterey Institute</a>. All three of these had been suggested to Steve by colleagues at other institutions who had offered advice and feedback on the initiative.</p>
<p>In full disclosure, the word <em>rubric</em> is one that generally leaves me cold. The adoption of rubrics as a way to assess education (both student work, and in this case, faculty work), seems to have emerged out of the increasing presence of instructional designers at our schools and the increasing interest in generating institutional data with which to clobber our accrediting agencies during reaffirmation.</p>
<p>(Now for a short side note about &#8220;instructional design&#8221;: When I was getting my graduate degree in instructional technology ten years ago, I looked at generally two kinds of programs: ones with a heavy emphasis on instructional design and ones without. I ended up going to one of the latter because there was something about the various instructional design systems that left me cold. Now, to be fair, I&#8217;m not an expert on these systems (what with the not going to a school that taught them). But what little I do know about them seems to suggest such a formulaic approach to teaching that it seems to suck the life and art out of the practice. )</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any particular problem with professional staff being hired to partner with faculty to think about ways to teach that are innovative and creative (hey! that sounds like what I do!). So, if that&#8217;s what an &#8220;instructional designer&#8221; is, fine. I also don&#8217;t have any particular problem with institutions being interested in thinking carefully and closely about what they do &#8212; and even using that process to imagine ways to evolve and change. If that&#8217;s what &#8220;institutional data&#8221; is for, fine.</p>
<p>But, really, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m seeing. Instead, I see more and more institutions relying on the perspectives of instructional designers and institutional data offices to determine strategic goals.</p>
<p>All of this was weighing on my mind fairly heavily as I gathered the materials for our meeting. I spent sometime reviewing the various rubrics as well as the notes on liberal arts education that the committee had developed earlier this summer. I suggested to Steve that we break the rubrics down into their component parts and then offer these pieces up to the committee to consider as they discussed how UMW should review online courses. In my mind, I was imagining that we would juggle and group the rubric components, finding some that we&#8217;d like to look at further for our own purposes, and some that we would eliminate entirely.</p>
<p>I literally printed a card for each rubric component, with the different rubrics each assigned a separate color or paper so that we could keep track of what was what. Last Tuesday, we all sat down at the table in DTLT with piles of colored paper and brief handouts that provided an overview of each rubric.</p>
<p>We started talking.</p>
<p>And then the earth shook. Literally. An earthquake hit Virginia, and, here in Fredericksburg, the walls of duPont rumbled dramatically. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>And ever since then I&#8217;ve been joking that the earthquake was some higher power&#8217;s sign to us that we needed to treat rubrics with CAUTION!!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, in preparation for the make-up meeting (which, as it happens will be this afternoon), I&#8217;ve been doing additional thinking and soul-searching about this project. Here are a couple of thoughts I&#8217;ve had, loosely organized, in no particular order.</p>
<p><strong>1. Let&#8217;s make Online Learning about Learning Online. </strong><br />
It seems to me that a lot of online learning conversations operate under the assumption that the &#8220;online&#8221; component is merely the technical component that allows a faculty to deliver a course to students who are not physically co-located. Online simply becomes a mechanism that a faculty member employs for practical reasons. I would like to suggest that we need to start thinking about Online Learning as a practice that considers in a holistic way how learning can happen within a networked, open culture. DS106 is a great example of a course that not only relies on online environments to communicate with students and provide access to content and ideas but also places students within the open Web where their success depends upon learning how to navigate these online spaces, develop networks of support, and contribute their own knowledge and creative practices back to open Web culture.</p>
<p>What if we conceived of our online courses this way? What if faculty were asked to consider how they could incorporate the open Web into their curriculum and students were expected to engage in these spaces as part of their coursework.</p>
<p><strong>2. Let&#8217;s Start Over </strong><br />
It seems to me that most online courses grown out of existing face-to-face courses, where a faculty member works (sometimes in conjunction with others) to &#8220;transform&#8221; or translate the F2F experience to the online course environment (usually an LMS). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelmXaSibrc">It&#8217;s digital facelifts all the way down</a>. What if we decided to build online courses from scratch? Instead of simply translating a F2F class, how about if every online coure is a NEW course. Perhaps it&#8217;s built out of something that has been taught F2F, but it&#8217;s given a chance to exist, natively within an online context. Faculty could use online courses to explore those aspects of their discipline that lend themselves to being taught within a Web-based network.</p>
<p><strong>3. Let&#8217;s Make (Teaching) Art </strong><br />
I don&#8217;t have a particular problem with courses being reviewed by other faculty members, nor (as I stated above) do I have a problem with University&#8217;s having people on staff whose job is to partner with faculty to think about new ways of teaching. What I DO have a problem with is taking the review of online courses so far that it sucks the creativity and art out of teaching. Honestly, the rubrics that I reviewed for our meeting were filled with criteria that seemed  over-the-top. We have never subjected faculty to this kind of review for F2F classes. Why do we assume that when they teach online, they&#8217;re incapable of making smart choices about how they teach? Can&#8217;t our &#8220;review&#8221; of courses focus more on developing creative partnerships among faculty and their supporting colleagues &#8212; partnerships that focus on thinking through the possibilites of a course, bouncing ideas off each other, exploring new technologies or approaches? These partnerships would be a breading ground for discussing the two points I raised above &#8212; how to teach a liberal arts discipline within an open, networked Web and how to build natively, online courses within those disciplines.</p>
<p>Okay, that was a LONG post. But when I blog, I don&#8217;t just make some crappy animated gifs. I BLOG.   Would love to hear feedback and/or pushback on any of this.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that Jim Groom, given his altered state, may not have given the class some examples of radio shows that have been done already in what was once simply #ds106. Therefore I have taken it upon myself, as a good professor, to provide you with some solid examples of both radio shows and bumpers from previous courses to use as a model as you create your own.</p>
<div>The idea behind the radio show is to frame a series of stories/narratives that experiment with telling stories orally through sound on the radio. While the bumpers are used to both to promote your show, as well as transition neatly between different sections of your groups show&#8212;if they are, indeed, distinct. Bumpers can be very short, i.e., 15 to 30 seconds, or as long as a minute. The general theme for the show should be focused around Summer Camp or Summer of Oblivion. Hopefully either gives you room to experiment. Ideally your group will work together to come up with a show that is both coherent and original. What&#8217;s more, it should be something that you all can work on together or individually. That said, please try and make it work as a longer, compelling show that is at least 5 minutes per person as a rule (or 20 minutes if there are 4 groups members).</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you want examples of shows from students in the previous classes, see my May ds106 course&#8217;s &#8220;Dog Days of Summer&#8221; show here:</div>
<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/dog_days_of_summer.zip" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/dog_days_of_summer.zip</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, there are a number of radio shows you can access here from the Spring semester</div>
<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/ds106showfinal_02_WSOZzombieradio.mp3" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/ds106showfinal_02_WSOZzombieradio.mp3</a></div>
<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/ds106showfinal_09_MysteriouslyMysteriousMysteries.mp3" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/ds106showfinal_09_MysteriouslyMysteriousMysteries.mp3</a></div>

<div></div>
<div>And here are some bumpers:</div>
<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_ds106_arkansasterritorialmilitia.mp3" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_ds106_arkansasterritorialmilitia.mp3</a></div>

<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_mysteriouslymysteriousmysteries.mp3" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_mysteriouslymysteriousmysteries.mp3</a></div>
<div><a href="http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_ds106_radio_will_set_you_free.mp3" target="_blank">http://ds106.us/wp-content/audio/bumper_ds106_radio_will_set_you_free.mp3</a></div>
<p>I hope this helps you all in your quest! What&#8217;s more,<strong> I have taken the liberty to extended the deadline for the final radio shows from Sunday at midnight to Monday at midnight.</strong></p>

<p><em>What follows is a copy of the email I will be sending out to the ds106 Summer of Oblivion course members shortly.</em></p>
<p>All,<br />
Here is the <a href="http://youtu.be/V35h61bw6e0">link</a> to today&#8217;s abbreviated course session:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V35h61bw6e0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Keeping up with the ds106 Radio Show</strong><br />
In light of Jim Groom&#8217;s disappearance, I think I need to step in and establish some kind of order and reaffirm that we must remain one as a class, and put all our divisions aside. What&#8217;s more, you must get your assignments done! Today&#8217;s video was short and sweet, and provided a review of where we are and a look at where we are going&#8212;with or without Jim Groom.</p>
<p>As a quick recap. you should already have your radio groups formed and each group should have a name and list of members on this wiki page <a href="http://ds106.us/wiki/index.php?title=SOB_ds106_Radio_Shows" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, your groups :30 second and one minute bumpers are due for your radio show by tomorrow, Friday, July 8th, at 5 PM. In addition, the show is due no later than midnight on Sunday July 10th (this deadline is not negotiable). Finally, the shows will air on Monday, July 11th starting at 2 PM and going through the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Telling Stories in/on the Web Assignment</strong><br />
What&#8217;s more, as a look of things to come we will be experimenting with web storytelling, wherein you each will be asked to hack a website and make it your own. Here is an example I worked on today to give you an example of what one of them might look like: <a href="http://marthaburtis.net/ds106_amazon.html" target="_blank">http://marthaburtis.net/ds106_amazon.html</a></p>
<p>This assignment will be the subject of Monday&#8217;s course, and the course will be centered on this assignment but in order to get a head start see the video about how to execute this assignment <a href="http://blip.tv/file/4897007" target="_blank">here</a> and the very detailed tutorial <a href="http://digsto.umwblogs.org/2011/03/17/tutorial-firebug/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can see some ideas and the vision of this assignment on Jim Groom&#8217;s blog <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/weeks-9-10-telling-stories-inon-the-web/" target="_blank">here</a>, before he lost it entirely.</p>
<p>Steady and strong wins the race,<br />
Martha Burtis</p>

<p>Last night I finished up <a title="The Childrens’ Season (In which I beg for your help)" href="http://wrapping.marthaburtis.net/2011/06/01/the-childrens-season-in-which-i-beg-for-your-help/">my segment for the Ds106 radio show</a> &#8220;Dog Days of Summer&#8221; that my class will be broadcasting on Monday.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m really happy with how it turned out. I used audio that <a href="http://cluttermuseum.blogspot.com/">Leslie</a> and <a href="http://www.bavatuesdays.com">Jim</a> submitted of interviews with their children as well as a short interview I did with Madigan. In addition, I found a couple of interesting video clips on the Internet Archive. The first was a documentary about a progressive British summer camp for kids during World War II. The other was a documentary about a summer community program for teens in NYC during the 60s. I liked the sounds and stories behind these films, and decided to incorporate them into the overall segment.</p>
<p>I also tracked down some Creative Commons music that I used throughout the segment.</p>
<p>Here are links to the source material:</p>

</ul>
<p>I have to say I loved working on this project. I need to push myself to do audio more, because I find it so satisfying. When I was working on the piece I could hear in my head what I wanted it to sound like. Sometimes I was able to actually execute my &#8220;vision.&#8221; Other times, as I worked with bits and pieces of the tracks, I heard new things that I decided to use instead.</p>
<p>There is definitely a kind of media fluency involved in working with audio like this that is a challenge to develop and foster. Simply wrapping my brain around the different tracks in my head and associating those ideas with the actual tracks in the software is a huge challenge for me. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m having to develop a cognitive understanding of the media and the way it overlaps and intersects. It&#8217;s very different then constructing text narrative or meaning.</p>
