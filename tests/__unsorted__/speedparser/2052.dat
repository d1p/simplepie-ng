<p>The 37th and 40th Presidents of the United States are buried within 45 miles of downtown Los Angeles at their respective presidential libraries. As the country's only metropolitan area to host two presidential libraries, Southern California boasts a wealth of presidential history--and contemporary presidential drama like the recent the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/us/politics/08debate.html">September 7 G.O.P. bout</a> at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley. And yet the region of more than 17.8 million residents&mdash;more populous than all but three states&mdash;has not produced a major presidential contender since Richard Nixon exited the political stage in 1974.</p>]]>

<p>Raised in Orange County and Whittier, Nixon was a recent World War II veteran when he won election to the U.S. House in 1946, representing Los Angeles County. The young politician rose quickly: Californians elevated him to the U.S. Senate in 1950, and in 1952 Dwight D. Eisenhower made Nixon a national figure by choosing him as his running mate. He served as Eisenhower's backup from 1953 to 1961, but his political fortunes had turned; in 1960 John F. Kennedy defeated him for the presidency, and in 1962 he lost his bid to unseat Edmund "Pat" Brown, Sr., as California governor. </p>

<p>Nixon eventually won the presidency, of course, serving from 1969 until 1974, when he resigned and retired to the Western White House, La Casa Pacifica, in San Clemente. Dedicated in 1990, Nixon's <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/">presidential library</a> is located at the site of his birthplace and childhood home in Yorba Linda.</p>

<p>Unlike Nixon, Ronald Reagan was not a Southern California native. Born in Illinois, the Midwesterner arrived in 1937 as a newly signed actor for Warner Bros. Pictures. Although Reagan never broke into the top echelon of film stars, he worked as a screen actor until the 1960s, when he left the entertainment industry for a new role: politician. Reagan first appeared as an enthusiastic Barry Goldwater supporter in 1964 and then as California governor from 1967 to 1975. </p>

<p>A champion of conservative causes, Reagan made two unsuccessful presidential bids, first losing the Republican nomination to Nixon in 1968 and then narrowly losing to the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, in 1976. With his third attempt, in 1980, Reagan found success. He defeated George H.W. Bush for the Republican nomination and then unseated Jimmy Carter as president. After leaving office in 1989, Reagan retired to Bel Air. His <a href="http://www.reaganfoundation.org/">presidential library</a> opened in Simi Valley in 1991.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 22, archivists from the Reagan Library and the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda will discuss some of the unique materials that link their collections with Southern California history at the <a href="http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/archives_bazaar">6th-annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar</a>. </p>

<p><img alt="William Gibbs McAdoo in his Washington, D.C. office.

<p>Nixon and Reagan are household names, but Southern California's first serious presidential contender&mdash;a lawyer and traction magnate named William Gibbs McAdoo, whose <a href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf367nb1sd/">papers</a> are housed at UCLA's Young Research Library&mdash;is largely unknown today. </p>

<p>Born in Georgia during the Civil War, McAdoo oversaw two major rail transit projects in his early career. First was the conversion of Knoxville, Tennessee's street railway to electric streetcars, which bankrupted the company and prompted McAdoo to move to New York City in 1892. Second was the completion of the rail tunnels under the Hudson River, which McAdoo oversaw as president of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. The tunnels, completed in 1907, continue to shuttle PATH commuters between New York and New Jersey to this day.</p>

<p>McAdoo's success as a New York railroad executive helped launch his career in politics. He became vice chairman of the national Democratic Party in 1912 and from 1913 to 1918 served as Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of the Treasury. It was a role in which he excelled; his actions during a 1914 financial crisis transformed the United States from a borrower to a creditor nation and, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2007/03/the_unknown_financial_superhero.single.html">according to some</a>, helped the United States wrest the world's economic leadership from Great Britain. </p>

<p>Although he did not permanently move to Los Angeles until 1922, McAdoo's Southern California story begins in 1919, when he helped found United Artists. The new film studio, the brainchild of Hollywood stars Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, D. W. Griffith, and Mary Pickford, was owned and operated by actors and directors instead of financiers. McAdoo joined the new company as general counsel and, along with the four founding stars, assumed a 20 percent ownership stake in the studio. His tenure was short lived, however; by April 1920 he had resigned and sold his shares.</p>

<p><img alt="McAdoo during the inauguration of an anti-narcotic league in North Hollywood in 1923. Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library Photograph Collection." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/mcadoo_1923_noho.jpg" width="597" height="470" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Leaving United Artists allowed McAdoo to reenter national politics. After months of denying interest in a bid, in June 1920 McAdoo entered the field for the Democratic nomination for president. At the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, McAdoo received the most votes on the first ballot but did not secure a majority; in subsequent ballots his support waned, and the nomination went to Governor James Cox of Ohio.</p>

<p>McAdoo again sought the Democratic nomination in 1924, this time as a California resident. Endorsed by the then-resurgent Ku Klux Klan, McAdoo controversially declined to repudiate the racist group's endorsement. McAdoo's chief opponent was Governor Al Smith of New York, a Catholic and an opponent of the Klan.</p>

<p>At the national convention in Madison Square Garden, McAdoo again finished atop the first ballot but never could secure a majority thanks to the strong opposition of Smith's backers. The nomination eventually went to a compromise candidate, former Solicitor General John W. Davis. </p>

<p>Although McAdoo, who later represented California in the U.S. Senate from 1933 to 1938, never won the Democratic nomination, he was Southern California's only serious presidential contender until Richard Nixon in 1960. </p>

            <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m24004.html"><img alt="The Four Level interchange as seen from above in 1959.

<p>Fifty-eight years ago today, the Four Level interchange first opened to traffic. This iconic concrete ribbon that binds the 101 and 110 freeways is an almost inescapable feature of many Southern Californians' commute. Admired by some and feared by others, the Four Level was&mdash;like many other highway innovations in Los Angeles&mdash;the first of its kind and destined to be copied elsewhere.</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p>The Four Level, also known as the Stack, gets its name from its multi-tiered structure that separates traffic heading in each direction into dedicated lanes. On the bottom level are curved ramps for those changing from the 110 freeway to the 101. One level above is the main trunk of the 110 freeway, named the Arroyo Seco Parkway north of the interchange and the Harbor Freeway south of it. On the third level are the arcing flyover ramps carrying traffic from the 101 freeway to the 110. Finally, on the fourth and top level is the main trunk of the 101 freeway, named the Hollywood Freeway to the west and the Santa Ana Freeway to the east. </p>

<p>This design, now the basis of freeway interchanges around the world, was a marked improvement over the previous model. Older cloverleaf interchanges were less expensive and kept a lower profile, but they also tended to slow traffic and were more dangerous. They required motorists both entering and exiting a freeway to merge into one lane. (The 405 freeway's interchange with Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood is an example.) Stack interchanges, on the other hand, kept the eight directions of traffic separate until the final merge. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist11/photogallery/index.htm"><img alt="The Four Level carrying traffic in all eight directions shortly after its 1953 opening.

<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/acsc-m1179.html"><img alt="A partially-opened Four Level Interchange in 1952. Courtesy of the Automobile Club of Southern California." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/AAA-NG-6631.jpg" width="597" height="520" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist11/photogallery/index.htm"><img alt="Automobiles on the Hollywood Freeway crossing the top level of the interchange in 1953. Courtesy of Caltrans." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/Caltrans_FourLevel_top.jpg" width="597" height="459" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>Still, the Four Level manages to inspire dread in some motorists. Merging is not always easy; transitioning from the southbound Hollywood (101) Freeway to the southbound Harbor (110) Freeway requires a tricky three-lane maneuver to avoid the exit-only lanes bound for downtown streets. The interchange is also confluence of freeway names and numbers that can be confusing even to locals. Frustrated by missing information on Caltrans' lane guidance signs, artist Richard Ankrom <a href="http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/community/fulldollar/artist-or-sign-painter.html">once installed</a> his <a href="http://www.kcet.org/shows/socal_connected/content/culture/public-artworks.html">own signage</a> near the interchange as an act of "<a href="http://ankrom.org/freeway_signs.html">Guerilla Public Service</a>." Finally, some Angelenos may be aware that the interchange is the site of L.A.'s original town gallows.</p>

<p>Plans for the interchange were first unveiled on April 22, 1944. Construction cost $5.5 million and required <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~philipje/MM_PROJECTS/Ghost_Neighborhoods_2000/CLICK_ME.htm">demolition of the neighborhood</a> adjacent to Bunker Hill. Work finished by 1949, but the interchange then sat unused for years; construction crews were still building the connecting Hollywood, Harbor, and Santa Ana freeways. The Four Level opened in successive stages, but it was not until September 22, 1953 that motorists could drive on all 32 of its lanes and over all 20 of its bridges.</p>

<p>Following the Northridge earthquake, the Four Level was retrofitted in 1997. In 2006, Caltrans <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist07/Publications/Inside7/story.php?id=39">renamed</a> it the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange after the late KNX-AM and KNXT-TV traffic and weather announcer.</p>

<p>Many have admired the Four Level for its aesthetic qualities. In <em>L.A. Freeway: An Appreciative Essay</em> (1981), David Brodsly praised the "particularly elegant" interchange for its "simple lines." And despite some Southern Californians' fondness for the 10-405 and 105-110 interchanges, the Four Level holds the distinction of being the only interchange in the region to be certified as a <a href="http://www.ascelasection.org/index.php/main/pages/civil_engineering_landmarks/">civil engineering landmark</a> by the Society of Civil Engineers.</p>

<p>Contemporary fiction has also recognized the Four Level's landmark status, often depicting it as an unconscious manifestation of the conscious terror the interchange inspires in some motorists. In Thomas Pynchon's novel <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>, one character has a "boozy, black-and-white dream of jumping off The Stack into rush-hour traffic." </p>

<p>Maria in Joan Didion's <em>Play It As It Lays</em> likewise dreams of the iconic interchange. She "lay at night in the still of Beverly Hills and saw the great signs soar overhead at seventy miles an hour, <em>Normandie ¼ Vermont ¾ Harbor Fwy 1</em>. Again and again she returned to an intricate stretch just south of the interchange where successful passage form the Hollywood onto the Harbor required a diagonal move across four lanes of traffic. On the afternoon she finally did it without once braking or losing the beat on the radio she was exhilarated, and that night slept dreamlessly."</p>

<p>A series of recent news headlines have reminded us that our city&mdash;often associated with brown skies, high-speed pavement, and its concrete river&mdash;still maintains an intimate relationship with nature. </p>

<p>Throughout the summer, spooked residents of Burbank and Glendale reported at least <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mountain-lions-20110821,0,7783881.story">five mountain lion sightings</a>. "I have a 4-year-old daughter and 10-year-old girl," one man told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. "I am just seriously scared." Then, on August 30, a cougar sprinting across the 405 freeway in the Santa Monica Mountains was <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/08/mountain-lion-santa-monica-mountains.html">struck and killed by rush hour traffic</a>. Most recently, L.A. County officials struggled with the fate of a pack of coyotes that <a href="http://www.glendalenewspress.com/news/education/tn-gnp-0911-coyotes,0,5169481.story">moved into an abandoned Glendale house</a>.</p>

<p>For those living on the edge between L.A.'s urban sprawl and the surrounding undeveloped mountains, such encounters may be an unavoidable but frightening reminder of wild nature's proximity, like the firestorms that occasionally turn the brown slopes red. For residents of the vast flatlands of L.A., though, these headlines also serve as a reminder of the landscape destroyed by more than 240 years of settlement.</p>]]>

<p>Prior to Spanish colonization, the vast Los Angeles Basin and the nearby inland valleys hosted an expansive prairie ecosystem. </p>

<p>Grasses and wildflowers covered much of the land, interrupted by sycamore-lined arroyos and streams. One of the watercourses, <a href="http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/">the Los Angeles River</a>, had an outsize influence on the landscape. Issuing from the vast subterranean reservoir of the San Fernando Valley, the river flowed year-round into coastal marshes. Never a broad, placid river like those of the eastern United States, the Los Angeles River's flow often slowed to a trickle. Exceptionally heavy rains, though, would transform the tame river into a raging torrent that could not be trusted to keep to its channel.</p>

<p>In fact, for some time the river did not flow toward its current mouth on San Pedro Bay; instead, it turned west toward Santa Monica Bay after passing what is today downtown Los Angeles. In 1815, the river overflowed its banks and began carving a shortcut to the sea, bringing the river uncomfortably close to the <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/birth-of-the-pueblo-of-los-angeles-los-pobladores-and-la-as-a-spanish-colonial-outpost.html">still-fledgling Los Angeles pueblo</a>. The town was forced to abandon its original plaza and construct a new one on higher ground. </p>

<p>Ten years later, the storm-swollen river burst through its banks again, this time sculpting an entirely new channel that headed directly south toward San Pedro Bay, the present location of the river's mouth. Ballona Creek, which today empties into the Pacific Ocean just south of Marina Del Rey, is a remnant of the Los Angeles River's former path.</p>

<p><img alt="In 1886, the river washed out the adjacent tracks of the Santa Fe Railroad. The Downey Avenue Bridge, visible in the background, was also destroyed.

<p><img alt="A tamer Los Angeles River flows through the Elysian Valley, circa 1895-1915. Courtesy of the Title Insurance and Trust / C.C.

<p>On the drier grasslands not flooded by the river's flow, herds of pronghorn antelope roamed freely, and holes made by the prairie's many rodent species pockmarked the ground. Condors, eagles, and other birds of prey soared above, sharing the sky with a diverse group of larks, sparrows, and plovers.</p>

<p>At the apex of the food chain stood California's eventual symbolic state animal, the grizzly bear. Unlike the more docile American black bear, the larger grizzly thrived in the flat, open savannas and grasslands of Southern California. Omnivorous, they were especially adept at digging through the ground in search of gophers, weasels, and other subterranean rodents. Grizzlies were so important to the local environment that, until recently, ecologists referred to the dominant Southern California biome as the Broad Sclerophyll-Grizzly Bear Community.</p>

<p>Humans also inhabited the land, of course. The Tongva Indians had occupied the Los Angeles Basin and its adjacent valleys for hundreds or even thousands of years. As the <a href="http://www.kcet.org/socal/voices/pixeltown/interview-with-militant-angeleno.html">Militant Angeleno</a> recently <a href="http://militantangeleno.blogspot.com/2011/09/native-week-know-your-na.html">detailed</a> in his blog's Native Week series, dozens of villages dotted the region, supporting a population of five to ten thousand. Although the Tongva did not inflict the kind of environmental trauma that our metropolis does today, they did shape the land over the centuries through brush-clearing fires, hunting, and intensive foraging.</p>

<p>Because the Tongva did not keep written records of their world, the observations of early European explorers and settlers, carefully preserved in libraries and archives, have been an invaluable resource to ecologists like Paula Schiffman who have reconstructed L.A.'s lost landscape. Among the best sources are two early Spanish visitors to the region: Pedro Fages, a soldier who explored the area in 1775; and Pedro Font, a missionary who accompanied Juan Bautista de Anza during his <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/31238-many-roads-to-the-historical-southland.html">1775-76 expedition through California</a>. </p>

<p>Font entered the San Gabriel Valley on January 3, 1776, describing the plain as "a country very level on all sides; we found it very green in spots, and the blossoms already bursting forth." Two days later, he made a salad out of a plants he found growing naturally near a spring, one of which he described as celery and the others as "passably good little lettuces."</p>

<p>The next month, Anza's and Font's expedition crossed the Los Angeles River, then known as the Porciuncula: "We crossed the...river, which carries a good amount of water and runs toward the San Pedro bight and spreads out and loses itself upon the plains shortly before reaching the sea. The land was very green and flowery and the route had a few hills and a great deal of miry grounds created by the rains."</p>

<p>Fifty-six years later, the early Anglo settler Hugo Reid described the animal life beneath the grasslands:</p>

<blockquote>Squirrels, rabbits, and gophers were continually scurrying down into their holes, out of harm's way. Indeed, these tiny animals had so honeycombed the surface of the ground as to make it dangerous to ride anywhere off the roadway faster than at a walk. The caravan stretched out in a thin line along a road the surface of which seemed no smoother than the open field. Only in this way was it possible to avoid stumbling, dropping a load, and perhaps breaking a leg.</blockquote>

<p>Only the earliest visitors to the region witnessed L.A.'s indigenous prairie, which was destroyed long before parking lots and subdivisions replaced the region's wild flatlands. As the presence of Europeans grew, invasive Mediterranean species&mdash;transported accidentally or intentionally from the Old World&mdash;began to supplant the native flora. Horses and longhorn cattle, introduced by Spanish missionaries and allowed to graze freely over the valleys and coastal plain, disrupted the careful balance of the ecosystem. The final end of the prairie could perhaps be dated to the disappearance of its keystone species, the grizzly bear, which Angelenos hunted to local extinction in 1897.</p>

<p><img alt="Caballeros roping a grizzly bear. Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library Photograph Collection." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/00064498.jpg" width="597" height="505" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Our city's native landscape may be lost today, but reminders of the city's ecological history abound.</p>

<p>Many of the flora and fauna of the Los Angeles prairie have vanished, but some of Southern California's indigenous wildlife have adapted to the new urban ecosystem. Raccoons, skunks, and a host of bird species&mdash;joined by non-native species such as rats, eastern fox squirrels, and opossums&mdash;have moved from the neighboring chaparral communities of the hillsides into the artificial urban woodland of our modern metropolis.</p>

<p>Although straitjacketed in concrete for much of its route, the Los Angeles River still traces its post-1825 course to San Pedro Bay, its flow augmented by urban runoff. In some segments, pressure from upwelling water made it impossible to pave the river completely; in the Glendale Narrows, for example, cottonwoods spring up from the river's earthen bottom.</p>

<p>Natural history is also embedded in some of our city's place names. Downtown's Aliso Street refers to an <a href="http://www.viewfromaloft.org/2007/01/the_tribes_gath.html">ancient, 60-foot-tall sycamore</a>, named El Aliso by early Spanish settlers, where the region's Tongva tribal leaders would once congregate. La Cienega Boulevard recalls the marshes (<em>ciénagas</em> in Spanish) where, as Font saw, the Los Angeles River lost itself before reaching the ocean.</p>

<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, as the horrors of Nazi Germany engulfed the European continent, Los Angeles became a sanctuary for some of Europe's most celebrated artists and intellectuals. Playwright Bertolt Brecht, author Thomas Mann, and composer Arnold Schoenberg all made Southern California their home in the years surrounding World War II and&mdash;drawn by the region's favorable climate and the economic opportunities afforded by the Hollywood film industry&mdash;scores of other German-speaking exiles joined them.</p>

<p>Next week, scholars from around the world will convene at the University of Southern California for the fifth biennial conference of the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/ifs/">International Feuchtwanger Society</a>. From Wednesday, September 14 through Friday, September 16, historians, librarians, and other experts will <a href="http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/ifs/documents/ifs.FINAL.pdf">discuss</a> the experiences of the artists, intellectuals, and other German-speaking exiles who fled persecution in Nazi-controlled Europe for the safety of Southern California. </p>

<p>Although many chose to return to Europe after the Second World War's conclusion&mdash;a decision that is the theme of the upcoming conference&mdash;others remained, closing out their illustrious careers near the Mediterranean shores of California. Today, our region's archives preserve the record of these exiles and émigrés.<br />

<p>One of the most prominent exiles to make Southern California home was the German-Jewish author Lion Feuchtwanger, who gave his name to the International Feuchtwanger Society. </p>

<p>Feuchtwanger was an internationally renowned historical novelist whose outspoken criticism of Hitler and National Socialism made him an enemy of the state when the Nazis assumed power in Germany in 1933. Driven into exile in France, Feuchtwanger was imprisoned by French authorities at the outbreak of World War II&mdash;an episode that Feuchtwanger recorded in his memoir, <em><a href="http://www.usc.edu/libraries/about/programs_exhibitions/events/devilinfrance/">The Devil in France</a></em>, recently revised and republished by the USC Libraries.</p>

<p>In 1940, Feuchtwanger escaped from an internment camp in Vichy France with the help of his wife and several sympathetic Americans, who then smuggled the couple out of Europe. Deciding upon Southern California as a new home, the Feuchtwangers heard of a sprawling 6,000 square-foot house in Pacific Palisades that had fallen into disrepair. Built in 1928 as the Los Angeles Times Demonstration Home, the house was meant to demonstrate not only the latest innovations in household design, but also the attraction of living far from the city's urban core.</p>

<p>Ironically, it was that very isolation that had undercut the house's value - it and others in the neighborhood were seen as too distant from basic amenities such as schools and medical care. The Feuchtwangers bought the estate for only $9,000, renovated the property and promptly filled the house with books.</p>

<p>Villa Aurora, as they called the house, soon became a hub of cultural fellowship among the émigré community. The Feuchtwangers were generous hosts and frequently welcomed their fellow exiles, along with American artists and intellectuals, for readings from upcoming works, discussions about art and culture, and to share the latest news from Germany. Feuchtwanger lived in Los Angeles until his death in 1958. </p>

<p>Thomas Mann&mdash;the Nobel Prize-winning author of <em>Death in Venice</em> and <em>The Magic Mountain</em>&mdash;was among those who attended the salons at Villa Aurora, calling the house a "true castle by the sea." </p>

<p>Mann, perhaps the most famous of the German émigrés in Los Angeles, would later build his own castle perched atop the hills of Pacific Palisades.</p>

<p>Strongly opposed to Nazi policies, Mann left Germany in 1933. After several years of exile in Switzerland and a short teaching stint at Princeton, he and his wife Katia arrived in Los Angeles in 1940.</p>

<p>Many within the exilic community held conflicted feelings about Los Angeles; some detested the city's perceived cultural and urban shortcomings and were only too happy to return to Europe after the war. Mann, however, took U.S. citizenship and planned to make Los Angeles his permanent home.</p>

<p>In his 1996 book <em>German-speaking Artists in Hollywood</em>, Cornelius Schnauber quoted Mann, who often enjoyed strolling down Santa Monica's Palisades Park, on his reasons for settling in Los Angeles:</p>

<p>"The climate has great advantages," he wrote a friend, "as does the countryside, living expenses are relatively cheap, and, in particular, the opportunities for our young musician-children are promising." Later, Mann wrote to his son: "We were just at Princeton and it is very pretty. But I am a bit afraid of the scholarly atmosphere, and I basically prefer the movie rabble in Hollywood."</p>

<p>A 1942 <em>New Yorker</em> profile proclaimed Mann to be "Goethe in Hollywood" and, according to Mann's fellow exile Bertolt Brecht, the author thought of himself as a "latter-day Goethe in search of the land where the lemons grow" (quoted in <em>City of Quartz</em> by Mike Davis).</p>

<p>Mann's years in Southern California were productive. He composed some of his most significant works while in Los Angeles, including <em>Doctor Faustus</em> and <em>The Holy Sinner</em>. Eventually, the draw of Europe's old world traditions was too strong. In 1952, Mann returned to Switzerland, where he died in 1955. </p>

<p>Feuchtwanger and Mann were only two of the many intellectual and artistic titans to reside under the Southern California sunshine.</p>

<p><img alt="	Arnold Schoenberg conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in a rehearsal for a 1935 concert.

<p>The influential Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg left Vienna for Los Angeles in 1934. Schoenberg&mdash;the founder of the Second Viennese School&mdash;taught music at both UCLA and USC and his weekly tennis matches against George Gershwin became the stuff of local legends. He lived in Brentwood until his death in 1951.</p>

<p>In 1941, the famed dramatist Bertolt Brecht arrived in Southern California, settling into a house on 26th Street in Santa Monica. Like many exiles, Brecht found financial support from the Hollywood studios, although his actual contributions were limited: his one script was for Fritz Lang's 1943 film, <em>Hangmen Also Die</em>. </p>

<p>Brecht complained often of life in Los Angeles. In 1942, he wrote that "here one feels like Francis of Assisi in the aquarium, Lenin at the Prater (or Oktoberfest), a chrysanthemum in a mine pit, or a sausage in a hot-house." As Mike Davis noted in <em>City of Quartz</em>, "none of the anti-fascist exiles seemed more spiritually desolated by Los Angeles than the Berlin playwright and Marxist aesthetician." In his poem "Contemplating Hell," Brecht wrote:</p>

<blockquote>On thinking about Hell, I gather<br />
My brother Shelley found it was a place<br />
Much like the city of London. I<br />
Who live in Los Angeles and not in London<br />
Find, on thinking about Hell, that it must be<br />
Still more like Los Angeles.</blockquote>

<p>Brecht lived in Santa Monica until the advent of the McCarthy era made life&mdash;and work&mdash;uncomfortable for him. Singled out for his leftist politics, Brecht was blacklisted by Hollywood executives and on October 30, 1947 controversially testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The following day, he returned to Europe, where he would live out his remaining years in East Germany.</p>

<p>Next week's conference, titled <em>To Stay or Not to Stay?</em> (<em>Bleiben oder Zurück-kehren</em>) will explore through <a href="http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/ifs/documents/ifs.FINAL.pdf">seventeen panel discussions</a> the reasons some exiles, like Feuchtwanger and Schoenberg, remained in Los Angeles, while others, like Mann and Brecht, emigrated back to Europe.</p>

<p>Southern California's archives have become a destination for scholars around the world researching the experience of German exiles in L.A. The extensive archives of USC's <a href="http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/">Feuchtwanger Memorial Library</a> document the lives of Lion Feuchtwanger, novelist Heinrich Mann, and composer Hanns Eisler, among others. The <a href="http://special.lib.uci.edu/">UC Irvine Libraries' Special Collections</a> preserve more than <a href="http://special.lib.uci.edu/collections/thomas-mann/">1,000 editions of Thomas Mann's published works</a>, in addition to thousands of manuscripts, letters, and other documents related to Mann and his family.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.villa-aurora.org/index.php?page=home_en">Villa Aurora</a> also continues as a place for intellectual fellowship. Maintained by the German government, the Feuchtwangers' former house is today a monument to Southern California's exile community and a residence for artists who face persecution overseas.</p>

        <summary>The pueblo of Los Angeles was founded in 1781 as a remote outpost of Spain&apos;s New World empire. While September 4 is today celebrated as the city&apos;s birthday, the date - and much of the traditional story of the pueblo&apos;s birth - enjoys only a tenuous connection to historical fact.</summary>

<p>September 4 marks the traditional anniversary of the 1781 founding of <em>El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles</em> (The Town of the Queen of the Angels).</p>

<p>In a scene that will be <a href="http://lospobladores.org/events/230th-birthday-celebration-of-los-angeles/">reenacted this Saturday</a> by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and descendants of the pueblo's original colonists, the 44 founding <em>pobladores</em> (townspeople) marched as a group from Mission San Gabriel Arcángel to the historic Los Angeles Plaza at the southern end of Olvera Street. There, Governor Felipe de Neve welcomed the procession and presided over a grand ceremony commemorating the town's founding. It was a celebration worthy of the birth of a great city.</p>

<p>Except that none of it actually happened.</p>

<p>In recent decades, scholars have turned to journals, correspondence, maps, official records, and other carefully preserved eighteenth-century documents to piece together the actual story of the agricultural settlement's founding. And, like Romulus and Remus, the traditional narrative has proven to be more myth than fact: the original pobladores arrived separately at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, some settled the townsite as early as June 1781, and September 4 was likely an arbitrary date that Neve used in his report to his superiors&mdash;one that was marked with little pomp and circumstance. </p>]]>

<p>The story of Los Angeles' founding begins with a Russian expedition to North America in the 1730s and 1740s. Although Spain had laid claim to Alta California for nearly two centuries, it had never settled the land, which lay along the northwestern reaches of its vast American empire. But when a Russian expedition, led by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering, reached Alaska in 1741, it became clear that the Russian empire, expanding eastward over the Eurasian landmass and across the soon-to-be-named Bering Strait, might harbor territorial ambitions toward Spanish California.</p>

<p>In the mid-1760s, the Visitador General of New Spain, José de Gálvez, drew plans for the colonization of California. Settlement would take three forms: a string of religious missions to convert the indigenous peoples into Spanish subjects, presidios to secure Spain's military hold on the province, and pueblos to supply the garrisons with food and establish a secular, civilian presence in the territory. Seeing more signals that Russia intended to expand south from Alaska into California, King Charles III of Spain hastily approved the plans in 1768. </p>

<p>A presidio in San Diego came first in 1769, followed soon by missions strung up the California coast. In Southern California, Mission San Gabriel Arcángel appeared in 1771.</p>

<p>Civilian settlement, however, lagged. It was not until 1777 that Governor Felipe de Neve founded the first pueblo in San Jose.</p>

<p>Eight years earlier, Gaspar de Portolà's expedition passed through the Los Angeles basin on its way north and noted what would become the future site of Alta California's second pueblo, Los Angeles. The broad river valley, framed by a line of irregular hills, had "all the requisites for a large settlement." The missionary Juan Crespí described the scene in his diary entry of Wednesday, August 2, 1769:</p>

<blockquote>We set out from the [San Gabriel] valley in the morning and followed the same plain in a westerly direction. After traveling about a league and a half through a pass between low hills, we entered a very spacious valley [the Los Angeles basin], well grown with cottonwoods and alders, among which ran a beautiful river from the north-northwest...We halted not very far away from the river, which we named the Porciúncula [today, the Los Angeles River]...The plain where the river runs is very extensive. It has good land for planting all kinds of grain and seeds, and the most suitable site for a mission.</blockquote>

<p>Fittingly, the first European party to set foot on the future site of Los Angeles felt three earthquakes on the day of its arrival.</p>

<p><img alt="1948 re-enactment of the Portolà expedition's arrival in Los Angeles. Courtesy of the Los Angeles Daily News Collection, UCLA Library." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/hb7x0nb54b-FID5.jpg" width="597" height="496" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Portolà and Crespí were not the first to realize the site's suitability for settlement; that same day, the expedition encountered the native Tongva (Gabrielino) people, who came from their riverside home to greet and trade with the Spaniards. Their village, named <a href="http://www.kcet.org/socal/voices/where-we-are/persistence.html">Yang-na</a> (or Yaanga, according to some sources) was one of the largest indigenous settlements on the Los Angeles plain. A giant, 400-year-old sycamore at the center of the hamlet, which the Spanish later named <em>El Aliso</em>, provided shade to the tribal leaders who met under its canopy. (for more on Yang-na and the L.A. River's history, check out <a href="http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/">KCET's interactive documentary from Departures</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, in 1779, Neve secured approval for the founding of a new pueblo at the site mentioned by Crespí. Neve personally oversaw much of the town planning, mandating a site close enough to the Porciúncula River for irrigation but elevated enough to survive the inevitable floods.</p>

<p>The pueblo's layout&mdash;based on the standard Spanish colonial model replicated everywhere from South America to New Mexico&mdash;would feature a central plaza surrounded by residences and, eventually, a village church. The Spanish soldier José Darío Argüello detailed Neve's plan in a 1786 map, preserved today at the University of California, Berkeley's Bancroft Library. The plaza and residences were to be built on a terrace abutting the Elysian Park Hills, creating a defensible military position. Farmland was to be situated closer to the river&mdash;on the west bank, the pobladores' lots, and on the east, the royal fields, which later became Boyle Heights. </p>

<p><img alt="Los Angeles civic leaders celebrate the city's September 4 birthday in 1963 next to a statue of Felipe de Neve, the colonial governor who founded the original pueblo.

<p>Neve dispatched his lieutenant governor south to New Spain's Interior Provinces to recruit the first pobladores. Aware of the long, dry summers of Southern California, the Spanish officials recruited experienced farmers from the dry province of Sonora, where irrigation made agriculture possible, as well as skilled artisans who would keep the settlement supplied with farming tools. Neve and his lieutenant governor also searched for soldiers prepared to serve on the frontier and escort the pobladores over hundreds of miles to their new home. </p>

<p>On February 2, 1781, 12 pobladores and their families, escorted by 17 soldiers and their families, departed the Sonoran town of Álamos. A second party made up of soldiers and nearly 1,000 head of livestock would later follow <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/31238-many-roads-to-the-historical-southland.html">Juan Batista de Anza's overland trail to Alta California</a>, but the pobladores' path took them across the Gulf of California and then up the Baja California peninsula to their destination.</p>

<p>The town's first settlers were a remarkably diverse group. The pobladores, their wives, and their children who left Álamos were all Spanish subjects, but only two among them claimed exclusive Spanish descent, as historian Antonio Rios-Bustamante notes in his 1992 book, <em>Mexican Los Ángeles: A Narrative and Pictorial History</em>:</p>

<blockquote>The 23 adults and 21 children in this group were a representative cross-section of the laboring class majority population of the northwestern Mexican frontier provinces in the eighteenth century...the group reflected the ethnic composition of Sonora and Sinaloa from which most came. Eight of the twenty-three adults were Indians, ten were of African descent...Records also show that one of the black settlers, Luis Quinero, was the son of a black slave and an Indian woman of Álamos.</blockquote>

<p>At this point in the story, the traditional narrative begins to depart from what historians today accept as historical fact. It was long thought that the pobladores arrived as a single group at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. However, correspondence and other records show that the settlers actually arrived as separate parties over the course of a few months. </p>

<p>More central to L.A.'s foundation myth is the idea that the pobladores all walked from the mission to the townsite together. This notion, too, is now thought to be wrong. </p>

<p>Historian Harry Kelsey's 1976 article for the <em>California Historical Quarterly</em>, "A New Look at the Founding of Old Los Angeles," has been particularly influential in understanding the town's creation. Consulting the journal&mdash;today preserved in the Huntington Library&mdash;of Franciscan missionary Francisco Palou, Kelsey established that the first four families of pobladores arrived at the San Gabriel Mission in June and were quickly dispatched to the Los Angeles townsite nine miles away. Palou wrote:</p>

<blockquote>There arrived first at San Gabriel the people who came by way of Old California, and soon as part of them arrived [Neve] gave them the order to found the projected town of Nuestro Senora de Los Angeles with some four families...The rest of the troop was kept at San Gabriel Mission until the group arrived that came by way of the Colorado River.</blockquote>

<p>A later entry described the new town:</p>

<blockquote>Town of Our Lady of the Angels: About three leagues directly northwest [of San Gabriel] on the banks of the River named Porciuncula a town is started that had its beginning about June of 81. In it are established four families of people of reason and four soldiers of escort.</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, by September, the pueblo's 11 founding families had settled their land on the banks of the Los Angeles River. But if the first pobladores arrived in June, why is September 4 celebrated as the city's birthday? </p>

<p>William David Estrada, curator of California and American history at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, provides a succinct explanation in his 2008 book, <em>The Los Angeles Plaza: Sacred and Contested Space</em>:</p>

<blockquote>...[O]n November 19, Neve informed Croix [his superior] that the founding of the pueblo had taken place under his command on September 4, 1781. The selection of this date possibly was arbitrary, since September marked the month when the colony's financial records were first recorded. Therefore, September 4 marked the official, if not the actual, date of the founding of El Pueblo de La Reina de Los Angeles. Contrary to another long-cherished myth, it took place without pomp or ceremony.</blockquote>

<p>One final incongruity between the traditional account and historical fact is noteworthy. Although the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District is where L.A.'s earliest history is remembered today, the monument does not mark the original site of the pueblo. Historians are unsure where the settlers first built their adobes, but the pueblo evidently moved at least once and perhaps twice to escape the occasional yet devastating floods of the Los Angeles River. The royal square shifted to its present location in 1818, the year construction began on La Nueva Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles. Today, thousands of tourists stroll past the church and down Olvera Street's alley of shops and restaurants each year. The location of the original pueblo, the <em>plaza vieja</em>, is lost to history.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrolibraryarchive/2932458584/"><img alt="Two streetcars pass at Sunset Junction, circa 1952.

<p>With the recent <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/1st_and_spring/communities/board-of-public-works-sunset-junction.html">decision</a> by the L.A. Board of Public Works to deny the Sunset Junction Music Festival a permit, the thirty-year history of the neighborhood festival may be coming to an end. But Silver Lake's Sunset Junction&mdash;known for its unusual configuration and as a locus of fashionable cafes, bars, and shops&mdash;is steeped in local transportation and social history that will continue to survive in Southern California's archives.</p>

<p>Sunset Junction's name&mdash;as well as its peculiar layout&mdash;is a relic of L.A.'s heritage as a streetcar city. Rolling northeast from downtown Los Angeles on Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Electric Red Cars reached a fork in the tracks: they could continue on Sunset toward Hollywood Boulevard or turn west onto Santa Monica Boulevard toward the town of Sherman, better known today known as West Hollywood. The other street at the intersection, Sanborn Avenue, did not carry streetcar traffic but did add complications to the junction's layout.<br />
</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p>Although it's universally known today as Sunset Junction, maps from the days of the Red Car, like the one below, actually mark the convergence of streetcar lines as the Sanborn or Hollywood Junction. </p>

<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/CHS-13038"><img alt="1910 map of the Los Angeles Pacific Company electric streetcar lines. Sunset Junction appears in the top-right and is labeled 'Sanborn'. Courtesy of the California Historical Society Collection, USC Libraries." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/CHS-13038.jpg" width="597" height="561" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>Trolley tracks first reached the intersection in 1895, when the Pasadena & Pacific Railway completed the first interurban rail line between downtown Los Angeles and the beachside community of Santa Monica. Ten years later, the junction was created when the railroad&mdash;by then renamed the Los Angeles Pacific&mdash;extended its tracks up Sunset Boulevard toward the fledgling town of Hollywood. Eventually, the original narrow gauge tracks were upgraded to standard gauge, and in 1911 the "Great Merger" of Southern California's competing interurban rail systems brought the junction under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Electric Railway. </p>

<p>The junction continued to serve as an important node in L.A.'s streetcar network until May 31, 1953, when the Pacific Electric shuttered its South Hollywood-Sherman Line, which traveled down the center of Santa Monica Boulevard. Streetcars continued to roam the Hollywood Line up Sunset until September 26, 1954, when buses replaced trolleys. Today, the tracks and electrical wires are gone, but an imaginative eye can still envision the trolleys making the wide, arced turn from Sunset onto Santa Monica.</p>

<p>Sunset Junction's role in the city's history did not end with the demise of L.A.'s streetcar system. Instead, later events at the junction, which became an epicenter for the burgeoning gay rights movement, would have national political and social significance.</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve 1966, eight undercover LAPD officers infiltrated the gay-friendly Black Cat Bar, located near Sunset Junction between Sanborn and Hyperion Avenues. As the clock struck midnight and celebrants exchanged traditional New Year's kisses, police officers sprung into action, beating several bargoers and arresting 14 for assault and public lewdness. </p>

<p>The incident sparked one of the first public protests in the nascent gay rights movement. Six weeks later, and more than two years before the famous Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village, a crowd of hundreds gathered in front of the Black Cat to protest the raid. Attorneys and gay rights activists delivered speeches condemning "police lawlessness" and calling on authorities to respect the "rights and dignity of the homosexual citizen." Photos, documents, and other records from this watershed event are preserved in the <a href="http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/one_national_gay_and_lesbian_archives">ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives</a>, now a part of the USC Libraries.</p>

<p>The demonstration did not end in violence&mdash;police monitored the protesters but kept a distance&mdash;and its peaceful success triggered further public rallies across the region. </p>

<p>It also had national ramifications. Two of the celebrants arrested on New Year's Eve, Charles Talley and Benny Baker appealed their conviction for lewd conduct (they were observed kissing each other, one of them wearing a white dress) to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although the high tribunal declined to hear their case, Talley's and Baker's attorney broke new ground by asserting equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The Black Cat protests also inspired Richard Mitch and others to create what is today the nation's best-known LGBT publication, <em>The Advocate</em>, as a way to spread information about the rising movement.</p>

<p>As Silver Lake grew in its reputation as a gay-friendly neighborhood, Sunset Junction continued to serve as an important place within L.A.'s LGBT community. </p>

<p>In 1980, community leaders organized the first-annual Sunset Junction Street Fair, designed to create bonds between LGBT residents and members of other cultural and ethnic groups in the area. The event was a hit, and every year from 1980 through 2010 Sunset Junction hosted the festival, which eventually evolved from a cultural outreach effort into a showcase for art and independent music. Although the street fair's future is now uncertain, its contribution to Sunset Junction's history&mdash;like those of the Pacific Electric Red Cars and the pioneering gay rights activists&mdash;will live on in our region's archives.</p>

<p>Ever since the legendary oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and his partner, Charles A. Canfield, struck oil northwest of downtown Los Angeles in 1892, extracting petroleum from the land beneath Southern California has been a major part of the Southern California economy. For decades, it also had a powerful effect on the landscape of Southern California. Oil derricks towered over sandy beaches, houses, schools, golf courses, and orange groves. In one case an oil derrick even stood stubbornly in the middle of a Beverly Hills street.</p>

<p>Many of the wells have since been closed, and in some cases the towering derricks have been replaced by the ever-nodding horsehead pumps, but the surreal views of oil derricks dominating the Southern California landscape survive in the following images, drawn from several of the region's photographic archives.</p>]]>

<p>Recently, scenes from L.A. history have been reappearing a few dozen miles to the south, as the Walt Disney Company completes a makeover of the entrance to its California Adventure theme park. The main entrance <a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2011/07/disney_moderne.php">now bears a striking resemblance to the Streamline Moderne Pan-Pacific Auditorium</a>, which L.A. lost to fire in 1989. Just behind the entrance's fin-shaped towers, the Disneyland Monorail will soon glide over<a href="http://www.theeastsiderla.com/2011/07/a-mickey-mouse-version-of-the-glendale-hyperion-bridge-now-under-construction/"> a replica of the Glendale-Hyperion Bridge</a>, which connects Atwater Village with Silver Lake.</p>

<p>These reconstructions of L.A. architecture recall the city Walt Disney encountered when the aspiring cartoonist first arrived in California in 1926, but they also remind us of the place that theme parks and other tourist attractions occupy in Southern California history. With its international stature, Disneyland may be the best known of Southern California's tourist destinations, but the region has been home to several popular attractions, from ocean-front amusement parks to Busch Gardens in Van Nuys.</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p><strong><big>Marineland of the Pacific</big></strong></p>

<p>Before there was SeaWorld, there was Marineland, perched above the coast of the Palos Verdes Peninsula at Portuguese Bend. </p>

<p>Marineland of the Pacific was reputedly the world's largest oceanarium when it opened in 1954. Built at a cost of more than $3,500,000, the park featured two colossal salt water tanks that collectively held more than 1 million gallons of sea water, pumped fresh from the Pacific Ocean below and filtered for sand, algae, and other unwanted elements. Like SeaWorld and other oceanariums today, the park housed a collection of marine mammals, sharks, fish, mollusks, and other creatures of the sea. Dolphins, porpoises, and pinnipeds performed stunts before auditoriums full of tourists, led by the park's star orcas, Orky and Corky.</p>

<p>The park also collected marine curiosities discovered in the nearby ocean waters. For example, when in 1956 divers found a Cuvier's beaked whale off the shore of Santa Catalina Island, far from its normal habitat, they captured the whale and transported it to Marineland, where it was placed in a tank. </p>

<p>In late 1986, Harcourt Brace Jovanavich&mdash;the publishing company that also owned the SeaWorld chain of marine mammal parks&mdash;purchased Marineland for $23 million and, citing financial difficulties, closed the park a few months later. Harcourt moved Orky and Corky to its SeaWorld San Diego park and tried to rename the pair Shamu and Namu (SeaWorld's stage names for its killer whales) but relented in the face of Marineland fans' protests.</p>

<p><big><strong>Knott's Berry Farm</strong></big></p>

<p>Billed today as "America's first theme park," <a href="http://www.knotts.com/">Knott's Berry Farm</a>, as its name suggests, began as an agricultural concern. Farmer Walter Knott and his wife Cordelia moved to Buena Park in 1920 and opened a rural roadside berry stand, selling berries to beachgoers traveling along Highway 39. In 1932, Knott became the first to commercially cultivate the boysenberry, a hybrid developed by Anaheim farmer Rudolph Boysen. </p>

<p>Two years later, facing financial hardship amid the Great Depression, Cordelia Knott opened her Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It was an instant success. Three-hour long lines often snaked through the Knotts' property, and by 1940 the restaurant served as many as 4,000 chicken dinners every Sunday evening. </p>

<p>To entertain the hungry diners, the Knotts added various attractions and diversions, from a 20-foot artificial volcano to a gold mine where visitors could pan for genuine gold flakes. In the 1940s, Walter Knott began transporting buildings from abandoned towns of the Old West to create the themed Ghost Town area. Rides, including a restored narrow-gauge railroad and the Calico Mine Ride, followed and in 1968 the Knotts fenced in the theme park and began charging admission. </p>

<p>The Knott family sold the park to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, an amusement park operator, in 1997. Many of the early attractions have since been replaced by nausea-inducing roller coasters, but Knott's Berry Farm still greets millions of tourists each year&mdash;many of whom fill their stomachs at Cordelia Knott's fried chicken restaurant.</p>

<p><big><strong>California Alligator Farm</strong></big></p>

<p>In <em>Jurassic Park</em>, author Michael Crichton and filmmaker Steven Spielberg imagined an amusement park designed to showcase <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/dinosaurs-in-the-southland-35340.html">Mesozoic-era reptiles</a>. Their imagined park had a real-life antecedent in Los Angeles in the form of Lincoln Heights' <a href="http://laist.com/2009/03/14/laistory_los_angeles_alligator_farm.php">California Alligator Farm</a>, a gated, exotic zoo where the chief attractions were the bone-crushing "living fossils" that have persisted on Earth relatively unchanged since the Age of Dinosaurs.</p>

<p>The brainchild of Francis Earnest and Joe Campbell, the California Alligator Farm opened in 1907 near the intersection of Mission Road and Lincoln Park Avenue. Earnest and Campbell segregated the alligators by size to discourage cannibalistic behavior, but they remarkably did not separate the gators from their human visitors. As the photos below show, Alligator Farm visitors&mdash;including young children&mdash;were encouraged to walk or swim among the dangerous reptiles. </p>

<p>If close encounters with the gators wasn't enough, various attractions kept visitors entertained. Alligators climbed to the top of a chute and then took a belly-slide to the pool below. Tourists could also climb aboard a saddled Billy the Alligator&mdash;whose gaping jaws appeared in dozens of Hollywood films&mdash;for a ride around the farm. The park's operators also staged spectacles such as alligator wrestling and the feeding of live chickens to the gators.</p>

<p>In 1953, the California Alligator Farm relocated to Buena Park, across the street from Knott's Berry Farm. The park closed in 1984, plagued by declining attendance.</p>

<p>Like many American cities in the mid-twentieth century, Los Angeles once hosted its own regional breweries that supplied the city and its environs with light, affordable American pale lager. Before intense competition led to their decline, L.A's own Eastside Lager and Brew 102 battled in local and regional markets with such national brands as Budweiser, Schlitz, and Miller.</p>

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://eaglerockbrewery.com/">Eagle Rock Brewery</a> became the first brewery in years to open within L.A. city limits. Since then, two more&mdash;<a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2010/09/nibble_bit_tabby_brewery_opens.php">Nibble Bit Tabby</a> and <a href="http://www.angelcitybrewing.com/">Angel City</a>&mdash;have begun concocting new mixtures of barley, hops, water, and yeast inside the City of Los Angeles, joining a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/05/food/fo-beer5">growing cohort</a> of Southland craft brewers.</p>

<p>Though their focus is different&mdash;microbrewers typically hand-craft a wide range of ales and lagers, while the early L.A. brewers concentrated on one style of lager&mdash;these new breweries have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-los-angeles-beer-20110602,0,2199593,full.story">tapped into long-dormant tradition</a> of Los Angeles beer brewing.</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p>L.A.'s first brewery, the Philadelphia Brew House, opened in 1874 near the present-day site of Union Station. It was one of the city's most historic locations; for hundreds of years, Tongva (Gabrieleño) tribal leaders gathered under the shade of an ancient sycamore tree&mdash;later dubbed El Aliso by L.A.'s first Spanish settlers&mdash;that came to be the center of the Indian village of Yangna. At first, the brewery's walls surrounded the expansive tree, but in the 1890s good business spelled a bad fate for El Aliso, which was felled and sold for lumber to make room for an expanded brewery facility.</p>

<p><img alt="The Maier & Zobelein Brewery circa 1900. Courtesy of the Security Pacific National Bank Collection, Los Angeles Public Library." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/Maier-Zobelein-LAPL.jpg" width="597" height="312" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>In 1882, two German immigrants named Joseph Maier and George Zobelein purchased the Philadelphia Brew House, renaming it Maier & Zobelein. </p>

<p>The new L.A. brewers were part of a wave of German entrepreneurs, including the now-familiar names of Adolphus Busch and Frederick Miller, who began making a light, pilsener-style lager throughout the U.S. in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Their style of brew, which fermented at colder temperatures using a different type of yeast, was a relatively new arrival in North America, where beer drinkers were accustomed to ales brewed at room temperature in the British tradition. Greater availability of ice, better transport, and the advent of refrigeration made these new lagers possible, and thirsty European immigrants imported the demand. </p>

<p>The photos above from the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California and publicly accessible through the USC Digital Library shows a turn-of-the-century Maier & Zobelein bottle that excavators discovered during an 1989-1991 excavation at Union Station. </p>

<p>Maier died in 1904, leaving his share of the brewery to his sons. A legal dispute between Zobelein and his new partners ensued, and in 1907 Zobelein split with the Maier brothers and purchased the ten-year old Los Angeles Brewing Company, located on the L.A. River near Lincoln Park. Zobelein crafted a line of beers, ranging from a pale lager to a stronger, darker bock, and sold them under his new <a href="http://www.rustycans.com/COM/month0305.html">Eastside brand</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="A sign on the Los Angeles Brewery proclaims Eastside to be 'the perfect brew.' Courtesy of the California Historical Society Collection, USC Libraries." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/CHS-48570.jpg" width="597" height="472" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><img alt="Aerial view of the Maier Brewing Company in 1924. Courtesy of the Security Pacific National Bank Collection, Los Angeles Public Library." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/Maier-aerial-LAPL-1924.jpg" width="597" height="477" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><img alt="MS.1 Charles Fletcher Lummis Papers, 1888-1928; Braun Research Library Collection." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/Maiers-Tonic-Autry.jpg" width="597" height="1132" class="mt-image-none" style="" /> </p>

<p>Maier Brewing Company, meanwhile, introduced a pseudo-medicinal Select Malt Tonic "rich in the elements that feed the tissues, restore nerve health, and make rich red blood." <a href="http://libraries.theautry.org/2011/03/17/no-food-or-drink-in-the-archive-unless-it%E2%80%99s-beer-on-st-patrick%E2%80%99s-day/">Autry National Center NHRPC Processing Archivist Holly Rose Larson recently discovered a series of advertisements for the brew in the papers of Charles Fletcher Lummis at the Braun Research Library.</a> As the image above shows, the concoction&mdash;actually just simple beer with the addition of honey&mdash;was advertised as a "liquid food" for the treatment of various ailments, from insomnia to "old age" to "expectant motherhood."</p>

<p>Maier and Eastside both struggled during Prohibition. Like many American breweries, they survived the dry spell by producing soft drinks and "near beer"&mdash;beer that squeaked under the 0.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) limit imposed by the Volstead Act.</p>

<p>Some breweries supplemented their legal activities with illicit brewing. On March 30, 1932, federal agents raided the Maier Brewery and discovered what they called "unshakeable evidence" that the facility had been producing full strength, 4% ABV beer. Prohibition officers arrested Maier's sales manager and one of his employees. Owner Edward R. Maier denied knowledge of the illicit brew, but authorities seized the brewing equipment and bottling plant. Maier would not regain control of his business from a court-appointed receiver until 1940, seven years after Prohibition ended.</p>

<p>For Maier's rival, the end of Prohibition was a happier time. One minute past midnight on April 7, 1933, actress Jean Harlow smashed a bottle over an Eastside delivery truck to mark the legalization of 3.2% ABV beer. A full repeal of Prohibition came less than a year later with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>

<p>Both breweries prospered through the Second World War and in the years immediately after. Upon the advice of advertising executives, the Maier Brewing Company rebranded its original pale lager as Brew 102&mdash;advertisements suggested that the brewery had tried 101 unsuccessful recipes before settling on the "new" brew&mdash;and positioned it as a cheap beer for the working class. The marketing strategy worked. With demand surging, Maier replaced its old, brick brewery with a new, industrial complex. </p>

<p>Eventually, intense postwar competition with Anheuser-Busch and other national brewers led to the L.A. brewers' decline. </p>

<p>Zobelein's family sold the Los Angeles Brewing Company and its Eastside brand to Wisconsin-based Pabst in 1948. Pabst, in a race with other national brewers to expand first to the West Coast, opened a new plant next door to the old Eastside brewery and began making its Pabst Blue Ribbon lager in 1953. Rival brewers Anheuser-Busch and Schlitz both followed in 1954 by opening large industrial breweries in Van Nuys. </p>

<p><img alt="Executives at Pabst's Los Angeles headquarters pose for a photograph, 1952. Courtesy of the Los Angeles Examiner Collection, USC Libraries." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/Pabst-USC-1952.jpg" width="597" height="431" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><img alt="Workers inside Anheuser-Busch's Van Nuys brewery in 1972. Courtesy of the Los Angeles Times Photographic Archive, Department of Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA." src="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/AnheuserBusch-ucla-1972.jpg" width="597" height="391" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>The Maier Brewing Company was sold to a San Francisco businessman in 1958. Under new ownership, the brewery located atop the historic Indian village continued to make Brew 102 until 1972, when the plant closed. Although it was finally demolished in 1985 for the construction of the El Monte Busway, its mammoth footprint is still evident in the sudden curve that northbound motorists negotiate on the 101 freeway just before Alameda Street.</p>

<p>At the Pabst facility, production continued on both the Eastside lager&mdash;by then marketed as a discount beer under the Eastside Old Tap brand&mdash;and PBR until 1979. That year, after losing the national beer wars of the 1970s to the well-capitalized Anheuser-Busch and Miller (owned then by tobacco giant Philip Morris), Pabst shut down its Los Angeles operations. While Anheuser-Busch and Miller today continue to make beer in their Southland breweries, the closure of the Pabst plant marked the end of an era and the death of the 72-year-old Eastside brand. For brewery workers, it also marked the end of an even longer tradition, dating back to the nineteenth-century Maier & Zobelein Brewery: guaranteed seven-minute beer breaks every hour.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County opened its <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/arts-culture/first-look-natural-history-museums-new-dinosaur-hall-35014.html">new Dinosaur Hall</a>, a permanent exhibition featuring hundreds of dinosaur fossils and 20 complete mounts of dinosaurs and other Mesozoic creatures. The new display marks an important milestone in a <a href="http://www.nhm.org/site/about-our-museums/nhm-next-campaign">seven-year, $135 million transformation</a> of the museum, and it also brings new attention to the prehistory of Southern California.</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p><img alt="The National History Museum's new Dinosaur Hall features the world's only T. Rex growth series.

<p>In 1901, Union Oil geologist William Orcutt was surveying an area then known as Hancock Ranch when he discovered fossilized bones in pools of asphalt. The pools--today known as the <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/">La Brea Tar Pits</a>--have since proven to be one of the world's richest paleontological sites, yielding more than 1 million fossils since excavation began in 1906.</p>

<p>The bones and fossilized plants preserved in the tar revealed to scientists a starkly different L.A. landscape than what we see today. Southern California in the <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/ple.html">Pleistocene</a>--a geologic epoch that ended roughly 11,700 years ago--was inhabited by large mammals that bore a striking resemblance to the animals today seen in zoos or on safaris. Two species of elephant--the <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/mammoth.html">Columbian mammoth</a> and imperial mammoth--grazed the Southern California grasslands. Their cousin, the <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/mastodon.html">American mastodon</a>, joined a host of other now-extinct herbivores, from camels to ground sloths. These animals provided plenty of reasons for large carnivores, which included <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/lion.html">American lions</a>, <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/wolf.html">dire wolves</a>, and <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/sabert.html">saber-toothed cats</a>, to roam prehistoric Los Angeles. The largest of them--the <a href="http://www.tarpits.org/education/guide/flora/bear.html">short-faced bear</a>--would dwarf modern grizzlies, standing over 11 feet tall on its hind legs.</p>

<p>Despite these extensive caches of Pleistocene fossils, Southern California's land rarely yields dinosaur remains. During the <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/mesozoic.html">Mesozoic era</a>--a period of about 185 million years during which dinosaurs dominated many terrestrial ecosystems--<a href="http://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html">North America looked very different</a>, and most of our state was then underwater. Because dinosaurs dwelt only on the land, their carcasses would have to be carried out to sea and then be buried in fresh sediment to survive as fossils in the rocks that now underlie Southern California.</p>

<p>It may have come as a surprise, then, when in 1967 a junior high school student named Brad Riney discovered the incomplete backbone of a hadrosaur in the sea cliffs of La Jolla. Twenty years later, Riney--by then a paleontologist for the San Diego Natural History Museum--found the fossilized remains of a <a href="http://www.sdnhm.org/exhibits/mystery/fg_ankylosaur.html">stout, armored nodosaur</a> during a Carlsbad road construction project. In all, <a href="http://www.sdnhm.org/research/paleontology/dinossd.html">five dinosaur specimens</a> have been found along the string of San Diego County hills and cliffs that geologists know as the Point Loma Formation. </p>

<p>Dinosaurs may not have frequented Southern California, but they've retained a fierce hold on the public imagination since their existence became widely known in the late nineteenth century. In Southern California, the prodigious and long-dead beasts have influenced the region's popular culture, from roadside attractions to theme parks to fashion.</p>

<p>Anyone who has driven to Palm Springs will be familiar with the Cabazon dinosaurs, the landmark sculptures alongside Interstate 10. The concrete and steel structures (pictured at the top of this post) were envisioned and built by Claude K. Bell, a retired sculptor from Knott's Berry Farm who wanted to lure motorists to his roadside diner. Thousands have visited the landmarks, and millions more have glimpsed them from their car windows. The replica Tyrannosaur, Mr. Rex, even appeared in the 1985 film <em>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</em>. In the 1980s, Bell drafted plans to expand the roadside attraction and add Pleistocene mammals to the scene, but he died in 1988 before construction could begin.</p>

<p>Another imagined dinosaur scene appeared in the Southland in 1966. Walt Disney's Primeval World diorama initially appeared as an attraction at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. When the fair closed, Disney shipped the robotic dinosaurs to Anaheim, where they became a part of the Disneyland Railroad ride.</p>

<p>Bell's Cabazon dinosaurs--<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/27/local/me-dinosaurs27">which now house a creationist museum</a>--and the Disneyland diorama still greet visitors today, testaments to our continuing fascination with all manner of representations of the extinct reptiles. For those who want to see the real thing, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's new <a href="http://www.nhm.org/site/explore-exhibits/permanent-exhibits/dinosaur-hall">Dinosaur Hall</a> is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/commentary/angelino-angeleno-and-angeleno.html">Angeleños</a> prepare to survive the upcoming weekend without access to a ten-mile section of the San Diego Freeway, our thoughts may turn to L.A.'s pre-freeway era, a time before it was possible to cruise through the Los Angeles basin at 70 miles per hour, a time when freeway construction was an occasion for celebrity photo-ops rather than an excuse to coin apocalyptic portmanteaux. </p>

<p>In the twenty years between 1950 and 1970, more than 500 miles of freeways were built in L.A., Orange, and Ventura counties. Southern California welcomed them with the pomp and circumstance usually reserved for foreign dignitaries. Movie stars and governors christened the new concrete rivers, and many Southern Californians drove to construction sites to pose in photographs of half-built highways rising from the ground.</p>]]>
            <![CDATA[<p>The photos below, culled from several regional archives, illustrate that junction between L.A.'s pre- and post-freeway eras, when work crews built bridges and on-ramps but also razed houses and split neighborhoods. They show construction work on five Southern California freeways: the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Highway 101), one of L.A.'s first; the Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110); the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10); the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405); and the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210).</p>

<h3>Dig Deeper</h3>

<p>The collections of the Dorothy Peyton Gray Transportation Library and Archive at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority constitute an invaluable resource for understanding Southern California's transportation, from early cable cars to the Pacific Electric Railway and from superhighways to the "Subway to the Sea." </p>

<p>Those interested in learning more about how L.A.'s freeways system was conceived should consult the Metro Library's <a href="http://www.metro.net/about/library/archives/visions-studies/los-angeles-transit-and-transportation-studies/">online list of major L.A. County transportation planning documents</a>. Thanks to the library's active digitization efforts, many of the documents are publicly available in PDF format. Particularly relevant to the subject of freeway planning and construction is a 1946 report by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Parkway Engineering Committee, titled <em><a href="http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/trafficplans/1946_interregional_regional_metropolitan_parkways.pdf">Interregional, Regional, Metropolitan Parkways in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area</a></em>. The report includes maps of proposed freeway routes and an analysis of the county's long-term highway needs.</p>

<p>Librarian Kenn Bicknell is currently digitizing another relevant collection that he describes as the "mother lode of information" about freeway construction. Published from the 1924 to 1967, <em>California Highways and Public Works</em> was the official journal of the California Highway Commission and, later, the California Division of Highways. Bicknell hopes to have the entire archive digitized and publicly accessible <a href="http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/">here on the library's website</a> by the end of the year. He has already digitized the <a href="http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1956_sepoct.pdf">September/October 1956 issue</a>, which contains a treasure trove of photographs, maps, and other information about freeway construction projects in Southern California.</p>

<p>This Friday, <a href="http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/index.aspx?page=1048">Burbank celebrates its centennial</a>. The city ambitiously billed as the media and entertainment capital of the world&mdash;and which, for much of its history, also served as a major hub of the aviation industry&mdash;hardly betrays today its humble origins as a dentist's sheep ranch.</p>

<p>The city is named after David Burbank, a New Hampshire-born dentist who came to California in a covered wagon in 1850. After the Civil War, Burbank moved to Southern California and purchased a 9,000-acre ranch that included all of the Mexican-era land grants of Rancho Providencia and Rancho Cahuenga, as well as part of Rancho San Rafael. His new fiefdom, situated at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley, cost him only $1 per acre.</p>

<p>Burbank at first populated his ranch with sheep. But in 1884 a land boom, fueled by an influx of migrants from the Midwest, gripped Los Angeles County. Over the next four years, this speculative bubble would spawn more than one hundred new towns across the county, many of them in the San Fernando Valley. Burbank capitalized on the boom and in 1886 formed the Providencia Land and Water Development Company with a group of Los Angeles-based investors with the goal of subdividing and developing Burbank's sprawling sheep ranch.<br />

<p>On May 1, 1887, the new town of Burbank opened with a $30,000 hotel and a one and a half mile-long, horse-powered street railway. An irrigation system transported water from nearby Toluca Lake to the fledgling community, and a depot along the Southern Pacific Railroad brought freight and new residents. </p>

<p>At first the town flourished, but by 1889 the land boom had turned to bust, and many of the new towns failed, but the strongest of the new communities&mdash;which included Burbank&mdash;emerged intact if hobbled. The resulting regional depression coincided with years of unusually dry weather, constraining further development of the town. Some farmers planted vineyards and drought-resistant crops and thrived, but for years Burbank's growth would not exceed what its natural resources could sustain.</p>

<p>That changed late in the first decade of the twentieth century, when two developments resurrected the Valley land boom.</p>

<p>First, 1905 brought plans for a massive and controversial water project. The Los Angeles Aqueduct would transport snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada's eastern slope out of the Owens Valley, across the Mojave Desert, over the San Gabriel Mountains, and into the San Fernando Valley, essentially watering one valley at the expense of another. </p>

<p>Construction began in 1909 and in 1913 water once bound for Owens Lake <a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m818.html">flowed into the San Fernando Valley</a> and through the taps of Burbank homes and businesses.</p>

<p>Second, Southern California's interurban rail network, the Pacific Electric Railway, began to expand into the San Fernando Valley and connect the mostly-undeveloped plain with downtown Los Angeles and other regional population centers.</p>

<p>With a modest population, Burbank residents had some trouble convincing the Pacific Electric to bring its streetcars to the town. The railway only agreed to extend its Glendale-Los Angeles line into Burbank after extracting a subsidy of $48,000 from residents.</p>

<p>Like the aqueduct, the arrival of the Pacific Electric was not without controversy. Burbank resident J.W. Fawkes had patented the nation's first monorail, a suspended car that he dubbed the Aerial Swallow. Fawkes built a prototype along a short segment of Olive Avenue and planned, after securing the right-of-way, to extend the line to Glendale. He urged his fellow residents to reject the Pacific Electric's demands and instead adopt his own experimental concept. In the end, Burbank chose the Pacific Electric's more conventional option. The Aerial Swallow became known as "Fawkes' Folly," and the first Pacific Electric streetcar from Los Angeles rolled into Burbank on September 6, 1911.</p>

<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m17278.html"><img alt="'Fawkes' Folly,' an experimental monorail that operated briefly in Burbank in 1911.

<p>With much of the now rapidly-developing Valley being swallowed up by the City of Los Angeles, residents of Burbank petitioned the state legislature to allow the town to incorporate as its own city. On July 8, 1911, the City of Burbank came into being.</p>

<p>In the succeeding years, independent Burbank became a major center for two industries that would dominate Southern California. </p>

<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m4332.html"><img alt="First National Studios in Burbank, circa 1927-1931. The studio facility is today the home to Warner Bros.

<p>The filmed entertainment business, nominally headquartered in Hollywood, came to Burbank in the 1920s when First National Pictures built a film studio on Olive Avenue. Following the success of First National's 1929 talkie film, <em>The Jazz Singer</em>, Warner Brothers Pictures acquired the studio and moved from its Hollywood home to the Burbank lot. Other production companies would soon follow: Columbia Pictures purchased land in the city for use as a backlot and, in 1939, Walt Disney Productions moved into its new home on Buena Vista Street. (Next year, KCET will follow in their footsteps when it moves into its new Burbank facility.)</p>

<p><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m10957.html"><img alt="Lockheed assembly plant in Burbank, circa 1940.

<p>In 1928, another transplant from Hollywood, the Lockheed Aircraft Company, settled down in Burbank. An early leader in the fledgling aviation industry, Lockheed became a crucial supplier of Allied warplanes during World War II&mdash;and a major attractor of new workers and residents.</p>

<p>As for the the description of Sumner as Johnston's "eventual replacement," you're right, and I've updated the post to remove the word. I used "eventual" because Sumner arrived some three weeks after Johnston submitted his resignation, but Johnston did indeed remain in San Francisco until Sumner's arrival and, in fact, was praised by the U.S. War Department for turning over his command in good order.</p>]]>

<p>Every summer, Southern Californians flock to the <a href="http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/">Hollywood Bowl</a> for evenings of music and picnicking under the stars. As the Los Angeles Philharmonic begins its 90th season at the venue, we look back at the Bowl's history through archived images from the <a href="http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/visit/museum.cfm">Hollywood Bowl Museum</a> and other <a href="http://www.laassubject.org">L.A. as Subject</a> members.</p>

<p>The Bowl's <a href="http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/philpedia/hollywood-bowl-history/first-organizers.cfm">origins</a> as a musical venue date back to 1919, when the newly-formed Theatre Arts Alliance dispatched two of its members, William Reed and his son H. Ellis, to the Hollywood Hills to find a suitable location for outdoor productions. After a long search, the Reeds finally found their desired site: a shaded canyon and popular picnic spot known as Daisy Dell. Nestled in the hills near the entrance to the Cahuenga Pass, the site was a natural amphitheater, as H. Ellis Reed discovered:</p>

<p>"I scaled a barbed wire fence, went up to the brow of a hill," Reed said. "Dad stood near a live oak in the center of the bowl-shaped area and we carried on a conversation. We rushed back to the Alliance with a glowing report."</p>]]>

<p>Daisy Dell&mdash;soon to become known as the Hollywood Bowl&mdash;hosted concerts, graduation ceremonies, and other community events in 1920, but it was in 1921 that the Bowl's best-known association began. On March 27, 1921, the outdoor venue hosted its first Los Angeles Philharmonic performance, an Easter sunrise service attended by more than 800 concertgoers. The following year, the Philharmonic played its first official summer season in the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

<p>The first concertgoers stretched out blankets over the Bowl's wild grass or sat on temporary benches as bands and orchestras performed on a simple wooden stage. As the venue grew in popularity, the Bowl installed permanent seating and, in 1926, 1927, and 1928, installed a series of band shells meant to provide a visual backdrop and to enhance the amphitheater's natural acoustics. The 1928 shell, designed by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright), introduced the now-familiar concept of concentric arches but lasted only one season.</p>

<p><img alt="In 1922, the year of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's first season at the Bowl, the venue consisted of moveable wooden benches and a temporary stage.

<p><img alt="In 1927, the Hollywood Bowl debuted a pyramidal band shell designed by Lloyd Wright.

<p><img alt="The following year, a new band shell designed by Wright featured concentric elliptical arches. It suffered weather damage that following winter and was discarded.

<p>Finally, in 1929, the Bowl received a permanent shell, inspired by Wright's design but featuring circular rather than elliptical arches. It became instantly recognizable worldwide and, with only a few modifications by architect Frank Gehry in the 1970s and 1980s, remained in use through 2003. In 2004, a more commodious version of the old band shell debuted, based on the original design but large enough to accommodate a full orchestra.</p>

<p>Although the Bowl is best known as a symphonic music venue, it has hosted a variety of events, from Hollywood High School's annual graduation ceremony to speeches by political leaders and dignitaries.</p>

<p>In April 1943, Soong May-ling, the wife of Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, concluded a wartime speaking tour of the United States--organized by film producer David O. Selnick--with a rousing speech at the Bowl. Hollywood luminaries, Caltech scientists, and more than 30,000 others filled the Bowl the hear Soong describe China's war with Japan. Soong concluded her speech with a call for the U.S. Congress to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, an 1882 law that banned Chinese immigration into the United States. With China as an ally in the war against Japan, Congress complied that December.</p>

<p>In 1946, Frank Sinatra became the first popular artist to play at the Bowl. It was a controversial appearance, as some objected to Sinatra's sharing the stage with the Philharmonic, but the Bowl began to incorporate popular acts into its schedule. During one especially memorable week in 1965, the Bowl hosted separate performances by the Beatles, Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, and Bob Dylan. This summer, that tradition of diverse offerings continues with Bowl performances by rock band Maroon 5, country singer Dolly Parton, comedian Eddie Izzard, and, of course, concerts by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.</p>

<p>Another Hollywood Bowl tradition&mdash;picnicking&mdash;dates back to the early 1950s. Although Daisy Dell hosted many picnickers before the first note was ever played in the Bowl, in-seat snacking was forbidden at performances until 1952. That year, Dorothy Chandler&mdash;a noted patron of the arts who helped save the facility from financial ruin in 1951&mdash;changed the rules and created a new custom when she ordered a catered picnic for her guests. In-seat picnicking is still encouraged at the Bowl today.</p>

<p>The Hollywood Bowl recently featured these moments, as well as many others, in a series of 90 retrospective tweets that celebrated the start of the Philharmonic's 90th season at the venue. Those highlights--many of which include images from the collections of the <a href="http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/hollywood_bowl_museum">Hollywood Bowl Museum</a>, a member of the L.A. as Subject research collective--are now <a href="http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/story/90.php">compiled on the Bowl's website</a>. To learn more about the Hollywood Bowl's history, visit the museum at 2301 N. Highland Avenue, next to the venue. Admission is free.</p>
