Other sites have exclusive shorteners, too, like Facebook (fb.me) and YouTube (YouTu.be).&amp;nbsp; When you share a link from those places, those short, branded domains will be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be outdone by a Google announcement, Bit.ly announced that it was partnering with some serious heavyweights (New York Times, AOL, Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post, etc.) to offer a Pro service in limited private Beta. Benefits include: Custom URLs (ex.: nytm.es) and analytics in real-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The option to bake a shortener into your CMS that allows you to create a short URL of your choice, domain and all.&amp;nbsp; This is considerably more heavy lifting than the free services already out there, but offers its own set of benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something as seemingly innocuous as a URL shortener &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; figure into the social media portion of a comprehensive content strategy.&amp;nbsp; There are many, many options, and the decision on which one to use must be carefully considered.&amp;nbsp; While not as important as a content audit or the choice of a CMS, the &lt;b&gt;benefits of choosing the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; URL shortener are clear&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid, useful metrics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute to (rather than hamper) your SEO strategy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevention of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot" id="rue6" title="link rot"&gt;link rot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide the best user experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reinforce branding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security/confidence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metrics component alone may be the make-or-break feature.&amp;nbsp; Most site analytics suites can track in-bound traffic from Twitter.com.&amp;nbsp; Since 30% of Twitter-related link-clicking traffic comes from third-party applications like TweetDeck or Tweetie, tracking the links from the shortener end becomes considerably more important.&amp;nbsp; Some of the services offer more analytics features, and they are quickly improving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain shorteners use different types of HTTP traffic redirects to point to your original URL.&amp;nbsp; Some properly refer the traffic and maintain your hard-fought SEO efforts, others do not.&amp;nbsp; Most of the major players play by the rules and refer the traffic on a permanent basis and do not recycle links.&amp;nbsp; Watch out for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What constitutes the best user experience is always up for debate.&amp;nbsp; Certain shorteners like the Diggbar and HootSuite's ow.ly shortener use frames.&amp;nbsp; While there may be some UX benefits with frames for users, they can also confuse and distract.&amp;nbsp; There is the potential for the frame-based shorteners to cause &lt;a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-growth-of-framebars-kevin-rose-on-the-diggbar-17416" id="l_78" title="metrics and SEO issues"&gt;metrics and SEO issues&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shorteners are only as trustworthy as those using them.&amp;nbsp; We've been taught to avoid unfamiliar links in emails for as long as phishing has been around.&amp;nbsp; Selecting a service that uses a familiar or custom-branded URL domain will give people the confidence to click without fear of spam or malware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, indeed, &lt;b&gt;it does matter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What may have been something destined to be a footnote in the history of The Internets is now something vital to a &lt;b&gt;strong social media strategy&lt;/b&gt;, and by extension, &lt;b&gt;content strategy&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of shortening...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

that Google, a popular search engine, has chosen to include "public" Facebook status updates in the special, Real-Time place in regular Google search results.&amp;nbsp; MySpace and Twitter updates are already showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2. Facebook just rolled out changes to their privacy settings.&amp;nbsp; Upon login, people have been presented with a prompt, asking them to confirm their privacy settings to the default, recommended settings, or to keep their old ones.&amp;nbsp; The default setting for status updates is "everyone," meaning that people's updates of "I'm eating a waffle" are now set to be indexed by Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook claims that this is a reaction to the way that people are using the service in &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_changed_privacy_policies.php%20"&gt;this interview on ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Barry Schnitt, Director of Corporate Communications and Public Policy at Facebook, gives this somewhat veiled explanation:&amp;nbsp; "Because the site is changing, our userbase is changing and the world changing."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever the official stance may be, it is clear that both companies stand to benefit from more updates being made publicly available, and having those updates showing up in search. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3. The final announcement, &lt;a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;amp;art_aid=118190"&gt;as reported by MediaPost&lt;/a&gt;, will have an impact upon those that use the Facebook Pages.&amp;nbsp; From the start, all status updates from a Page have shown up in the news feed of Fans of that Page.&amp;nbsp; Soon, Facebook will be inserting an algorithm into that process, giving preference to Page owners that have a higher level of engagement with their Fans.&amp;nbsp; (Engagement, in this case, being people "Liking" and commenting upon updates.)&amp;nbsp; Simply stated, the more interaction a Page has, more of those updates will appear in Fans' News Feeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does this mean for those that operate Fan Pages on Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your strategy has been to set one up and wait for people to make it viral, then you have your work cut out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren't already clear, it should be blindingly so now: &lt;b&gt;your social media strategy is a content strategy&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Status updates are content.&amp;nbsp; Links and Notes in Facebook are being indexed.&amp;nbsp; Photos on your Page will soon show up in search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for alarm.&amp;nbsp; If dealt with properly, it can be cause for celebration.&amp;nbsp; Reach can now be extended outside of the walled garden of Facebook and into the wide open world of search.&amp;nbsp; More traffic can potentially be driven to Pages and sections of Pages, like Notes, Photos, and Video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be some work involved. Page owners may need to take a new approach to the content they publish to those pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook's new News Feed insertion rules depend on the mojo granted from comments and "Likes."&amp;nbsp; Page administrators will need to curry the favor of those Fans.&amp;nbsp; To do this, publishers and content creators should apply the same SEO-friendly rules to their Facebook content and updates that are likely in place for other content:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Clear, descriptive titles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Concise summaries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Relevant images, video, audio content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper metadata attribution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hooks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other content creators and publishers, these changes may be a wake-up call.&amp;nbsp; Maybe the updates that have been published up to this point haven't been that appealing.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps they were posted just to post something, to stay in front of Fans.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Now may be the time to look at a larger content strategy.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Or, ask bigger questions, such as "What are we doing here?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more outlets [and changes in those outlets' policies] present themselves, they'll need to be incorporated into strategies, workflows, governance, and metrics.&amp;nbsp; Unlike other, more static components of a content strategy, the rules and tactics in social media are more likely change week to week.&amp;nbsp; User agreement changes, acquisitions, and partnerships with competitors can all force a re-examination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even what seems to be a relatively minor change in a single channel may turn out to have a sizable impact. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;["Self Noir" image via Flickr user &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremybrooks/"&gt;Jeremy Brooks&lt;/a&gt; (CC: by-nc)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-1290152561866708283?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/1290152561866708283/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=1290152561866708283' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/1290152561866708283'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/1290152561866708283'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2009/12/privacy-facebook-and-social-media.html' title='Privacy, Facebook, and Social Media Strategy'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SyhKcLKvUFI/AAAAAAAACSA/yHJcT3XhrlA/s72-c/google-facebook-privacy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-1949271420260459395</id><published>2009-12-01T20:14:00.008-06:00</published><updated>2009-12-02T05:47:33.187-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='strategy'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='resolution'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='format'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='entertainment'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='content'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='record industry'/><title type='text'>Is Your Content 'Good Enough'?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SxR78kwWAZI/AAAAAAAACRA/6G_wica5mfE/s640/lp-arm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A couple of weeks ago the Geek Girls Guide &lt;a href="http://www.geekgirlsguide.com/blog/2009/11/16/126/good_enough"&gt;featured a post&lt;/a&gt; about the relatively new and inevitable phenomenon of "Good Enough."&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the answer to a need is less about the most-est and more about the most well-suited.&amp;nbsp; The example is the handy Flip camera -- not the most sophisticated or high-tech, hi-res device.&amp;nbsp; But, it is good enough for most people. (myself included.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;There is a luxury that creators and publishers of content are able to enjoy that the hardware and device manufacturers are not: &lt;b&gt;the flexibility of multiple versions of content&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This concept can apply to many different kinds of content:&amp;nbsp; feeds, documents, or other file types.&amp;nbsp; It also applies to variations of those, like resolution and format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the stadium of rock-n-roll content resolution.&amp;nbsp; Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood and Nine Inch Nails founder Trent Reznor have opposing viewpoints on "Good Enough."&amp;nbsp; They shared their views in a recent set of "New Yorker" articles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenwood &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2009/09/dithering-jonny-greenwood.html#ixzz0XGhmRdVX"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that average mp3 files are fine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="color: #666666; font-family: Times,&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;We had a few complaints that the MP3s of our last record wasn’t encoded at a high enough rate.

give people too many choices.&amp;nbsp; Reznor didn't release the album on cassette or 8-Track.&amp;nbsp; [Even though some people would likely have bought them.]&amp;nbsp; However, he did release it in a way that offered people a variety of attractive, relevant choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the option of multiple versions early in the analysis phase.&amp;nbsp; Know the client, know the audience.&amp;nbsp; Keep the design and interface clean.&amp;nbsp; Clearly explain what is available.&amp;nbsp; People want choices, but not to be overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People that &lt;b&gt;choose their own version of "Good Enough"&lt;/b&gt; will think your company is more than just good enough.&amp;nbsp; They may think it is awesome, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;["Like a record baby" image via Flickr user &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/itchy73/"&gt;itchy73&lt;/a&gt;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SwTQ3EyKn3I/AAAAAAAACQQ/4stdInZYIow/s320/jenkaneco_tweet.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the radio world, an episode of a program with date-neutral content is produced to fill air time should calamity strike [snapped tapes, sunspots, old-fashioned user error, etc.]&amp;nbsp; These episodes are called "evergreens," and are used only as a last resort to avoid the dreaded "dead air."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are replaced often to keep things somewhat current, actually making them less "evergreen" than the name implies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evergreen content is thought to be a godsend to some content creators and publishers.&amp;nbsp; It was relevant before it was even published.&amp;nbsp; It will be relevant for all eternity.&amp;nbsp; It is EVER GREEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But what content is really evergreen?&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; What content does not require some degree of maintenance?&amp;nbsp; What content is not made out-of-date by SOMETHING?&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Content that few will find really valuable or compelling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could possibly happen if content is dealt with in the RonCo Rotisserie method -- set it and forget it?&amp;nbsp; Lots of things.&amp;nbsp; Your content might:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Become out-of-date&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gain a new context&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Become unusable due to CMS updates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expire, from a legal or rights standpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confuse people with multiple versions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And more, unfortunately&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these can lead to a terrible user experience, and even worse, legal liabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publishers and content creators are strapped for time and resources. Many are too busy pushing the content out the door, leaving no time to put a proper content maintenance strategy in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a strategy in place that considers the &lt;b&gt;lifespan&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;life cycle of content&lt;/b&gt; can help avoid these issues.&amp;nbsp; Good questions to ask when putting one together:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the content good for 6 hours or 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do editorial considerations apply?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are different versions of content tracked properly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should it be archived or deleted?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What triggers activities like archiving and relocation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What stays on site, what shows up only in searches?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are legal contracts, rights, and obligations in sync with content?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are new contextual opportunities managed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are new business opportunities applied to existing content?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus many other considerations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plans take time.&amp;nbsp; Content maintenance strategies take time.&amp;nbsp; Workable content strategies take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting a strategy together may add more to existing workflows.&amp;nbsp; Editorial oversight requires staff resources.&amp;nbsp; Long-term CMS issues will be confronted. &amp;nbsp; But, a good maintenance strategy can also provide new opportunities as new business models and development pop up.&amp;nbsp; The final result will be &lt;b&gt;better than evergreen&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will soon find out that your &lt;b&gt;content can remain vibrant and relevant long after it has been published.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;["Pine tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;

back in early October points to the work of journalists engaging in curation via Twitter as a way of "filtering the signal from the noise."&amp;nbsp; The phrase used was "curation is the new aggregation."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more recent &lt;a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/roger/archive/2009/11/09/76139.aspx" target="new"&gt;post on the Simple-talk.com blog&lt;/a&gt; by Roger Hart delves more into the world of content curation in a broader sense, stating that it is a bit of a flavor-of-the-month.&amp;nbsp; I would disagree with that sentiment, having discussed this for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with curation is more specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily, and sometimes twice daily, it is my job to draw from a set pool of content, radio programs' arts and entertainment segments, and publish them into a CMS with text and audio.&amp;nbsp; There is even a daily podcast, my pride and joy, the &lt;a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/pri/.jukebox?action=viewPodcast&amp;amp;podcastId=15343"&gt;PRI: Arts &amp;amp; Entertainment podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years, publishing content in this manner makes me a curator of sorts.&amp;nbsp; Not an aggregator.&amp;nbsp; And here is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curation goes one step beyond aggregation by adding an active, ongoing editorial component.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curation and aggregation are similar in but a few ways.&amp;nbsp; They both want to take lots of content and put it in a place [framework, feed, database, etc.] and they both seek to separate the wheat from the chaff.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, they &lt;b&gt;both require a strategy&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Why is this content being put together? Who will use it?&amp;nbsp; How will they use it?&amp;nbsp; Are they getting it somewhere else right now?&amp;nbsp; What are the staffing impacts? &lt;b&gt;What are the potential outcomes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if the Minneapolis Institute of Art populated their museum based only on aggregation.&amp;nbsp; The people in charge would have noted that the above velvet Mr. T metadata indicated it was a painting, an original, from the 20th century, and possibly placed it next to the Van Gogh or Mondrian.&amp;nbsp; All automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With aggregation the velvet Mr. T painting might end up in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in a totally un-ironic or un-post-modern way.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Aggregation, why would you do that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggregation is automated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggregation collects content based on criteria in the form of metadata or keywords&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Criteria can be adjusted, but remain static otherwise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follows a preset frequency of publishing [as available, weekly, etc.] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, this scenario is unlikely to unfold, but I set it out there to illustrate the point: aggregation excludes the important, active, and ongoing editorial approval from the process of gathering content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggregation has its place.&amp;nbsp; It is easy to set and forget.&amp;nbsp; It requires considerably less staff resources.&amp;nbsp; With carefully selected criteria and sources, it may actually serve the purpose you seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is much &lt;b&gt;more to effective curation than putting similar stuff in a single place&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are contextual cues that no amount of keywords or metadata can surface.&amp;nbsp; Sentiment, branding, and time frame issues: a raw aggregating apparatus is blind to them all.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention the fact that the more open aggregation schemes can be gamed in all sorts of bad ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggregators may have curatorial aspirations.&amp;nbsp; If they could have the same refined output as curation, they likely would.&amp;nbsp; However, that would require more oversight, turning into something else: curation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.&amp;nbsp; What does curation look like, then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curation is, in part, a manual task&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starts with sources to parse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluates content individually based on established editorial criteria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weights content based on context, current events, branding, sentiment, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publishes approved content on appropriate schedule&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, both aggregation and curation can be bad ideas unless there is a &lt;b&gt;workable strategy in place&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;For a good example of a great curatorial strategy, look no further than the true home of the velvet Mr. T, The Velveteria Museum in Portland, OR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object style="height: 344px;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;According to Wikipedia, the concept of physical things being constructed out of smaller, indivisible units, or elements, has been around for about 2,600 years.&amp;nbsp; Science confirmed this about 200 years ago.&amp;nbsp; Atoms can be broken down further, but any division past that atomic level and the element ceases to be an element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the science lesson?&amp;nbsp; What does this have to do with content?&amp;nbsp; I have taken us all back to the science classroom because elements and atoms are a rather fitting analogy.&amp;nbsp; This element is not on the periodic table: it is known as...Content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a production point of view, content has almost always started from the single, discrete piece.&amp;nbsp; From there, each piece has been combined to make a larger component.&amp;nbsp; For example, think of a newspaper article: an election story might appear in the politics section of the Monday edition of the local paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SvON2lgMWdI/AAAAAAAACPQ/17bgKb3-ee8/s640/hierarchy_paper.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For newspapers, selling single stories at the newsstand was a tough proposition.&amp;nbsp; Selling the politics section was too narrow of an appeal.&amp;nbsp; But, if you put that into a larger framework, a whole newspaper with sports scores and weather and classifieds and advertisements, it starts to make more sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same hierarchy existed for many years on public radio.&amp;nbsp; A six minute feature was produced, then included in the larger framework of an hour-long show, and on a select day, broadcast on a radio station.&amp;nbsp; The production direction from small piece to large framework was &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That was before the advent of on-demand listening and podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SvOOBKENlzI/AAAAAAAACPY/D-8FP8mlSTM/s640/hierarchy_radio.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For some, peeling off one layer of that hierarchy to adapt to online consumption habits was seen as enough.&amp;nbsp; If producers took an hour-long show and placed it online, the work was done.&amp;nbsp; No additional production required.&amp;nbsp; Easy.&amp;nbsp; Take the same hour-long chunk that airs on radio stations and make it available online via on-demand and podcasting.&amp;nbsp; But that is not serving the needs of the people that &lt;b&gt;actually consume&lt;/b&gt; the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the newspaper example again, imagine that you want to share an article with a friend.&amp;nbsp; Do you point them to the stack of old newspapers in the garage from the last month? Or the whole newspaper from Monday?&amp;nbsp; Or the Politics section from Monday? The easier way would be to clip the article out, and give them that specific thing you wish to share.&amp;nbsp; Your friend will know exactly what you want them to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing happens in public radio.&amp;nbsp; Some programs are two or more hours long, built out of smaller segments.&amp;nbsp; Wouldn't it be ideal to have those segments in an easy-to-share format online?&amp;nbsp; And wouldn't it be great if you could comment on those individual segments?&amp;nbsp; Of course.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of reasons to publish content at the &lt;b&gt;segment level&lt;/b&gt; for consumption online:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate, focused metadata can be attached&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper taxonomy can be applied in the CMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is SEO-friendly, increasing discover-ability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It becomes much more easily shared via social media&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easier to output via API, RSS, podcast, widgets, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quickly becoming industry standard and convention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are beginning to demand it of content producers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It just makes sense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are reasons NOT to do it, too.&amp;nbsp; Some obstacles you may encounter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not in current workflows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More attention is required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More steps in publishing process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current CMS not equipped to handle it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current outputs not configured to handle it [website, feeds, etc.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater opportunity for user-input error&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits are &lt;b&gt;far too great&lt;/b&gt; not to put forth the effort to overcome the obstacles in the way of segment-level nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author and blogger Seth Godin has made a mantra out of the phrase "Ideas that spread, win."&amp;nbsp; If your idea, in the shape of content, can spread, it can win!&amp;nbsp; Not a jackpot lottery win, but the kind of win that content wants: to be &lt;b&gt;consumed&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;shared easily&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atomic segment-level publishing, FTW!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-3631328225839201126?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/3631328225839201126/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=3631328225839201126' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/3631328225839201126'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/3631328225839201126'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2009/11/is-your-content-atomic-content.html' title='Is your content ATOMIC CONTENT?'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SvMKpLmiy6I/AAAAAAAACPI/Z6DPi7tUJJg/s72-c/table.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-5861160846487655305</id><published>2009-10-26T21:35:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-27T19:34:34.745-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='strategy'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='metadata'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='scarcity'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='content'/><title type='text'>Scarcity, Not Content, Is King.</title><content type='html'>YouTube wants me to get paid.  They sent me an email, telling me as much.  They sent me two, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two videos posted there have been viewed enough, it would seem, that Google views them as a driver of revenues.  [Placement of ads next to popular videos, and sharing the revenue is a totally sound plan to capitalize on those impressions.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;My video candidates, as selected by YouTube:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-six seconds of a rabbit, who happened to be suffering from "Jackalope Syndrome." &lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;(Shope Papilloma Virus - the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shope_papilloma_virus"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; features my photograph of said rabbit. The editor contacted me for permission to use it.)&lt;/span&gt; 48,900 views, at the time of this writing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVp9pOgGl_Y&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVp9pOgGl_Y&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-two seconds of the obscure Sony Discman D-88 CD player in operation.  It was made for playing those equally obscure &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-inch_CD_single"&gt;three inch CD singles&lt;/a&gt; that never really became mainstream. 65,349 views, so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vbfrsoAqFPI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vbfrsoAqFPI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving these emails, I have determined, without question, once and for all, that content is not king.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scarcity is king.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would there be any appeal at all in these videos if there were even 100 others like them?  Not likely.  Since they may never see another video of a Jackalope, the entire planet is forced to view mine.  Well, maybe not the entire planet; just those &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;actually looking for a Jackalope video.&lt;/span&gt;  Scarcity, in this case, gives my video the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As distribution of content becomes easier and more instantaneous, someone may well be poised to eat your lunch.  Companies will be forced [if they haven't already] to decide if what they have to offer people is unique [scarce] and quick-to-marketplace.  The latter point is of interest as well, because scarcity without an outlet becomes effectively non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[It would also be effectively non-existent if not accompanied by the appropriate metadata, but that is another post altogether.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-5861160846487655305?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/5861160846487655305/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=5861160846487655305' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/5861160846487655305'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/5861160846487655305'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2009/10/scarcity-not-content-is-king.html' title='Scarcity, Not Content, Is King.'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-4771676477157703899</id><published>2009-09-25T20:15:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-30T06:13:15.111-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='twitter'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='content'/><title type='text'>Happy Twitter Accidents</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sr13B4FbIxI/AAAAAAAACLE/5QpoQ0M4Pqs/s1600-h/wrong.gif" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5385591603523691282" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sr13B4FbIxI/AAAAAAAACLE/5QpoQ0M4Pqs/s320/wrong.gif" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 238px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 248px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of you may know, I am on Twitter under not only one, but two aliases: @wd45, my personal account, and @PRI, for my company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that manages multiple Twitter accounts will tell you that the third-party applications out there, like Seesmic and TweetDeck were a godsend for easily managing them.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Mostly.  &lt;/span&gt;TweetDeck makes is almost too easy to make a...mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I maintain a firewall between these two accounts for more than one reason -- I am interested in maintaining my own identity on the @wd45, with ridiculous pictures [see &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/72zsw"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/hvep1"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/b9oai"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;] posted to Twitpic, the easy Twitter-linking, photo posting&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;service.  Things that I post there might not interest someone that follows the @PRI account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The @PRI account services the needs of the company, and I have been quite diligent about what makes the cut and what does not.  People expect certain things from the company, and they will be expecting that same level of quality and consideration from the @PRI tweets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a super-successful venture, with two happy mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, a follower had sent a real direct message (a DM, in Twitter parlance), to which I responded via the same, private channel.  Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had offered a note of praise for the company.  I looked at her profile page to ensure that the account was real, and noticed that the URL in her bio was yoga-related.  In the interest of forging that personal, real-person connection, I said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Thanks for listening.  I practice yoga twice each week as well as daily meditation.  I don't know what I would do without it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was not a DM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went to the 5,000 or so followers the account had at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing my misstep, I quickly evaluated my options:&lt;br /&gt;-erase it, hope noone notices&lt;br /&gt;-send out an 'oops' message and hope that folks ignore it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the latter, but folks did not ignore it.  The first response said, "Yeah, I thought that was pretty random. :)"  About a dozen people were thrilled by it. Some even said "It is nice to know that you are a real person."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been an isolated incident, meant as a heuristic tool.  Never again would it happen.  Vigilance must be maintained!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was, until this week.  I was excited to post a somewhat personal thing to @wd45.  September 23 was John Coltrane's birthday.  I was going to show my jazz acumen to my followers by saying this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sr1wW79COYI/AAAAAAAACK8/MkHRJyZC7rM/s1600-h/tranetweet.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5385584268758104450" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sr1wW79COYI/AAAAAAAACK8/MkHRJyZC7rM/s320/tranetweet.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 203px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You might notice that it is on the @PRI account.  Oops again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were seven re-tweets, and one other related response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this reinforces the notion that people want that personal, real-life connection with those they follow in the social media realm; even brands. &lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-4771676477157703899?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/4771676477157703899/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=4771676477157703899' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4771676477157703899'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4771676477157703899'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2009/09/happy-twitter-accidents.html' title='Happy Twitter Accidents'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sr13B4FbIxI/AAAAAAAACLE/5QpoQ0M4Pqs/s72-c/wrong.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-6646372932127023545</id><published>2009-09-10T06:15:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2009-09-11T21:18:49.650-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='radio'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='old media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='record industry'/><title type='text'>090909 was a time machine</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SqsCrt9-4BI/AAAAAAAACK0/vNILNqpLElQ/s1600-h/volt.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SqsCrt9-4BI/AAAAAAAACK0/vNILNqpLElQ/s320/volt.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5380397129921388562" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three items happened in the past week that made me think that I stepped out of a time machine rather than the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Beatles had their albums reissued on CD&lt;br /&gt;2. The iPod Nano update included a FM radio&lt;br /&gt;3. The Chevy Volt electric car will now include a hitch so that it can be pulled by horses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, one of those things is silly.  The other two are just bewildering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beatles catalog of albums was reissued on 090909.  [Yes, clever, Revolution No. 9].  This is of interest, from my perspective, for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: In the late 1980s, the Fab Four's albums were all issued on CD, just like all of the other rock giants - Elvis, the Stones, etc. And there was mixed response.  That was fairly early in the world of the CD; people were starting to get the hang of properly mastering for the medium.  Prior to that, things were mixed and mastered with LP or cassettes in mind, leaving the CDs sounding thin compared to the old LPs everyone was used to hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The record companies and artists [or their estates] realized this, and reissued the entire catalog of other major selling artists once again, twice, or even three or four times over.  While working in a record store in college, I witnessed on a few occasions complete reissues of all of the albums of both Miles Davis and KISS [to mention a couple of disparate examples].  Add a bonus track, add a new set of liner notes, better the sound, and you have money in the wallet.  Easy peasy.  Not so with the Beatles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Liverpool Lads had to wait for quite some time before the catalog was given a more just edition.  The audiophiles and Beatlemaniacs will be buying these, and folks that missed them the first time around, but there is another group that will not.  THE KIDS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have talked about it here in the past, and album sales reinforce this time and again.  Kids consume tons of music.  Kids aren't lining up for CDs anymore.  Kids &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;will,&lt;/span&gt; however, buy the video game that features those songs.  Smart move with the Rock Band thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Apple is feeling the heat when it comes to the decline in music sales.  In a bid to remain relevant, they announced, also on 090909, that the iPod Nano would now include an FM tuner.  I thought it was a nice feature on the Zune, when it rolled out.  I am sure it was a selling point for the seven or eight people that bought Zunes.  But for the newest iPod?

It was a door prize.  The grand prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did spend three bills on a DVD player back in 1999, though.  I am not &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; behind the curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward [ha! pun intended! OMG!] to 2009.  I have canceled both my OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSEIVE Comcast Digital Cable package and all of its on-demand video capabilities.  Also on the scrap heap is my Netflix membership, victim of one too many scratched-beyond-playable DVDs delivered [and more often, simply unwatched].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some family is visiting, so what am I to do?  Time to make good on that promise of being moderately technologically literate and use the internets to entertain my guests.  I had two options, as far as I was concerned: iTunes or Amazon.  I like both because I have established accounts with each.  One click or two, no need to fetch my wallet, and I will soon be viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at iTunes, it appears that I will need to wait until the 1.21 gigawatts [or GB, if you must] completes downloading before my viewing can begin.  Moving along...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the option for download, but also the on-demand feature.  [I got used to the on-demand feature with Netflix -- one of the reasons I kept that subscription for so long.]  I clicked and we were off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture quality was fine for me and my 9-year-old non-HDTV.  As a matter of fact, the quality was as fine as my DVD player through an S-Video cable, a feat that still boggles the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a parable here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to something as fleeting as rental entertainment, the on-demand is going to win out in many households.  Downloads will have their place where connectivity is lacking or portability is priority.  But, as long as people are plopping down in their living rooms, this will be the pick.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-8799076068497377433?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/8799076068497377433/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=8799076068497377433' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8799076068497377433'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8799076068497377433'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2009/09/i-rented-movie-from-amazon.html' title='I rented a movie from Amazon'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/Sqcsm7sI8iI/AAAAAAAACKk/VRL5MrqdRu0/s72-c/projector.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-6781434858446110846</id><published>2008-09-23T21:00:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-23T21:40:28.247-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='streaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='format'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='news'/><title type='text'>Is that a complete news studio in your pocket, or...</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SNmoaNqBMhI/AAAAAAAABR0/MDGoYNJVr8k/s1600-h/uptake.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SNmoaNqBMhI/AAAAAAAABR0/MDGoYNJVr8k/s320/uptake.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5249412008972988946" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been witness to some piece of technology, earlier dismissed, that now proves to be a an obvious chunk of awesome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Count me in on the streaming live video front now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the McCain/Palin ticket graced the fringes of the Twin Cities metro on Friday I had a unique opportunity to witness some of it live.  Not in person, not on the television, and not on a mainstream media news site.  Instead, it was on &lt;a href="http://theuptake.org/"&gt;www.theuptake.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Uptake is an aggregation of citizen journalists, using a central site for coordination and distribution.  We can now say that citizen journalism is nothing new.  However, the critical difference is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; that technology allows them to stream live video from their compatible devices [ a hacked iPhone in the clip I viewed, as the cameraman described it to an interviewee. ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These streams are available on theuptake.org live as they happened, and also in archived form after the fact.  They use the service &lt;a href="http://qik.com/"&gt;Qik&lt;/a&gt; for the live video back-end, and blip.tv for archived/produced pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been aware of the technology since Qik's release, but thought that it might be an answer looking for a question.  The tech itself seemed sound enough, but the missing link to me was in notification to potential viewers.  How would people that wanted to see the video know to visit The Uptake to partake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer was now simple, as it was how I found out.  One of my Twitter followers, @noahkunin, is a correspondent for The Uptake.  He sent out tweets that preceded the event, and while it took place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the picture is complete.  The tech to harness the moment live to teh Internets is in place, an aggregator like The Uptake is in place to coordinate the coverage, and, a suitably viral method to notify people about it is also in place.  The archive in is place; it is the last and oldest piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It means that now things will be covered in a way that they haven't yet been covered.  Citizen journalists are not only equiped with a phone/camera/video camera in their pocket; now they are packing what is just shy of a complete news studio.  And that is a big deal.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-6781434858446110846?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/6781434858446110846/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=6781434858446110846' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/6781434858446110846'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/6781434858446110846'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/09/is-that-complete-news-studio-in-your.html' title='Is that a complete news studio in your pocket, or...'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SNmoaNqBMhI/AAAAAAAABR0/MDGoYNJVr8k/s72-c/uptake.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-2856652389811671612</id><published>2008-08-04T07:35:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-04T07:44:27.575-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='content'/><title type='text'>Microsoft Midori: the melon-flavored Windows replacement</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SJb3mqJe8yI/AAAAAAAAA54/rJG7E70_HGU/s1600-h/midori.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SJb3mqJe8yI/AAAAAAAAA54/rJG7E70_HGU/s320/midori.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5230640260758565666" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had to read that a couple of times.  Microsoft Midori.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft is now looking into the world, post-Windows.  &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7540282.stm"&gt;This BBC story&lt;/a&gt; tells us that MS has become aware that many people are no longer tied to a single machine; rather, they are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;promiscuous&lt;/span&gt; with the devices they use to consume data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cope, they are set to create an OS that will accomodate such behavior.  And the project shares its name with a melon-flavored liqueur.  Midori.  [it also means "green" in Japanese, tells me the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_liqueur"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft names projects after alcoholic drinks, and the BBC tells me that I am promiscuous.

Witness yesterday's earthquake.  Seconds after it happened, some of my Twitter friends in LA posted about it. Moments later, a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MissRFTC/statuses/871803775"&gt;new internet meme&lt;/a&gt; was born.  It was Tweeted and re-Tweeted all afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What normally would have taken a few days to make the rounds in the world of email a few years ago, now takes seconds in some communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As go memes, so goes the internets.  If you are launching something, pad those numbers for bandwith &amp;amp; capacity.

People were bummed they had to wait for the video to download to begin viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/14/microsoft-and-netflix-announce-partnership/"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; that their streaming video service, originally offered on their website and then through a dedicated set-top box, will now be available via the XBox 360 this fall.  This of course means that Netflix and Microsoft are now in partnership.  That seems like kind of a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two items in the same week?  Good thing it wasn't last week, amid the destroyer-class hysterics of the iPhone.  Which brings up a good point -- people are still going to go home to sit in front of a screen.    Granted, wireless personal devices are going to be the major focus from here on out, as &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=209100488"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from Information Week indicates.  But, not everything will be consumed on a personal device.

This has been close to my heart, as I have family that was affected by these floods.  My grandparents' home was rendered uninhabitable by the flood waters, so naturally I wanted to know what was going on in the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned to the site &lt;a href="http://www.iowaflood.com"&gt;iowaflood.com&lt;/a&gt; upon the suggestion of Public Radio International's mroning news show &lt;a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/a&gt;.  A&lt;strong style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;ndy Brudtkuhl&lt;/strong&gt;, a consultant from the Des Moines area, set up a site that drew upon the strengths of citizen journalism and user generated content [UGC].  [In two hours, no less.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than exclusively posting content of his own, he tapped major media sites [TV, newspaper], services like releases from government officials &amp;amp; the National Weather Service,  and feeds of user-generated content from YouTube, Flickr, and Twitter to create a much more comprehensive resource.  Other tools included Yahoo Pipes and WordPress.  He gives the full details &lt;a href="http://48webconsulting.com/projects/building-iowafloodcom/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, to me, represents what citizen journalism can really be.  In situations where people need up-to-the-minute coverage of events that change as quickly, custom aggregators like this have no peer.  The local TV stations don't have the manpower or editorial jurisdiction to place unedited feeds on their sites.  Conversely, the average Joe doesn't have a helicopter for those aerial views of the flood damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At certain times like this, the power and resources of the masses, with their cameras and mobiles, comes to the fore to complete the coverage. The media goes on about its business most of the time, with UGC trickling in to augment coverage, but switches gears when significant events deem necessary.  I don't think one will not supplant the other; we have proof of a symbiotic relationship in iowaflood.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may well prove to be a model to be followed for future catastrophic events.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-1985642584696359986?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/1985642584696359986/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=1985642584696359986' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/1985642584696359986'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/1985642584696359986'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/06/peerless-iowa-flood-coverage.html' title='Peerless Iowa Flood coverage'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFjzvvDiEFI/AAAAAAAAAxo/-djM5syEGoI/s72-c/floods.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-7747781603195231699</id><published>2008-06-16T17:21:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-16T17:35:04.907-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='new media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='old media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='news'/><title type='text'>CNN Shirt [Beta]</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFbneqIkzHI/AAAAAAAAAso/3HAExHSJ6WU/s1600-h/cnn_shirt_beta.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFbneqIkzHI/AAAAAAAAAso/3HAExHSJ6WU/s320/cnn_shirt_beta.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212608132620274802" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here is a novel idea -- take headlines, and put them on t-shirts, on demand.  Clever, ironic, and just the thing for all of your news-following hipster friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this on the CNN website for the first time today -- there is a little t-shirt-shaped icon&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFbperQkWeI/AAAAAAAAAsw/lq9Z5dwsBlI/s1600-h/cnn_shirt_beta_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFbperQkWeI/AAAAAAAAAsw/lq9Z5dwsBlI/s320/cnn_shirt_beta_2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212610331945490914" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; next to some of the stories with intriguing headlines.  The only other icon there is the video camera denoting video content.  There is a list of all of the shirts they have come up with so far &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/tshirt/allshirts/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Some highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"Robo restaurant a hit with diners"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"Food zips on rails in automated eatery."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"Look out!  Your groceries are shrinking!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;As you can see, these are the lighter stories, as I am certain CNN does not want to immortalize certain things in shirt form with their logo.  Other things, they will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is simple: the headline, and in a smaller font below, the phrase "I just saw it on CNN.com" followed by the date and time that the article was posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, combined with their &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cnn"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/politicalticker"&gt;feeds&lt;/a&gt;, will have them in with the cool kids.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-7747781603195231699?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/7747781603195231699/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=7747781603195231699' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/7747781603195231699'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/7747781603195231699'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/06/cnn-shirt-beta.html' title='CNN Shirt [Beta]'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFbneqIkzHI/AAAAAAAAAso/3HAExHSJ6WU/s72-c/cnn_shirt_beta.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-5463883025641416356</id><published>2008-06-13T11:51:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-13T12:16:36.130-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social networking'/><title type='text'>MySpace gets a face[book] lift</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFKrQusucEI/AAAAAAAAAsg/RAL0iV-J_zw/s1600-h/247086052_acc64faf23.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFKrQusucEI/AAAAAAAAAsg/RAL0iV-J_zw/s320/247086052_acc64faf23.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5211416022722965570" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[ image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robotson/"&gt;Robotson&lt;/a&gt; / Flickr ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is about bloody time that &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_7452000/7452715.stm"&gt;MySpace gets a face lift&lt;/a&gt;.  The Internets are abuzz about what this will actually mean for the almighty 'Space.  This comes less than a month after the announcement that Facebook was about to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_7408000/7408215.stm"&gt;have a freshening.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many people that have accounts in more than one place; the MySpace/Facebook dichotomy seems to be one of the most common.  They have different uses for them, different contacts on each service.  The one thing that these 2+ members say is this: MySpace sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on a professional level, colleagues have noted that it is:&lt;br /&gt;1. a wasteland&lt;br /&gt;2. for teenagers and pedophiles&lt;br /&gt;3. a lost cause&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MySpace read the writing on the SuperWall and put into place their version of the wildly successful Applications, and are now set to refine their navigation and layout to make things easier to deal with and less dissonant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sites seem to be going in a common direction, but Facebook appears to be leading the way.  Being the underdog in terms of page views is not necessarily a bad thing when you actually have an operational strategy in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not to say that MySpace doesn't do anything well -- they are still one of the best places to keep up on your favorite bands.  FB has tried to emulate some of this; they have the tools in place.  However, there is no replacement for that instant cognition that people of a certain age have when in comes to seeking more info on a musical act: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;look at their MySpace page.&lt;/span&gt;  No amount of clean interface will get you that.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-5463883025641416356?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/5463883025641416356/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=5463883025641416356' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/5463883025641416356'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/5463883025641416356'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/06/myspace-gets-facebook-lift.html' title='MySpace gets a face[book] lift'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SFKrQusucEI/AAAAAAAAAsg/RAL0iV-J_zw/s72-c/247086052_acc64faf23.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-775218279348306779</id><published>2008-04-16T09:45:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-16T10:03:18.811-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='streaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='VOD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='HDTV'/><title type='text'>The Internets are bound for the sewer.</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAYU8FvVEtI/AAAAAAAAAb4/hpOtdRG1x9Y/s1600-h/2345367259_c7bdf15bcc.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAYU8FvVEtI/AAAAAAAAAb4/hpOtdRG1x9Y/s320/2345367259_c7bdf15bcc.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189858643156472530" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[ image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/m500/"&gt;Joe M500&lt;/a&gt; / Flickr ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internets are bound for the sewer.  Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BBC &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7350431.stm"&gt;has a story&lt;/a&gt; today about an Ofcom pronouncement that indicates the new home of the mega-fast internets could be in the sewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is not that big of a deal.  France is doing it already.  It is more sophisticated than running a fatty LAN cable through the storm drains; it is an extension of 'conduit sharing' that is already taking place.  Providers are also looking at literally sharing conduits with other utilities as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the next generation of broadband leaves the once-fast cable modems in the dust, we move closer to instant access.  The article states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Connections of up to 100Mbp will allow for a host of new services including on-demand high definition (HD) TV, DVD quality film downloads in minutes, online video messaging, CCTV home surveillance and HD gaming services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have high-speed internet, and video-on-demand in my home, and it is abundantly clear that it operates at the fringe of effectiveness much of the time.  Compression artifacts in video distract from viewing, audio on some on-demand material is less-than-mp3 quality, and overall navigation time of the system is snail-paced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I am still sometimes amazed that Comcast is able to shove as much stuff through that standard 75-Ohm coaxial as they do.  Imagine if it were fiber optic, at 8-10x the capacity.  Now we are talking.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-775218279348306779?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/775218279348306779/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=775218279348306779' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/775218279348306779'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/775218279348306779'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/04/internets-are-bound-for-sewer.html' title='The Internets are bound for the sewer.'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAYU8FvVEtI/AAAAAAAAAb4/hpOtdRG1x9Y/s72-c/2345367259_c7bdf15bcc.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-4135842968248837288</id><published>2008-04-14T13:09:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-14T14:24:57.522-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='record industry'/><title type='text'>Music = video games &amp; deodorant</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAOvXlvVEsI/AAAAAAAAAbw/J6H6-byDONw/s1600-h/1404147923_0953b17e4d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAOvXlvVEsI/AAAAAAAAAbw/J6H6-byDONw/s320/1404147923_0953b17e4d.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189184015463420610" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[ image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordoncooper/"&gt;Jordon&lt;/a&gt; / Flickr ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I sit listening to a real CD, I am nearly put to tears today about where the music industry has tread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two announcements passed before my eyes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Def Leppard art &lt;a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2008/04/def_leppard_to.html"&gt;debuting their new single&lt;/a&gt; in video game "Guitar Hero III" &lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[thanks &lt;a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/"&gt;Shiny Shiny&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hip-hop producer Jermaine "JD" Dupri has partnered with P&amp;amp;G, makers of "Tag Body Spray" to create TAG Records.  &lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[via &lt;a href="http://www.trendcentral.com/WebApps/App/SnapShots/Category.aspx?CategoryId=17"&gt;Trendcentral&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my own loyalties hew to the old model of the business, however outdated they may be, I can see why they are doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things are different from the days when I was working for Capitol Records, an independent record store, the college radio station and the local public radio station.  [At the same time.]  Capitol has moved further down the ladder in importance in the industry, becoming yet another barely defined brand in the EMI Music behemoth cache of holdings.  That record store closed its doors.  The public radio station was absorbed in a statewide consolidation.  All that is left is that tiny college station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crossover between video games and music is nothing new, but taking it to the point of debuting a single from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_certification#List_of_certifications"&gt;diamond-selling&lt;/a&gt; band within one is.  This is a band that used the old outfit to sell an astounding &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;12 million copies &lt;/span&gt;of a single title.  As store after store reduce their inventories of CDs and DVDs to make room for video games, then that seems to be the best place to show up.  Fish where the fishes are, yeah?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the TAG collaboration is a bit more indefensible.  Aside from the easy jokes ["Our records don't stink."  Or, "Our records sometimes stink, but we cover it up."  Or...] it seems like less of a natural transition from one to the next.  TAG has tread near this before, with an &lt;a href="http://superflymedia.blogspot.com/2007/04/getting-paid-for-that-content.html"&gt;item highlighted&lt;/a&gt; one year ago this week by yours truly.  That has worked well for TAG -- they have had 26 million people see that video, and by extension their logo.  And more importantly, there have been 26 million views of the dreamy Pete Wentz using the TAG product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, it will be interesting to see how the TAG brand is expressed in this new record label/deodorant relationship.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/d3UTHj16ukM&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/d3UTHj16ukM&amp;amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-4135842968248837288?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/4135842968248837288/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=4135842968248837288' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4135842968248837288'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4135842968248837288'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/04/music-video-games-deodorant.html' title='Music = video games &amp; deodorant'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/SAOvXlvVEsI/AAAAAAAAAbw/J6H6-byDONw/s72-c/1404147923_0953b17e4d.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-8545490751591781784</id><published>2008-04-11T01:33:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-10T21:41:37.633-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='format'/><title type='text'>I am not making this up:  Tastebook</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R_7D9zvL4jI/AAAAAAAAAbo/32ZtmjTvrYM/s1600-h/tastebook.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R_7D9zvL4jI/AAAAAAAAAbo/32ZtmjTvrYM/s320/tastebook.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187799287404945970" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My wife is a fabulous cook.  She gets her ideas from all over the place -- family, friends, cookbooks, and, most recently, the Internets.  for years she has been a frequent visitor of popular site epicurious.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epicurious has been one of those places that was ahead of the social media curve in the same sense as Amazon.  They were both doing social media-type things before folks were even calling it that.  People were posting their recipes, posting comments, and reviewing.  I have eaten well as a result, many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CondeNet, owner of Epicurious, announced investment in a new venture in October 2007.  It was dubbed &lt;a href="http://www.tastebook.com/"&gt;"Tastebook."&lt;/a&gt;  Created by the originators of Ofoto in February 2007, it takes some of the concepts of the Ofoto photo service [now known as Kodak Easy Share Gallery]; taking the digital and making it tangible in the form of prints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what Tastebook is capable of, from their press release:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" &gt;Registered Epicurious.com members can now instantly import their My Epi Recipe Boxes to TasteBook. In addition, by logging onto TasteBook, users will have access to more than 25,000 editor-tested recipes from Epicurious and may upload their personal recipes. With TasteBook’s simple drag-and-drop interface, making a personal cookbook is as easy as creating a “playlist” comprised of recipes. Details like cover art and title are also customizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone can create a TasteBook today by visiting www.tastebook.com or www.epicurious.com to get started. Using the TasteBook service is free, and a personal cookbook filled with up to 100 recipes costs only $34.95.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two paragraphs cover what blogger Kevin Kelly speaks of in a post titled &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php"&gt;"Better than free."&lt;/a&gt;  Whether Tastebook is aware of it or not, they have provided about five of the "Eight Generatives Better Than Free."  In a nutshell, Kelly posits that in the world of free things, creators/aggregators/distributors need to offer value to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epicurious users have access to those 25,000 recipes already, for free.  Users have also always had the option of printing a page out of Epicurious as they would print any web page, but those loose pages tend to accumulate in unusable piles on counters, waiting to be painstakingly indexed and filed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they haven't had up to this point is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a copy they can immediately pull off of the shelf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;user-selected content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;easily accessed content [via index &amp;amp; tabs in the book]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;findable content [as opposed to those print-outs]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a hard copy they can happily dust the flour off of [as opposed to a keyboard]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;They may have had a couple of those, but the more you have in one place, the greater that value proposition appears.  Tastebook is making this downright irresistible for net-savvy cooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name may or may not have been a clever play on the white-hot Facebook.  If you ask me, their idea is hot enough that they didn't even need to bother.  Perhaps the name was an update on the standby name of 'cookbook;' that term is still functional if not overly workman-like, for sure, but Tastebook lends an air of, well, taste.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-8545490751591781784?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/8545490751591781784/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=8545490751591781784' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8545490751591781784'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8545490751591781784'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/04/i-am-not-making-this-up-tastebook.html' title='I am not making this up:  Tastebook'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp2.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R_7D9zvL4jI/AAAAAAAAAbo/32ZtmjTvrYM/s72-c/tastebook.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-4040644043114745629</id><published>2008-04-10T11:33:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-10T12:35:43.630-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='web 2.0'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='advertising'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='search'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='literacy'/><title type='text'>Yahoo!

They did the same thing that Special K did in this most recent ad -- instructed folks to go to a specific search engine and enter a term, circumventing the need for a special URL or landing page that might be hard to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger Cabel Sasser noticed this same phenomenon in Japan on a recent trip; this post details what he saw as a major shift away from URLs toward suggested search engines and terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digging further into the Kellogg site, you will notice that the second item on their left-side navigation is an invite to join them at their &lt;a href="http://new.groups.yahoo.com/specialkgroup"&gt;Yahoo Group&lt;/a&gt;.  I went there to find a lavishly branded Group, easily navigable even by those unfamiliar with Yahoo Groups.  Newsgroups have come a long way, and this is no exception; there are social functions built in, maps, etc.  This is an extensive project, not just a social media tag-along.  Props for that.  [I am just waiting for a Facebook app...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R_5LtDvL4iI/AAAAAAAAAbg/C21FfD5fcKI/s1600-h/ksearch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R_5LtDvL4iI/AAAAAAAAAbg/C21FfD5fcKI/s320/ksearch.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187667058246804002" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part about trying to integrate this sort of partnership into ad campaigns is yet to come.  Folks are pretty well set in their ways when it comes to search engine loyalty.  There needs to be an appealing value proposition to make a switch from something as ingrained as Google in their browsing habits.  Especially in light of the fact that tons of &lt;a href="http://www.dailydomainer.com/200742-yahoo-top-search-term-on-google.html"&gt;people are typing URLs&lt;/a&gt; into search engines instead of their address bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling both lazy and insolent, I went to Google rather than Yahoo to do the search thing.  I did the search in my Firefox search field, with Google as the default. Their helpful little 'suggestion' feature brought up 'Special K diet' after I finished the 'K.' Since this feature is based on common searches as entered by other people, I discovered that I was not the only lazy/insolent one.   So much for following instructions, America.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/D9lTRfh0gcU&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D9lTRfh0gcU&amp;amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-4040644043114745629?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/4040644043114745629/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=4040644043114745629' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4040644043114745629'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/4040644043114745629'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/04/special-k-yahoo.html' title='Yahoo!

[Soon I will have a great need to share photos, and this looks to be one of the easiest ways.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some truly odd restrictions, though.  According to this article, only Pro users [those paying the $24.95 annually] will have access, and even then they will only be able to upload videos with a duration of less than 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other option is for folks to put their videos on YouTube for free.  Videos up to 10 minutes in length.  For free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know that the value proposition is great enough for folks to pay the $25/year to have their videos next to their photos.  As long as those videos are less than 90 seconds.  There are more benefits to the Pro membership than this new video hosting, so perhaps those already paying will see it as an added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would image that Yahoo's reasoning behind the project is this:&lt;br /&gt;1.

A full page promo on page six, right after the table of contents offers a glimpse of what is available on their site.  There is a specific URL pointing people to the issue-specific version, so if you get the magazine second-hand, like me, then you will be getting the content they mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers are lured with mp3 from artists in this issue, music videos, a video podcast, and a "react" section where you can voice your opinion or add yet another list to the world of rock-n-roll.  Film trailers, blogs, and 10+ daily updated news stories round out the bait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you visit that URL, &lt;a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6394/Pasted_Issue_40"&gt;pastemagazine.com/issue40&lt;/a&gt;, you are presented with an even more vanilla brochure of links than was in the paper magazine.  Only after you click those links, things get interesting.  I would imagine that they are using a separate URL in order to track the effectiveness of what amounts to a large piece of real estate in the printed edition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand what they are up to here; having teases for the web content after each story may not present enough of a benefit to readers.  Having the content all in one place [closely following the table of contents in the print edition] gives readers a stronger value proposition.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"I can get all of this if I go to the web?"  &lt;/span&gt;That may be enough.  I would be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item No. 2: a few pages later, we are greeted by another full page of names in about 8 point font.  These are not the names of best guitar solos on some rock list, but rather the names of those that paid &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; for their subscription to the magazine than the offered rate.  "Paste" asked their readers to pay what they felt was a worthy amount for a subscription.  If you paid more, you got nothing but your name in this special section.  [And the magazine, of course.]   Someone was a show-off and paid $70!&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-8255886998939751143?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/8255886998939751143/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=8255886998939751143' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8255886998939751143'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/8255886998939751143'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/03/paste-magazine-subscriptions-and-teh.html' title='Paste Magazine, subscriptions, and teh Internets'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp0.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R-aItzJ1UeI/AAAAAAAAAZg/D89ZiFW4rbE/s72-c/paste.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-7818483264440001713</id><published>2008-03-24T11:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-24T12:35:18.973-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iPod'/><title type='text'>Rumor: iPods and unlimited music</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R-fjezJ1UfI/AAAAAAAAAZo/BlBNh1Pj8Pg/s1600-h/2069646878_b95811e9b0_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R-fjezJ1UfI/AAAAAAAAAZo/BlBNh1Pj8Pg/s400/2069646878_b95811e9b0_m.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181360014580077042" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[ image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/redcarpet/"&gt;Mickipedia&lt;/a&gt; / Flickr ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, then you are following all things that are related to the iPhone and music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not, then you might be surprised to hear the rumors that Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, is having some discussions that would have some interesting repercussions for the European iPod market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the lead of Nokia, Jobs is &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/03/18/apple_considering_premium_for_unlimited_iphone_ipod_music.html"&gt;allegedly offering a fee&lt;/a&gt; paid to record labels to open up an all-you-can listen music buffet on the ubiquitous iPod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Nokia may have already negotiated a deal like this in the Euro market, they don't have anywhere near the product saturation Apple enjoys.  Jobs may be using this to his advantage; while Nokia's fee paid to record labels is $80 for that all-you-can-listen-for-the-life-of-the-device plan, the Apple man has offered all of $20 for the same arrangement [allegedly].  I am sure a myriad of reasons are behind his $60-per-device discounted offer -- the aforementioned market share, an unwillingness to tack on any more Euros that won't end up in his shareholders' pockets, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all fine and good, but as blogger and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inside Radio &lt;/span&gt;founder Jerry del Colliano &lt;a href="http://insidemusicmedia.blogspot.com/2008/03/inside-apples-ipod-subscription-plan.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, don't get too excited.  This is for the European market, not the U.S.  Given the intractable Mickey Mouse copyright laws and Draconian royalty schemes, this will not be happening anytime soon here.   del Colliano argues that this isn't even how people are looking to consume music, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think he or I are able to gauge what the the internet generation will prefer as their chief mode of music consumption.  As quickly as things are changing, perhaps stating that things will go one way or another is a moot point; formats have come and go for 100 years, and consumer habits have changed along with them at every move.  Technology, bandwidth, and royalty/copyright will always do battle.  Laws will always be behind the curve, and the hurdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should all of this prove to be untrue in the end, or partially true, as Apple rumors often are, we will know why all of the hype &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080323-reality-antitrust-concerns-dog-apple-subscription-rumors.html"&gt;reached a fever pitch&lt;/a&gt;.  This is kind of exciting.  Major companies thinking in a way that takes into account what the users are already doing.  All of the people engaging in file-sharing are already doing the all-you-can-eat deal.  Deals like this make it monetized &amp;amp; legal, above ground &amp;amp; advertise-able.  With the iPod's ubiquity, that could be a big deal.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31409847-7818483264440001713?l=www.content-ment.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.content-ment.com/feeds/7818483264440001713/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=31409847&amp;postID=7818483264440001713' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/7818483264440001713'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31409847/posts/default/7818483264440001713'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.content-ment.com/2008/03/rumor-ipods-and-unlimited-music.html' title='Rumor: iPods and unlimited music'/><author><name>Clinton Forry</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08346052398690953089</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp1.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R-fjezJ1UfI/AAAAAAAAAZo/BlBNh1Pj8Pg/s72-c/2069646878_b95811e9b0_m.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31409847.post-5142448057500655154</id><published>2008-02-26T16:36:00.007-06:00</published><updated>2008-02-26T17:10:59.902-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='streaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='media consumption'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='format'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mp3'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='record industry'/><title type='text'>iTunes #2, for now.</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R8SbgVrgVJI/AAAAAAAAAY8/__lYJizKKSA/s1600-h/2120962077_c110efa3e2_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_ufFvB6JW2W4/R8SbgVrgVJI/AAAAAAAAAY8/__lYJizKKSA/s320/2120962077_c110efa3e2_m.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171429252005909650" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;[ image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kunstlab/"&gt;kunstlab&lt;/a&gt; / Flickr ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arkansas juggernaut seller of all things Wal-Mart had better keep an eye over shoulder.  Business Week &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8V23V300.htm"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that iTunes has surpassed Best Buy and Target to become the #2 music retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/02/26/itunes_now_the_no_2_music_retailer_in_the_us.html"&gt;AppleInsider.com&lt;/a&gt; states that the download store sold 20 million tracks on Christmas day 2007&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;.  In one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that will work until everyone gets on board with the subscription streaming model, where we pay for access to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;everything ever recorded&lt;/span&gt;.  [Or at least as much as the copyright holders will license.]&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The more music I download from &lt;a href="http://www.emusic.com/"&gt;eMusic&lt;/a&gt;, the more it gets lost on my harddrive.   [I don't buy much of anything from iTunes because of their extant &amp;amp; punitive &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"&gt;DRM&lt;/a&gt;.]  I end up buying physical copies of things I really enjoy hearing, even though I have paid for them to some degree through my subscription to eMusic.  This is probably silly and counter-intuitive, and the main reason that this next month's membership will be my last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back and forth on this, and I am strongly considering putting that eMusic subscription money towards a &lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt; subscription.  Rhapsody has the unlimited streaming of songs for a set price of $12.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model will support the behavior that I am certain I am not the only one engaging in.  Being a sometimes fan of some pop songs, I enjoy hearing them more than once.  I could pay a buck on iTunes, or about 33 cents on eMusic, and have the single track get lost in my 11,000 song iTunes library.  I have done that.  I don't make playlists, and I don't burn many mix CDs, so these precious few singles quickly fall between the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main interest is in full albums and compilations; I will continue to buy those physical objects.  With an outlet for my pop song interests pointed at Rhapsody, I won't have the urge to by albums that in the end, I really don't want.  I'll go to the site and stream them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And everyone is happy.  I'm glad we worked that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and congrats iTunes.
