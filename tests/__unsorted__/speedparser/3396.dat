&lt;br&gt;
I totally missed this.  I knew about the 3 years but did not catch that it was 17 years before he appeared in Antioch.  Shouldn't be surprizing as Moses was 40 years in preparation for his calling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking Paul in the years before his appearance in Antioch is dicey. The places we look for details of his life come up blank on the 17 years following his encounter with Jesus outside Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;He makes one reference, the same place where Paul gives more verses on his life than anywhere else – Galatians 1:11-2:1. The verses about these 17 years state that after returning from Arabia to Damascus, it was three years before he went to Jerusalem, to meet with Peter, and then he says that 14 years more passed before he returned to Jerusalem. This latter visit was for the well-publicized conference with James about circumcising Gentile believers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;He does say that during these years he was in Syria and Cilicia. What was this great apostle doing during this expanse of time?&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is – we don’t know!&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Anything beyond that is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to speculate!&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental Gospel issues were clear. He entered this time period with a deeper knowledge of the Gospel, of the issues of Jewish exclusivism, of Gentile inclusion. After three years of study he had a profound grasp of grace, justification, and the universal intention of God’s kingdom. Also, he located himself in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia, whose boundaries stretch from Damascus in the south to the eastern edge of Galatia in the north and west. In the light of Paul’s later travels, this is not a huge territory, but for the commencement of his apostleship a reasonable chunk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;What would he be doing? My hunch is a phase of learning by good intention and failure, a phase of church planting, and a phase of concentration in and around Tarsus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase might have evidenced a strategy of evangelizing synagogues as the base for Gentile expansion. That is the good intention, but the failure would be the refusal and resistance of Jews, even followers of Jesus, to accept Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase of church planting would take him to the house church model around clusters of Gentile believers. Why not? He knew the area well, was well acquainted with the culture, knew the pagan ways he was confronting, and knew ways to witness to them. This was, after all, his calling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;The third phase can be documented. With the Spirit’s work in the city of Antioch, the believers there needed seasoned teachers and disciplers. The leaders of the church in Jerusalem knew this and commissioned Barnabas to find Paul and enlist his help for the Antioch church. Barnabas found him in Tarsus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Tarsus was his home town, a plausible place for Paul to concentrate his efforts. What is surprising is the absence of any further reference to there being a church established there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Further speculation – he wrote letters during this period. Maybe from Damascus to Tarsus, or from Issus on the route around the sea to Aleppo. Who knows and why not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;For certain we can assume that he was putting into practice many of the teachings and conclusions that we know from his later letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/missionomission.wordpress.com/263/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img border="0" alt="" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=missionomission.org&amp;amp;blog=18910552&amp;amp;post=263&amp;amp;subd=missionomission&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians: Persuasive Cross-cultural Witness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two letters Paul wrote to the church he planted at Corinth, he manifests an awareness that his was a cross-cultural missionary church planting mission.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As he deals with divisions rooted in a cultural attraction to speakers with cleverness pursued with rhetorical technique (“wisdom of word,” 1 Cor 1:17), he points to a proclamation of the gospel which addresses the standards of two ethnic groups: Jews and Greeks (1:18-25).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Jews seek “signs”; Greeks seek “wisdom.”&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Paul’s strategy is to preach a gospel of the cross which is subversive of both values: a scandal to Jews and foolishness to Greeks.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For only in that way can a truly culturally transformative gospel be transplanted into their hearts.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For as they receive it their faith will not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God (2:4-5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the gospel and the Spirit’s saving power transcultural, the congregations&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;formed reflect a transcultural unity, as well as, a multi-ethnic diversity.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, Paul can use the physical body—members imagery and declare, “For, as the body is one and has many members, and although all the members of the body are many, the body is one, so also is Christ.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For, indeed, we all by one Spirit have been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freedman, and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit” (1 Cor 12:12-13).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Unity in the midst of mult-ethnic diversity, all because God’s plan for applying salvation involves an invitation with a universal reach to every culture and tribe and nation and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul in 1 Corinthians teaches us that the gospel is multi-culturally persuasive and births a unified multi-cultural church.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Only the culturally transformative power and wisdom of God can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ciu.edu/seminary/faculty/bio.php?id=95"&gt;Dr. William Larkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor of Greek and NT, &lt;a href="http://www.ciu.edu"&gt;Columbia International University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we learn from Paul's strategy to be "a scandal" and "foolishness" to the Corinthians? What are current barriers to growing multi-ethnic congregations, such as the one in Corinth? Please share your thoughts below...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Love this clarification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I recently received a very disturbing email from a missions organization.  In it they were announcing a major shift in their strategy and resource deployment related to the U.S. becoming the third largest missions field in the world, with over 100 million unreached people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bristled at what was being communicated by an organization that should have known better.  I was concerned by:&lt;br&gt;1) their apparent confusion of the concepts of lost people with unreached peoples,&lt;br&gt;2) their apparent ignorance of the basic facts regarding the status of Christianity in their own country, and&lt;br&gt;3) their apparent misunderstanding of the purpose of missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://blakemcdaniel.blogspot.com/www.uscwm.org"&gt;U.S. Center for World Mission&lt;/a&gt; has been a champion for the concept of unreached peoples for more than 30 years.  Through resources like the “Perspectives on the World Christian Movement” class, Mission Frontiers magazine, and Global Prayer Digest, they have educated and promoted the cause of the unreached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing out of this has been a simple model embraced by missiologists regarding the world of 6.8 billion people we live in today.  At a very simplistic level, the world can be thought of in three broad categories:&lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;world A&lt;/strong&gt; (unreached – less than 2% evangelical Christian) – 27% of the world’s people (1.8 billion)&lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;world B&lt;/strong&gt; (underreached – 2% to 5% evangelical Christian) – 40% of the world’s people (2.7 billion) &lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;world C&lt;/strong&gt; (reached – more than 5% evangelical Christian) – 33% of the world’s people (2.3 billion)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;World A, the unreached, those with little or no access to the gospel should be the primary (although not exclusive) focus of the mission efforts of local churches and mission sending organizations concerned with completing the task Jesus gave His Church in the Great Commission.   &lt;a href="http://blakemcdaniel.blogspot.com/www.joshuaproject.net"&gt;Joshua Project&lt;/a&gt; has some excellent information about unreached peoples.  There are 6900 UPG (unreached people groups) containing the 1.8 billion world A people.  Nearly 10% (600+) of these UPG are UUPG (unengaged, unreached people groups) of 50,000+ souls.  Engaging these UUPG should be given very high priority by those serious about completing the task.  These are people groups with absolutely no access to the gospel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2010 edition of &lt;a href="http://blakemcdaniel.blogspot.com/www.gmi.org/products/operation-world"&gt;Operation World&lt;/a&gt; indicates that there are currently 92 million evangelical Christians (29% of the population) among the 317 million people currently living in the US.  That means there are 3 genuine followers of Jesus for every 10 people.  This is one of the highest national ratios in the world.  Even in traditional “unchurched” areas of the country like New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the Pacific coast, and in other “unchurched” cities like Denver and my home of Austin, the percentage of evangelical Christians is between 10-15% (solidly in world C).  1 genuine follower of Jesus for every 10 people.  That is excellent access to the gospel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This also means there are 225 million lost people in the US (not 100 million).  The US does have the third largest number of lost people in the world (behind China and India), but please realize that we are also the world’s third largest country (behind China and India).  Even if the percentage of evangelical Christians in the US doubled to 60% of the population, we would still have the fourth largest number of lost people in the world (simply because of the size of our country).  But almost none of these people are unreached.  With the exception of a few native American groups in New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska, and a few groups of recent immigrants in major metro areas across the country, all Americans live as part of reached people groups with easy access to the gospel.  Does this mean we should become complacent and stop sharing the gospel where we work, live, and play?  Absolutely not.  But the US is far from being a mission field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evangelism and missions are both components of the Great Commission.  Although closely related, they are not the same.  Even though the terms are sadly used interchangeably by many churches and a few missions organizations.  There is need in the US (and in other world C contexts) for evangelism. Bold, incarnational, culturally relevant demonstration and proclamation of the gospel among the 225 million who do not yet know Christ.  I heartily support and commend those churches and para-church organizations that take this challenge seriously.  However, missions is a different animal in two important ways.  &lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, missions is always cross-cultural (reaching out with the gospel to those who are different than we are, often significantly different).  &lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, missions is predominately about providing access to the gospel and a culturally relevant church for those with little or no access to the gospel (world A).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difference in vocabulary and perspective represented by these reflections and the missions organization that sent me the disturbing email is far more than an academic disagreement.  It represents a battle raging in the US Church today.  How we look at these issues determines how the Church of Jesus Christ chooses to prioritize its limited financial and manpower resources in its efforts to bring closure to the Great Commission.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5543558690197158563-4741880558010830586?l=blakemcdaniel.blogspot.com" alt="" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was just logging off to go to bed, and I ended up reading &lt;a href="http://www.djcoffman.com/2011/08/25/trader-dons-2-the-pitch-the-hook/"&gt;this great post&lt;/a&gt; by DJ Coffman, about how to create a pitch with a hook. He asked, at the end, if we’d read the comic based on the pitch. I wrote that I might, but that what I found interesting was that the “until” was missing. Now, the weird thing is, I didn’t even realize that I thought like that, until I read DJ’s post, and then I didn’t realize that I even &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; about the “until” ..um…&lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the Until?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Movies and most fictional stories have a reasonably similar plot projection that goes like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everything was normal UNTIL it wasn’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That’s it. That’s the plot nugget. Let me show it to you with the examples I gave to DJ in his comments section (and do go &lt;a href="http://www.djcoffman.com/2011/08/25/trader-dons-2-the-pitch-the-hook/"&gt;check out his cool project&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Marlin and Nemo lived happily in their reef UNTIL Nemo got lost during a school trip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wall-E lived happily in his junkyard, finding old junk to treasure UNTIL Eva showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bob and Helen Parr lived secretly with their children, UNTIL Bob had to go and have a midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See? It’s the UNTIL that makes the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Real Life is Rarely Like Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You see, most of us try very hard to cling to that first half of the plot. Most of us try really hard to keep things the way they’ve always been. But you can’t do that in fiction. The Incredibles would be pretty boring if Bob just worked at his insurance job all day. Wall-E would be interesting for about 8 minutes if all he did was collect garbage. Finding Nemo happens every day inside of fishbowls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But You Could Embrace the Until&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if getting laid off was your Until? Erik Proulx made an entire movement out of that idea with &lt;a href="http://www.lemonademovie.com/"&gt;The Lemonade Movie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if a break-up brings you to your until? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if a change of faith, a sickness, the discovery of a new technology brings you to your until?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ll Never Know, Unless…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of us ward off our “untils,” but what if you didn’t? What would life be like? How would you see the world, if you were at least &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; to the possibilities of your until? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think?

&lt;br&gt;
Couldn't have said this better myself. Common prayer (usually over food) "Lord, make us ever mindful of the needs of others."  Remix - "Lord, make us ever needful of the minds of others."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing:  All Liberals are not trying to take down our way of life.  The guy who lives next door and has an Obama sticker is most likely a pretty nice guy.  He just voted for a different guy than me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I’m risking the entire operation here by starting with politics, but it was an easy target.  What if, instead of&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yelling at each other, the two (or 3-5) sides of the equation actually started off with the baseline assumption that the other side ISN’T in cahoots with Satan, or the Chinese, or some other Asian/demonic alliance?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="width:332px"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://assumethebest.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3145271693_fd4b19d0e4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://assumethebest.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3145271693_fd4b19d0e4.jpg" alt="" title="3145271693_fd4b19d0e4" height="500" width="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I understand that to try to build bridges with the other side is to risk it all in a political race.  They’ve got to rally the base, to get in the news.  Any publicity is good publicity.  Name recognition is the goal.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not talking about the candidates.  We’ll let them strut around in front of the cameras like peacocks in $950 suits and get the sound-bytes.  I’m talking about the dude next door.  It’s high time we had him over for dinner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When’s the last time we had somebody who didn’t look like us over for dinner?  There’s almost nothing that my wife’s corned beef casserole can’t fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying we have to be best friends with people with whom we vehemently disagree on policy or even worldview issues.  But to demonize their character — who they are as a person — doesn’t do anybody but the media any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the baseline assumption that the people with whom we disagree are &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; first, and have complex worldview issues second. And they don’t have a red phone in their room with which they discuss ways to bring down capitalism with their North Vietnamese government contacts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They most likely don’t even have a land line, and went over on their anytime minutes last month talking to their mom who lives out of state.  They were talking about the uncle who moonlights as a hotel lounge singer.  They didn’t even mention the debt ceiling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we could have them over and talk about sports?  They were wearing a Braves hat the other day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my prescription for being a part of the ATB revolution regarding politics, taken from my actual life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be quiet.&lt;/strong&gt;  It’s easier to confirm when somebody has less-than-stellar motives when I can actually let them speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask good questions.&lt;/strong&gt; The worst thing I can do in this situation is to lead with the Fox News talking points: “Do you see any way out of this crisis?” It just puts them on the defensive and doesn’t actually start conversation.  Get to know people, as opposed to their opinions. It’s tougher to hate a person when I know their kid’s names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop being right.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s going to be the toughie, because according to the prevailing sentiment in my own head, I actually AM right.  That’s where a healthy dose of reality will come in very handy.  Reading an article in the Economist doesn’t actually make me certified to speak into fiscal policy on an international level.  So I should stop acting like it does, and instead ask good questions (see the previous point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What methods have helped you to Assume The Best about another person’s political views?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				We have an inherent selfishness about us.  It's why heroes in movies will sacrifice the world for the person s/he loves and we all find that romantic instead of disturbing.  It's why we have a tendency to care a lot less about a genocide than a friend with cancer.  As David Ropeik points out in an article for Psychology Today, we have a statistical numbness that urges us to care more about the problems of an individual than the problems of many. 				&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5831013/why-you-dont-care-about-the-deaths-of-millions-of-people" title="Click here to read more about Why You Don&amp;#39;t Care About the Deaths of Millions of People [Psychology]"&gt;More »&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Pretty near the core of American culture is the automobile. The average family owns two of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;three of them, and from high school on, all of us, men and women, see cars as the extension of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;our personality, our pride (well, for men at least!), and our freedom. Gas prices notwithstanding,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;we’ll keep driving!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are banned from driving. Many&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;leading princes among the more than 5,000 of their peers favor a lifting of the ban. But many&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;others side with the conservative elements in Saudi society who see this as kowtowing to western&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;norms. For them, allowing women behind the wheel is to slide down the slippery slope of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;women’s liberation with all the immorality and filth it leads to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Meanwhile, close to a million male drivers (mostly from South Asia) are employed to drive&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Saudi women around to their appointments – always accompanied by the mandatory male&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;relative chaperon. Their average salary is $600 a month, which many people even in Saudi&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Arabia cannot afford. Forget the price, though, critics of the ban retort. Why are women singled&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;out as second-class citizens of the kingdom? Why should their freedom be curtailed here, as in&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;many other areas (I’ll get to the mandatory black covering all women have to wear in public in a&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;later blog).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;This question opens up a series of four blogs I’m writing on “Islam” and human rights. In all&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;of these you will come to see why I have to put “Islam” in quotation marks. As with any other&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;religious tradition, “Islam” is what particular groups of people or individuals in specific times&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;and climes interpret the sacred texts to be saying. Here I want to convince you of one thing: the&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;opinion of Muslims around the world about women’s rights is diverse and changing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;You’ve heard me quote the massive Gallup Poll of Muslims in over 35 different countries before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;That’s because it’s the best bird’s eye view of what Muslims actually think – not what the&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;media tells you what they think (Who Speaks for Islam? Edited by John L. Esposito and Dalia&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Mogahed, 2007).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;On the one hand, Muslim women tend to be strongly religious. In most countries polled, large&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;majorities of women state that “religion is an important part of life.” Another staple answer to&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;the question, “what do you most admire about your society?”, is “faithful/sincere/attached to&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;religious beliefs/adhere or respect teachings of Islam” (p. 113).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;On the other hand, though Muslim women keenly reject the idea that they need to be “saved” by&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;well-meaning western feminists, they staunchly line up behind the following rights for women&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;(and, amazingly, so do men in just about the same percentages!):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;•&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;the same legal rights as men (85% in Iran, 90% in Indonesia, 61% in Saudi Arabia)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;•&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;•&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;•&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;rights to vote: from Turkey (93%) and Bangladesh (90%) to Saudi Arabia (56%)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;the right to hold any job for which they are qualified outside the home (all countries&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;from 90% down to 61% in Jordan)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;the right to hold leadership positions at cabinet and national council levels (most&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;had majorities, except Saudi Arabia, 40%, and Egypt, 50%)—note too that Pakistan,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh and Turkey have all had female heads of state!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Add to this the fact that women in just every Muslim-majority country outperform and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;outnumber men in the universities (and mostly choose to wear the hijab – and often much to their&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;mothers’ chagrin), and you have the recipe for lots of changes ahead!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Back to the Saudi driving ban for women . . .&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;You must have been surprised to read last month that hundreds of Saudi women – no doubt&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;jealous of and egged on by other Arab women toppling governments through street protests –&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;organized (via Twitter and the like) an act of collective civil disobedience. Fewer than expected,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;but around fifty nonetheless, drove around the capital city Riyadh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Remarkably, no one was arrested. Likely the main reason was that this was a grassroots&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;campaign launched back in March that attracted considerable world media attention. Yet, one&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;the women who initiated it, Manal al-Sharif, was detained for nine days last month for posting&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;footage of herself behind the wheel on YouTube.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Consider, however, that the first campaign by women to shake off the yoke of extreme male&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;dominance in 1990 ended much differently. The fifty women who drove around Riyadh in a&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;convoy for an hour – each and every one of them lost their jobs and passports . . . the times they&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;are a’ changing!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;When were women allowed to vote in our country? Less than a hundred years ago . . . and sixty&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;years ago in Switzerland. This has nothing to do with Islam (the Qur’an says women can’t drive,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;right?) and there is in fact no written Saudi law saying they can’t drive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;As we will see with the issues of marriage and divorce, inheritance and apostasy, human rights&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;are now assumed to be part of the Islamic religious heritage. True, they’re not always formulated&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;exactly in the same way by this scholar or that one, and some brag that Muslims invented them&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;1,400 years ago! Say what you will, but the notion of “human rights” is firmly embedded in&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;today’s Muslim psyche.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty near the core of American culture is the automobile. The average family owns two or three of them, and from high school on, all of us, men and women, see cars as the extension of our personality, our pride (well, for men at least!), and our freedom. Gas prices notwithstanding, we’ll keep driving!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are banned from driving. Many leading princes among the more than 5,000 of their peers favor a lifting of the ban. But many others side with the conservative elements in Saudi society and see this as kowtowing to western norms. For them, allowing women behind the wheel is to slide down the slippery slope of women’s liberation with all the immorality and filth it leads to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, close to a million male drivers (mostly from South Asia) are employed to drive Saudi women around to their appointments – always accompanied by the mandatory male relative chaperone. Their average salary is $600 a month, which many people even in Saudi Arabia cannot afford. “Forget the price, though,” critics of the ban retort. “Why are women singled out as second-class citizens of the kingdom? Why should their freedom be curtailed here, as in many other areas?” (I’ll get to the mandatory black covering all women have to wear in public in a later blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard me quote the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Speaks-Islam-Billion-Muslims/dp/1595620176/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1313182290&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;massive Gallup Poll of Muslims in over 35 different countries&lt;/a&gt; before.That’s because it’s the best bird’s eye view of what Muslims actually think – not what the media tells you they think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Muslim women tend to be strongly religious. In most countries polled, large majorities of women state that “religion is an important part of life.” Another staple answer to the question, “what do you most admire about your society?” is “faithful/sincere/attached to religious beliefs/adhere to or respect teachings of Islam” (p. 113).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, though Muslim women keenly reject the idea that they need to be “saved” by well-meaning western feminists, they staunchly line up behind the following rights for women (and, amazingly, so do men in just about the same percentages!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the same legal rights as men (85% in Iran, 90% in Indonesia, 61% in Saudi Arabia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rights to vote (93% in Turkey, 90% in Bangladesh, and 56% in Saudi Arabia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the right to hold any job for which they are qualified outside the home (all countries from 90% down to 61% in Jordan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the right to hold leadership positions at cabinet and national council levels (most had majorities, except Saudi Arabia, 40%, and Egypt, 50%)—note too that Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Turkey have all had female heads of state!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this the fact that women in just about every Muslim-majority country outperform and outnumber men in the universities (and mostly choose to wear the hijab – and often much to their mothers’ chagrin), and you have the recipe for lots of changes ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the Saudi driving ban for women . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have been surprised to read last month that hundreds of Saudi women – no doubt jealous of and egged on by other Arab women toppling governments through street protests – organized via Twitter and the like an act of collective civil disobedience. Fewer than expected, but around fifty nonetheless, drove around the capital city Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, no one was arrested. Likely the main reason was that this was a grassroots campaign launched back in March that attracted considerable world media attention. Yet, one of the women who initiated it, Manal al-Sharif, was detained for nine days last month for posting footage of herself behind the wheel on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, however, that the first campaign by women to shake off the yoke of extreme male dominance in 1990 ended much differently. That time, of the fifty women who drove around Riyadh in a convoy for an hour, each and every one of them lost their jobs and passports . . . the times they are a’ changing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When were women allowed to vote in our country? Less than a hundred years ago . . . and only sixty years ago in Switzerland. This has nothing to do with Islam (the Qur’an says women can’t drive, right?), and there is in fact no written Saudi law saying they can’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we will see with the issues of marriage, divorce, inheritance, and apostasy, human rights are now assumed to be part of the Islamic religious heritage. True, they’re not always formulated exactly in the same way by this scholar or that one, and some brag that Muslims invented them 1,400 years ago! Say what you will, but the notion of “human rights” is firmly embedded in today’s Muslim psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bounded-set thinking that comes most naturally to many of us, the arrival of a new idea, especially if it challenges an old one, automatically generates a response of rejection. It falls outside the boundary of received Christian orthodoxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It, and its proponents and adherents, is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what’s happening with the evolution and historicity of Adam question. And I understand it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian tradition has built a lot on Adam. The idea of a historical first parent who fell from a state of innocence is important for understanding humanity, creation, and even how salvation works. &lt;a href="http://www.jrdkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Adam-and-Eve.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jrdkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Adam-and-Eve-300x298.jpg" alt="" title="Adam and Eve" width="300" height="298"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what we’ve seen over the past hundred and fifty years: after scientists started working with a theory of evolution, data from innumerable branches and sub-branches of various scientific disciplines started making other discoveries that supported that theory and did not support instant appearance of diversified species on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest challenge to the traditionally conceived Christian story of origins is genomic data that points to pools of thousands rather than a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do Christians do with all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we recognize that we are standing at a different point, downstream from our theological forebears. They had scientific worldviews that were impacting their articulations of humanity and sin (sin transferred in sperm, anyone?). And, their scientific worldviews were closer to the biblical writers: we hadn’t yet discovered that the earth revolves around the sun, for example, or found fossils of animals that died millions of years before anything like a human being was on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.train2equip.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jrdkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mr_dino_pulling_color-300x245.jpg" alt="" title="mr_dino_pulling_color" width="300" height="245"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Copyright Javier Martinez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This does not mean that we will automatically get right what they got wrong, but it does meant that to be faithful to our point in the story we will have to say something that makes sense in our own day and time, even as those who came before us said something that made sense in theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first step is huge. It is, I think, the greatest hurdle: to clear the bar of setting our minds in such a posture that we can listen to the issue, wrestle with the problem, without defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we revisit the biblical story to see where we might have been over-reading our preconception into the story. The particular creation story in which there is a person named Adam who breaks a command and thereby brings ruin on himself and, apparently, the world, is the same story that then proceeds to have Adam’s son Cain run off to marry foreigners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates that Genesis 2-4 is a story that does not intend to give an entirely comprehensive account of the origin of humanity. Yes, it intends to tell a story within which God’s people have a unique place, and where a ruptured relationship with God wreaks havoc in every aspect of life, but there’s also a window into the possibility that this fits within a larger narrative of an already-extant humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, we step further back and realize that we have two creation stories in Gen 1-2 alone, and that each tells a different narrative about humanity as it fits within the unfolding of creation. Then there are other biblical stories–creation from a slain Leviathan, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start to get a perspective on creation that is polyvalent, to say the least. When the question is opened up, by our modern scientists, about how we did, in fact, come to be here, we have our eyes opened afresh to see that the biblical narratives are anything but dogmatic about the answer. They give evidence of different ancient Israelites at different times and places painting different pictures in order to communicate something significant about humanity’s and, more importantly Israel’s, place in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Paul did the same thing, building on Adam traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, then, is beginning to return to our time. What must we say about the creation of the world, about humanity, about “The Man” and “The Woman” whom we meet in the early chapters of Genesis? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be able to provide a viable answer to that question if we are unwilling to ask it with integrity for our own day and time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bounded-set Christianity has not place for the question at all. Ironically, those most committed to history are least willing to learn from it. Yes, the earth does circle the sun; and yes, Christianity survived this knowledge. But conservative Protestant Christianity, in particular, refuses to be chastened by the mistakes of the past, and continues to insist on the absolute necessity of data that science has repeatedly disproved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, as I see it, is not whether this scientific information is correct, but rather how we will articulate faithful Christianity in light of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are downstream and there is no swimming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: the author got so caught up in the “Trajectories and challenges” part, he forgot about “ethics.” What does all this have to do with how we act as Christians? Come back tomorrow and find out! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>J. R.

Come, please, is ma yay (eye)...ma leg...ma pikin (child).&amp;quot;  Even just walking to the market, in civilian clothes, we are still known.  There are so many who need help and good food and clean water and medical care.  Too many who have lived for years waiting for a miracle.  For the outcast and the hopeless, too often we are their last hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two cities, two continents, two worlds.  One impersonal and individual and alone, the other personal and noisy and filled with life.  Both still have the outcast who call the streets home, the needy who call out to be heard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you hear them?  Can you see the value of a person behind the filth and the mask and the deformity and the smells?  Will you see enough to come close and touch, to meet the hopeless when they need it the most?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="font-family:&amp;#39;Charis SIL&amp;#39;, charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px"&gt;   &lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family:&amp;#39;Charis SIL&amp;#39;, charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family:&amp;#39;Charis SIL&amp;#39;, charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’  Matt 25:34-40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1172392395304193269-8325697972342769845?l=nursingadventuresinfaith.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>lauracoles@gmail.com (Laura)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nursingadventuresinfaith.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nursingadventuresinfaith.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Nursing adventures in faith...around the world!</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nursingadventuresinfaith.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1313145424850"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36770289.post-191857113090648830">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03f8ee7a1b43e915</id><category term="Daily Life" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Work" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Digging for Reactions&amp;#39; Roots</title><published>2011-07-21T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-08-11T19:16:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/2011/07/digging-for-reactions-roots.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/feeds/191857113090648830/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=36770289&amp;postID=191857113090648830" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HCpr_z9OEOI/Tihg7wYo3JI/AAAAAAAABW4/I1nTMhMDC8o/s1600/black-and-white-tree-roots.png" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HCpr_z9OEOI/Tihg7wYo3JI/AAAAAAAABW4/I1nTMhMDC8o/s320/black-and-white-tree-roots.png" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The other day I read a number of challenging emails before breakfast. &lt;/b&gt;Bad idea. When I am still sleepy and haven&amp;#39;t made any coffee yet, my guard is down. I&amp;#39;m vulnerable to taking things wrong. I think it&amp;#39;s OK to reach for my iPod and check the RSS feeds - which tend to &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; me rather than asking anything of me -  but maybe I should hold off on the emails?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two of them were asking me to recommend solutions to problems that remain mysteries to me&lt;/b&gt; - requests which elicited my distaste for not knowing the answer. I felt myself growing testy. &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hate feeling ignorant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another came from someone who wanted me to send some files and the email providers kept rejected them. &lt;/b&gt;Drat.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;What's the workaround?&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hate feeling incompetent. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fourth email was asking me to retract or change something I'd published...&lt;/b&gt; Ugh. Reminding me of all the times it's happened in the past, especially when I gave authors, promoters, or ministry leaders the chance to see, in advance, what I'd written about something they'd created. "Leave out that part about the book's weaknesses, or how old the video is, or that the conference is really mostly for the 18-25-year-old set. That the curriculum a little too American, or written for Baptists."&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't they know my job is to serve the readers, &lt;/b&gt;to offer them information and discernment about whether the resource is worth their while - that it would be wrong for me to give my allegiance to the publishers and promoters? When I feel or anticipate pressure to recommend something that's not very good but that comes from someone who expects my "loyalty," well, that's hard. Then I really feel taken advantage of. &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hate betraying my own integrity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In reflecting on it later in the day I realized my sensitivity about this last matter, especially, is probably linked not only to events of the relatively recent past, but that it pokes at a far older, unresolved sore point. &lt;/b&gt;Remember I wrote about that revelation from &lt;a href="http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/2010/10/counseling.html"&gt;counseling&lt;/a&gt; that one of the big statements that echoes in my life is "you don't matter"? Or at least, that I don't matter as much as other people. That I'm supposed to keep the peace, not make trouble, toe the line, and stop telling other people what I think. Because what I think, what I want, or what I care most about, it just doesn't matter.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well, just recognizing the roots of my reactions to each of these emails really helped.&lt;/b&gt; The people who asked for help in addressing sticky ministry problems, well, I could come alongside them and we could pool our ignorance (or knowledge) and maybe come up with some good ideas.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eventually, I got the computer files to my friend in Asia. &lt;/b&gt;He was sympathetic to the challenge, and so grateful to be reunited with the tools he needed when they finally went through.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;And even when, at the end of the day, I went back and looked at the email asking me to change my resource review... &lt;/b&gt;It wasn't such a big deal after all. They weren't mad at me, or demanding, but actually pleased with most of what I'd said. They were just asking for a simple change and it was one I could say yes to. So I did.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maybe I'll never get to the point where my responses to other people are not affected by these kind of things, &lt;/b&gt;when I can stop making it "about me" and no longer react to challenges out of proportion when they seem to highlight my insecurities and inabilities. But it would be great to recognize these things more quickly and put them into perspective.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's one thing I've found that seems to help:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://donmilleris.com/2010/03/26/how-to-change-a-negative-character-trait/"&gt;How to Change a Negative Character Trait&lt;/a&gt; (Donald Miller).&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36770289-191857113090648830?l=tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Marti</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Telling Secrets</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://tellingsecrets-mks.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1312984165767"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a63c28837e4f2022</id><title type="html">God gave you a Couch.</title><published>2011-08-10T13:49:25Z</published><updated>2011-08-10T13:49:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AssumeTheBest/~3/BEScxeRRDxE/god-gave-you-a-couch" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://assumethebest.info" title="Assume The Best"/><content xml:base="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AssumeTheBest/~3/BEScxeRRDxE/god-gave-you-a-couch" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Shared by  Pat 
&lt;br&gt;
Funny I'd read this the day I started seriously thinking of getting another couch for our 'home group'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a popular preacher’s sermon (via slick android app).  Here’s the line that stuck out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
People coming to Christ on your couch, transferring from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light–in your living room, is the reason God gave you a couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now, there was no reason to punch me in the metaphorical teeth, preacher man.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get this, though:  The couch applies to nearly every situation imaginable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://assumethebest.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2365042979_4a356cce31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://assumethebest.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2365042979_4a356cce31.jpg" alt="" title="2365042979_4a356cce31" height="333" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Seagulls need couches too. Image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/themarque/2365042979/"&gt;TheMarque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason God put you at that job, in that cubicle,&lt;/strong&gt; is to be a part of bringing his kingdom to bear on the folks with whom you work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason you are raising support right now&lt;/strong&gt; is to bring God’s kingdom to bear on not just people’s lips, but their wallets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason you are going through this tough season of life&lt;/strong&gt; is to bring God’s kingdom to bear on the people with whom you are forced to spend your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couch might be in a different type of room, but the reason it’s there is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, I build my life around some phantom concept called “security” for me and my family.  The reason God gave me a couch is to sit on it, to give my family a place where the big bad world can’t get in to mess things up.  Here, on my couch, I can control the content that they see, hear, and read.  I can do things the right way, the family centered way.  &lt;strong&gt;Just the way satan would like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God gave us couches to invite people to sit on them.  Messy people who might spill stuff on the couch, or track dirt through the living room.  Single parents who are no good at setting boundaries for their kids and end up breaking lamps and drawing on the walls.  People without good manners, people with different cultures and skin colors and values.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOUD PEOPLE.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Awkward people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Smelly people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who didn’t vote the way we did last election and won’t in the next. People with all sorts of brokenness, without their lives put together.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who need saving, just like us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, by your grace may all of our couches be outposts of peace where God’s kingdom is brought to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Good word! As a missions team leader for about 15 yrs I love info like this.  So hard to say no without this kind of info.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Adc&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Focoins.info%3Agenerator&amp;amp;rft.title=The problem with glamissional efforts&amp;amp;rft.aulast=Smith&amp;amp;rft.aufirst=Jeremy&amp;amp;rft.subject=#Featured&amp;amp;rft.subject=Justice&amp;amp;rft.source=Hacking Christianity&amp;amp;rft.date=2011-03-28&amp;amp;rft.type=&amp;amp;rft.format=text&amp;amp;rft.identifier=http://hackingchristianity.net/2011/03/the-problem-with-glamissional-efforts.html&amp;amp;rft.language=English"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://aws.hackingchristianity.net/wp-content/files/toms-shoes-228x175.jpg" alt="toms-shoes" title="toms-shoes" height="175" width="228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something about me: I have a strong distrust of flashy campaigns for mission organizations. Back when I was in high school, our church youth group did the &lt;a href="http://www.30hourfamine.org/about"&gt;30 Hour Famine by World Vision&lt;/a&gt;. Great idea, flashy logos, pre-packaged info packets for the youth minister. I mentioned it to my dad and he researched and saw that only a portion of every dollar raised actually gets to the hungry children.  While the organization has &lt;a href="http://www.30hourfamine.org/donate/where-your-donations-go"&gt;bettered the percentages&lt;/a&gt; since then, it was a wake-up call that flashy logos and marketing costs money, and my donations were paying for it rather than going to hungry third-world children. I call it glamissional efforts “glam-missional” whereby the flash of the giving is bigger than the actual help…and trendier too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 13 years ago. Today, enter &lt;a href="http://www.toms.com/our-movement/movement-one-for-one"&gt;TOMs shoes&lt;/a&gt;. All the rage with my youth is TOMs shoes: you buy a pair of hipster-savvy shoes and another pair is given to needy third-world children. It’s called &lt;a href="http://aidwatchers.com/2010/11/a-tryst-with-toms/"&gt;BOGO giving: Buy One Get One&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, if you buy something for yourself, it helps other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do great works, donating millions of shoes and hiring locals to &lt;em&gt;distribute &lt;/em&gt;the shoes &lt;em&gt;(this will be important later)&lt;/em&gt;. Shoes may not seem like much to some, but saving youth especially from &lt;a href="http://zacstravaganza.blogspot.com/2010/10/does-toms-cause-more-harm-than-good-by.html"&gt;soil-borne illnesses and infections&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, TOMs shoes is doing great works and changing lives across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;don’t&lt;/span&gt; have a problem with the successes or with the people working at TOMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem I have with a setup like TOMs shoes is what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek"&gt;Zizek&lt;/a&gt; calls &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cultural capitalism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.greenfudge.org/2010/08/16/we-are-greenwashing-ourselves-%E2%80%93-slavoj-zizek-on-%E2%80%98cultural-capitalism%E2%80%99/"&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;how we may do good things within the structures of a bad system, while in fact contributing to it&lt;/strong&gt;.”  In other words, it’s essentially “personal redemption for being a consumer” that makes buying things feel better. (h/t &lt;a href="http://tumbledore.tumblr.com/post/4089928661/dear-people-buying-toms-shoes"&gt;tumbledore&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own congregation in a rural town, we did a book study on Julie Clawson’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830836284/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hackinchrist-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0830836284"&gt;Everyday Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; book. It talked about the plight of coffee farmers who are severely underpaid for their crops, cocoa beans picked by slave children, and sweatshops that make clothes. Clawson challenged us that&lt;strong&gt; every time we buy one of those unethically grown-or-made products, we support this system of injustice&lt;/strong&gt;. I challenged the 12-person study group to find fair trade coffee, chocolate, clothes in our town’s stores. They found some coffee (at Wal-Mart, oddly enough), but mostly they could find products that gave 1-5% to a particular charity, ie. Chocolate that gave 1% back to the Rain Forest.  That sounds like a good buy. But according to Clawson (and Admiral Ackbar)…it’s a trap :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frustrating thing is when I find an item for sale…which will donate 1 percent of its profits to some charity cause. &lt;strong&gt;This helps the buyers feel good about their purchase but distracts from the underlying justice issue&lt;/strong&gt;. What we need instead is for public awareness of these issues to increase and for the demand for clothing made ethically (in all aspects) to increase. (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830836284/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hackinchrist-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0830836284"&gt;Everyday Justice&lt;/a&gt; [Kindle location 1347])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMs shoes may give to the needy and help people in very real ways (hookworm is &lt;em&gt;horrifying&lt;/em&gt;), but there are difficulties. While manifold, I see two ones as most important: &lt;strong&gt;effectiveness &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;creating dependency&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://zacstravaganza.blogspot.com/2010/10/does-toms-cause-more-harm-than-good-by.html"&gt;Zac Mason&lt;/a&gt; crunches the numbers (charitably towards TOMs) and sees that TOMs shoes are not that great a deal when it comes to effectiveness of the dollar when compared to other needs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For $1,969 you could give 72 kids in Ethiopia a pair of shoes which will inevitably rip and degrade into rags within a few years – or you could send your money to a Peace Corps Volunteer or Oxfam or Water Aid to build one row of concrete latrines at a school which should last for decades. For the price of sending TOMS Shoes to a school of 1,000 kids for 2 years, you could build 13 latrines at 13 schools to benefit the health of tens of thousands if not a hundred thousand kids over the course of 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a child in Ethiopia a pair of shoes might very well be a moral thing to do, but when a development agency or NGO is pursuing some sort of public health agenda they have to do these kinds of calculations to determine which of many policy options available to them are worth the expenditure of finite financial resources. If you are going to donate your money to some sort of humanitarian cause, you should do the same kind of math to determine which charity you feel best deserves your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions like these, while commendable, &lt;a href="http://goodintents.org/in-kind-donations/toms-shoes#comment-5129"&gt;create dependency&lt;/a&gt; not independence. Like women &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott"&gt;suckled to Nestle’s formula&lt;/a&gt;, any free aid eliminates or reduces demand for the product given. With the &lt;em&gt;exception &lt;/em&gt;of Ethiopia (per a more-than-cursory web search), TOMs does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;buy their shoes from local vendors. So they are made, assembled, and shipped from overseas…and only distributed by “local partners.” I wonder what the shoe vendors in those countries feel about having free shoes everywhere? It is an example of creating dependency on free shoes rather than empowering local merchants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, it’s not like the competition is much better. The alternatives are much more expensive (&lt;a href="http://www.sawashoes.com/eng/chi_siamo.php"&gt;Sawas&lt;/a&gt; are twice as expensive as TOMs and twice as less-trendy, but they are locally-made shoes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma with TOMs shoes is an example of the &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;conflict between charity and justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. TOMs shoes is a charity, digging wells and latrines is justice. Charity takes care of a person’s immediate needs and required repeated actions. Justice takes care of long-term systemic problems and is slow-moving but helps more people. Both are required actions as part of Jesus’ command to “Love Thy Neighbor” but both require reflection on the fruits of such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are other organizations to support. Instead of charity feeding for a day, it is closer to justice changing the structures of hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heifer.org/"&gt;Heifer Project International&lt;/a&gt;, while in the same boat as World Vision for only a portion of proceeds go to the needy, teaches independence not dependence by showing farmers how to plant, people how to care for livestock, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micro-loan distributors (like &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org"&gt;kiva.org&lt;/a&gt;) get money directly to the people who need it not for a handout but to start their own business or empowerment effort. Such efforts create, again, independency not dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations where 100% of your donation goes to the needy. If you are United Methodist, &lt;a href="http://new.gbgm-umc.org/advance/"&gt;donating to an Advance cause&lt;/a&gt; (like was advertised for Japan and Haiti recently) results in 100% of the gift reaching the needy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, am I gonna stop my youth from wearing Tom shoes or lecture them&lt;/strong&gt;? Not at all, I’m no hater and I want to encourage my youth to reach out to others. But I will (and do) talk to them about the difference between a charity gift that makes you feel better, and a justice gift that honors both the recipient and yourself and changes the reason “why” people are shoeless or hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it may not be flashy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of Zac Mason (quoted above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that you should not give to charity – all I’m saying is that before you give whimsically to just any humanitarian-sounding cause, first take into consideration that it is possible that your unconditional generosity might just distort incentives to such a perverse extreme that &lt;strong&gt;any good that they might have achieve in the short run might be negated by the greater harm that they might cause in the long run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get informed about the effects of Buy-One-Get-One efforts. Ask yourself the real motivations you have behind the purchase. And find out from people on the ground as to the effects of a charity, not just the # of people helped.&lt;/p&gt;

Do Muslims and Christians worship the same God? Yes and yes, says Yale Divinity School theologian Miroslav Volf in his new book &lt;em&gt;Allah: A Christian Response &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://tgcreviews.com/reviews/allah-a-christian-response/"&gt;see The Gospel Coalition’s review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Thabiti Anyabwile draws upon his experience as someone who formerly practiced Islam to respond to Volf’s arguments and efforts to clarify Christian views for Muslims who often misrepresent such doctrines as the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24631261" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to my opening question in the video, Volf does not explicitly state in the book that someone can be both 100 percent Christian and 100 percent Muslim. Rather, he argues more narrowly that you can practice Islam and be 100 percent Christian. He explained in the comments section following TGC’s review of his book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, to be a Christian (spiritually and not merely culturally),  means to accept that Jesus Christ is the final revelation of God. A  Christian cannot accept therefore that Muhammad is the Seal of the  Prophets. The vast majority of Muslims do not believe that in Jesus Christ is  God dwelled in human flesh, for me an essential Christian belief. In the  book I state explicitly and precisely how what the publisher put on the  book jacket (namely that you can be a practicing Muslim and 100 percent  Christian) should be understood.  I say: “In holding many Muslim  convictions and engaging in many Muslim practices, you can still be 100  Christian.” . . . I say that one can be a 100 percent Christian, and engage in some specifically  Muslim practices. I explicitly state that I leave open the question  whether such person can be described as 100 percent Muslim. That’s not on me to  decide; Muslims must decide that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have a theory that &lt;i&gt;most Muslims are in search of a redemptive God&lt;/i&gt;. They believe that there is a higher power and that this higher power is the provider of morality, giving them a compass to help them distinguish between good and bad.  &lt;i&gt;Many Muslims are seeking a God or a concept of God that in my view meets the description of the Christian God.&lt;/i&gt;  Instead they find Allah. They find Allah mainly because many are born in Muslim families where Allah has been the reigning deity for generations… (p. 239, emphasis added).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Christian leaders now wasting their time and resources on a futile exercise of interfaith dialogue with the self-appointed leaders of Islam &lt;i&gt;should redirect their efforts to converting as many Muslims as possible to Christianity, introducing them to a God who rejects Holy War and who has sent his son to die for all sinners out of a love for mankind&lt;/i&gt;… The Vatican and all the established Protestant churches of northern Europe believed naively that interfaith dialogue would magically bring Islam into the fold of Western civilization. It has not happened, and it will not happen…. To help ground these people in Western society, the West needs the Christian churches to get active again in propagating their faith. It needs Christian schools, Christian volunteers, the Christian message… &lt;i&gt;The churches should do all in their power to win this battle for the souls of humans in search of a compassionate God&lt;/i&gt;, who now find that a fierce Allah is closer to hand. (pp. 247, 249, 250, 251, emphasis added).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Even as we consider and marvel at the keen insights of this former Muslim who now claims no faith, let us pray that this dear sister will move from Infidel, to Nomad, to Daughter of the King! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I love this story in luke 4.  Spot on application.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Saturday’s post about homosexual marriage I made the suggestion that Christians need to develop the habit of asking two separate questions, without predetermining what the relationship between them might be. The first is, “What does God require of us as God’s people?” and the second is, “What does this mean for our life in civil society populated by people who do not, and will not, agree with us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to pick this back up today, once again focusing on those of us who are Christians and who believe that homosexual sex is sinful. I realize that there are Christians who disagree with this position, and that is its own debate. I want to keep pushing here the “so what?” question for those of us who uphold heterosexual normativity as part of our constellation of Christian belief and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strand of NT teaching that pushes me to keep the two questions I’m asking distinct, if not entirely separate. Why should we ask both what does God demand of us in our posture toward God and then, separately, what does God demand of us as an act of love toward neighbor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That strand of teaching is the posture of the Jewish insiders with respect to Gentile outsiders in the NT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the history of interpretation, the church has made a number of mistakes in assessing the exclusivist posture of the first century Jewish community to the Gentile outsiders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most often the problem of early Judaism has been seen as legalism. Yes, the law was good, but early Jewish people were keeping it legalistically; or, they were keeping it because they thought that if they did they would merit God’s eternal favor and eschatological salvation.&lt;a href="http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Dore-Mark.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jrdkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Dore-Jesus-synagogue-218x300.jpg" alt="Gustav Dore, Jesus Teaching in a Synagogue" title="Dore, Jesus synagogue" width="218" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the admonitions of Paul and the actions of Jesus point in a different direction: a surprising superabundance of grace that overflows the people of God even as that people is rightly adhering to the law that God has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus’ famous sermon in Luke 4, he proclaims a jubilee year: freedom to the captives, good news proclaimed to the poor, light to those who are in darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Jewish people marveled at the gracious words falling from his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knew themselves to be captives in need of deliverance. They knew themselves to be blind in need of light. They knew themselves to be poor in need of good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were ready to sing “Amazing Grace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Jesus explodes their understanding of who the grace of God is for. There were many widows in the time of Elijah, and many lepers in the time of Elisha–but they were sent beyond Israel, beyond the people marked out as pure and holy and faithful, to feed the widow and cleanse the leper (without first demanding adherence to the Law of Israel’s God)–of non-Jewish, non-YHWH-worshiping outsider Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the people were filled with rage and attempted to murder Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we to read this? On the one hand, we can recognize that most of us are gentiles and therefore happily included in this great surprise of God–that grace comes to us without our becoming Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as those who now occupy the place of the “insiders,” the embraced and, by God’s grace, faithful people of God, we must also reappropriate this text from the point of view of its insiders. We must place ourselves not merely on the periphery as those to whom the word would come despite all apparent obstacles. We must place ourselves in the role of the insiders and be willing to hear that God’s grace will not be contained by us, and God’s blessings cannot be cordoned off to the faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not an argument for gay marriage, but it is an argument about how we need to posture ourselves toward those we deem “other” if we are going to be faithful children of our Father in Heaven. Come back Saturday for part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: This bulk of this post originally appeared on March 4, 2008. The introductory paragraph has been changed to fit the context of June 2011. The state of New York has officially legalized gay marriage. Now, it is always heartbreaking to see sin defended and celebrated as if it were not only legitimate but also [...]&lt;img alt="" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=thideology.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=474402&amp;amp;post=1287&amp;amp;subd=thideology&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1" border="0" height="1" width="1"&gt;
