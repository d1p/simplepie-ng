Users from your town can search using location based queries to get your listing in the results or on Google Maps. Think Plumber Manhattan for instance. If you optimize the listing you usually have good chances to be at the top of the listing for user searches, which in turn drives great business to your website and Google Places listing.</p><p>One of the issues that businesses and webmasters who take care of the listing for businesses experience from time to time is the dreaded &#8220;We currently do not support the location&#8221;.</p><p>This basically returns a blank page with the error message instead of the businesses listing on Google Places. I actually experienced this message twice in the last three months for a client.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/we-currently-do-not-support-the-location.jpg" alt="we currently do not support the location" title="we currently do not support the location" width="240" height="110" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50826" /></p><p>It can be a serious blow to the businesses operations if it is not found on Google Places anymore. One might now assume that this message appears on purposes because something&#8217;s wrong with the listing, or maybe even the Google account in question.</p><p>This is however often not the case. The <strong>We currently do not support the location</strong> seems to be a bug in Google Places that a lot of local businesses have experienced in the last time.</p><p>I do suggest you check the email account linked to your Google Account and your Google Webmaster Tools account first to see if you got any emails or warnings from Google. The next thing that you need to do is to open your Places listing in your Google Account to check for changes or messages there.</p><p>If everything appears all right, you can try the following solution to bring your local business listing back on Maps.</p><p>The fix that worked in my client&#8217;s case both times was to make a change to the Google Places listing. The easiest way to do that is to post an update. You find the &#8220;Share an update on your place page&#8221; on the right side of the Places listing.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/google-places-update.png" alt="google places update" title="google places update" width="354" height="213" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50827" /></p><p>Just enter an update into the form and hit the Share button afterwards. Write about a new product or special offer for instance.  I had to wait about 15 minutes before the local business appeared again on Google Places. The We currently do not support the location message was gone.</p><p>You can also make other changes, like adding or removing text from the site&#8217;s description, business hours or categories. Make sure you do not change the businesses location or other information related to that.</p><p>I hope this helps some local businesses who are fighting with the same bug on Google Places.</p><hr

The sites basically republish the RSS feed of one or multiple unique websites on a domain, usually without rights or link back to the original source. Technology in this sector has advanced in past years, and scraping has been combined with article spinning to create unique low quality articles instead of 1:1 copies.</p><p>One would assume that search engines like Google or Bing had the tools to distinguish between original and copy and act accordingly. This unfortunately though is not always the case.</p><p>These sites often rank for long tail keywords which drive some traffic from the search engines to the sites. And since the majority of them runs Adsense ads, they make a pretty penny from that.</p><p>It is bad enough that those sites can copy and paste contents automatically on their blogs and earn money from it. Even worse is the fact that the process of setting up a new scraper site does not take more than ten minutes tops, and with automation even less.</p><p>So called auto blogs have been a trend in recent years in the Black Hat communities.</p><p>Some legit webmasters even experience something that they should not: A scraper site outranking the site where the article was published originally.</p><p>The search engines leave webmasters who experience the issue more or less alone. They basically ask the webmaster to fill out DCMA requests and send them to the scraper sites. Problem here is that many use proxy hosting or other forms of obfuscation so that it is not possible to contact the webmaster directly. Plus, webmasters usually deal with multiple scraper sites which leads to a never ending cat and mouse game, especially if you take the easy set up of new sites into account.</p><p>Webmasters have criticized Google in particular for this in the past, considering that Google could identify the majority of domain owners easily through their Adsense program as the majority of scraper sites uses Adsense for monetization.</p><p>Google recently asked webmasters to report scraper pages to them. The data will be used to test and improve algorithms that target those scraper sites.</p><p><img

href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGM4TXhIOFd3c1hZR2NHUDN1NmllU0E6MQ&#038;theme=0AX42CRMsmRFbUy1mYzJkYmE4MS04Mzc4LTQ0ZGMtYjFlYi03NjU4MjkyMjIwMWY&#038;ifq">on this</a> web form.</p><p>It is about time that Google puts an end to this practice, especially since the company&#8217;s recent drive to promoting &#8220;quality&#8221; sites in their search engines.</p><p>Here are several good resources for webmasters who want to do more than just reporting.</p><p><a

Some website listings, Lifehacker&#8217;s for instance, display an author profile photo next to their listing in the Google search results. This only happens on pages where a single author can be easily identified, which is the case for most blog posts. The question is: How can you get the same treatment?</p><p>It is thankfully not super complicated to configure your site to be compatible with the new author photo snippets that show up on Google Search. It is at this point in time however not guaranteed that your photo, or a photo of one of your authors, will appear in Google Search. It is rumored that Google has enabled that feature only for selected blogs and sites.</p><p>Nevertheless, it does not hurt to add the code to your site and Google Profile. And if your site gets picked by Google, you can expect a higher CTR (click-through rate) than sites without an author profile photo in Google.</p><p>Lets take a look at how it looks like in the search engine if it is configured correctly and enabled by Google:</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/google-search-author-profile-photos.png" alt="google search author profile photos" title="google search author profile photos" width="600" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49250" /></p><p>Here are the steps that you need to undertake:</p><h2>Creating An About Author page</h2><p>You first need to create an about author page on your website. You then need to link to that page from all posts that this author writes. The link needs to use the <strong>rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</strong> parameter. How it is added depends largely on how the author information are posted on the post pages.</p><p>Here on Ghacks, the code looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>&lt;p class=&#8221;tags&#8221;&gt;Author: &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.ghacks.net/author/martin/&#8221; title=&#8221;Posts by Martin Brinkmann&#8221; rel=&#8221;author&#8221;&gt;Martin Brinkmann&lt;/a&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Adding the code can be an easy task on single author blogs, but a bit more complicated on multi-author blogs. The best way to add support on those blogs and sites is to install a plugin like <a
href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/allow-rel-and-html-in-author-bios/">Allow REL= and HTML in Author Bios</a> that adds the support.</p><p>You are not yet finished though. The about author page needs to exist for every author on the site. The actual page can contain any kind of information. One important part though is that it needs to link to the Google profile of that author. The link to the Google profile needs to contain the parameter <strong>rel=&#8221;me&#8221;</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>&lt;a rel=&#x201d;me&#x201d; href=&#x201d;http://profiles.google.com/ID&#x201d;&gt; Author Name &lt;/a&gt;</p></blockquote><h2>Linking Back from Google Profile</h2><p>In the last step, we need to link back from the Google profile to the about page on the website. Open your Google Profile, click the Profile icon at the top and then the Edit Profile button at the top. Locate links on the right side and select the Add custom link option.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/links-about-page-google-profile.png" alt="links about page google profile" title="links about page google profile" width="346" height="401" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49255" /></p><p>You need to link to the author page on the website, and enable the &#8220;this page is especially about me&#8221;. You also need to make sure that a photo is added to the profile.</p><h3>Testing the rich snippet</h3><p>Open the <a
href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">rich snippet testing tool</a> and enter an url from your website that is linked to a single author (a blog post for instance).</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rich-snippet-tool.png" alt="rich-snippet-tool" title="rich-snippet-tool" width="600" height="326" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49256" /></p><p>If you see the author photo next to the listing, you have configured the author profile photo support on your site correctly.</p><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li>Create an about author page on your site. Link from that page to the Google Profile of that author with the rel=&#8221;me&#8221; tag. Link the author&#8217;s blog posts on the website with the rel=&#8221;author&#8221; tags to the about author page on the blog.</li><li>Add a photo and a link to the author&#8217;s about page on the Google Profile of that author. Make sure the &#8220;this page is especially about me&#8221; box is ticked.</li><li>Check for correct implementation with the help of the Rich Snippet Tool.</li></ul><hr

If you search for Ghacks for instance, you will notice that my site is displayed at the top. Below the standard listing are the site links, which previously used about the same amount of space as a standard Google search results site listing.</p><p>Google today announced that they have modified site links. When you now search for Ghacks in the Google search engine, you will notice that the site links use up a lot of space. On my 1920&#215;1200 resolution and a maximized window, that&#8217;s about two thirds of the screen.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/google-search-sitelinks.png" alt="google search sitelinks" title="google search sitelinks" width="482" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49199" /></p><p>Here is a screenshot of Google&#8217;s old sitelinks layout for comparison.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/old-google-sitelinks.png" alt="old-google-sitelinks" title="old-google-sitelinks" width="526" height="146" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49200" /></p><p>Why has Google made the decision to change the sitelinks layout? The Webmaster Central blog lists four reasons: Visibility, Flexibility, Clarity and Quality.</p><ul><li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The font size of the link text has been increased. Both the url and the first free words of the description added.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Sitelinks are now query dependent, and the maximum number of sitelinks has been increased from eight to twelve.</li><li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Sitelinks and standard search results are now separated, which means that a sitelink entry will not appear in the general search results and vice verse.</li><li><strong>Quality</strong>: Google with the update has &#8220;combined the signals&#8221; used for &#8220;site links and ranking&#8221;.</li></ul><p>I personally think that Google went a bit overboard with the new sitelinks design. It takes an extreme amount of space. Both the description and url information are more or less useless, considering that you won&#8217;t usually see the full url or more than the first five or six words of the description on the search results page.</p><p>I&#8217;d rather like to see options to customize the layout. For my site, I&#8217;d remove the descriptions completely and start the urls after the domain name, as it should be clear that results come from the same domain (with the exception if a subdomain is listed of course).</p><p>Another thing that I think is missing is the ability to pick your own links for the sitelinks. Google picks them automatically, and your only option of influencing the listing is by demoting urls in the Webmaster Tools. First, that is no guarantee that the link won&#8217;t show up as a sitelink anymore, and second it does not guarantee that a better link is picked by Google&#8217;s algorithm.</p><p>For my site, I&#8217;d really like to add more categories and get rid of the articles that are displayed. That&#8217;s however not really possible.</p><p>You find more information about Google&#8217;s new sitelinks <a
href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/08/introducing-new-and-improved-sitelinks.html">at the</a> Google Webmaster Central blog. Have you encountered the new sitelinks in Google&#8217;s search engine yet? If so, what&#8217;s your opinion?</p><hr

The idea behind Panda was to introduce a quality variable into the ranking equation. Sites with good quality contents would see an increase, sites with low level quality or article farms would see a decrease. That worked so-so with many legit webmasters hit by the Panda. I know several webmasters whose sites have been hit where I could not find a reason for it, no matter how hard I looked at their websites.</p><p>More recent updates made some sites recover while others still would not return to their previous rankings. The core problem with Panda was that Google did not release a definition of quality. And if you ask one hundred Internet users about their definition of a quality website, you will likely get one hundred different answers.</p><p>Google first rolled out Panda to websites in the United States, and there only to English sites and queries. A later update launched Panda for all English speaking websites regardless of their location in the world. Today&#8217;s <a
href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/08/high-quality-sites-algorithm-launched.html">announcement</a> at the Google Webmaster Central Blog marks the next step of the &#8220;high-quality sites algorithm&#8221; as Google likes to call it. Panda is now used on non-English versions of Google Search as well, with the exception of the Chinese, Japanese and Korean language versions.</p><p>According to the information posted, Panda will affect between 6 to 9 per cent of all queries &#8220;to a degree that a user might notice&#8221;. That&#8217;s lower than the initial 12% of affected sites of English queries, but still a considerable amount.</p><p>With Panda out in the open almost everywhere: What is your personal impression of Google&#8217;s search engine quality as of late? Has Panda improved the results significantly by pushing down lower quality sites? Or did you experience a decrease a value, something that might even have made you use another search engine?</p><p>Let me know in the comments.</p><hr

I was looking for an A-B testing service that would allow me to test web page variations to find out which variation worked best for a site that I own. I first thought about using Google&#8217;s Web Optimizer but had the impression that it was not really that easy to use. I then stumbled upon <a
href="https://optimizely.appspot.com/">Optimizely</a> and their service simply blew me away.</p><p>They basically allow you to create variations of an existing web page in a drag and drop like manner. For that, you do not need any coding experience whatsoever. Here is what you do. You create a new experiment first by entering a web page address that you want to A-B Test.</p><p>The web page is then rendered in the interface. A click on any element on the page displays a context menu with options to move, resize, hide or remove the element, change an image, edit the HTML directly, edit the link destination, track clicks or use custom JavaScript for advanced functionality.</p><p><a
href="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/optimizely-a-b-testing.png"><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/optimizely-a-b-testing.png" alt="optimizely-a-b-testing" title="optimizely-a-b-testing" width="455" height="510" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48871" /></a></p><p>You can make fonts bigger, move images around, exchange contents and manipulate the page in any other imaginable way. You can create one or multiple variations of a page.</p><p>Once done you get a single line of JavaScript code that you need to add right below the head tag of the web page that you want to A-B test. And that&#8217;s it. No manual creation of pages on your web server, no code editing.</p><p>A click on Start Experiment starts the monitoring. You can from that moment on access the stats for that experiment to compare conversion rates, improvements and the performance of specific links on the page that you have chose to monitor.</p><p>Here is a video that outlines the whole process.</p><p><strong>A-B Testing Video:</strong></p><p><iframe
width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0S0IrbwpfzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>What I personally really like about Optimizely is the ease of use. You don&#8217;t have to create multiple pages on your web server to test their performance, which speeds up the process significantly. The downside is the price of the service. Users get a 30-day free trial after which they pay $79.99 for up to 20,000 visitors or $399,99 for up to 200,000 visitors, both with an unlimited number of experiments.</p><p><a
href="https://optimizely.appspot.com/">Optimizely</a> has more to offer, including multi-browser testing of pages, automatic goal tracking or multiple page testings which is very helpful if you want to make changes to an element that is displayed on several pages of the website.</p><p>Optimizely is an A-B Testing service that I can recommend to web developers, Internet marketers and enthusiasts regardless of their technical background.</p><hr

Webmasters usually run into a phase shortly after they have setup the site where they have to wait until the site gets indexed in the big search engines. This can take minutes, hours, days and sometimes even weeks, as it depends on the search engine bots and their first visit to the website. Indexation of contents is usually fast if links are posted on a authority set or well crawled website, or if pings and social bookmarking is used to get the contents indexed.</p><p>Sometimes though you wait and wonder why the darn page is not in the index right now. This can also be a problem for an established site, for instance if you have changed content on a popular post or on your site in general. You&#8217;d like to see the new contents indexed in the search engines which usually does not happen right after you have hit the save button.</p><p>Google has now announced that they have added an option for webmasters to submit their urls to the search engine in Google Webmaster Tools.</p><p>The existing Fetch as Googlebot feature in Webmaster Tools has been improved with a submit to index option which basically allows you to submit the fetched url to Google for evaluation and inclusion in the index.</p><p>Here is how this works. Open Google Webmaster Tools and follow the Diagnostics > Fetch As Googlebot option in the left sidebar. You have to select the right domain first, of course. You need to add it if it is not already listed in Webmaster Tools.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/submit-to-index.png" alt="submit to index" title="submit to index" width="400" height="138" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48595" /></p><p>You need to enter the url that you want to crawl. This can be a website&#8217;s homepage, a subpage or any other page that is publicly accessible on the Internet. Click Fetch to retrieve the site as Googlebot. This process may take between a few seconds to a few minutes. Once done you get a status report on the same page and an option to submit to index.</p><p>You get a prompt first where you can select to submit only the single url or the url and all pages that it links to.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/submit-url-to-index-confirm.png" alt="submit-url-to-index-confirm" title="submit-url-to-index-confirm" width="600" height="189" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48596" /></p><p>Google currently has a limit of 50 individual page submissions per week, and 10 page with all linked pages submissions per week. The numbers are shown on the Fetch as Googlebot page.</p><p>Google has revamped the public Crawl URL form as well. The core difference besides the captcha is that webmasters and users do not have to verify ownership of the page or site to submit it to the index.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/crawl-url.png" alt="crawl-url" title="crawl-url" width="366" height="336" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48597" /></p><p>The new Submit to Index feature is handy for webmasters who have troubles getting their website or a specific part of that website indexed in Google.

href="http://www.ghacks.net/2011/07/24/why-website-investments-are-better-than-stock-market-investments/">Why Website Investments Are Better Than Stock Market Investments</a> I have listed arguments for investing in websites, and not in stocks or other types of investment. I do not want to paraphrase the whole article, just that much: With investments in websites it is usually a matter of 12 to 24 months to get a 100% return. Even better, if you pick the right site you may not spend more than a couple of minutes per week managing it. Are there other types of investment with such a high return? Yes, but they are usually a lot riskier, and the chance of losing everything is much higher. If all falls down, you still end up with the domain and keywords and the knowledge that the website can be a good earner.</p><p>The biggest issue that keeps people from investing in websites is knowledge. How do you determine the worth of a website? Do you only look at the money it earns per month? Or are there other factors that can play a role? Should you hire a broker or do all the evaluating and bidding yourself?</p><p>Here are eight tips that can make the difference between making a great investment and buying a site that is not worth a single cent.</p><p><strong>1. Start Low</strong></p><p>Yes, that $50,000 Dollar website looks tempting. It might be a good investment. But what you need at the very beginning is experience. Look at websites that are sold at a lower price range. So what&#8217;s a good starting point? This depends largely on your budget. My suggestion would be to start with a website for less than $1,000 Dollars. You will get valuable experience out of this first deal. You make your first negotiation, understand how payments are made, how websites and domains are transferred to you and how to setup the website on your server or web hosting account.</p><p>Delays or downtimes, which may happen during the process, do not hurt you that much as well. Imagine a 24 hour downtime because of an error in the site&#8217;s DNS configuration. Would you prefer that to be your 50,000 Dollar site, or your 1,000 Dollar site?</p><p>Verdict: Start with a low site or two before you dive head first in your first four, five or six K investment.</p><p><strong>2. The Price</strong></p><p>A website is worth as much as the buyer is willing to pay for it. It is difficulty to determine the price, especially in the beginning. A good rule of thumb for PPC kind of sites (like Adsense) is to multiple the average monthly earnings of the last six months by the factor twelve. Make sure to adjust extreme values accordingly. Those are usually one-time peaks that should not be part of the calculation.</p><p>Adjust the price if you have analyzed the website in question and came to the conclusion that you can make changes to it to earn more than that average. This can be the case if the site uses bad ad placements for instance or if ads are missing on some of the site&#8217;s pages.</p><p>Verdict: Pay up to twelve times the average earnings of the last six months. Adjust that by the website&#8217;s optimization potential.</p><p><strong>3. The Traffic</strong></p><p>Some webmasters might say that there is no bad traffic. I&#8217;d have to disagree with that when it comes to buying websites. There are basically four types of traffic:</p><ul><li>Direct Traffic, that is visitors who enter the site url directly or open the site from their bookmarks.</li><li>Search Engine Traffic, traffic from organic search engine rankings</li><li>Referrals, traffic from third party sites that link to the site in question</li><li>Paid traffic, traffic that has been paid for.</li></ul><p>In my experience, it is best if the majority of traffic comes from organic search engine rankings, unless otherwise noted in the sales letter. Some websites use paid traffic to generate revenue. Why are referrals and direct traffic worse from a buyers point of view? Because they can be easily manipulated. Think of a webmaster who owns a high traffic website and the site that you want to buy. The webmaster might have added a link on his high traffic site to the other site to increase the site&#8217;s traffic. Chance is, that link will not be there anymore once the site has been sold, unless part of the agreement.</p><p>Another aspect to look after are the keywords that the site ranks for. A site that sells TVs via Amazon&#8217;s affiliate system will earn less per visitor if the main keywords are not TV related.</p><p>Verdict: Go for sites with organic traffic of 60%+, the more the better.</p><p><strong>4. The Payment</strong></p><p>When in doubt use Escrow or a comparable service. It is always alarming if a seller does not offer Escrow, especially if you are prepared to pay all of the fees (try negotiating to split the fees). What&#8217;s Escrow? It is basically a service that acts as a middle-men for both parties. You send the money to Escrow who park it until you have received the services or goods that you ordered from the other party, in this case the domain name, website and all other assets that are part of the agreement.</p><p>Verdict: Use Escrow to make sure you get the website and data after making the payment.</p><p><strong>5. The Revenue</strong></p><p>As with traffic, there are good and bad revenue streams in terms of verification. Good revenue streams are not easily faked, like Adsense or Affiliate earnings. Bad revenue streams are private ad sales or one-time deals. Would you buy a website for $1,000 Dollars because the seller claimed to have received $100 per month for the last twelve months for placing a link on the website?</p><p>Another aspect that gets often overlooked is the availability of the services used. Amazon for instance blocks people from several US states from becoming an affiliate. It would be pretty bad if the website you bought made use of Amazon affiliate links.</p><p>Unless you already have an account, you should check the requirements for opening an account prior to bidding for a website.</p><p>Verdict: PPC or affiliate based offers are the most reliable revenue types. Do not bid for sites with shady or unprovable revenue streams.</p><p><strong>6. Verification</strong></p><p>The first thing that web investors need to do when they spot a potential investment is to verify the claims of the seller. How is that done? Start with a simple <a
href="http://www.whois.net/">whois</a> to see the website owner and administrative contacts. It is a good sign if they match the seller&#8217;s profile. Some website selling business sites like Flippa run their own verification system to verify a seller&#8217;s phone number and other data including Google Analytics data.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/flippa-trust.png" alt="flippa-trust" title="flippa-trust" width="446" height="262" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48455" /></p><p>You can also look up the seller on the Internet, or use a reverse IP lookup script like <a
href="http://www.ghacks.net/2011/07/23/ewhois-reverse-ip-adsense-analytics-lookups/">ewhois</a> to find out more about the seller&#8217;s other businesses.</p><p>Two key areas are left for you to verify: Revenue and Traffic. Traffic can be easily verified if Google Analytics is used. Ask the seller to add you to the account to get a first hand look at the site&#8217;s traffic. For revenue, it is not nearly as easy. Screenshots are fine but they are easily faked. Ask for video proof or a screencast session to see the earnings in realtime.</p><p>Verdict: Verification is very important and one of the first steps in validating a seller&#8217;s claims.</p><p><strong>7. Niches</strong></p><p>The best website niche is one that you have expertise in. While it is nice to sell high tech TVs on an affiliate website, it may be better to operate a site that you are familiar with. Why? Because you may get comments or questions by potential buyers. Should I get an LCD or Plasma TV, or a 3D TV? You may end up losing credibility if you cannot communicate with your buyers. Even worse, they may buy somewhere else and leave comments about your mediocre service on the Internet.</p><p>It is not really a necessity to buy a website in a niche that you are proficient in, but it can help you in the long run. Being proficient is also interesting when you add new content to the site you have just bought. New TVs coming out? Pick the best and add them to your store or site.</p><p>Verdict: Pick a niche that you are proficient in if possible.</p><p><strong>8. Time</strong></p><p>Would you rather buy a website for $900 that earns you $80 per month but requires you to spend one hour working per day, or a site for $500 that earns you $40 that runs on its own. The first site may look like the better deal, as it earns more per Dollar that you invest. But it also takes away 7 hours per week or 28 hours per month. And that makes it a very bad deal. First, your time is limited. If you only buy websites that require your attention, you will end up with a handful at most.</p><p>So called passive websites require almost no attention. It usually pays of to monitor the earnings and traffic, and to publish new contents a few times a month, but that&#8217;s done in less than an hour per week. That leaves ample room for many more websites.</p><p>Verdict: The less time it takes to maintain a website the better, unless you can outsource.</p><p>Anything that I left out that needs to be mentioned? Let me know in the comments.</p><hr

You may remember that the company started to introduce its Page Speed service about two years ago which provided suggestions to webmasters and developers on how to improve the page loading times <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/pagespeedonline/">of their</a> websites and web services.</p><p>The Page Speed Service is a new addition to the Page Speed family. It basically acts as a proxy, or content delivery network for the website. The benefits according to Google lie in the 25% to 60% improvement range.</p><p>Google Page Speed Service is not as complicated to setup as a content delivery network. It does however require a change of nameservers at the domain registrar or web server. The DNS entry needs to point to Google. Here is what the service does:</p><blockquote><p>Page Speed Service fetches content from your servers, rewrites your pages by applying web performance best practices, and serves them to end users via Google&#8217;s servers across the globe. Your users will continue to access your site just as they did before, only with faster load times. Now you donât have to worry about concatenating CSS, compressing images, caching, gzipping resources or other web performance best practices.</p></blockquote><p>Probably the biggest advantage over a CDN and local optimizations is that it is less complicated and time consuming. All that it takes is to change the DNS server to make use of recommended speed optimization settings and features such as compression, caching or merging of CSS files.</p><p>Google has created an online tool to test the page loading time of the website and the optimized website. A form is displayed on the Web Page Test site. Webmasters need to enter the url of a website that they want to test into the form. The process will take several minutes to complete.</p><p>The results page displays the page load time, start render time of the page, repeat view page load time and repeat view render time of both the normal and optimized website.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/page-speed-comparison.png" alt="page speed comparison" title="page speed comparison" width="600" height="281" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48327" /></p><p>A test on Ghacks revealed that the optimized service would take longer to load and render. That&#8217;s likely because Ghacks is highly optimized for fast page loading times. It could also be because of different kinds of ads that have been displayed during the optimized page&#8217;s loading.</p><p>The very same page displays a visual comparison of both page loading times. This could be interesting to analyze both states in detail.</p><p>A comparison for another website turned out to be more favorably.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/page-speed-service-comparison.png" alt="page speed service comparison" title="page speed service comparison" width="600" height="289" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48328" /></p><p>This highlights that it is important to check individual websites to make sure that they might benefit from Google&#8217;s Page Speed Service.</p><p>A click on View Test displays detailed information about the conducted tests. The information display median values and detailed information from Google&#8217;s Page Speed tool. Webmasters can use the information to analyze unoptimized areas of their website.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/webpage-test.png" alt="webpage-test" title="webpage-test" width="600" height="525" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48330" /></p><p>Google plans to offer the service with &#8220;competitive&#8221; pricing. For now, it is open to a limited set of webmasters free of charge. Webmasters and developers who are interested in testing Google&#8217;s Page Speed Service can apply by <a
href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&#038;formkey=dDdjcmNBZFZsX2c0SkJPQnR3aGdnd0E6MQ">filling out</a> a web form over at Google Docs.</p><p>The form requires an email address of a Google Account, a website url that domain ownership needs to be verified if accepted into the trial and the approximate page views per day that the website gets. There is no guarantee of inclusion. Google has not yet revealed the pricing, it will be interesting to see how &#8220;competitive&#8221; it will be in comparison to content deliver networks.</p><p>The official announcement <a

Why? Because social signals will grow in importance in the coming years. These buttons can also be convenient for site visitors who would like to share a specific article or the whole website that they just discovered with friends, family or colleagues.</p><p>Every new button on the other hand increases the page loading time of a website. Most buttons make use of JavaScript. The three buttons here on Ghacks, that link to Facebook, Twitter and Google, all have their own JavaScript file that needs to be loaded during page loading time.</p><p>One of the things that webmasters can do to speed up the loading time is to combine JavaScripts, another to load scripts asynchronously.</p><p>Google recently announced that they have made their +1 button load faster on websites. The search giant enabled asynchronous loading for +1 buttons. This basically means that the JavaScript of the button gets loaded without interrupting the loading and rendering of the website it is embedded on.</p><p>Webmasters who would like to integrate the new button need to <a
href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/#utm_source=adsense&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=async">visit the</a> Google +1 button generator at Google to generate the code for the new button.</p><p>The code for the old +1 button was placed in two locations. First at the location on the page where the button should show up and second in the site&#8217;s footer just before the closing body tag.</p><p>The new Google +1 button changes this slightly. You still add the tags to the location where you want the +1 button to appear on your site. The JavaScript code on the other hand needs to be placed after the last +1 tag on the page.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/google+1button-asynchronous.png" alt="google+1 button asynchronous" title="google+1 button asynchronous" width="561" height="489" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48289" /></p><p>Just copy and paste the generated code into your site. You need to remove the old JavaScript from the footer of your website before you place the new JavaScript code into the site.</p><p>Webmasters who do not want or cannot integrate the new code into their website will benefit from rendering optimizations which can speed up the rendering of the button on a website by a factor of 3. This is automatic and independent of the button code that is implemented on the site. Additional information about the speed improvements <a

The rise of mobile browsing, especially on smartphones but also on low resolution devices like tablet and netbook PCs, has made this step even more important. A website that is not offering optimized contents for popular devices and resolutions could lose a lot of visitors because of this.</p><p>If you run a CSM or platform like WordPress, you can utilize plugins to create automatic and custom mobile versions of your website. You still need to test those resolutions to make sure that the sites display correctly on the devices.</p><p>Most webmasters do not own all of the devices that they need to support. The only available option to test screen resolutions and mobile compatibility is to use emulation.</p><p>Screenfly is an online service that can display a given website in predefined resolutions. Webmasters are asked to enter a web address into the form on the homepage.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/website-screen-resolution-test.png" alt="website screen resolution test" title="website screen resolution test" width="600" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48265" /></p><p>This website is then displayed in one of the available resolutions. Semi-transparent buttons on the left side are provided to switch the resolution or device group. Available for selection are desktop, tablet, mobile and television devices, each with several subdevice listings.</p><p>The desktop group ranges from 10&#8243; netbook resolutions of 1024&#215;600 all the way up to 1920&#215;1200, the native resolution of a 24&#8243; monitor.</p><p>Tablet support is available for Apple&#8217;s iPad and four Android tablets including the Samsung Galaxy and the Motorola Xoom.</p><p>The mobile device category includes two Android smartphones, the Apple iPhone 3 and 4, the Asus Galaxy 7 Windows 7 phone, the Blackberry 8300 and two Motorola RAZR phones.</p><p>Television finally displays the website in a 480p, 720p and 1080p screen resolution on screen.</p><p>Switching to another device or resolution is a fluent process that happens without a reload of the page.</p><p>One interesting feature of Screenfly is the ability to detect mobile versions of a website. The service will automatically use the mobile version of a site if available and supported by the emulated device. This detection can be used to test a site&#8217;s mobile version thoroughly.</p><p>The one thing that is missing is an option to test a custom screen resolution. Webmasters who want that feature can try <a

href="http://www.ghacks.net/2011/07/24/why-website-investments-are-better-than-stock-market-investments/">website</a> recently. One of the things that freaked me out in the early days of being a webmaster was moving a website to another host or server. Why? Because of all the things that could go wrong. Set the wrong nameservers for instance and your site won&#8217;t be accessible for a period of time. The biggest concern by far was site downtime. That&#8217;s bad for any business, and prolonged downtime could result in lost rankings in the search engines.</p><p>Over the years, I developed a technique on how to best move a website to a new server. I&#8217;m using it ever since and it has resulted in 0 downtime or difficulties when moving a site to a new host.</p><p>Here is the list of data and information that you need to get started:</p><ul><li>Old and new ftp server logins.</li><li>CPanel or web hosting logins from both the old and new web host.</li><li>MySQL logins, MySQL user and database information.</li><li>Website admin interface logins.</li><li>Logins for the old and new web hosting company.</li></ul><p>This is the step by step guide on how to move the site to a new server:</p><h3>Download all data</h3><p>My first step is always a full backup of all site data. This includes the web files and databases. I often connect to the ftp server and download the web files to my local computer, and use Cpanel or a comparable hosting panel to create the database backup. This step can take some time. But we can prepare the new hosting account in the meantime.</p><h3>Setup the new hosting account</h3><p>I start to configure the new hosting account while the data is downloading. This includes basic setup of the account, quotas, ftp login, MySQL database and user among other things. I do that to have the data at hand to proceed to the next step immediately after the data backup completes.</p><h3>Upload the data</h3><p>Once the downloads are finished I begin to upload the data to the new host. I use the same ftp client to upload the data to the new host, and Cpanel or phpMyAdmin to import the MySQL database.</p><p>I also modify the data if needed. This may include the new MySQL database information or paths in configuration files.</p><h3>Hosts File Changes, Testing</h3><p>I edit the Hosts file on my system to point to the new server IP address. This is done for testing purposes. Remember that you cannot access the domain name on the new host at this point in time, since the nameservers are still pointing to the old hoster. Check out <a
href="http://www.ghacks.net/2009/11/28/work-on-websites-before-dns-propagation/">Work On Websites Before DNS Propagation</a> for a detailed guide on how to change the Hosts file for that purpose.</p><p>Once the Hosts file has been changed, it is possible to access the site with its domain name on the new server. Just enter the domain name in your web browser to do that. I test the new site extensively, check that everything is displayed correctly and that no error messages show up. I also test the admin interface if available to make sure that it works as well. If you are unsure, ask a friend to take a look at the site to see if you have overlooked anything.</p><h3>Switch Nameservers</h3><p>If the website passes all tests I open the domain hosting panel at the domain registrar and switch the nameservers so that they now point to the new web server instead of the old one. The propagation may take up to 48 hours to complete. I suggest you test the connection with proxies or virtual private networks for testing purposes.</p><p>I keep the data on the old domain name for at least a week or two. I also backup the downloaded data to have it at hand if I should need it.</p><p>It pays to monitor the traffic and web servers during the propagation phase to make sure that the process is fluent and without service interruption.</p><p>Have you ever moved a domain name to a new web hosting account? If so, tell us about your experience.</p><hr

That&#8217;s true for the stock market, website investments and other forms of investments. Once you have done your research, you can make an educated guess about the investment. What are the risks? What&#8217;s the worst case scenario? Which return can I expect when I calculate conservatively? Lets say you have 10,000 Dollars that you would like to invest. You have several options. You could put it in a bank account and get a few percent on top of that per year. Barely enough to break even if you include inflation in your calculation. Even with a 5% increase you would end up with 10,500 after the first year, minus taxes and inflation. But you can be sure that the money is still there after the year, that is, unless the bank files for bankruptcy.</p><p>The stock market is different. You need to research stocks a lot before you invest your money. And that&#8217;s where the problems start. You could invest into a fund but would need to do research on that fund as well, or hand the money over to your contact at your bank and ask them to invest. If you are lucky, you may get a 20% or even 30% increase over one year. If you are unlucky, you may end with 0 Dollars. The most likely outcome is the +/- 20% range. If you get 20% you end up with 12,000 Dollars after one year, minus taxes and brokerage fees. You may also get a dividend on top of that. Problem is, you do not have the money yet. You need to sell your stock. (Please note that expert traders may have much higher returns, the average Joe on the other hand will usually end up with less money). And you do not get that extra 20% or whatever directly into your bank account.</p><h3>Investing In Websites</h3><p>Lets take a look at website investments for a minute. I&#8217;d like to share two first hand experiences with you. I bought a site about six months ago for 400 Dollars. It generated a revenue of approximately $40 per month from Adsense and Amazon. I paid another $200 Dollars to get guides and articles updated, and fresh contents on the site, and another $400 so far for SEO.</p><p>That&#8217;s an investment of 1,000 Dollars. The site is now raking in $60 Dollars per month and climbing to new heights ever since. If it sticks with 60 Dollars I will end up with 720 Dollars after one year&#8217;s time. That&#8217;s a 72% increase in the first year. If I would not have done anything it would probably have returned $480 in its first year, which is a 120% return on the investment.</p><p>The second site was more expensive. I paid 23,000 Dollars for it. It earns between $2000 and $3000 Dollars per month. I plan to do light SEO and content generation on that site for about 200 Dollars per month. My first year investment is therefor 23,000 + 2400 = 25,400 Dollars. The money I earn from the investment is conservatively $2000 per month, that times 12 is 24,000 which is almost a 100% return of my investment. Even if all hell breaks lose and the site drops to $1000 per month, I would still earn 12,000 from it which would be more than 40% return.</p><p>And that&#8217;s money that I get right into my bank account.</p><p>Websites rise in value not only if their revenue increases, but also if other factors change. And one of those factors changes without the user&#8217;s doing: Age. A track record of constant earnings over a longer period of time will usually result in a higher selling price.</p><p>Websites, like stocks, can crash badly. Most websites rely on Google, Bing and other search engines for the majority of traffic. A ban on Google could seriously hurt the earnings of a website. You&#8217;d still have opportunities like PPC but that would require another investment and thorough research.</p><p>It is still possible to burn all your money on a bad investment. I see offers for new websites with 100 visitors that are supposed to earn 1500 Dollars per month every day. You will encounter black sheeps among the sellers, which you often can get rid of by looking at a website&#8217;s track record of traffic and earnings. If the seller is only providing information about the last month or two, you can almost be sure that something fishy is going on. One of the tricks of those sellers is to drive extra traffic to the website in the first month to make it look like it is getting good traffic and earnings. Once you buy the site, the traffic stops and you end up with an almost worthless website. It is possible to spot those if you get access to the stats of a site.</p><p>I&#8217;m not saying that website investments are the best option for everyone. You need some knowledge in the field, not only when doing your research and evaluation, but also technical knowledge later to move the website and set it up on one of your servers or hosting accounts. I do all that by myself but you could hire someone to do the job. That again costs money.</p><p>For me personally, investments in websites are the way to go forward. I have the expertise to evaluate them and the technical know how to maintain them after they have been purchased.</p><p>If you do proper research, your websites will return between 40-100% of your investment after one year&#8217;s time. Even if it crashes in the search engines, you can still work on it to improve the rankings again.</p><p>That&#8217;s another difference to the stock market. Once you have made your purchase there, you are a passive bystander hoping for the best. With your website, you can actively promote and optimize it.</p><p>Here are two good sites to get you started with web investments: <a
href="https://flippa.com/">Flippa.com</a> is probably the best known marketplace for web properties. You find many professional buyers and sellers there, and it is rare that you can make a bargain purchase there. It happens, but it is rare and you need to be fast. Despite its quality, you find many lukewarm and some fraudulent offers on that site.</p><p>A second place to buy domains is the <a
href="http://forums.digitalpoint.com/forumdisplay.php?f=52">Digital Point</a> forum. You usually get less stats and information about a website, and more fraudulent or lukewarm offers because of this. Sites here tend to go for a lower price though and you may end up paying less. Some webmasters buy on DP, optimize for a month or so and sell for a premium on Flippa. That&#8217;s called site flipping.</p><p>You will find other sites where you can buy domains, eBay for instance or Sedo. Good sites there sell for a lot of money.</p><p>Where do you invest your money in?</p><hr

Updates that follow quickly after a major release are usually either security or bug related. According to WordPress, version 3.2.1 is a maintenance release that fixes a server incompatibility related to JSON, and a few other issues that came up after the release of WordPress 3.2.</p><p>Please note that this is not a security release, which means you have got more time than usual to update your WordPress site to the new version of the blogging script.</p><p>WordPress Trac <a
href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.2/?rev=18436&#038;stop_rev=18398">lists</a> all the changes in the new release. If you look at the list you will notice that most are design related. Many fix or improve the Twenty Eleven default theme that ships with WordPress, while others do the same for the new admin interface introduced in WordPress 3.2.</p><p>Still no option to change the default font for the admin interface easily, unfortunately.</p><p>Updates are makinguse of the new &#8220;fast&#8221; update mechanism which only updates files that have been changed, instead of all files of a WordPress installation. Users who update via their WordPress Dashboard should notice that the procedure is speedier than before.</p><p>Updates are available via Dashboard > Updates. WordPress administrators can download the new version of WordPress from there or update directly if their blog has been configured properly for that.</p><p><img

The new design looked that terrible that I &#8211; for the first time ever &#8211; switched from the plain HTML editor to the visual editor. The visual editor uses an eye pleasing font and layout.</p><p>It is still a mystery to me why the developers thought it was a good idea to change the default plain HTML editor textarea font in the WordPress admin interface.</p><p>If you are like me, you prefer the old font, especially if you are used to working with the HTML editor of the admin area.</p><p>It is thankfully though not complicated to switch back to the old font. All you need to do is to replace or edit one file of your WordPress installation.</p><p>CSS is used both on the blog&#8217;s frontend and backend to format elements. Lets take a look at the new font of the WordPress 3.2 admin interface.</p><div
id="attachment_47424" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a
href="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wordpress-32-admin-interface.png"><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wordpress-32-admin-interface.png" alt="wordpress 32 admin interface" title="wordpress 32 admin interface" width="600" height="406" class="size-full wp-image-47424" /></a><p
class="wp-caption-text">new wordpress font</p></div><p>To change the WordPress admin interface to this</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wordpress-admin-font.png" alt="wordpress admin font" title="wordpress admin font" width="597" height="404" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47426" /></p><p>you need to edit the file wp-admin.css located in the wp-admin/css directory. Make a backup of the file before you start editing it. Open it in your favorite text editor and search for the string <strong>#editorcontainer</strong></p><p>You should see code that looks like the following:</p><p><code>#editorcontainer #content{font-family:Consolas,Monaco,monospace;padding:6px;line-height:150%;border:0</code></p><p>Notice the font-family setting? To change the font all you need to do is to add another font in front. I have added Verdana which you can see in the second screenshot of the admin interface. The code for Verdana would look like this</p><p><code>#editorcontainer #content{font-family:Verdana,Consolas,Monaco,monospace;padding:6px;line-height:150%;border:0</code></p><p>You can also change the padding and line-height there to get better values as well if you want.</p><p>I know that some of you may not be comfortable editing css files on their own. I have uploaded the new wp-admin.css file to my server, and you can download it from this link: <a
href='http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wp-admin.css'>wp-admin.css</a>.</p><p>Just copy the file to the wp-admin/css/ section of your WordPress blog and you should see the new font when you reload the admin page. The only change in the file is the new font. If you want to change line height, padding or other values you need to do that on your own.</p><hr

That is, if you update your blogs as soon as the updates come out, and not weeks afterwards. WordPress 3.2 is not a security update, which means that webmasters have more time to update their blogs to the new version, as it is not something that they must do right away to protect it from hackers and exploits.</p><p>That&#8217;s good because the new version introduces new system requirements that webmasters should make sure their server supports, before they upgrade. WordPress 3.2 requires as a minimum MySql 5.0.15 and PHP 5.2.4. That&#8217;s a big step from MySQL 4.1.2 and PHP 4.3. Contact your hoster if you are not sure if you server supports the minimum requirements.</p><p>Experienced webmasters can also create a php file with &lt;? PHPINFO(); ?&gt; as the content and upload it to their server. The file displays the information, among many others, in the browser when opened there.</p><p>The highlights of WordPress 3.2 in 40 words or less: WordPress comes with a refreshed admin design, a full screen editor for distraction free blogging, a new default HTML5 theme and an extended admin bar.</p><p>There are other things, largely under the hood that will make webmasters happy. This includes faster page loading times, dropped support for Internet Explorer 6, additional performance and speed improvements and caching of admin dashboard widgets to reduce the site&#8217;s memory footprint.</p><p><object

Especially the font in HTML editing mode feels strange with its white space between words and a new line height. Editors who switch to the visual mode on the other hand seem to get a default font (does anyone know if it is possible to change the font in WordPress admin?)</p><p>The update notifications are as usual available right on the admin backend of the blog. Webmasters can update their blogs from within their, if configured this way. This is the fastest update option. An alternative is the download of the new version <a
href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/gershwin/">from the</a> official website and updating via ftp or sftp.</p><p>I have updated five blogs yesterday evening and the update went well without difficulties. I will now continue to upgrade my other twenty or so blogs, such fun..</p><hr

Whenever they do it means that I have to stay away to find out if it fixes security vulnerabilities. If it does, I update all of my blogs immediately. Instead of going to bed, I&#8217;m spending between one and two hours updating the sites. Not that pleasant.</p><p>WordPress 3.1.4. has just been released and the developers refer to it as a security and maintenance upgrade. The new version fixes one known vulnerability that &#8220;could allow a malicious Editor-level user to gain further access to the site&#8221;. If you are running a single author blog you are safe from this.</p><p>I&#8217;d still recommend to update the blog as soon as possible because of security hardening additions to the blogging platform.</p><p>The update is as usually available as a direct download, install and update from within the WordPress admin interface, and as a separate download from the official WordPress website. I have updated a total of five blogs so far &#8211; including Ghacks Technology News &#8211; and encountered no problems or issues after the update. While it may be to early to tell, it is relatively safe to say that the update won&#8217;t break the blog.</p><p><img

href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.1/?action=stop_on_copy&#038;mode=stop_on_copy&#038;rev=18375&#038;stop_rev=18047&#038;limit=100">WordPress trac</a>.</p><p>The developers have furthermore released the third and final release candidate of WordPress 3.2 which will be released in the near future. While I would not suggest to update a public blog to that version yet, it is clear that it won&#8217;t be long until the final version is released. Likely again before my bedtime.</p><p>You find additional information about the features and changes in WordPress 3.2 on the <a
href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/">official beta</a> announcement post over at the WordPress website.</p><p>Have you updated your blogs yet? If so, have you encountered any issues with this update?</p><hr

While it may be cool to have ten 500 Kilobyte images on your homepage, it may in turn lead to visitors leaving the site before it is completely loaded in their browsers.</p><p>Lower page loading times have positive effects on both the web server and visitors, among them improved bounce rates, page views and an increase in returning visitors.</p><p>Various online and offline tools are available for webmasters to test the performance of their websites. Two of the most popular ones are YSlow by Yahoo and Page Speed by Google. <a
href="http://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a> is a service that runs both performance tests at the same time.</p><p>To run the test visit the GTmetrix website and enter an url into the form on the main page. You can run the test as a guest.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/gtmetrix.png" alt="gtmetrix" title="gtmetrix" width="471" height="246" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46726" /></p><p>It usually takes less than a minute to complete the analysis of the website. Results are then displayed as a summary and in detail.</p><p>You find both the Page Speed and YSlow grade at the top, and a breakdown separated in tabs.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/performance-report.png" alt="performance report" title="performance report" width="600" height="242" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46727" /></p><p>The summary gives a quick overview of the overall performance as analysed by the two web reporting tools, the page loading time, page size and total number of requests.</p><p>The breakdown lists the various recommendations and grades in detail, with the least optimized items listed at the top.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/website-performance.png" alt="website performance" title="website performance" width="600" height="262" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46728" /></p><p>A click on an individual recommendation displays additional information, for instance which CSS files are not minimized, or which objects are not making use of effective browser caching.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/optimize-website.png" alt="optimize website" title="optimize website" width="436" height="101" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46729" /></p><p>It is usually best to start optimizing items that are listed near the top with a priority rating of high. It is not always possible to do that though. It is for instance not possible to add expires headers for components that are not hosted on the web server the site is running on. One interesting option offered by GTmetrix is the ability to compare different websites with each other.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/website-comparison.png" alt="website comparison" title="website comparison" width="600" height="244" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46732" /></p><p>Websites and their scores are displayed next to each other on the comparison report page. You can compare the summaries and breakdown of individual items easily. That&#8217;s handy if you want to compare the performance of several websites that you own, or your own website with a fast or slow loading websites in your niche.</p><p>It can happen that you run into a recommendation that you do not know anything about, like specifying a cache validator or combining images using CSS sprites. The site offers <a
href="http://gtmetrix.com/recommendations.html">recommendations</a>, very similar to those that <a
href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rules_intro.html">Google</a> and <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">Yahoo</a> offer on their pages. It is a good start to find how how &#8220;things&#8221; are optimized.</p><p>I usually run the performance report for a site, fix one issue that is high on the priority list, double-check that the website loads as intended, before I re-test the page to get the new performance rating.</p><p>A web performance report can only help you that much. It hints at areas of your website that could be improved to reduce page loading times for visitors, and reduce the load on the web server at the same time. It is still up to the webmaster to optimize the site, for instance by installing caching plugins, optimizing images, objects on page or by switching web hosts.</p><p>Have you recently run website optimizations? Which tools have you used for that?</p><hr

However, there are certain aspects of the program that cause some users pause.</p><p>For example, many posts benefit from a nice, clean thumbnail seated just to the left of the title of your posts.  Such images break up otherwise monotonous, similar posts into individual units with their own appearance and characteristics.  They can make the difference between an unattractive blog blanketed in text and an interesting web magazine with illustrations.</p><p><img
src="http://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wordpress-thumbnails1.png" alt="wordpress thumbnails" title="wordpress thumbnails" width="600" height="407" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46136" /></p><p>To implement these thumbnails you need to tell WordPress to look for the specific images you want and then to add them itself.  You can do this by creating a field in each post called customimage which, when found, will tell WordPress to make the image appear.  On the off chance that you do not add the customimage field to a particular post, you want WordPress to instead display a default image.</p><p>To begin, select an image that you would like posts to display by default.  This could be your face, your dog, a speeding car â really, it&#8217;s completely up to you.  Open the image in your favorite editor (Gimp, Paint.net or any other image editor that you may have at your disposal) and set it to whatever pixel dimensions you prefer.  Be mindful that regardless of how long your blog title is, your photo will always be the same size.  Somewhere between 150 by 150 and 250 by 250 pixels is probably a safe bet, and square boxes are easier to place various images in later, as opposed to rectangular ones.  Once you have a nice image name it something you can remember (standard.gif, default.gif, etc.).</p><p>Next, upload the default image into your theme&#8217;s image directory.  This makes it available to all pages of your site and any post missing the customimage field.</p><p>Now for the important part: post the following code into the index.php file of your WordPress wherever you would like the thumbnails to appear:</p><p><code>&lt;?php $postimageurl = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, 'customimage', true);</p><p>if ($postimageurl) {</p><p>?&gt;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php echo $postimageurl; ?&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;Post Pic&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>&lt;?php } else { ?&gt;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?&gt;/images/yourwebsite.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p><p>After you are finished copying over the code and pasting it in index.php, save the file.  Your posts will now place whatever image you chose as your default (customimage) earlier beside each entry.  That&#8217;s good, but you really want to be able to change that image â the point of this entire exercise is to make each post different.</p><p>All that you need to do is create a custom field with each entry called customimage (not in italics, of course).  Change the value each time to the URL of whatever image you would like to display beside the particular post and you will be set to go.  Enjoy having a unique thumbnail beside each post, unless you allow it to fall to the default.</p><p>Images clearly make for a more attractive blog post for the majority of readers. Are you one of those? Photos attract, so make sure that you blog is attractive and attracting.</p><p><strong>Update from Martin:</strong></p><p>You do not necessarily have to paste the code into index.php. You can alternatively paste it into single.php for individual posts, category.php for categories or tags.php for tags.</p><p>If you are not familiar with web development you may want to select a theme that supports post thumbnails out of the box. There are even some that take the first image of each post automatically and use it as the post thumbnail provided that you have not added a thumbnail image of your own to the post.</p><p>You also need to consider that images will increase the loading time of the site. If you have a slow loading site, it is probably best not to add more images to the blog, or at least not before you started to optimize the blog code for speed.</p><hr
