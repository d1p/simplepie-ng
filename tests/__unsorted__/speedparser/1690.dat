 <title>New International Teaser and One-Sheet: - The Party of Wolves (Lobos de Arga)</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47666/new-international-teaser-and-one-sheet-party-wolves-lobos-de-arga</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been several months since last we spoke about Juan Martínez Moreno&#039;s hairy new horror comedy &lt;I&gt;Party of Wolves&lt;/i&gt; (or &lt;I&gt;Lobos de Arga&lt;/i&gt; for you purists out there), but with the passage of time comes good things, like teasers and posters! We love that kinda stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Areces, Mabel Rivera, and Secun de la Rosa all star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;I&gt;1911, Arga, a rural village in the North Western Spanish region of Galicia. A terrible curse falls on the evil Marchioness of Mariño and her son, transforming him into a werewolf. One hundred years later, Tomás Mariño, a failed writer and the only male descendant of the Mariño family, goes back to Arga to be awarded the freedom of the village. But things aren’t as they seem. The real reason for which he has been invited is to be the main protagonist and the sacrifice in an obscure ceremony that must be carried out by the villagers one hundred years after the curse first came into effect in order to end the reign of fear of the werewolf that has been terrorizing the region all that time.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mariño, with the help of an old friend from the village, Mateo, manages to escape. What they don’t realize is that, as the ceremony hasn’t been carried out on the exact date, a second curse will fall on the village, much worse and more dangerous than the first: all the villagers are transformed into raging, hungry werewolves.  From that moment on, our protagonists, who have been joined by Mario, a literary editor, and Rosa, Tomás’s grandmother, will be forced to spend the longest, most terrifying night of their lives, trying to escape by any possible means (some of them very stupid) from that hell full of beasts which Arga has now become. But, of course, without losing their sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Exclusive Interview: Wes Craven Talks Scream 4 Blu-Ray, Scream 5 and More!</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47665/exclusive-interview-wes-craven-talks-scream-4-blu-ray-scream-5-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/s4i.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;Exclusive Interview: Wes Craven Talks Scream 4 Blu-Ray, Scream 5 and More!&quot; /&gt;Directed by Master of Horror Wes Craven, &lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; is the latest installment in the (potentially growing) &lt;I&gt;Scream&lt;/i&gt; series of flicks which not only reunited the director with the franchise&#039;s original trio of survivors (Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox) but also allowed the veteran director an opportunity to collaborate with a new generation of genre stars (Emma Roberts, Hayden Paniettere, Rory Culkin, Alison Brie, Erik Knudsen) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in theaters this past April, the latest sequel featured &quot;final girl&quot; Sidney Prescott (Campbell) returning to her hometown of Woodsboro on the eve of the anniversary of the original &quot;Woodsboro Massacre&quot;- also known as the plot of 1996&#039;s &lt;I&gt;Scream&lt;/i&gt;- for a book signing after her biography becomes a hit with readers everywhere.  Always a victim of bad timing, Sidney&#039;s unaware when she arrives in town that a new Ghostface is on the loose; not only is this killer looking to remake the events of the original &quot;Woodsboro Massacre&quot; but they&#039;ve got only plans to rewrite the ending and this time everyone (including Sidney) must die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Sidney&#039;s reunited with Dewey (Arquette) and Gale (Cox), it&#039;s up to the trio to figure out who&#039;s taken on the Ghostface persona this time around before Sidney and everyone she loves ends up a victim of the brutal knife-wielding killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dread Central recently caught up with Craven for an exclusive chat regarding the upcoming Blu-Ray release of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/scream-4-blu-raydvd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; (Blu-ray/DVD review here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, his thoughts on the sequences removed from the final cut of the flick as well as if he&#039;s heard anything on whether or not we can expect to see Ghostface ever again (and more importantly- would Craven consider returning to direct &lt;I&gt;Scream 5&lt;/i&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a running time of 111 minutes, it may or may not come as a surprise to many that when production first began on &lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; in mid-2010, Craven was originally shooting from an astonishing 140 page long script. Throughout the editing process, Craven began realizing more and more that if they used everything he&#039;d shot for the flick, he&#039;d end up with a movie that clocked in around three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing there&#039;s no way he could release &lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; at anywhere near that kind of running time, the director knew cuts had to be made; most he was accepting of but there&#039;s one in particular he wished had made it into the final cut of the latest sequel.&lt;br /&gt;
Craven walked us through what the editing process was like on &lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; and why some of the editing decisions were made, often resulting in the removal of some character development related moments for key cast members. &lt;I&gt;&quot;What we had for Scream 4 was a script that was too long so when we shot everything. There was a lot we had in there and while it was all mostly wonderful stuff, it really slowed down the pace of the story overall.  Also, sometimes things would just come across repetitive, especially in the case of Trevor (Jill&#039;s ex).  His dialogue ended up being him saying the same things over and over so we cut a lot of those scenes out. Thankfully, most of his third act stuff stayed intact and that&#039;s when Nico (actor Tortorella) really shined anyway so I think in that case, it worked out for the best in the end.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/s4i1.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;Exclusive Interview: Wes Craven Talks Scream 4 Blu-Ray, Scream 5 and More!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;But overall, things just weren&#039;t happening fast enough. We had a lot of scenes in the hospital- too many I think- and we spent a lot of time at Sidney&#039;s Aunt Kate&#039;s house too which also slowed the pace down. So a lot of stuff got left on the cutting room floor- especially the stuff at Kate&#039;s house but I&#039;m okay with those cuts because they served the final movie. However, there was one shot in particular that I did not agree with cutting and Bob said it had to be cut.  There was a sequence that we shot with the crime scene involving the first two victims of the movie and how their bodies were placed to resemble the crime scenes from Casey and Steve&#039;s death that opened the original Scream.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;Actually, the fact that the killer was patterning themselves after the deaths in the original Scream was a huge theme in the original drafts of the Scream 4 script that got minimalized throughout the editing process of the movie. I guess that would be the one thing I would have liked to see featured more but in the long run, I&#039;m very happy with how Scream 4 came out,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; added Craven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor creative differences aside, if there&#039;s one thing Craven is certain about it&#039;s that the &lt;I&gt;Scream&lt;/i&gt; franchise is unlike most other genre series out there when you take into consideration the fact that the director has always returned to helm the sequels (something unheard of within the genre) and that the series still continues to follow three of the original survivors from 1996&#039;s &lt;I&gt;Scream&lt;/i&gt; (also something else unheard of in horror movies).  He spoke about why he thinks these movies stand out against other horror franchises and what keeps bringing him back every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craven explained, &lt;I&gt;&quot;I think a lot of people forget sometimes that the Scream movies aren&#039;t your average slasher films; they&#039;re really murder mysteries wrapped up inside a horror movie so we always have a little more to accomplish in our stories than the usual horror movie formula.  These aren&#039;t the standard &#039;killer stalks down random pretty girls in the woods and hacks them to death while we all cheer movies&#039;; they&#039;re a beast of a different nature altogether and that starts with the original.  That movie was a response to the horror genre at that time and the sequels had their own messages too.  With Scream 4, not only is this one is a sequel but it also has the Ghostface killer &#039;remaking&#039; the original movie and that&#039;s something you don&#039;t see every day in horror movies.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/s4i2.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;Exclusive Interview: Wes Craven Talks Scream 4 Blu-Ray, Scream 5 and More!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;See, I absolutely love the unique nature of this series so I think that&#039;s what brings me back- that and if the idea is good too because I have to believe in the idea to want to direct.  But it&#039;s incredibly rare to have a director at the helm for every film in the series so I do feel lucky that I&#039;ve not only been involved with all of these films personally but that I&#039;ve gotten to do it alongside Neve, David and Courteney the entire time.  Everyone always asks me each time we start one of these movies if I&#039;m going to kill off one of the &#039;main three&#039; but I always hesitate because they&#039;re the heart of the franchise.  Especially Neve- rarely do you see a character grow as much as you do with Sidney through all four of these films.  Actually, Courteney was begging me to kill Gale in Scream 4 but I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to do it and I don&#039;t know if I ever will either,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; added Craven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;I&gt;Scream 4&lt;/i&gt; hitting DVD and Blu-Ray shelves on October 4th, we asked Craven if he&#039;s heard about any forward movement on the &lt;I&gt;Scream 5&lt;/i&gt; front. &lt;I&gt;&quot;I know everyone&#039;s been speculating, even back in April, but I would say that most likely there will be Scream 5.  Now, will I be directing? I&#039;m not sure- as I mentioned, for me the story has to be there and if it&#039;s not there then I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d come back but I know it is something that Bob Weinstein wants to do.  Fans will just have to wait and see what happens.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Wes Craven for taking the time to speak with Dread Central!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dread Central Heads to Knott&#039;s Scary Farm</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47664/dread-central-heads-knotts-scary-farm</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/knottsA.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Knott&#039;s Berry Farm, Knott&#039;s Scary Farm, Halloween Haunts&quot; style=&quot;padding:6px&quot; width=180 /&gt;Knott&#039;s Scary Farm, the granddaddy of all Halloween theme parks, is back again for the 39th year to bring healthy scares to thrill-seekers looking for a fun evening, and we have just a taste of the terrors that lie in wait for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the yearly event opened a week ago, we were fortunate enough to be invited to participate in their media night celebration. So check out the some of the sights in our image gallery below. There were a whole lot more images from the evening that did not make the cut, especially from their spooky and dark mazes. Even the pictures in the gallery below do not do justice to the amount of intricate details in the setup. It is definitely an experience to be had in person. The 3D mazes are not to be missed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/gallerythumb.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the listing of Knott&#039;s Berry Farm&#039;s Halloween Haunt &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knotts.com/public/park/haunt/halloween_haunt.cfm&quot; target=blank rel=nofollow&gt;mazes and scare zones&lt;/a&gt;. Knott&#039;s Scary Farm runs through October 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been to Knott&#039;s Scary Farm yet? Or is there another Halloween theme park near you that you like? Tell us all about it in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>American Horror Story Attic Artifacts Roundup Image Gallery</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47663/american-horror-story-attic-artifacts-roundup-image-gallery</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/ahsA.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Alexandra Breckenridge, American Horror Story, Brad Falchuk, Connie Britton, Denis O&#039;Hare, Dylan McDermott, Eric Close, Evan Peters, Frances Conroy, FX, Horror TV. Jamie Harris. Jessica Lange. Ryan Murphy, Sarah Paulson, Taissa Farmiga, Teddy Sears, Zachary Quinto&quot; style=&quot;padding:6px&quot; width=180 /&gt;The following is a Dread Central Public Service Announcement™: We would like to take this time to remind you folks to set your DVRs for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/american-horror-story&quot; target=blank&gt;American Horror Story&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&#039;s premiere episode on Wednesday, October 5th on FX. Failing to do so would be an epic fail on all counts. Thank you for your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&#039;t already know, &quot;American Horror Story&quot;&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youregoingtodieinthere.com/registerdreadcentral/&quot; target=blank rel=nofollow&gt;You&#039;re Going to Die in There&lt;/a&gt; promotion have been running for some time now, and we at DreadCentral are curating the attic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while some folks received actual artifacts, others have received slightly more cryptic e-mails. Has FX released all of the goodies for this promotion? Honestly, we just don&#039;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, we are asking for your help in identifying as many attic artifacts as possible. Check out the image gallery below for a refresher on what we know so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get to the attic on &lt;a href=&quot;http://youregoingtodieinthere.com/&quot; target=blank rel=nofollow&gt;You&#039;re Going to Die in There&lt;/a&gt; by entering the front door of the house and then move the slider to &quot;1970s&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/gallerythumb.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Defrost Two More Clips from The Thing </title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47662/defrost-two-more-clips-thing</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday is here and as per usual it sucks. Good thing we have some more clips from the premake™ of &lt;I&gt;The Thing&lt;/i&gt; to tide us over. We even threw in the previous ones just so you have the whole package. We&#039;re good like that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr., is directing from a screenplay by Eric Heisserer and Ronald D. Moore.  The cast includes Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Jonathan Walker, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Dennis Storhøi, Trond Espen Seim, Jørgen Langhelle, Eric Christian Olsen, Stig Henrik Hoff, Jan Gunnar Røise, Kristofer Hivju, and Jo Adrian Haavind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for &lt;I&gt;The Thing&lt;/i&gt; in theatres on October 14, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Synopsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the thriller THE THING, paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they’re infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew’s pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://api.indieclicktv.com/watch/4e8913460af49/video.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jack Ketchum and Lucky McKee Want To Give You a Piece of The Woman</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47661/jack-ketchum-and-lucky-mckee-want-give-you-piece-woman</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few movies are able to create the firestorm that &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; has, before even being released at the theater. A brutal story that has drawn both praise and scorn, there is one thing that can&#039;t be denied: &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; has already left a huge mark on the history of our genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Jack Ketchum and director Lucky McKee know how important that you, the fans, have been in keeping &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; alive, and your support has been invaluable. So with the theatrical release of &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; looming near (October 14th), the men behind the madness want to pay you back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is send in your ticket stub for &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt;, dated October 14th-16th, along with a SASE (self-addressed stamped envelope) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Jabcuga&lt;br /&gt;
Attn: Lucky Jack&lt;br /&gt;
69 Sherwood Ave.&lt;br /&gt;
Hamburg, NY 14075&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 101 people to get in their ticket stubs will receive one of the pages from the actual rough draft script of &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; (complete with handwritten) notes, autographed by Lucky McKee and Jack Ketchum. However, even if you aren&#039;t one of the first 101, you will still get your thanks as well. You will receive a copy of one of the pages also signed by Ketchum and McKee (original signatures, not copies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rare opportunity to get something very special, just for doing what you should: supporting horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find all the details at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jackketchum.net/the-woman-giveaway/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jack Ketchum&#039;s official site&lt;/a&gt; and you can visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloodydisgustingselects.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloody Disgusting Selects website&lt;/a&gt; to find a theater near you playing &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Woman is the last surviving member of a feral clan that has roamed the Northeast Coast for decades. When the last of her family is killed in a battle with the police, The Woman finds herself alone, severely wounded and vulnerable. Unfortunately, she is now a far too easy prey for local hunter, successful country lawyer and seriously disturbed family man Christopher Cleek. With his twisted set of ideals, Cleek decides to embark upon a deranged project - to capture her and &quot;break&quot; The Woman - a decision that will soon threaten the lives of Cleek, his family and The Woman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Convent Becomes a Haunted Dorm in Latest Paranormal Activity Copycat</title>

 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/stock/foundfootage.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;The Convent Becomes a Haunted Dorm in Latest Paranormal Activity Copycat&quot; /&gt;Ever since the success of &lt;I&gt;Paranormal Activity&lt;/i&gt;, everyone&#039;s walking around with cameras, setting up make-shift stunts, and passing it off as &lt;I&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; footage. The latest to join the ever growing crop? &lt;I&gt;The Convent&lt;/i&gt;, not to be confused with the Mike Mendez classic of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not many details are available at press time, but as you can see by the trailer below, some nuns died and are now &lt;I&gt;haunting&lt;/i&gt; the place where they croaked, which been refurbished into a student dorm. Things moving by themselves, people getting yanked, and chicks screaming ensue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, we&#039;ve seen it all before, but you can&#039;t blame &#039;em for trying, right? Tell us your thoughts below after watching the teaser. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Plot Details and Teaser Art Emerges for Sadako 3D</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47659/plot-details-and-teaser-art-emerges-sadako-3d</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been a few months since last there was anything to talk about pertaining to the next chapter in the &lt;I&gt;Ring&lt;/i&gt; franchise, &lt;I&gt;Sadako 3D&lt;/i&gt;, but some plot details have surfaced along with a bit of teaser art! Dig it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koji Suzuki has penned the script for the flick coming to us from Kadokawa Shoten Company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadako, identified by her long black hair covering her face, has become an iconic character in the Japanese horror genre. Suzuki, the author of the original Ring novel series, indicated that the new 3D film will include a scene of Sadako coming out of a television set, similar to the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;I&gt;13 years after the original Ring movie, Sadako returns to the big screen in 3D!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Akane is a high school teacher who hears a rumor from her students that there is actual footage on the Internet of someone&#039;s suicide. The footage is said to drive anyone who sees it to also commit suicide. Akane does not believe the rumor at first, but when one of her female students dies after viewing the footage, she and her boyfriend Takanori are fatefully drawn into the horror that has been created by the man who appears in the suicide footage, Kashiwada.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Kashiwada&#039;s intention is to create chaos in the world by bringing back Sadako and the power of her curse. Now Akane has to fight against Sadako and Kashiwada to save the lives of herself and Takanori.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Toronto After Dark Film Festival 2011: Stills, One-Sheet, and Trailer: War of the Dead</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47658/toronto-after-dark-film-festival-2011-stills-one-sheet-and-trailer-war-dead</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gearing up to have its world premiere as part of the 2011 Toronto After Dark Film Festival is &lt;i&gt;War of the Dead&lt;/i&gt; (formerly &lt;I&gt;Stone&#039;s War&lt;/i&gt;). To celebrate the flick&#039;s debut on Saturday, October 22nd, at 9:45 pm, we have a bunch of new goodies for you cats. Dig it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marko Makilaasko directs. Andrew Tiernan, Jouko Ahola, Mikko Leppilampi, Samuel Vauramo, Mark Wingett, Andreas Wilson, Antti Reini and Magdalena Gorska star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;I&gt;March 1942. Captain Martin Stone (Andrew Tiernan - 300, The Pianist) leads an American unit on a mission to destroy an enemy bunker, joining forces with an elite platoon of Finnish soldiers that includes Cpt. Niemi (Jouko Ahola - Kingdom of Heaven) and Ltnt. Laasko (Mikko Leppilampi). The troops are torn apart by the same enemy soldiers they had killed a few minutes earlier in an ambush. The living dead? Evil forces? Or SS experiments gone wrong?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Reel Estate Market Goes Bust for Dream House at the Box Office</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47657/reel-estate-market-goes-bust-dream-house-box-office</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/stock/boxoffice.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;The Reel Estate Market Goes Bust for Dream House at the Box Office&quot; /&gt;It’s been two weeks since a new horror movie opened to dismal box office results, and despite a cast that includes James Bond, an Oscar-winning actress, and a 6-time Oscar nominee in the director’s chair, &lt;i&gt;Dream House&lt;/i&gt; became the latest horror offering to have a nightmarish opening weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dream House&lt;/i&gt; opened to horrid reviews from critics and general disinterest from audiences judging by Box Office Mojo’s tally. Opening in 6th place with $8.2 million dollars for the weekend, the mind-bending chiller couldn’t even beat out an evangelical Christian cop drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is that &lt;i&gt;Dream House&lt;/i&gt; was anything but a dream behind the scenes as director Jim Sheridan was said to have feuded heavily with the producers over the final cut. The producers won, but at what cost? The marketing department did this film no favors either. It was also during the filming of &lt;i&gt;Dream House&lt;/i&gt; that Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz fell in love and married so at least the film worked out well for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contagion&lt;/i&gt; continues to be the only other box office offering with any horrific overtones, and it is clearly nearing the end of its theatrical run. Down to 9th place with $5 million for the weekend, the star-studded Steven Soderbergh pandemic thriller has thus far accumulated a respectable but unremarkable $64 million domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No report next week since it will be all about what happens when robots box and George Clooney runs for President. But in two weeks we finally find out if &lt;i&gt;The Thing&lt;/i&gt; is actually a remake, a prequel, or what I prefer to call a premake. Whatever this &lt;i&gt;Thing&lt;/i&gt; turns out to be, let’s just hope it it&#039;s not a movie we want to take a flamethrower to.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Preview of Supernatural Episode 7.03 - The Girl Next Door</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47656/preview-supernatural-episode-703-girl-next-door</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/stock/supernatural.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Supernatural&quot; style=&quot;padding:6px&quot; /&gt;This week&#039;s episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot; left viewers with a real cliffhanger, and while we ponder the possibilities of what the events that transpired mean for the Winchesters - and the human race - we have a peek at the upcoming &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, directed by series star Jensen Ackles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Episode 7.03 &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;&lt;/u&gt; (10/7/11 Air Date; 9:00-10:00 PM):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dean (Jensen Ackles) is furious after Sam (Jared Padalecki) disappears to follow a lead on a case with clues that are identical to a case Sam solved as a kid.  The demon turns out to be Amy (guest star Jewel Staite), who has been killing low-life thugs and taking their brains for dinner – the same demon Sam found as a kid.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jensen Ackles directed the episode written by Andrew Dabb and Daniel Loflin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bruce Dern Joins the Cast for Rob Zombie&#039;s Lords of Salem</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47655/bruce-dern-joins-cast-rob-zombies-lords-salem</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be Sunday, but you know the saying - There&#039;s no rest for the wicked.  Which must be why Rob Zombie chose today to announce some of the biggest casting news yet for his upcoming &lt;i&gt;Lords of Salem&lt;/i&gt;.  Read on for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s what Zombie had to say about Dern on, where else?, his Facebook page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here&#039;s some really exciting casting news! I am fucking thrilled to announce that Academy Award nominated actor BRUCE DERN has joined the ever growing cast of THE LORDS OF SALEM. Bruce is taking on the role of FRANCIS MATTHIAS author of the book &quot;SATAN&#039;S LAST STAND - The Truth About The Salem Witch Trials.&quot; Francis may know a little too much about witches for his own good.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bruce has appeared in so many classic films it is almost impossible to list them but here are a few: The Wild Angels, The Trip, Psych-Out, Hang &#039;Em High, They Shoot Horses Don&#039;t They, The Cowboys, Silent Running, The King Of Marvin Gardens, The Great Gatsby, Family Plot, Black Sunday, Coming Home and the list goes on and on and on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most recently Bruce completed work on Francis Ford Coppola&#039;s latest film entitled TWIXT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/lords-dern.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bruce Dern Joins the Cast for Rob Zombie&#039;s Lords of Salem&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dern joins the previously announced Torsten Voges as Count Gorgann, lead singer of the Norwegian death metal band Leviathan the Fleeing Serpent; Jeff Daniel Phillips as Herman &quot;Whitey&quot; Salvador, one third of &quot;The Big H Team&quot; at WIQZ - Salem&#039;s Rock Radio; Meg Foster as Margaret Morgan, the leader of a secret coven of witches in Salem; and Ernest Thomas, who will play Chip &quot;Freakshow&quot; McDonald, the station manager at Salem&#039;s #1 rock station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Blum, Steven Schneider, and Oren Peli of Haunted Pictures are producing as well as Zombie regulars Andy Gould and Brian Kavanaugh-Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Heidi, a blonde rock chick, DJs at a local radio station and, together with the two Hermans (Whitey and Munster), forms part of the &quot;Big H Radio Team&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mysterious wooden box containing a vinyl record arrives for Heidi, &quot;a gift from the Lords&quot;. She assumes it&#039;s a rock band on a mission to spread their word. As Heidi and Whitey play the Lords&#039; record, it starts to play backwards, and Heidi experiences a flashback to a past trauma. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Later Whitey plays the Lords&#039; record, dubbing them the Lords of Salem, and to his surprise, the record plays normally and is a massive hit with listeners.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The arrival of another wooden box from the Lords presents the Big H Team with free tickets, posters and records to host a gig in Salem. Soon Heidi and her cohorts find that the gig is far from the rock spectacle they&#039;re expecting: The original Lords of Salem are returning, and they&#039;re out for BLOOD.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A New Clip Arrives for The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence </title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47654/new-clip-arrives-human-centipede-2-full-sequence</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times isn&#039;t exactly the first name that comes to mind when you think of who might debut a new clip from Tom Six&#039;s upcoming &lt;I&gt;The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence&lt;/i&gt;, but then again, there isn&#039;t much about this sequel that&#039;s been predictable.  Check it out as Martin, the film&#039;s protagonist, engages in a little real estate transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clip isn&#039;t embeddable, however, so click the below image to see it in all of its black &amp;amp; white glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/09/29/movies/100000001082213/exclusive-clip-human-centipede-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/hc2clip.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;A New Clip Arrives for The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFC has announced a limited theatrical release date of October 7th for the slithery little flick that&#039;s destined to get under the skin of lots of people all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a man who becomes sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of the first film and who imagines putting the &#039;centipede&#039; idea into practice. Unlike the first film, the sequel presents graphic images of sexual violence, forced defecation, and mutilation; and the viewer is invited to witness events from the perspective of the protagonist. Whereas in the first film the &#039;centipede&#039; idea is presented as a revolting medical experiment, with the focus on whether the victims will be able to escape, this sequel presents the &#039;centipede&#039; idea as the object of the protagonist&#039;s depraved sexual fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Update and New Trailer for Echo Lake</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47653/update-and-new-trailer-echo-lake</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first heard about &lt;i&gt;Echo Lake&lt;/i&gt; last December, it was slated to be a web series, but things have changed as co-writer (with Kelsey Zukowski) and director Jonathan Moody now tells us it&#039;s turned into a feature.  They&#039;re in the midst of fundraising to finish shooting this winter, and to help move things along in that regard, they&#039;ve released a new trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film from Sick Flick Productions stars Chason Hunter, Brittany Colley, Andre Bland, Eli Harris, Kelsey Zukowski, Jonathan Moody, Sam Qualiana, Brandon McPherson, Robert Shepherd, and Frances Mitchell; and once Phase II kicks into gear, they&#039;ll be joined by a few more recognizable names:  Jackey Hall (&lt;i&gt;Cyborg Conquest, 869&lt;/i&gt;), Shawn C. Phillips (&lt;i&gt;Haunted High, Chillerama&lt;/i&gt;), Sierra Holmes (&lt;i&gt;Piranha 3DD&lt;/i&gt;, VH1’s &quot;Scream Queens&quot;), and Melantha Blackthorne (&lt;i&gt;Sineaters, The Witching Hour&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Synopsis:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;In this town... nobody&#039;s safe.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ten years ago the small town of Echo Lake suffered horrific murders; ten years later the killer has returned. And now it&#039;s up to a group of friends (old and new) to figure out who the killer is. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the red band trailer, and if you like what you see, click the link below and visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/ECHO-LAKE/163276730357686?ref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Echo Lake&lt;/i&gt; Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; for more. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Visit Zombie Pumpkins and Get a Free Halloween Carving Pattern</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47652/visit-zombie-pumpkins-and-get-free-halloween-carving-pattern</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncle Creepy brought me on board here at Dread Central earlier this year, and I&#039;ve been truly having a blast writing for all you gorehounds. However, there is something I&#039;ve been dying to write about but had to wait for the right time. Well, it&#039;s that time, Halloween time, and I&#039;m finally getting my chance to write about one of my favorite websites, Zombie Pumpkins, easily one of the greatest Halloween sites around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site owner, pumpkin pattern designer and basic jack-of-all-trades badass Ryan Wickstrand has been overlord of the pumpkin carving world since 2003, and he continues to improve and add to the site every year.  And not only is Wickstrand a brilliant artist when it comes to designing patterns, he&#039;s a gorehound himself (and fan of Dread Central)! Wickstrand&#039;s love of horror is blatantly obvious in the patterns he creates. Yes, he has the obligatory Elmo, Kermit the Frog and Hello Kitty patterns for the kids. It is a business after all, and the more diverse he can be, the bigger the fanbase he can grow. But where &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zombiepumpkins.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt; Zombie Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; excels is in the horror imagery department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zombiepumpkins.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/pumpkins.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;Zombie Pumpkins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Wickstrand currently has 254 patterns online and is adding to it all the time. And I&#039;m not just talking during October. He posted a &lt;I&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/i&gt; pattern in February. I&#039;m telling you, the man is on the ball! But the real highlight of his empire is the Movie Monsters section of the site. Sure, he&#039;s got the classics in there -- Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolf Man -- but there&#039;s so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Genre fans will love this collection as there are some true gems amongst these patterns. Where else can you find a pumpkin carving pattern of Karen Cooper from the original &lt;I&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/i&gt;? She&#039;s there with no less than three &lt;I&gt;House of 1000 Corpses&lt;/i&gt; patterns. You can carve the monster from John Carpenter&#039;s &lt;I&gt;The Thing&lt;/i&gt; or Cheryl the Deadite from &lt;I&gt;The Evil Dead&lt;/i&gt;. They&#039;ve even got the classic, worm-eyed undead from Lucio Fulci&#039;s &lt;I&gt;Zombie&lt;/i&gt;. And as a bonus to all you loyal Dread Central readers, Ryan Wickstrand has given us a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zombiepumpkins.com/pattern-fulci-zombie.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;FREE PUMPKIN CARVING PATTERN of Fulci&#039;s Zombie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Click the image below, and enjoy.  All you need is a printer, some pumpkin carving tools, a pumpkin of course and maybe... some guts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zombiepumpkins.com/pattern-fulci-zombie.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/oct11/pumpkinzombie.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;Pumpkin Carving Pattern for Fulci&#039;s Zombie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Believe me when I say they are all there. The new and classic Michael Myers, masked and unmasked Jason Voorhees, plain and stitched Chucky, Leatherface, Cujo, Hannibal Lecter, Pinhead…the list is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  And that&#039;s just the movie stars. From TV they&#039;ve got Sookie and her vamps from &quot;True Blood,&quot; &quot;Dexter,&quot; &quot;The Addams Family,&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and his newest pattern, just unveiled: the awesome bicycle girl zombie from &quot;The Walking Dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Is music more your thing? How about a Rob Zombie pumpkin? Zombie Pumpkins has three Rob Zombies and the Living Dead Girl herself, Sheri Moon Zombie, too! Ozzy, Angus Young, Marilyn Manson and Iron Maiden&#039;s iconic mascot Eddie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Trust me; if you&#039;ve got any inkling to carve a pumpkin this year, this is the place to go. Zombie Pumpkins charges a very reasonable fee for its patterns, and you can choose several pay options. You can get signed up for as little as $2. Come on; you can spare two bucks to amaze and impress your friends, can&#039;t you? And believe me; they will be amazed and impressed by your dexterity. As difficult as these things look, they aren&#039;t that hard to produce at all. Wickstrand assigns each pattern a difficulty level, and even if you&#039;ve never seen a pumpkin before, you can get through an Easy Level pattern with no problem. And once you&#039;ve got the first one under your belt, you&#039;ll be banging out Challenging and Advanced Patterns in no time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Do yourself a favor and head over to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zombiepumpkins.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;Zombie Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. There truly is something for everyone. And while you&#039;re there, send Ryan Wickstrand a message telling him how cool he is and that Doctor Gash and the rest of the crew at Dread Central sent you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Go Behind-the-Scenes of American Horror Story</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47651/go-behind-scenes-american-horror-story</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has everyone set their DVR&#039;s for the Wednesday, October 5th, debut of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; on FX?  Of all the genre TV series premiering and returning this month, it&#039;s among the ones we&#039;re most excited about.  If you are, too, then you&#039;ll want to check out these new behind-the-scenes videos for the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ll find four BTS videos below:&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Coming Together&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Two appears to be MIA - we&#039;ll keep our eyes open in case FX releases it before the premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;American Horror Story&quot;, co-created by former &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; executive producers and current &quot;Glee&quot; co-creators/executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, revolves around The Harmons, a family of three who move from Boston to Los Angeles as a means to reconcile past anguish. The all star cast features Dylan McDermott (&quot;The Practice&quot;) as “Ben Harmon,” a psychiatrist; Connie Britton (&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;) as “Vivien Harmon,” Ben’s wife; Taissa Farmiga as “Violet,” the Harmons’ teenage daughter; Jessica Lange (&lt;i&gt;Tootsie, Blue Sky, Grey Gardens&lt;/i&gt;) in her first-ever regular series TV role as “Constance,” the Harmons’ neighbor; Evan Peters (&quot;One Tree Hill&quot;) plays “Tate Langdon,” one of Ben’s patients; and Denis O’Hare (&quot;The Good Wife&quot;) as “Larry Harvey.” Guest stars for the series include Frances Conroy (&quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) as the Harmons’ housekeeper; Alexandra Breckenridge (&lt;i&gt;Dirt&lt;/i&gt;) as the Harmons’ housekeeper; Jamie Brewer as Constance’s daughter; Zachary Quinto; Teddy Sears; Morris Chestnut; Eric Stonestreet; and Sarah Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Exclusive In-Depth Chat with C. Thomas Howell Regarding MoniKa and More!</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47650/exclusive-depth-chat-c-thomas-howell-regarding-monika-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a young man, he assisted a cross-dressing alien in evading the feds in Spielberg’s 1982 smash-hit &lt;i&gt;E.T. The Extraterrestrial&lt;/i&gt; and was told to “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” in Coppola’s 1983 drama &lt;i&gt;The Outsiders&lt;/i&gt;.  He made famous the battle-cry ‘Wolverines!’ in John Milius’ 1984 Cold War flick &lt;i&gt;Red Dawn&lt;/i&gt; and as ‘Jim Halsey’ nearly ate a french-fried finger in director Robert Harmon’s 1986 horror classic &lt;i&gt;The Hitcher&lt;/i&gt;. Years later, and with nearly 150 titles to his credit, C. Thomas Howell sat down with us to discuss with candor his varied career as well as his role in Steven R. Monroe’s upcoming feature &lt;i&gt;MoniKa&lt;/i&gt;. Read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“It’s sex, drugs and rock n’ roll, that sort of thing,”&lt;/i&gt; the forty-four-year-old Howell told us of his role last June on the Big Picture Soundstage, Burbank, California, set of &lt;i&gt;MoniKa &lt;/i&gt;(then titled &lt;i&gt;Hole in the Desert&lt;/i&gt;), which is co-executive produced by lead actress Cerina Vincent (who appears in the titular role) with Monroe and producers Anthony Fankhauser and Corey A. Jackson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“My character is a small part,” &lt;/i&gt;Howell continued of his role of ‘Double’ in &lt;i&gt;MoniKa, “and I only have a couple of days on this movie, but I basically play the best friend (of actor Jason Wiles), who gets talked into coming to Vegas on a whim, and who stumbles into a murder, so it’s basically kind of a ‘whodunit’ with a bit of a The Sixth Sense twist, but I can’t reveal it.  It’s not what you think you are watching though.  It definitely has some thinking involved; you know, ‘Is it a dream? Is it a nightmare? Is it a ghost story? What is it?’  So you’re just trying to figure it all out, and it’s interesting.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/sep11/cthomas1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;C. Thomas Howell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenge-thriller &lt;i&gt;MoniKa &lt;/i&gt;co-stars Jeff Branson, Chad Lindberg and Andrew Howard (the three also appeared in Monroe’s &lt;i&gt;I Spit on Your Grave &lt;/i&gt;redux) and actors Lew Temple (&lt;i&gt;The Devil’s Rejects&lt;/i&gt;), Shayla Beesley (&lt;i&gt;Spreading Darkness&lt;/i&gt;), Raffaello Degruttola, Elisa Donovan and genre vet Tim Thomerson; and Los Angeles-native Howell told us of his inclusion, &lt;i&gt;“Actually a friend of mine is one of the producers, which is what happens when you grow up in the business.  For me about seventy percent of my work comes from re-hires, and it’s always great to maintain the relationships and see people that you enjoy working with and go back and hook up with them again and just continue the process.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On working with Monroe, &lt;i&gt;“He’s really cool, man,” &lt;/i&gt;offered Howell of the director, whose other genre films have included the Cerina Vincent-starrer &lt;i&gt;It Waits &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;House of 9&lt;/i&gt;, among others.  &lt;i&gt;“He’s a really good writer and a good director, and he comes from a camera background, so he understands the process really well, and he laughs at my jokes, and I think that’s really important, so I get along with him well.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howell continued, &lt;i&gt;“Steven’s just kind of let me bring to the table kind of my own thing, really.  He’s not really precious with his words, which for a writer and a director is unusual actually.  Most writer/directors want you to say (exactly) what they wrote, so Steven’s a bit more open to suggestions.  I mean, I’m not coming in and re-writing anything, but at the same time he’s not coming up to me and saying things like, ‘You know, you left out the word &quot;but&quot; here; can we go again?’ and making me insane, which if it were Tarantino directing &lt;/i&gt;(Note: the latter is notorious for his actors&#039; strict adherence to scripted dialogue)&lt;i&gt;, I’d probably kill him myself and bury him,”&lt;/i&gt; said Howell with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“But that’s my process, you know,” &lt;/i&gt;expounded the actor on his approach to his craft.  &lt;i&gt;“I like to explore when I’m working; otherwise what’s the point? You might as well have puppets do it (otherwise).  I mean, a writer creates the space, and then it grows from there.  It’s not a finished product on the page, and there’s room for improvement if you allow it to grow, and that’s been my approach to film, and you know, a lot of times I understand that some actors will come in and bastardize the words, and can ruin a scene, but that’s what a good director will do.  He’ll go back to the words if things aren’t going so well, but generally in my experience good actors tend to bring an ego to the role, and the writer and director is looking at the big picture, and they are not just looking at this three-day part, and they can then look at the actor’s perspective and say, ‘You know, you are absolutely right,’ and go ahead and make that change, and that makes it fun.  It’s kind of like Bono going into the studio: He just starts singing shit, and he doesn’t write a poem and then go sing the poem.  There’s a discovery process that makes it exciting, and that takes the tedium out of it.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation turned to Howell’s outlook on his varied filmography (while he’s appeared in numerous celebrated films, he’s also taken jobs in flicks not so well renowned, including such ‘B’ fare as &lt;i&gt;The Hitcher II: I’ve Been Waiting, Killer Bees!, Thirst: The Blood War &lt;/i&gt;and more), and he stated, &lt;i&gt;“A lot of actors have their boundaries when it comes to a certain genre.  I suffer from enjoyment of work.  That’s my biggest issue really.  I like the process of going to the set, and I like the challenge of trying to make something better.  I’m not afraid to throw myself into the fire, and a lot of times you get burned by doing that.  I mean, I’ve made a lot of shit that I probably shouldn’t have done, but at the same time I learned more from that stuff than I did the great things that I’ve been a part of.  I mean, if I could have Johnny Depp’s career, I would take it, but I just feel that my process may have taught me a bit more than just working with Tim Burton over and over and over.”  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/s6WmEoMY2Lo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I just really like to travel, and I love acting, and I learn a lot when I do small pictures,”&lt;/i&gt; Howell mused, &lt;i&gt;“and I take those experiences to the bigger pictures (I book), like the new The Amazing Spider-Man reboot, and I’m going into my fourth season on (the television series) &quot;Southland&quot;, which has just been an amazing experience, and I had a great run on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and my career is just kind of turning into something lately that I didn’t really expect.  I’ve played lately a lot of bad guys and a lot of darker roles.  You know, I learned something from Rutger Hauer on The Hitcher, when I asked him, ‘Why are you so great at playing bad guys?’  He told me in that sort of scary voice of his, ‘I don’t play bad guys’.  And what he meant by that was that he finds the goodness and the humanity in those roles, and he doesn’t walk around and twist his mustache and play the cliché sort of idea of what people think a bad guy is.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I’m older now, and I’m no longer playing the kid in the leather jacket,” &lt;/i&gt;continued Howell, &lt;i&gt;“so you have to redefine what you are doing all of the time, like the good artists do.  If you don’t do that, then you are left in the dust, so it’s been a real pleasure for me to grow in this business, and to dig deeper, and to try to find a way to stay rooted but still bring fresh stuff to the table.  That’s not an easy task, and it’s difficult, but that’s what I’ve been aiming for.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--pagebreak--&gt;&lt;!--pagebreak--&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Commenting on his approach to the more complex individuals he’s been playing of late, and his affinity toward what some would deem ‘darker’ roles, &lt;i&gt;“Part of the discovery for me is that people relate to flawed characters more than they do the hero,”&lt;/i&gt; he said.  &lt;i&gt;“For example, I play a reformed alcoholic on ‘Southland’, and he’s not necessarily politically correct.  He doesn’t really know how to censor his thoughts so he says a lot of the wrong things, and I’ve had more people connect with that character on the street than any character I’ve ever done before, apart from Ponyboy (in The Outsiders).  That role is the supreme opposite example, which was just pure goodness as a child, although I don’t think you can play that (latter) kind of role when you are forty-four years old.  I mean, perhaps you can, but I haven’t found it yet, but playing the humanity and the struggle within ourselves, and sharing that with other people who can relate to that?  When I started out in the first season, my character was a drunk, and now he’s gone through rehab and is on the other side but is struggling to stay sober, and I’ve had a lot of people from AA wrap their arms around me and say, ‘Thank you so much!  I’ve been recovering, and I just want to tell you that you’ve done an amazing job, and I really enjoy watching you.’  They relate to that. They respond to it, more than watching the hero save the girl and kiss her at the end. That’s something that I’ve enjoyed more than anything else.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/sep11/cthomas3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;C. Thomas Howell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relating to Howell in this, this writer recalled his affinity at a young age for the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars &lt;/i&gt;character of Han Solo, as opposed to the ‘gee golly’ nature of the wide-eyed Luke Skywalker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“That’s right, man!” &lt;/i&gt;said Howell.  &lt;i&gt;“That’s a really good example.  I’m the same way.  I was a Han Solo fan myself, and those characters for me are a lot more fun to play.  I’d rather play Han than Luke, but these days personally I’d rather play Darth and try to find some sense of goodness and humanity within that mask!  Talk about a challenge.  It’s an ever-changing and ever-growing, joyful effort, and I feel so blessed to be doing what I do, and like I said, that’s probably my biggest flaw, that I don’t like waiting between gigs.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“One of the things that I admire about Jim Carrey is that he has evolved,” &lt;/i&gt;mused Howell of the actor, another man prone to taking artistic chances.  &lt;i&gt;“A lot of people who were his fans in the 80’s and 90’s when he was doing all of those silly movies might not be as attracted to what he does now, but he throws himself into the fire with every performance.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, and I can appreciate that as an artist when I watch his work.  I can appreciate that he tries something new.  The other example is Matthew McConaughey, and he said in an article I read once, ‘You know, it takes me five months after I read a script to decide if I can do it or not,’ and I’m like, ‘Really? You need five fucking months to figure out whether or not you can play the surfer guy?’  I don’t get that.  To me, within five months I’ll do five movies.  I mean, I’m not necessarily playing the lead in an eighty-million-dollar movie.  I’ll come in and I’ll play a smaller part, and I’ll play the bad guy – they just called me to play an assassin in a Bruce Willis film, and hopefully that’ll work out – but these are the types of gigs that I’m starting to get a lot of, and it’s kind of fun.  I just keep on banging.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Howell’s prolific career has evolved, so has the world, particularly with the advent of the Internet and the focus on celebrity it re-ignited.  I queried Howell the following hypothetical: If the ‘net and armchair bloggers were in existence during your youthful days of acting, would it have changed your outlook on the industry and the way you approached your craft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A lot of people take it too seriously,” &lt;/i&gt;Howell responded.  &lt;i&gt;“It’s only a movie.  It’s only the movie business, and there are so many haters online, and everyone wants to weigh in with their two cents if they are a hater, but there’s a lot more lovers out there. It’s just that the lovers don’t post.  So you just have to let it roll off of your back.  You can’t please everyone.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/sep11/cthomas2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;padding: 6px;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;C. Thomas Howell&quot; /&gt;As for his outlook as a child actor, &lt;i&gt;“I was too young,” &lt;/i&gt;said Howell.  &lt;i&gt;“I mean, I didn’t care.  I was just a carefree dude just living in the moment.  I was never really big on preparation as a kid because I didn’t know how to prepare.  I just knew how to be in the moment and go for it and try my hardest.  A lot of my work as a kid, you can see somebody trying a little too hard, and that’s because I didn’t have a director who was capable of teaching me or helping me.  I had to learn the hard way, and I’m on the other side of it today, and when I watch young kids, I often see them working too hard on the set, and that’s just because they want to be good, and they want to be accepted and they are trying just a little bit too hard, instead of just realizing, ‘Hey man, just hit the fucking mark, and just hang out, and take a moment, and feel it and then just say the line.’  They don’t need to press it, but they are all so anxious.  It’s like that Robert Duvall joke to Sean Penn in Colors, you know, ‘The Young Bull and the Old Bull?’  Where the young bull says, ‘Hey, let’s run down there and fuck us a cow,’ and the old bull says, ‘Hey, let’s walk down there and fuck them all,’ and there’s a lot of truth in that.  I didn’t understand that until I was nearly forty.  You just need to slow down a little bit and take a moment, and allow the process to take place, instead of trying to drive the process somewhere all of the time.”  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Sometimes you do get the occasional example of some genius kid like Dakota Fanning,”&lt;/i&gt; he continued, &lt;i&gt;“who gets it at a young age, and I’m always amazed by that.  I never find any false moments in her work, and how does she know that?  And then you watch her sister (Elle Fanning) in Super 8, and she’s as equally amazing, if not even better, and I don’t understand where that comes from either.  How is it that one family is so gifted?  Those skills that she is working with are more along the lines of someone who has been doing the work for twenty years, and it’s a very difficult thing to teach a young kid, and a lot of actors struggle with it and will never get it.  I struggled (with it) as a kid and became a much better actor as an adult, but most people don’t get that opportunity.  Most often if you are a child actor, your career is done when you grow up, and for me I feel really blessed to have not crashed and burned, particularly in that I have some roles that I wish I could take back, but at the same time I have some roles I’m super proud of.  You just have to take the good with the bad.  You can’t take just one film and judge me for that.  I mean, I’m a ‘lifer’, and when I die, you are going to see a body of work, and you are going to see where I’ve grown and where I was stunted, and to see where I have struggled and to see where I’ve grown.  I feel really lucky, and you just keep on keeping on.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;MoniKa &lt;/i&gt;Synopsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The film is a violent, edgy ride focusing on the forlorn Reagan Tyler, a man who is troubled by visions and premonitions that ultimately lead him to Las Vegas. It&#039;s there that Reagan meets the beautiful and mysterious Monika, a young woman who turns out to have been killed the night before he even met her. Reagan is then forced to put the puzzle together of what happened, how she is still present, and help Monika with her revenge on the killers of her younger sister.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Full Feature Lineup and Artist Guests at the Mile High Horror Film Festival </title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47649/full-feature-lineup-and-artist-guests-mile-high-horror-film-festival</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/aug11/denver.jpg&quot; style=&quot;padding: 6px;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Two More Titles Named to Mile High Horror Film Festival Line-Up&quot; /&gt;The Mile High Horror Film Festival is taking place October 7th-9th in Denver, Colorado, and the lineup is now complete along with the list of local Colorado artists that specialize in the horror genre who will be special guests of the fest.  Read on for the details!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up are the feature films that will be joining the previously announced &lt;i&gt;The Woman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Midnight Son&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chillerama&lt;/i&gt; - Filmmakers Adam Rifkin and Tim Sullivan will be in attendance!&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s the closing night at the last drive-in theater in America, and Cecil B. Kaufman (&lt;i&gt;Hatchet&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s Richard Riehle) has planned the ultimate marathon of lost film prints to unleash upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films so rare that they have never been exhibited publicly on American soil until this very night! What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hills Have Eyes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The original version written and directed by Wes Craven.  The MHHFF will be presenting legendary actor and horror icon Michael Berryman with a Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Horror Film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Didn&#039;t Come Here to Die&lt;/i&gt; - Director Bradley Scott Sullivan will be in attendance!&lt;br /&gt;
Never has a humanitarian project been so deadly and dangerous than when six young volunteers head into the woods to build a new camp.  Maybe the problem was heading into the woods in the first place?  But horrific accidents, rash decisions and the unpredictability of human nature lead them all to the same disturbing conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Saw the Devil&lt;/i&gt; - Unrated Version&lt;br /&gt;
A remorseless psychopath stalks deserted roads looking for women to rape and slaughter. But when he murders the pregnant fiancée of a secret-service agent, the tables turn, and the stalker becomes the prey as the grief-stricken agent pursues a gruesome revenge. Joo-yeon hunts down the killer but does not turn him over to the authorities. Instead, he exacts a punishment designed to make the psycho truly suffer. The sadistic mayhem escalates as the pair enact a gory cat-and-mouse game that quickly spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kidnapped&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jaime and Marta are an upper-class couple in their late forties in the midst of moving themselves and their rebellious teen daughter, Isa, into a gorgeous new home in an upscale gated Madrid community. Other than Isa chafing at moving away from her friends, life seems pretty much perfect. Perfect, that is, until a trio of men smash their way into the house, beat the family to the ground, and subject them to a night of terror. What follows are a series of gripping, intense set-pieces that are shocking, haunting, and truly unforgettable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rabies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A brother and sister in their twenties run away from home after their dark secret is discovered. They find temporary refuge in a deserted nature reserve. When the sister falls into a hunting trap set by a psychotic killer, the brother sets out in a race against time to rescue her. A forest ranger and his old dog, two apathetic cops, four tennis players, and a murderer, wandering carefree amongst his traps, will all be gradually drawn into a whirlwind of misunderstandings, fears, and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with these eight features, the fest is screening a multitude of short films, which are all listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://milehighhorror.festivalgenius.com/2011/films/category/Short+Films&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to create cross-promotional awareness and bring an extra level of excitement to the festival, the MHHFF is bringing in the following six local artists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Elrod is a self-taught artist/interactive designer who works with a variety of mediums including pencil, color pencil, ink, watercolor, acrylic, and digital. &lt;i&gt;Tickling a Dead Man: Stories About George&lt;/i&gt; is his self-published comic book in which he relentlessly tortures his misanthropic title character by forcing him to face his deepest fears and anxieties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally published wood burning comic book artist Daniel Crosier is featured on the new Travel Channel&#039;s reality TV show &quot;Making Monsters.&quot; Daniel is also co-director of the film &lt;i&gt;Isolation Man&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not trapping children and howling at the moon, Kevin Gentilcore spends most of his waking hours on drawing twisted and demented things such as his creator-owned web comic &lt;i&gt;Teenage Love Zombies&lt;/i&gt; and bringing the terrifying words of William Tooker to life with their comic company Creephouse Comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally from Philadelphia and Boston (where he picked up the annoying habit of using &quot;wicked&quot; as an adjective), Karl Christian Krumpholz has illustrated for Bluewater Productions, Creators Edge Press, Image Magazine, and Modern Drunkard Magazine. He is also the writer/artist of &lt;i&gt;Byron &lt;/i&gt;for SLG Publishing as well as the upcoming &lt;i&gt;Winsome &amp;amp; Wyrd&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Stigall is a native Colorado artist/illustrator who currently resides in Westminster, CO, with his wife, Tess, and two sons, Braydn and Ethan. As Lead Concept Artist at LEGO Play Well Studios in Louisville, CO, Jim is currently helping to create the visual look of the brick-based MMO, LEGO Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Kimble is a published comic book illustrator with titles such as &lt;i&gt;Wasted Minute&lt;/i&gt; from Yellow Nightmare Press and &lt;i&gt;Walking Bread &lt;/i&gt;from Jester Press. He is also preparing two more projects, a how-to draw MMA and an apocalyptic graphic novel slated for release in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>B-Sides: I Don’t Want to Be Buried in a Pet Sematary</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47648/b-sides-i-don%E2%80%99t-want-be-buried-pet-sematary</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter the month of October and the countdown to Halloween begins, the next five weekends of B-Sides will be devoted to sufficiently ghoulish soundtrack songs/music videos perfectly in tune with the spirit of the season. What better to begin with than The Ramones performing the theme song to Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;Pet Sematary&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans may be divided over the actual quality of the 1989 movie adaptation of King’s bestselling novel, but one thing that cannot be debated is the awesomeness of The Ramones&#039; “Pet Sematary” song. This is truly a B-Sides that does not, should not, require any further introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the motion picture of the same name, here are The Ramones performing the theme to &lt;i&gt;Pet Sematary&lt;/i&gt;, a song that will almost certainly be butchered by some vastly inferior rock band when Hollywood finally gets going on the frequently talked about remake.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Screen Media Handling US and Canadian Distribution for Glenn Ciano&#039;s Inkubus</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47646/screen-media-handling-us-and-canadian-distribution-glenn-cianos-inkubus</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Doctor Gash interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47236/director-glenn-ciano-talks-inkubus-robert-englund-infected-and-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Glenn Ciano&lt;/a&gt; recently, the &lt;i&gt;Inkubus&lt;/i&gt; director mentioned the film was scheduled for a theatrical release in at least nine cities starting on October 28th, and now we know what company will be handling said release: Screen Media, who is rolling out the flick the pre-Halloween weekend in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect some screenings in Canada soon as well since Screen Media acquired Canadian rights for &lt;i&gt;Inkubus&lt;/i&gt; along with its US distro deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in New England, however, you don&#039;t have to wait for October 28th.  You may remember that thanks to the work of producer Chad A. Verdi, &lt;i&gt;Inkubus&lt;/i&gt; will be making its world premiere at &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockandshock.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;Rock and Shock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Worchester, Massachusetts, on Saturday, October 15 at 8 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Detective Caretti (JOEY FATONE) and Officer Cole (JONATHAN SILVERMAN) head up a skeleton crew, working the final shift at a soon-to-be condemned police station. They&#039;re interviewing a suspect who, despite his blood-soaked clothes, claims he did not kill his girlfriend. He tells them that a mysterious stranger appeared from out of nowhere and killed her in front of him. The officers don&#039;t believe him...until a mysterious stranger, named Inkubus (ROBERT ENGLUND), appears from out of nowhere, holding his dead girlfriend&#039;s head.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inkubus is restrained and begins to confess his litany of crimes. He uses his one phone call to contact the retired Detective Gil Diamante (WILLIAM FORSYTHE), who almost caught him thirteen years ago and nearly lost his mind in the process. When the retired Detective Diamante arrives on the scene, the cops - unlucky enough to be present - are fated to participate in, and witness, the demon&#039;s crowning achievement of murder, gore, and mayhem.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://api.indieclicktv.com/watch/4dcd95ea83cb4/video.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;

 <title>Can&#039;t Look Away: The Lure of Horror Film Exhibit Opens October 2nd in Seattle</title>
 <link>http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47645/cant-look-away-lure-horror-film-exhibit-opens-october-2nd-seattle</link>
 <description>&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/sep11/empexhibit.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Can&#039;t Look Away: The Lure of Horror Film Exhibit Opens October 2nd in Seattle&quot; style=&quot;padding:6px&quot; /&gt;We know a lot of our readers live up in the great Pacific Northwest so when we heard about a new exhibit opening up this weekend at the Experience Music Project Museum entitled &quot;Can&#039;t Look Away: The Lure of Horror Film&quot;, of course we had to share the news.  Read on for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horror films scare us so why do we like them? Vampires, monsters, and murderers have fascinated audiences for centuries. Today the movies that feature them dominate the box office, reinforcing the historical significance and cultural relevance of the horror genre. Organized by EMP, &quot;Can&#039;t Look Away: The Lure of Horror Film&quot; examines the pivotal role that horror plays in the human experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three iconic horror directors--Roger Corman, John Landis, and Eli Roth--have curated a selection of their favorite films, providing a solid foundation on which audiences can safely explore the spectrum of cinematic horror from its inception at the turn of the 20th century to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors will get a chance to view iconic artifacts, including the script from &lt;i&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/i&gt;, the alien creature suit from &lt;i&gt;Alien&lt;/i&gt;, the scavenger demon from &lt;i&gt;Constantine&lt;/i&gt;, Jack Torrance&#039;s axe from &lt;i&gt;The Shining&lt;/i&gt; (pictured above), the original &quot;Gill Man&quot; mask used in &lt;i&gt;Creature from the Black Lagoon&lt;/i&gt;, Bram Stoker&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Dracula &lt;/i&gt;manuscript, and other horror film memorabilia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Scream Booth: Visitors are prompted to scream on cue as they watch horror film footage in a soundproof booth. A camera memorializes the moment with multiple shots displayed just outside the stall.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Horror Soundscapes: Visitors explore the fundamental music elements and scoring techniques used in horror to enhance a cinematic sense of suspense, dread, and terror.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Monster Timeline: A large infographic defines the monster archetypes of horror film, examines their individual particularities, and explores why they continue to inhabit the collective conscious of popular culture.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Shadow Monsters: Philip Worthington&#039;s interactive installation allows visitors to watch as their projected shadows morph into monsters.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEWARE! Due to the subject matter explored herein, this exhibition has a suggested rating of PG-13.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, including ticketing info, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.empmuseum.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=nofollow&gt;EMP Museum website&lt;/a&gt;.  EMP at Seattle Center is located at 325 5th Ave. N, Seattle, WA 98109; 206.770.2700 or 1.877.EMP.SFM1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=evilshopnet&amp;amp;linkCode=sb1&amp;amp;camp=212353&amp;amp;creative=380557&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
