Salesperson or service advisor: Stacy Keats&nbsp; <br />
</p><p>Stacy came highly recommended by my neighbor. (who is very difficult to please, I might add)&nbsp; He raved about his experience as will I.&nbsp; I had very specific needs for a vehicle and didn't want to spend time at the dealership.&nbsp; Stacy went to work for me and found what I wanted and called me&nbsp;back&nbsp;quicker than I thought possible.&nbsp; Fantastic!&nbsp; Talk about exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Her sales manager John also did a fantastic job in negotiating the price as I had to offer a trade in the 11th&nbsp;hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a busy executive I put off buying a new vehicle based on the stereotypical experience of spending what feels like an eternity at&nbsp;a dealership.&nbsp; Staci and her team were very respectful of my time.</p>
<p>Everyone I dealt with was courteous, professional and genuinely personable. (including the GM Mark McDermott)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not hesitate to highly recommend Stacy, John&nbsp;and her team at H&amp;H.&nbsp; You have a customer for life in me.</p>
<p>Much Appreciation,</p>
<p>David B. Carroll</p>
<blockquote>Our reply:<br /><p>Mr. Carroll</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to write such a generous review.&nbsp; I'll be sure to let Stacey, John and Mark know that they performed up to your expectation !</p>
<p>We are always very concerned about the time it takes to complete a purchase transaction for a new vehicle.&nbsp; We know how valuable time is to all of us and we just hate consuming those precious minutes.&nbsp; That being said, we also feel a commitment to "doing the job right" and that of course, takes time.&nbsp; For us, it is a balancing act.&nbsp; We continue to learn what pleases customers and have found some good, old-fashioned listening usually works the best.</p>
