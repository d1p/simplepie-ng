For many businesses, corporate value statements are little more than vague motherhood statements that sound nice but bear little relation to way business is done.</p>
<p>But that’s not that case in every business &#8211; values can be made to work when they are a genuine part of a <a title="10 key lessons from culture change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/10-key-lessons-from-culture-change/" target="_blank">company’s culture</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/values/atlassian-values.png" title="" class="shutterset_singlepic363" >
	<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-right" src="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/cache/363__320x240_atlassian-values.png" alt="atlassian-values" title="atlassian-values" />
</a>

<p>The company values of Atlassian are bold and in your face. Proclaimed on the company’s web site, Atlassian values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open company</li>
<li>No bullsh.t</li>
<li>Build with heart and balance</li>
<li>Don’t f..k the customer</li>
<li>Play as a team</li>
<li>Be the change you seek</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-10448"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D7xt0NHdSkg?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Atlassian formally proclaimed its values three years ago in a unique exercise. While other companies send their management teams off to retreats to work out their values, Atlassian did it the other way around. Management sat down and wrote out a list, and employees wrote down theirs. The two were compared.</p>
<p>There are no sales teams at Atlassian. Indeed, all sales for Atlassian come through word of mouth. Atlassian’s values of being a completely open company &#8211; in keeping with the no bullsh.t value, all customer complaints are logged on to the system for everyone to see – help pull in more customers.</p>
<p>To keep the values front and centre, Atlassian highlights examples of behavior that promote them.  Staff members who do that are turned into heroes.</p>
<p>At Rentoid, which is trying to build itself into the eBay of renting, has a similar manifesto of values that speak the customer’s language.</p>
<p>Some examples of the company’s value include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will never have grey or any color cubicles</li>
<li>Our people work where they please geographically</li>
<li>We trust each other; we don’t confuse people with our language</li>
<li>We don’t trick people with terms and conditions</li>
<li>We speak like people. We are people</li>
<li>We answer our phone calls</li>
<li>Too much money creates laziness and reduces creativity. We use our brains first and our wallets second</li>
<li>For rentoid, and personally; we don’t work with jerks. Even if it could be financially beneficial</li>
<li>Fun at work is more important than all things. It is not a corporate event, a team building exercise or a day out</li>
<li>We believe in opposites. The opposite of buying and selling is keeping, recycling, renting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/2556716" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="355"></iframe></p>
<p>In an interview Shannon Cooper, who runs the business, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our values are not only relevant to us but to our customers as well. We not only think about the things the company values but what our customers value as well. We use technology as a way of bringing people together.”</p>
<p>“If we have those values and if they are available to our customers, the business by default will be successful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He says the manifesto was a document that was not developed as part of a strategy. It evolved naturally “rather than something we wrote on a weekend.”</p>

<p>Many corporate communication plans fail to convey something fundamental to a company&#8217;s operations: its <a title="Stand out in a crowded market through corporate value statements" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/stand-out-in-a-crowded-market-through-corporate-value-statements/" target="_blank">values</a>.

</a>

<p>Today’s leaders are confronted with a world that is in transformation:</p>
<ul>
<li>With new economies that are emerging</li>
<li>With markets that are rapidly changing</li>
<li>With new technologies that generate new products, services, communication means</li>
<li>With revolutionary changes in connectivity (between societies, market places, companies, and people).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of it has a <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">strong impact on companies</a> and their leaders. But many companies and leaders <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">struggle with this reality</a>. Whether they are involved in mergers and acquisitions, or in global expansion and are coping with other cultural behaviors, rules and <a title="Stand out in a crowded market through corporate value statements" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/stand-out-in-a-crowded-market-through-corporate-value-statements/" target="_blank">values</a>. Whether they are dealing with <a title="Wake up call – change or fade away" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/customer-service/wake-up-call-change-or-fade-away/" target="_blank">customers that are becoming much more informed</a>, aware and demanding with respect to topics like customer service, quality, <a title="Wake up call – is your company the next target" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/leadership/wake-up-call-is-your-company-the-next-target/" target="_blank">corporate responsibility and sustainability</a>. Whether they are confronted with new generations of talented employees that have totally <a title="Build organizations that are fit for the future" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/build-organizations-that-are-fit-for-the-future/" target="_blank">different views on job</a>, workplace, and work/life balance.</p>
<p><span id="more-10279"></span>When confronted with these changes, leaders tend to try hard to stick to success formulas of the past. And the more explicit the change presents itself, the stronger this reflex tends to be. They try to extend the current situation as much as possible. They let themselves be dazzled by &#8220;positive results&#8221; and avoid looking at negative signals. They regard the change as negative or dangerous. They block critical thinking. They ignore facts. And it becomes worse when they are led by ego.</p>
<p>The consequences of this type of blindness can be serious. Not being able to let go of your past, of your past success, of clinging on to it, almost always creates Win-Lose situations. It is blocking the opportunity to develop and grow. The power of successful leaders is that they recognize well in advance when change is going to take place and innovation is needed. They explicitly open up to the unknown, to new influences and cultures. They lead the way in letting go of what was. They focus on creating Win-Win situations.</p>
<p>Not being able to let go of certain things can have serious consequences:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The story goes that the hunters put an apple in a glass jar with a narrow opening and leave the jar deep into the jungle under a tree. In the evening the monkeys come out of the trees triggered by the alluring fragrance of the apple. They find the jar by following their noses. As soon as a monkey sees the apple in the jar it doesn’t hesitate and puts a hand in and grabs the apple. But when it tries to pull the hand out it gets stuck in the neck of the jar because holding the apple makes the hand too big for the neck. The monkey is caught in an agonizing dilemma: letting go of the apple and having its hand back, or trying over and over to pull the hand and the apple out of the jar. The desire for the apple wins … In the morning when the hunters return they find the jar with the monkey next to it on the ground, exhausted.  Its hand still stuck in the jar. Too exhausted to fight the hunters, too tired to flee. An easy prey.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The best-performing companies know that an <a title="20 tips to improve employee engagement and performance" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/20-tips-to-improve-employee-engagement-and-performance/" target="_blank">employee engagement</a> improvement strategy linked to the achievement of corporate goals will help them win in the marketplace.</p>
<p>But if managers want to build <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">high-performing organizations</a>, they need to address <a title="5 key elements in shaping company culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/5-key-elements-in-shaping-company-culture/" target="_blank">culture</a> change.</p>
<p>High-performance organizations do not take their <a title="10 key lessons from culture change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/10-key-lessons-from-culture-change/" target="_blank">culture</a> for granted. They plan it, monitor it and manage it so that it remains aligned with they want to achieve. Do remember the famous words of Peter Drucker: “<em><strong>Culture eats strategy for breakfast</strong></em>“.</p>
<p>A lack of employee engagement is fatal says Geoffrey Moore, venture partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures and author of &#8220;Escape Velocity.&#8221; He spoke at a Churchill Club event called Igniting Innovation and Mastering Change:</p>

<p><a title="Is constant change the new normal" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/business-improvement/is-constant-change-the-new-normal/" target="_blank">Change is an inevitable</a> part of the modern business environment. But change rarely comes easily.</p>
<p>Organizations, and the people within them, must constantly <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">re-invent themselves to remain competitive</a>. As a result, today’s leaders must do more than manage the status quo – leaders must be champions in <a title="Is change readiness the new change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/is-change-readiness-the-new-change-management/" target="_blank">change readiness</a> – the ability to continuously initiate and respond to change in ways that create advantage, minimize risk, and sustain <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">performance</a>.</p>
<p>Here are 14 tips:</p>
<p><span id="more-9659"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Resistance to change </strong></span>- Expecting <a title="12 reasons why people resist change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/12-reasons-why-people-resist-change/" target="_blank">resistance to change</a> and planning for it from the start of your change management progamme will allow you to effectively manage objections. Understanding the most common reasons people object to change gives you the opportunity to plan your change strategy to address these factors</li>
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>A sense of urgency</strong></span> &#8211; Failure to create a strong <a title="Change management need a sense of urgency" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-need-a-sense-of-urgency/" target="_blank">sense of urgency</a> causes a change movement to lose momentum before it gets a chance to start. Establishing a true sense of urgency without creating an emergency is the first objective achieved to overcome the routine of daily business</li>
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Build an emotional and rational case for change</strong></span> &#8211; Many leaders excel at <a title="Build an emotional and rational case for change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/build-an-emotional-and-rational-case-for-change/" target="_blank">building the rational case for change</a>, but they are less adept in appealing to <a title="Change management require a compelling story" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-require-a-compelling-story/" target="_blank">people’s emotional core</a>. Yet the employees’ emotions are where the momentum for real transformation ultimately lies</li>
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Change management require that people feel the problem</strong></span> &#8211; Before you can get buy-in, <a title="Change management require that people feel the problem" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-require-that-people-feel-the-problem/" target="_blank">people need to feel the problem</a>. People aren’t going to consider anything until they are convinced there is a problem that truly needs to be addressed</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Involve the people</span></strong> &#8211; Whenever an organization imposes new things on people there will be difficulties. <a title="Successful change management involve the people" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/successful-change-management-involve-the-people/" target="_blank">Participation, involvement and open, early, full communication</a> are the important factors</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Increase engagement by asking questions</span></strong> &#8211; Have you ever been “talked at” instead of had someone “talk with”? It doesn’t feel good to have someone talk at you. It leaves you feeling like you might as well not have been there at all. It is much more powerful asking questions. <a title="When leading change increase engagement by asking questions" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/when-leading-change-increase-engagement-by-asking-questions/" target="_blank">Increase engagement by asking questions</a> when leading change</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">How to deliver bad news in connection with change</span></strong> &#8211; Delivering bad news is one of the biggest challenges managers face. How can you <a title="How to deliver bad news in connection with change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/how-to-deliver-bad-news-in-connection-with-change/" target="_blank">deliver bad news in a way that minimizes the damage</a>: Don’t wait too long – do it as soon as possible, give them the big picture, speak candidly and plan for questions</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Culture an important part of change management</span></strong> &#8211; All change in organizations is challenging, but perhaps the most daunting is <a title="Culture an important part of change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/culture-an-important-part-of-change-management/" target="_blank">changing culture</a>. But if managers want to build <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">high-performing organizations</a>, they need to address <a title="10 key lessons from culture change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/10-key-lessons-from-culture-change/" target="_blank">culture change</a></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Storytelling</span></strong> &#8211; <a title="Storytelling an important part of change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/storytelling-an-important-part-of-change-management/" target="_blank">Storytelling</a> can be a powerful tool when you want to drive organizational change. Good leaders tell stories that “cast” them and their organizations as agents of change, rather than defenders of the status quo.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Change old habit</span></strong> &#8211; Sustaining success depends on an organization’s ability to adapt to a changing environment – whether it’s an external change, such as a transformative technology or a changing economy, or an internal one, such as a <a title="Change management require changing employees old habits" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-require-changing-employees-old-habits/" target="_blank">restructuring or key process overhaul</a></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Change require breaking down silos</span></strong> &#8211; Business silos, just like agricultural silos hold something important and make it hard to get at. That’s good when you’re protecting wheat and corn from rain &amp; snow. But it’s bad when you’re trying to <a title="Change require breaking down silos" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-require-breaking-down-silos/" target="_blank">change across departments and divisions</a>. And the bigger the company the more harmful a role silos play. Silos create an environment where sharing and collaborating for anything other than one silo’s special interests is virtually impossible.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Communication is paramount when it comes to change management</span></strong> &#8211; Lots of it. Change is unsettling because it brings with it an element of uncertainty. And it is the uncertainty which is a major cause of <a title="12 reasons why people resist change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management/12-reasons-why-people-resist-change/" target="_blank">resistance  to change</a>. People can relate to facts – good or bad – but uncertainty and contradicting messages breed unease and resistance. Therefore, it is important to <a title="Communication is paramount when it comes to change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/communication-is-paramount-when-it-comes-to-change-management/" target="_blank">communicate with everybody about everything</a> in relation to the upcoming changes in order to reduce the uncertainty. Use any <a title="Internal communication an important part of any change management process" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management/internal-communication-an-important-part-of-any-change-management-process/" target="_blank">communication channels</a> available and remember that it is impossible to over-communicate  change</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Use social media</span></strong> &#8211; <a title="How to use social media for change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/how-to-use-social-media-for-change-management/" target="_blank">Social media platforms</a> are ideal mechanisms to facilitate change because much of change management boils down to ongoing conversations and dialogue in a company</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Change management and the power of small wins</span></strong> &#8211; Large change management problems are best broken down into smaller ones with <a title="Change management and the power of small wins" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/business-improvement/change-management-and-the-power-of-small-wins/" target="_blank"> concrete achievable goals</a>. Otherwise it can be so overwhelming that solutions seem unattainable – therefore, people often avoid tackling them or come up with single, grand programs that fail. Don’t forget to <a title="Do you want something to grow" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/do-you-want-something-to-grow/" target="_blank">pour champagne on it</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Companies most likely to be successful in making change work to their advantage are the ones that no longer view change as a discrete event, but as a <a title="Is change readiness the new change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/is-change-readiness-the-new-change-management/" target="_blank">constant opportunity to evolve the business</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/innovation/green-lamp-2.jpg" title="Innovation, Torben Rick" class="shutterset_singlepic307" >
	<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-right" src="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/cache/307__300x220_green-lamp-2.jpg" alt="Innovation - Green Lamp 2" title="Innovation - Green Lamp 2" />
</a>

<p>We live in a business world <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">accelerating at a dizzying speed</a> and teeming with <a title="Change before the competition force you to change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-before-the-competition-force-you-to-change/" target="_blank">ruthless competition</a>.</p>
<p>As most of the <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">tangible advantages of the past have become</a><a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank"> commodities</a>, creativity has become the currency of success.</p>
<p>A 2010 study of 1,500 CEOs indicated that leaders rank creativity as number one leadership attribute needed for prosperity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creativity is the most important leadership quality, according to CEOs. Standouts practice and encourage experimentation and innovation throughout their organisations.</p>
<p>Facing a world becoming dramatically more complex, it is interesting that CEOs selected creativity as the most important leadership attribute. Creative leaders invite disruptive innovation, encourage others to drop outdated approaches and take balanced risks. They are open-minded and inventive in expanding their management and communication styles, particularly to engage with a new generation of employees, partners and customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, many companies fail to unleash their most valuable resources: human creativity, imagination, and original thinking. They lack a systematic approach to <a title="10 key lessons from culture change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/10-key-lessons-from-culture-change/" target="_blank">building a culture</a> of innovation, and then wonder why they keep getting beaten to the punch.</p>
<p>Obstacles that will need to be addressed if you expect to establish a sustainable <a title="5 key elements in shaping company culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/5-key-elements-in-shaping-company-culture/" target="_blank">culture</a> of innovation:</p>

<li>Unwillingness to change in the absence of a <a title="Change management need a sense of urgency" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-need-a-sense-of-urgency/" target="_blank">burning platform</a></li>

<li>Absence of user-friendly idea management processes</li>
<li>Innovation not part of the performance review process</li>
<li>Lack of skillful brainstorm facilitation</li>
<li>No creative thinking training</li>

<p>Good luck!</p>

</a>

<p>We are living in interesting times indeed. Geo-political revolutions throughout the Arab world, social justice protests in Israel, the tsunami in Japan that disrupted many global supply chains, financial crises and economic uncertainty,</p>
<p>And we live in a business world <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">accelerating at a dizzying speed</a> and teeming with <a title="Change before the competition force you to change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-before-the-competition-force-you-to-change/" target="_blank">ruthless competition</a>.</p>
<p>But that is not the only challenge the business world is facing. Customers are voicing their opinions about companies they do business with, as constituents voice their displeasure about the poor job their leaders are doing on their behalf.</p>
<p><span id="more-10169"></span>The following incidents caught executives by surprise as specific cries against corporate actions rallied the hearts, minds, and activity of thousands in revolt against insensitive corporate interests.</p>
<ul>
<li>BP &#8211; the Deepwater Horizon <a title="Surviving a corporate image nightmare" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/social-media/surviving-a-corporate-image-nightmare/" target="_blank">oil spill</a></li>

</ul>
<p>What’s perhaps most interesting is that these recent revolutions and crises are being fueled and enabled by the reach and connectedness of internet based social media.</p>
<p>So the question is, will your organization lead the next revolution in your marketplace, empowering and giving voice to the latent motivations of your customers, or will it become a victim of a more agile, more united group of customers who will self organize around their collective needs and jobs, leaving your outdated organization in their wake?</p>

</a>

<p>Some say the traditional organizational hierarchy is soon history and we end up facing  with something completely new, a <a title="Build organizations that are fit for the future" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/build-organizations-that-are-fit-for-the-future/" target="_blank">new way of how businesses communicate and create value</a>.</p>
<p>In a Wall Street Journal article, “<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704476104575439723695579664.html" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">The End of Management</a>,” Alan Murray makes a compelling argument that “modern management is nearing its existential moment.”  He focuses on the last 100 years or so when large organizations developed to organize people and allocate resources for tasks that seemingly could be done much more effectively than individuals contracting with each other.</p>
<p><span id="more-9980"></span>One of the responsibilities of many, if not most, of the people in these organizations is to increase certainty or predictability with the intention of increasing quality and on time, on budget, performance.  An unintended consequence of those efforts is to <a title="Corporate change under pressure" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/corporate-change-under-pressure/" target="_blank">make the organizations resistant to change</a> and seemingly even resistant to the <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">dynamics of the market itself</a>.</p>
<p>As the rate of <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">change and market disruption accelerates</a> to the pace we see today with the advent of things like social networking and smart phones, this sets up “a destructive clash between whirlwind change and corporate inertia.“ Murray argues that some of the classic failures of once market-leading companies has not been a result of “’bad management,” but because they follow the dictates of ‘good’ management. They listened closely to their customers. They studied market trends. They allocated capital to the innovations that promised the largest returns. And in the process they missed the <a title="Build organizations that are fit for the future" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/build-organizations-that-are-fit-for-the-future/" target="_blank">disruptive innovations</a>.</p>
<p>Now, with the advent of instant worldwide communication, essentially free information, and the ability of large numbers of people to organize and collaborate without hierarchy, creativity and innovation can move far more rapidly than it can through a traditional organization.</p>
<p>What the future with mass collaboration will look like, no one knows for sure. But with the “modern” management becoming eventually obsolete, managers should understand the value of such culture that is willing to adapt new ways of working, is using innovatingly technology in business processes and boldness to experiment.</p>

<a href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/values/core-values.png" title="" class="shutterset_singlepic361" >
	<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-right" src="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/cache/361__300x220_core-values.png" alt="core-values" title="core-values" />
</a>

<p>For many businesses, corporate value statements are little more than vague motherhood statements that sound nice but bear little relation to way business is done.</p>
<p>Recent <a title="Companies in crisis need to build trust with the public" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/leadership/companies-in-crisis-need-to-build-trust-with-the-public/" target="_blank">high-profile scandals and crises</a> have made it clear that many businesses do not properly or openly communicate their values.</p>
<p>Just look at how The News of the World <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/phone-hacking" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">phone-hacking scandal</a> has exposed News Corp. to accusations over the company&#8217;s values and the efficacy of its leadership. Had the company more openly communicated what it stands for and the moral compass its employees follow, it likely would not have been vilified so thoroughly in the press. Despite numerous protestations from Rupert Murdoch and his top lieutenants that the company&#8217;s values align perfectly with the public&#8217;s best interests, the damage has been done. The public is left questioning what, if anything, does this company stand for?</p>
<p><span id="more-10016"></span>Even NewsCorp. purports to have values, but like many other companies it fails to effectively communicate them to the outside world. Having strong corporate values is admirable, but values without proactive employee communication of their importance might as well not exist.</p>
<p>But that’s not that case in every business. For a number of companies, corporate value statements have become real business drivers that help their companies stand out in a crowded market. They say values aren’t just window dressing, they attract customers and help retain staff.</p>
<p>Just ask Tony Hsieh, the American entrepreneur who founded the e-tailer Zappos which was sold of Amazon in 2009 for $928 million in stock. In a space of just 10 years, Zappos had grown from almost no sales to more than $ 1 billion in annual revenue. This was driven primarily by repeat customers and word of mouth.</p>

<a href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/values/zappos-core-values.png" title="" class="shutterset_singlepic364" >
	<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-right" src="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/cache/364__320x240_zappos-core-values.png" alt="zappos-core-values" title="zappos-core-values" />
</a>

<p>Zappos has 10 core values:</p>
<p>1. Deliver WOW through service<br />
2. Embrace and drive change<br />
3. Create fun and a little weirdness<br />
4. Be adventurous, creative, and open-minded<br />
5. Pursue growth and learning<br />
6. Build open and honest relationships with communication<br />
7. Build a positive team and family spirit<br />
8. Do more with less<br />
9. Be passionate and determined<br />
10. Be humble</p>
<p>In an interview Hsieh said that the values were important to keep the company focused as it grew.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we moved the company to Vegas, we were hiring a lot of people very quickly due to our rapid growth. It wasn&#8217;t scalable for us to be involved with every new hire decision, but the problem was that because we had so many new employees, not everyone knew exactly what we were looking for when we said we were looking for a culture fit,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Someone from our legal department suggested that we come up with a list of core values to serve as a guide for managers to make hiring decisions. I thought about all the employees I wanted to clone because they represented the Zappos culture well, and tried to figure out what values they personified. I also thought about all the employees and ex-employees who were not culture fits, and tried to figure out where there was a values disconnect.”</p>
<p>“Even though our core values guide us in everything we do today, we didn&#8217;t actually have any formal core values for the first six or seven years of the company&#8217;s history. It&#8217;s my fault that we didn&#8217;t do it in the early years, because it was something I&#8217;d always thought of as a very &#8220;corporate&#8221; thing to do. I resisted doing it for as long as possible.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m just glad that an employee finally convinced me that it was necessary to come up with core values &#8211; essentially, a formalised definition of our culture &#8211; in order for us to continue to scale and grow.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What can businesses do to better communicate their values? A few key ideas to keep in mind:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Establish core values across the company, not just within management</span> &#8211; </strong>If management sets values, who would own them? You need buy-in from employees; they have to feel a certain ownership over value creation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Develop a values communications plan</span> -</strong> Employee communications has to be at the forefront of your value-setting agenda; too often, executives fail to proactively seek employee input and buy-in <em>before</em> values are put in place. This leads to antipathy and resentment among those employees who don&#8217;t feel a company&#8217;s values align with their personal and professional aspirations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Live your values</span> &#8211;</strong>Embrace the corporate values and be mindful of them in every decision you make &#8211; both in good and bad times. Never forget that actions speak louder than words.</p>

</a>

<p>Businesses to consumer industries are facing tremendous changes in the way <a title="Is there anybody out there" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/customer-service/is-there-anybody-out-there/" target="_blank">customers wish to be served</a>. This puts a lot of pressure on management to understand that if the consumer’s or customer’s way of behavior changes, this means that the company’s <a title="The impact of bad customer service experience" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/customer-service/the-impact-of-bad-customer-service-experience/" target="_blank">customer service</a> needs to change.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing process and it will not stop or vanish. The evolution of communication will only speed up. With pervasive video, social media, mobile applications we build on ongoing story throughout the customer relationship lifecycle.</p>
<p>I as a consumer wish to be recognized by the service provider, I need to trust my service provider and it is even better if I can recognize the person serving me. With all the digital communication channels and choises, it is still the relationship between the service provider and the customer that counts.</p>
<p><span id="more-9851"></span>So what are we looking at? We have the customers who are young, know their way around the social media, have more money than before, request high quality personal customer service. There are a lot of requests, but at the end it’s the consumer who is at the driver’s seat so the cold fact for the company is to change or fade away.</p>
<p>In today’s <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">competitive landscape</a>, customer service is more important than ever. A company’s reputation for satisfying their customers has never been so valuable.</p>

<p>Business silos can occur in global corporations or start-up ventures with just a few employees. And no matter the size, they are detrimental to an organization’s ability to succeed in a <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">rapidly changing world</a>.</p>
<p>Business silos, just like agricultural silos hold something important and make it hard to get at. That&#8217;s good when you&#8217;re protecting wheat and corn from rain &amp; snow.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s bad when you&#8217;re trying to change across departments and divisions. And the bigger the company the more harmful a role silos play. Silos create an environment where sharing and collaborating for anything other than one silo&#8217;s special interests is virtually impossible.</p>
<p><span id="more-9771"></span>Remember! Companies don&#8217;t change because they want to. They <a title="Change before the competition force you to change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-before-the-competition-force-you-to-change/" target="_blank">change because they are forced</a> to by customers, by competition, by advances in science and technology and by government regulation.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t work unless leadership leads and helps everyone understand why change must happen and why they need to work together in new and different ways toward a common goal.</p>
<p><a title="Change management require a compelling story" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-require-a-compelling-story/" target="_blank">Creating a compelling case for change</a> is a critical step in breaking down silos. Try to guess who said the following, and when:</p>
<blockquote><p>It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success nor dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, this lukewarmness arising partly from fear of their adversaries, who have the laws in their favor, and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who does not truly believe in anything new until they have had experience of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice how so much of what <a title="12 reasons why people resist change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/12-reasons-why-people-resist-change/" target="_blank">resists change</a> is embedded in the <a title="5 key elements in shaping company culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/5-key-elements-in-shaping-company-culture/" target="_blank">culture</a>, in protecting what is rather than getting excited about what could be. The quote was from Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli, in 1513. And not much has changed in 500 years! Only by inspiring the entire organization with a compelling case for <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">why it needs to change</a> in order to insure the future health and growth of the enterprise &#8230; and job security (what&#8217;s in it for me?) will anyone be willing to play with speculation, risk-taking and newness.</p>
<p>A siloed organization cannot act quickly on opportunities that arise in a fast-paced business landscape, nor is it able to make productive decisions about <a title="Corporate change under pressure" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/corporate-change-under-pressure/" target="_blank">how to change</a> in order to seize these opportunities.</p>
<p>Is silos a big issue in your organization?</p>

</a>

<p>What does it take to build a strong culture? That&#8217;s a tough question.</p>
<p>Too many organisations go about the wrong way in creating corporate culture change. That probably explained why many of the corporate culture <a title="Managing change has to be a core competence" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/managing-change-has-to-be-a-core-competence/" target="_blank">change initiatives failed</a> or that that they cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>It is not too surprising that many leaders and managers doubt whether it is possible to change corporate culture in the first place. But it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Successful organisations have corporate culture aligned to their visions, mission, strategies, goals and their environment. It is generally agreed that the purpose of corporate culture is to develop an internal environment that is conducive for people to perform effectively</li>
<li><span id="more-9705"></span>To get a buy in of corporate culture change requires a <a title="Build an emotional and rational case for change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/build-an-emotional-and-rational-case-for-change/" target="_blank">strong rationale</a>. It is true that most culture change takes a lot of effort and time to overcome <a title="12 reasons why people resist change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/12-reasons-why-people-resist-change/" target="_blank">resistance</a>. An effective way to <a title="14 key elements in reducing resistance to change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/14-key-elements-in-reducing-resistance-to-change/" target="_blank">overcome resistance</a> is provide a strong, compelling and sound rationale for the culture change</li>
<li>Effective corporate culture change must begin with <a title="Change management require changing employees old habits" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-require-changing-employees-old-habits/" target="_blank">changing mindsets</a>. No change can be implemented without first a change in mindset. Changing mindsets is about eliminating unproductive habits or work practices that do not add value to the individual or the organisation. It is about inculcating a positive attitude towards oneself, work, people, the management and the organisation as a whole</li>
<li>To achieve credibility and win commitment of people, policies, procedures and practices must be consistent with the new culture. Consistency is an important factor in gaining credibility of any change program</li>
<li>To ensure company wide culture assimilation, culture change programmes should utilise various culture transmission mechanisms available. To succeed in culture change, there must be prevalent practices of behaviour that reflect the new culture</li>
<li>To achieve deep and sustainable culture change, requires participative approach. Culture change is by nature a deep and fundamental change. Such a change requires not just opening up minds but also touching hearts</li>
<li>The commitment of top management is essential for the <a title="5 key elements in shaping company culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/5-key-elements-in-shaping-company-culture/" target="_blank">success of culture change</a>. The success of culture change requires company-wide acceptance. To have company-wide practice of new corporate culture requires the commitment of top management</li>
<li>To speed up culture change leverage on &#8220;opinion leaders&#8221; Every resource is needed to help speed up the culture change process. A good way to tap into the organisation resource is seek out &#8220;opinion leaders&#8221; to assist in promoting the new culture. Opinion leaders can be formal or informal leaders whose opinion matters to others</li>
<li>Create a powerful dream of the new culture. Every great achievement starts with a powerful dream. There is a compelling force of change in creating a powerful dream. And great changes come from powerful dreams. It should come across as exciting, inspiring and worthwhile for everybody in the organisation</li>
<li>Recognise and <a title="Change management and the power of small wins" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/business-improvement/change-management-and-the-power-of-small-wins/" target="_blank">reinforce change success</a> early and frequently. A culture change is on ongoing process and may take a long time to see tangible results. Too often leaders wait too long before they start to recognise, <a title="Do you want something to grow" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/do-you-want-something-to-grow/" target="_blank">reward or reinforce</a> the motivation of people in the process of implementing culture change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</a>

<p>Many organizations spent the last two decades learning not to see change as a danger or challenge, but as an <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">opportunity to manage it to their competitive advantage</a>.</p>
<p>But despite this positive spin, it’s relatively rare for <a title="Managing change has to be a core competence" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/managing-change-has-to-be-a-core-competence/" target="_blank">change management programs to succeed</a>, many surveys, put the success rate at less than 40 percent.<a name="footnote1up" href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Corporate_transformation_under_pressure_2308#footnote1"></a></p>
<p>Many companies find it hard to <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">transform themselves in difficult circumstances</a>. These defensive transformations have lower success rates than progressive ones &#8211; launched, for instance, to boost growth or to move from good to great performance.</p>
<p>This seems to contradict the common wisdom that it is hardest to transform a company when it lacks an <a title="Change management need a sense of urgency" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/change-management-need-a-sense-of-urgency/" target="_blank">acute and apparent need for change</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-9505"></span>Consider the term &#8220;change management.&#8221; It immediately frames change as something new and different that must be managed. Many people add to this the fear of what the change might mean to them personally, which can create actual <a title="Is change readiness the new change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/is-change-readiness-the-new-change-management/" target="_blank">resistance to the change</a>. In addition, when you label a change effort a &#8220;change initiative,&#8221; you put the focus on achieving the change itself, not day-to-day work.</p>
</div>
<p>In contrast to the static and responsive approach of change management , where change is positioned as an event to be undertaken, a <a title="Is change readiness the new change management" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/is-change-readiness-the-new-change-management/" target="_blank">change readiness</a> approach is dynamic and proactive, positioning change simply as business as usual. It frames change as something that is present every day. Actions that support an organization in becoming change-ready include equipping people and improving systems and processes in order to build change awareness, change agility, change reaction, and change mechanisms &#8211; all of which, when used in concert, enable the company to effectively initiate and respond to change on a continuous basis.</p>
<p>Changing the way you communicate and position change has the potential to transform the way change is perceived and embraced across your organization. Why fight the uphill battle of trying to communicate, develop and inspire your people toward making a change, when you can communicate, develop and inspire people toward making the organization &#8211; and themselves &#8211; the best in the business?</p>
<p>How does your company communicate change? Was your last change effort successful?</p>

<p>The <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">best-performing</a> companies know that an <a title="20 tips to improve employee engagement and performance" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/20-tips-to-improve-employee-engagement-and-performance/" target="_blank">employee engagement</a> improvement strategy linked to the achievement of corporate goals will help them win in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Performance objectives are an amazingly effective management technique for improving employee performance and job satisfaction. Why? Because … research shows us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>When employees have clear objectives with <strong></strong>effective measures their performance <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>improves</li>
<li>Team members who know what’s <strong></strong>expected of them are found to be both more productive and profitable with higher satisfaction ratings than those who don’t</li>
<li>Employees who reported feeling lack of any real commitment to their job, gave the main reason for this as not knowing what was expected of them</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-9509"></span>Don’t make the mistake many managers make by assuming your employees know what’s expected of them. Perhaps they should… but they often don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your employees will struggle to give you what you want if they are unclear about your expectations. This causes so much frustration in the workplace, time and again one hear unhappy employees say, “I just want to know what my boss wants from me. Why doesn’t he/she just tell me?”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By agreeing on performance objectives with your employees you’re putting the foundation stones in place to ensure effective employee management. Without them you’ll struggle to give your employees the feedback they want and indeed, need.</li>
</ul>
<p title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture">Successful measurement systems – systems that energize and actually do what they’re supposed to do, which is boost performance – is often hard to find. Do a little performance measurement of your own: Assess it against this checklist.</p>

<p>For targets to be meaningful and effective in motivating employees, they must be <a title="Connect employee goals to larger company goals" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/business-improvement/connect-employee-goals-to-larger-company-goals/" target="_blank">tied to larger organizational ambitions</a>. Employees who don’t understand the roles they play in company success are more likely to become disengaged. No matter what level the employee is at, he should be able to articulate exactly how his efforts feed into the broader company strategy.</p>
<p>Do remember that there is a <a title="The fine line between good stretch targets and bad ones" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/the-fine-line-between-good-stretch-targets-and-bad-ones/" target="_blank">fine line between good stretch targets</a>, which can energize an organization, and bad ones, which can dampen morale.</p>

	<img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-left" src="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/wp-content/gallery/cache/357__280x200_yellow-warning-sign-of-bad-weather.jpg" alt="Yellow warning sign of bad weather" title="Yellow warning sign of bad weather" />
</a>

<p>Why can some companies <a title="How to take advantage of any change the market brings" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/business-improvement/how-to-take-advantage-of-any-change-the-market-brings/" target="_blank">take advantage of any change the market brings</a>, while <a title="Wake up call – disruption is rampant" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/wake-up-call-disruption-is-rampant/" target="_blank">others struggle</a> with the even the smallest internal or market-necessitated modification? The reasons why will differ for each organization, but the question is definitely worth asking &#8211; especially in light of the fact that the pace of change is <a title="Surviving disruption in an age where competition comes from anywhere" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/surviving-disruption-in-an-age-where-competition-comes-from-anywhere/" target="_blank">accelerating at the fastest rate</a> in recorded history.</p>
<p>Companies most likely to be successful in making change work to their advantage are the ones that no longer view change as a discrete event to be managed, but as a constant opportunity to evolve the business. So is change readiness is the new <a title="12 important elements for successful change management effort" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/12-important-elements-for-successful-change-management-effort/" target="_blank">change management?</a> Change readiness is the ability to continuously initiate and respond to change in ways that create advantage, minimize risk, and <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">sustain performance</a>.</p>
<p>Sustaining success depends on an organization’s ability to adapt to a changing environment – whether it’s an external change, such as a transformative technology or a changing economy, or an internal one, such as a restructuring or key process overhaul. Unfortunately, <a title="Managing change has to be a core competence" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/managing-change-has-to-be-a-core-competence/" target="_blank">60-70% of organizational transformations fail</a> &#8211; a dismal statistic validated by study after study. Failure rates this high demand a new mindset and new actions:</p>
<p><span id="more-3482"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Change awareness </strong></h2>
<p>Change Awareness is a company&#8217;s ability to redefine itself as necessary. This contextual focus is critical to innovation &#8211; the right product at the right time. Good change awareness practices include scanning the environment for opportunities, focusing on emerging trends and planning for the future. Does your company have people responsible for regularly assessing the market for new opportunities and market changes? Does your company proactively search for opportunities for brand renewal and product innovation?</p>
<h2><strong>Change agility </strong></h2>
<p>Change agility represents your company&#8217;s ability to <a title="Successful change management involve the people" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/successful-change-management-involve-the-people/" target="_blank">engage people in pending changes</a>. This is an internal focus that is critical to the company&#8217;s ability to effectively implement identified innovations. A great idea won&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t muster the capacity and commitment to carry it through. An organization with good change agility has the capacity to stretch when necessary and quickly shift resources to the place they will make the most difference. <a title="Is there enough leadership in todays business world" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/is-there-enough-leadership-in-todays-business-world/" target="_blank">Leadership</a> should inspire confidence and trust, and consistently. How agile is your company? How effective are your managers at engaging and delivering the changes envisioned by your decision makers? How well does your company actually facilitate and execute on change when it is needed?</p>
<h2><strong>Change reaction </strong></h2>
<p>Change reaction is the ability to appropriately analyze problems, assess risks, and <a title="12 reasons why people resist change" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/12-reasons-why-people-resist-change/" target="_blank">manage the reactions of employees</a>. This internal focus ensures your company can sustain the day-to-day business while reacting in a timely and appropriate manner to self-initiated and market-dictated change. How effectively do you and other leaders at your company assess risk and manage unplanned change? How well does your organization react and respond to crisis?</p>
<h2><strong>Change mechanisms </strong></h2>
<p>Change Mechanisms should encourage <a title="10 key elements in creating a high performance culture" href="http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/performance-management/10-key-elements-in-creating-a-high-performance-culture/" target="_blank">clear goal alignment across functions</a>, the ability to integrate a change into existing systems, accountability for results, and reward systems that reinforce desired change behaviors. This contextual focus is critical to the ability to implement desired change with no interruption to daily operation. Are your structures and systems flexible enough to adapt and support the implementation of change? Does your organization have the structures and systems in place to support the successful implementation of change?</p>
