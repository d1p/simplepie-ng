I haven't posted anything in a while. I should get better about updating this thing regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, there's just really nothin that interesting going on.&lt;br /&gt;Work is just kinda floatin by until the database and mainframe changes next year.&lt;br /&gt;Home front is still clockwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really sure if I'm self-involved enough to post my opinions on the state of the world. I mean do you really want to hear them? Really? What weight would they carry? Basically I believe, we're fucked. We've been fucked for a long time. We won't be un-fucked until there's some sort of massive cultural revolution. Something big will have to happen to break our hyper-media hypnosis and the ones fucking us will be damned if they let that happen. That, or they would figure out a way to package and sell us our own disgust. Hell, we'd probably pay top dollar for it too if they put Steve Jobs in charge of marketing. "The new iComplacency. Now with GPS. Get yours today!"&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=UCE&amp;amp;q=will+the+election+really+change+anything%3F&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;election &lt;/a&gt; will change things as much as people hope it will. But it's good to have hope I guess&lt;br /&gt;Blech... enough of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to Sean and Greta's visit soon and my subsequent trip to their Halloween party next month. We need some visitors down here. Knoxville's a decent sized city but we really don't get out much. Hell, I think our baby-laden friends get out more than we do. We really should change that and get out and meet some new people. It's hard though with my schedule being all wonky and both of us having a sort of shy nature. I'll put that on the to do list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headin to the &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;hs=WXt&amp;amp;q=watts%20bar%20lake&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;lake &lt;/a&gt; in the morning after work. Gonna power nap it there and watch some &lt;a href="http://www.titansonline.com/"&gt; football &lt;/a&gt;, play with the dogs, watch some movies on the porch. Try and clear my head and get back on track with some things before the madness of the impending holidays hits. Maybe I can get myself to get through a programming book without falling asleep five pages in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving into Athens on Monday to renew my tags. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to give up my National Guard tags since they no longer own my ass. It's not like they gave me free parking or anything, but I'm pretty sure some cops looked the other way at some of my vehicular transgressions. I do live in the south you know. It's just another sign that that part of my life is behind me.&lt;br /&gt;Although some of it really never leaves. I've been playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft"&gt;Airsoft &lt;/a&gt; with some of the security guards at night on some of the closed off floors of the hospital. It's a good way to pass the time at night and practice some of the tactical shit I learned in the military. Like, little plastic balls hurtling at you at 300 feet per second really fucking sting at close range. Don't get shot at close range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some sleep&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7177791801938757900-4686853848469514950?l=mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com/feeds/4686853848469514950/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7177791801938757900&amp;postID=4686853848469514950' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7177791801938757900/posts/default/4686853848469514950'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7177791801938757900/posts/default/4686853848469514950'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com/2008/09/slppe-tactics.html' title='sleep tactics'/><author><name>Mekanix Labs</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12526278126918540784</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7177791801938757900.post-26083486994848233</id><published>2008-09-03T01:56:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2008-09-03T02:52:39.006-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='world domination'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chrome'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='browser wars'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='google'/><title type='text'>So, how long till Google changes their name to Skynet?</title><content type='html'>Testing out the new &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; browser by Google. So far so good. It runs pretty lean and has a few nifty tricks up it's sleeves. Not really sure if it will ever replace &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/"&gt;FF&lt;/a&gt; for me though. I'm still pretty attached to all my extensions (especially my &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748"&gt; Greasemonkey&lt;/a&gt; scripts). &lt;br /&gt;I will say this for it, it handles memory allocation really, really well. It runs multiple processor browsing so each tab in the browser gets it's own memory. If one tab crashes it doesn't kill the whole browser and you're not totally screwed. &lt;br /&gt;It's still in beta but looks pretty promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the nifty lil &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt; they created that kind of explains it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once they get all the add-ons, themes, and plug-ins worked out this thing might just give the browser wars a kick in the tuckus it needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if your still using &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHMG_enUS291&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=why+internet+explorer+sucks+ass"&gt;Internet Explorer...&lt;/a&gt; leave.

I went all the way. I've finally thrown myself headfirst into the realm of the computer nerd. I literally jumped right in. Now, don't get me wrong,I wasn't a total tech virgin. I've fumbled around in the backseat with car stereos, fingered the inner workings of turntables and mixers, hell I've even gone down on some circuit boards from time to time. But I've never really succumbed to my tech lust like I did two weeks ago. &lt;br /&gt;The hospital that I work for is currently in the process of shutting down in order to be demolished and then rebuilt in a shinier newer fashion. During this process our Information Systems department decided to update or scrap a lot of the hardware that was being used. I come in to work one night and my co-worker Chuck tells me that there's a whole bunch of monitors and towers on the loading dock and he's gonna see if there's one he can use. I figure I'll tag along and see what's what. Sure enough, there's about a dozen or so monitors and half a dozen towers, all Dell, all in working order (minus the hard drives), all free. I grab myself one of each. I figure I can slap a drive in it and start experimenting with Linux. We take a gander in to the large commercial dumpster to and it was like a chorus of nerdy angels in horn-rims started singing in 1's and 0's. Hard drives, software, laptops, wireless cards, XP installation CDs, ethernet cable, memory chips, battery backups, oh my.&lt;br /&gt;While Chuck dutifully went back to work I proceeded to spend the next two hours digging through the dumpster giggling, ooooing and ahhing with each new find.&lt;br /&gt;When I was done, I needed to smoke a cigarette and cuddle.&lt;br /&gt;I had amassed a fairly good pile of stuff and more or less had an idea with what I wanted to do with it all. Home servers, entertainment PC, hack the iPAQ and so on and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that none of this stuff is top of the line and they were probably right to throw most of it out in their budgetary mindset. But then again, they probably weren't wanting to surf the internet on the LCD TV in their living room or access their music library online either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;Booty List:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.laptopmag.com/Review/MPC-TransPort-T2300.htm?view=Print"&gt; MPC Transport T2300&lt;/a&gt; missing the CD drive and needs a new hard drive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pcworld.about.com/magazine/1907p074bid50319.htm"&gt; Compaq EVO N400C&lt;/a&gt; needs a new hard drive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pcsurplusonline.com/viewprod.cfm?ID=8898"&gt; HP Compaq Evo Port Replicator Docking Station PR1005&lt;/a&gt; works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan282005id119485.htm"&gt; MPC Client Pro 414&lt;/a&gt; needs power cord (it's a weird one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,668796,00.asp"&gt; Dell Optiplex GX260&lt;/a&gt;  up and running.

I had worked for Stokes Electrical supply company here in Knoxville for nearly three years. I liked my job. I was regarded more or less as my boss' go to guy. His "fixer",  if you will. During my tenure I had been shuffled around to various positions, returns manager, repairs and services, delivery, counter sales, inventory control, etc.. At time it could get frustrating but the majority of the time my response was "Wherever you need me to do whatever boss." Because of that, they were pretty good to me. They worked around my National Guard schedule and were fairly hands off when it came to me running whatever task my boss had me doing that month.&lt;br /&gt;Then came the housing crunch and the inevitable drop in profits that tagged along with it. There had already been some cuts made in the name of saving a buck, so when Bob asked to see me after work one evening I more or less knew I was getting axed. But like I said, they were good to me and Bob seemed damn near weepy when he was telling me that my position had been cut. I guess that's why I was so calm about it. Rather than rant and rage and threaten to come back well armed and completely out of bubblegum, I just shook his hand and told him thanks. I was laid off. First time for everything I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to steer my job hunt in the direction of tech. I mean hell, that's what the army trained me in, I might as well take advantage of it. Oh, and that was an extra kick in the pants as well. My contract with the National Guard had just expired and I had decided that after 6 years I wasn't gonna re-up. Timing, huh?&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month and I'm now working for a hospital in Downtown Knoxville as a  third shift Computer Operator in the Data Center. So far it's been great. I'm learning a lot and getting far better pay for less work than I ever didn't do for Stokes. The work itself is fairly easy, which means lots of time for patrolling the internets, video games, rebuilding and tweaking old computers that have been laying around the house. All in all, it's a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt;So, with all this free, unsupervised time what should I do? I know I'll start a blog. Rather than just ramble on with my day to day musings, I'll add some of the cool things I find on my nightly ventures through the internet and pass them along to you. Lucky bastard. I'll try to focus on useful tips, tricks and tweaks for computers that I find since that's where my focus is lately. Rest assured though, especially for those of you that know me, there will be plenty of retarded fun shit to pass the time with as well.&lt;br /&gt;for now,&lt;br /&gt;Adios&lt;br /&gt;and good luck out there.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7177791801938757900-5582448026289773628?l=mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com/feeds/5582448026289773628/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7177791801938757900&amp;postID=5582448026289773628' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7177791801938757900/posts/default/5582448026289773628'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7177791801938757900/posts/default/5582448026289773628'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://mekanicalscientist.blogspot.com/2008/08/and-so.html' title='And so...'/><author><name>Mekanix Labs</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12526278126918540784</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
