		<description><![CDATA[A key to having  a steady flow of traffic to your website is the content.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A</span><span> key to having a steady flow of traffic to your website is the quality of the content.  You and your site developer can work to make your site discoverable by including meaningful keywords in your content and having compliant code that can be easily indexed by search engines.  Your website developer/designer can maximize the usability of your site by making sure the navigation is clear.  However, what is most important for getting and keeping site visitors is the content of your website.  In short, visitors will only come to and return to your site if they have a reason. Visitors come and return to sites for content they value.  Generally, people search on the internet for information or to be entertained.</span></p>
<p><span>A successful content strategy should include three critical elements:</span></p>
<ol style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 30px; margin: 0px;">
<li style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; padding: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creating interesting content</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></strong></span></span></span><span style="background-color: transparent;"> The buzz on the internet is that you must create &#8220;remarkable&#8221; content.  What is meant by that is content your audience finds useful or entertaining and hopefully good enough that they promote it via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Buzz, Delicious etc.).</span></span></li>
<li style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; padding: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keeping content fresh</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></strong></span></span></span><span style="background-color: transparent;"> You can think of fresh content as having &#8220;evergreen&#8221; content.  The idea here is that, you need to add new content on a regular basis.  The interval for adding content needs to be frequent enough that users come back to see what you have added.</span></span></li>
<li style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; padding: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making it easy to share content</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></strong></span></span></span><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Visitors to your site need easy access to social media links.  As visitors find interesting and/or helpful content on your website they share the content using social media.  In other words they <em>remark</em> on your content.  The idea that people find your content worth <em>remark</em> is the basis for the &#8220;remarkable&#8221; content terminology.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Including a blog as part of your website gives you an easy way to include remarkable content on your site.  Most blogging platforms already include the tools you need to periodically add new content.  Every time you add content a new post is created. Also, tools that allow visitors to your site to share your content using email or social media are either included already or can be added.  These tools are assigned to each post.  By utilizing a blog framework for some or all of your site&#8217;s content you can focus on creating the content rather than the technical ins and outs of presenting it and making it promotable through social media.</span></p>
<p><span>Blogging platforms come in a number of varieties including, hosted versus self hosted, full blog versus mini blogs. In part 2 of this series of posts on blogging I will examine some of the differences in the types of blogging platforms available.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: bold;">Profile Aggregators &#8211; Introduction</span></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already have several profiles on the internet you likely soon will.  Individuals are increasingly using social media to manage their careers and to look for new jobs, as well as to interact with vendors, family and friends.  A consequence of using social media is having profiles on multiple sites. Often each profile is slightly different from the others.  The names used at times depend on whether the name you wanted was available when you set up the profile. Sometimes you would like to include other information that the particular site isn&#8217;t set up to include.  Often HR professionals and other staff of a potential employer turn to the internet to find or investigate job candidates.  If you are a consultant or you freelance, potential clients may look to the internet to gain an understanding of you, independently of your company.  Friends, acquaintances and past colleagues may try to reconnect with you by finding you on the internet.  Any or all of these reasons could lead to you wanting to more actively manage what people find on the internet about you.</p>
<p>Realistically, you can&#8217;t take full control over what results are returned when someone searches on your name on the internet.  However, you can take measures to maximize the chances that they find information you want them to find.  Ideally, if you are trying to have a consistent presence each profile you create will use the same name. However, if your name was taken before you set up your profile, or you have profiles on sites that only allow a certain number of characters, or use you email address as your user name, etc. you may not have the opportunity to have a single user name across multiple sites.  Using a profile consolidation or aggregator may allow you to claim a version of your name on a profile consolidation page.  You can  direct people to other profiles that may be a variation of your name from the consolidation page.  There are three (3) free, easy to use services available on the internet that will allow you to create a profile that makes a statement about you and allows you to link to other profiles or blogs or websites, etc. associated with you.</p>
<p>Two of the three services, About.me and Flavors.me have a graphic interface.  Both these services result in creating a landing page for your name.  They are in effect mini websites. The third is Google&#8217;s Profiles. Google Profiles are not graphic.  However, completing a Google Profile can get you listed on the first page of results returned for your name.  If you share a name with several other people on the internet, this can be very valuable.  I recommend that you setup a profile at all three locations.  The overall process is the same for each service.  You sign up; which involves claiming or reserving your name.  You fill out a bio.  You select any other sites or profiles that you want to associate with your profile.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look in a little more detail at each service.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Flavors.me</h2>
<p>Flavors.me (Flavors) is a relatively new company.  Flavors was opened to the public in February 2010.  Flavors allows anyone, regardless of skill level with programming to create an attractive, graphic, single page website.  The whole process takes between 15 &#8211; 30 minutes.  The time spent largely depends on how long it takes you to write your bio and how long you spend tweaking the background for your page.  The service&#8217;s basic features are free.  For a $20/year upgrade you can add additional features. The free version however, is very comprehensive, and it is certainly worth taking the time to set up a profile.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Flavors site you are immediately invited to sign up and to create your profile page. Creating your page involves working through a 4 section profile panel.  The sections included are About, Content, Design and Promote.  The About section is where you enter your bio, contact info, and with the upgrade a favicon (the little icon that shows up in the address bar of your web browser).  The Content section allows you to select the services and feeds you want to link to your Flavors profile.  The Design section allows you to choose or upload a background, select a layout, a font etc. for your page.  Again, there are some options that are only available if you upgrade. The Promote section let&#8217;s you select places on the web, such as Twitter and Facebook where you want to &#8220;advertise&#8221; your new site.  That&#8217;s it; you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>The video shows how simple it is to use the Flavors Design Panel.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16745494" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/16745494">The New Flavors.me Design Panel</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out my <a href="http://flavors.me/rlmacklin">Flavors.me page</a>.  Also the flavors.me homepage has a <a href="http://flavors.me/directory">gallery</a> of pages users have created.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: bold;">About.me</span></p>
<p>About.me is currently in public beta. However, you can reserve your name at the site.  As space becomes available, or they come out of public beta, they will send you an invitation to complete your profile. On the surface About.me is very similar to Flavors.  As with Flavors the end result is a graphic landing page that allows you to create a profile and aggregates the feeds from your other social media services like Twitter, Facebook, blogs, websites etc. The end result on About.me is a bit more refined and the setup is even easier and more intuitive than Flavors.  Unlike Flavors all of About.me is free.</p>
<p>Again, you essentially claim your name, create a bio, select or upload a background, select services and add any URLs you want to feature on your page.  In addition to a palette of colors About.me includes a number of stock images you can use as a background.  About.me allows users to add any URL they want.  The URLs added by users are kept separate from the services, such as Facebook, Tumblr, Posterous, etc. that get pulled into the profile.   If visitors to your site click on one of the URLs they are taken to the corresponding page on the internet. Similarly to Flavors when visitors click on one of the services, as opposed to when they click a URL, they see the content from the service in a pop up window. About.me includes site statistics enabling you to monitor traffic to your profile page.</p>
<p>Once you finish completing your page you are given the opportunity to share the URL link to your new page on other social sites, like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Here is a link to my <a href="http://www.about.me/rlmacklin">About.me page</a>. A number of profiles are included on the About.me homepage so you can get an idea of what About.me pages can look like.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Google Profiles</h2>
<p>Google offers a non-graphic profile aggregator.  The process of setting up a Google Profile is a bit more complicated than either of the two (2) graphic profile aggregators. The main reason being if you don&#8217;t already have a Google account you will need one to set up your profile. Also the end result is notably different.  What you get from Google looks more like an online profile than a graphic landing page.  Still the result is very user friendly.  Google Profile is a free service.</p>
<p>After setting up a Google account or logging in to your existing account the process is similar to the other aggregators.  You create a bio, include any contact information, upload a profile picture if you want.  Google Profile uses a head shot type picture.  Some people use an avatar or no picture.</p>
<p>After you get your profile setup Google monitors your Google account to discover websites that might be related to you.  I, for example use Google Analytics to monitor the visitor statistics on my and my clients&#8217; sites.  The websites I register at my Google Analytics control panel are found by Google Profile.  You can select any of the sites Google Profile finds to include in your list of sites.  Also, you can manually add the URL and a description for any other site you want to include.  Google does not pull information in from the sites you link to.  Visitors clicking on a URL link are taken directly to the linked site.</p>
<p>If you allow Google to use your full name as part of your profile a link to your profile will be included on the bottom of first page of search results that use your name as the search term.  Normally, getting on the first page of Google search results requires paying or continued search engine optimization.  Granted it is the bottom of the page but the presentation is eye catching as it includes the profile picture you supply.</p>
<p>Here is a link to my <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/RobertaMacklin">Google Profile page</a>.  A more interesting approach might be to google my name (Roberta Macklin).  This will allow you to see the result.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While different from each other the three profile aggregators mentioned each offer users an opportunity to create a profile and link it to other social media and websites they are using on the internet.  These services should not be confused with other social media consolidation tools.  Most other consolidation tools are designed to give you a single point from which to <em>manage</em> your profiles.  They aren&#8217;t designed to introduce you to others on the web.  Even if you don&#8217;t have a bunch of profiles floating around these services are useful, in that they allow you to easily and quickly create a free and attractive landing page.  All three will allow users to quickly consume information provided by you about you.  Prior to these type services to have a similar level of control over information about yourself you had to buy a domain name and either design, code and load a website yourself or get someone to do it for you.</p>
<p>If you are willing to take about sixty (60) minutes of your time you can create multiple landing pages, where you have control over the content and to some extent the look of the pages. Even if you are planning on building a more comprehensive brand website creating profiles now will give you a head start on getting found in Google and other search engines.  You can claim your name and establish a hook to your professional brand presence on the internet.  Landing pages are useful tools to use when trying to draw people to your other work such as, websites, blogs, online videos, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GoodReads, Shelfari, etc.</p>
