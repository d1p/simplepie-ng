            <description>&lt;p&gt;Having failed to find time to post about various interesting things at SLF this year, this is more of a link list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SLF&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;	
	As usual I enjoyed and got a great deal from talking to colleagues and friends from all over Scotland. There was certainly a feel of the Festival having been cut back in space and attendance. The keynotes not using the Armadillo  I watched the Minister's opening on a screen in the main hall. Not being one who can parse political stuff the only comment I have is he left a lot open to discussion.&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;A couple of seminars I went to:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Shipbuilding Glow Pilot Project&lt;/strong&gt; – Testing the Waters Maeve Dixon () Learning Development Officer, Clydebank Museum) a lovely big school project involving:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;real stuff the museum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;real people ex shipbuilders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lots of in school making and doing, a huge ship launch for parents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;virtual stuff, glow meets with the museum and a glow group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
 		
		&lt;strong&gt;Games Design Transition Project&lt;/strong&gt; Charlie Love, Principal Teacher, Cults Academy&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Links ahd slides
		&lt;a href="http://charlielove.org/?p=6583"&gt;Kincorth Transition Project from SLF11 | Charlie Love.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;glow for external support&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;online resource&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;great looking scratch help videos in glow: &lt;a href="http://glo.li/bexogN"&gt;http://glo.li/bexogN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;David Muir gives good coverage of several seminars: &lt;a href="http://edcompblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Scottish%20Learning%20Festival"&gt;EdCompBlog: Scottish Learning Festival&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I didn't get much from the reduced trade show this year most interesting stalls for me were where I had a good chat about IOs and language learning with Mark Pentleton a source of info way beyond his business offering &lt;a href="http://www.radiolingua.com/"&gt;Radio Lingua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed talking to Gerry Queen, Ruth Washbrook and David S. C. Griffith about Moving Image Education I recodes a couple of quick boos: &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/scotland-on-screen"&gt;Scotland on Screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/mie"&gt;MIE&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/"&gt;EDUtalk&lt;/a&gt;. David went on to provide me with a great deal of food for though that I'll be following up at: &lt;a href="http://scotlandonscreen.org.uk/"&gt;Scotland on Screen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://languagesonscreen.org.uk/"&gt;Languages on Screen - Home Page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.screeningshorts.org.uk/"&gt;Screening Shorts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;h3&gt;TMSLF&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Probably the smoothest organisation of any teachmeet I've been to. I posted a quick boo the next day: &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/teachmeet-slf11"&gt;TeachMeet SLF11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;object data="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" height="129" id="boo_embed_479129" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /&gt;&lt;param name="scale" value="noscale" /&gt;&lt;param name="salign" value="lt" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgColor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="window" /&gt;&lt;param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F479129-teachmeet-slf11.mp3%3Fsource%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=TeachMeet+SLF11&amp;amp;mp3Time=06.02am+22+Sep+2011&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F479129-teachmeet-slf11&amp;amp;mp3Author=johnjohnston&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_479129" /&gt;&lt;a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/479129-teachmeet-slf11.mp3?source=embed"&gt;TeachMeet SLF11 (mp3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;There are a good deal of presentations, audio etc coming on line at: &lt;a href="http://tmslf11.posterous.com/"&gt;Teachmeet SLF2011 - Teachmeet SLF2011 Posts&lt;/a&gt; and I am posting to &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/tag/tmslf11"&gt;EDUtalk - Filed under 'tmslf11'&lt;/a&gt; as fast as I can chop up the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;There is also a good deal of post party discussion about TeachMeet both on twitter and blogs:
		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://islayian.blogspot.com/2011/09/teachmeet-at-scottish-learning-festival.html"&gt;Islay ICT: TeachMeet at Scottish Learning Festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Where I put in my 2d worth.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot&lt;/strong&gt;of the informal &amp;amp; valuable chat I had with a pile of folk swung round the forthcoming changes in Glow (see the &lt;a href="http://eduscotict.pbworks.com/w/page/45160456/ICT%20in%20Scottish%20Education"&gt;eduscotict wiki&lt;/a&gt;).  I missed the &lt;a href="http://www.stuckwithphysics.co.uk/2011/09/tmslf11/"&gt;#tmslf11 – Round Table – Glow: Love it/Hate it/Want it&lt;/a&gt; but from Drew Burrett's post a lot of sense was collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/johnjohnston/~4/MI7jX5k2-NY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>TeachMeet PirateBox Update: Bricked</title>
            <link>http://johnjohnston.info/blog/archive/2011/09/23/teachmeet-piratebox-update-bricked</link>
            <comments>http://johnjohnston.info/blog/archive/2011/09/23/teachmeet-piratebox-update-bricked#comm</comments>
            <description>&lt;img src="http://johnjohnston.info/blog/images/2011-09/2011-09-23_piratebox_bricked.png" alt="Piratebox Bricked" height="239" width="308" style="float:left;margin:4px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while ago I proposed &lt;a href="http://johnjohnston.info/blog/archive/2011/08/27/a-piratebox-for-teachmeet"&gt;A PirateBox for TeachMeet?&lt;/a&gt;. Several kind folk donated a fiver and I ordered the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH wireless router from an amazon reseller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First problem was that I did not notice that it was shipping from the USA, it arrive the day before &lt;a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/TeachMeet%20SLF11"&gt;TeachMeet SLF11&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't arrive home until late in the evening, but rolled up by sleeves to sort it out. Problem 2 was a USA power supply. This I rectified at Lunchtime the next day and settled down in a corner of the SECC to sort out the box. Apart from the fact I had plugged the mac into the WAN port rather than the LAN port(or the other way round) I didn't have a wired connection to the network. A major fail, I realised the port problem the next day after TeachMeet and though ti would now be plain sailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening I followed the instructions on &lt;a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY_OpenWrt"&gt;PirateBox DIY OpenWrt - David Darts Wiki&lt;/a&gt; which went, I though pretty well. Unfortunately I didn't really have a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH wireless router, I had a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; wireless router! The router was bricked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to unbrick the router using instructions I found: &lt;a href="http://g300nh.blogspot.com/2010/06/firmware-flash-and-brick-recovery.html"&gt;WZR-HP-G300NH Router: Firmware flash and brick recovery through TFTP&lt;/a&gt; After a few tries I noticed extra OS X help in a comment, but still failed. I decided to leave it until today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I had another go, musing again on the comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; the Mac uses carrier detect to automatically bring network interfaces up and down, and your ethernet interface needs to be up and running at the moment you power the router on, or you'll miss the little window when the tftp transfer can happen...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to try using linux running on my macbook under virtualbox. The mac had at least given me an &lt;strong&gt;"Unsuport MODEL" error&lt;/strong&gt; after using tftp to flash the firmware, but the virtualbox linux idea got me nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've now google &lt;em&gt;"Unsuport MODEL" error&lt;/em&gt; which has lead to a couple of interesting looking pages:&lt;br  /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=637023"&gt;DD-WRT Forum :: View topic - wzr-hp-g300nh2 bricked&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=636541&amp;sid=3fec64ad8f61844e412dd89f3a0b11d1"&gt;DD-WRT Forum :: View topic - problems recoberying buffalo wzrhpg300nhv2&lt;/a&gt; which I am leaving until tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on hope rather than experience I would like t oget the box up and running at &lt;a href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/38891224/teachmeet%20strathclyde%20edition"&gt; teachmeet strathclyde edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/johnjohnston/~4/b_W8ZbXS9sg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

It was, in my opinion a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after SLF09 we took the idea forward with &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/"&gt;EDUtalk - Audio publishing by educators, using mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://johnjohnston.info#fn1_2011-09-17" name="fn1_2011-09-17source" class="fntest"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  and over the last two years and we have had 332 audio files posted on EDUtalk.cc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year it looks like &lt;s&gt;LTS&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/"&gt;Education Scotland&lt;/a&gt;are joining in the fun. They have a &lt;a href="http://audioboo.fm/" title="Audioboo"&gt;AudioBoo&lt;/a&gt; channel, &lt;a href="http://audioboo.fm/glowradio"&gt;Glow Radio&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like they are going to be tagging their boos so that they will be picked up by EDUtalk. AudioBoo is only &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/pages/how-to-edutalk-0" title="How to EDUtalk - EDUtalk"&gt;one of the ways you can add your voice to EDUtalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is an ongoing open invitation to anyone interested in Education to add their voice to EDUtalk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously it would be great to get some reports and thoughts  about the Scottish Learning Festival or &lt;a href="http://eduscotict.pbworks.com/w/page/45160456/ICT%20in%20Scottish%20Education" title="eduscotict [licensed for non-commercial use only] / ICT in Scottish Education"&gt;#EduScotICT&lt;/a&gt; from a wide a range of voices as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instructions for adding your audio to EDUtalk are on the site: &lt;a href="http://edutalk.cc/pages/how-to-edutalk-0"&gt;How to EDUtalk&lt;/a&gt; and both David (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/parslad" title=""&gt;@parslad&lt;/a&gt;) and I (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/johnjohnston" title=""&gt;@johnjohnston&lt;/a&gt;) are happy to help or try and answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are going to SLF11 please  pick up your phone and EDUtalk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Barriers to use include the rigid timetable of secondary schools, the lack of computers or other devices in most classrooms and the failure in many cases to link ICT to relevant CPD The goal for hardware should never be “One Computer per Child” but should be “Access when Required”. Good open access wifi throughout the school buildings coupled with allowing pupils to use their own devices, smartphones, tablets, netbooks or whatever would at least partially overcome that barrier.&lt;/blockquote&gt;    &lt;div class="posterous_quote_citation"&gt;via &lt;a href="http://fkelly.co.uk/2011/09/eduscotict/#comment-730"&gt;fkelly.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incisive &amp; concise. The only bit I wonder about is the byo, not sure how the staff who lack skills would cope with multiple devices, OSs etc. Sometime taking a class through a glow activity using 2 different browsers can cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/johnjohnston/~4/fb7QqUvKzO4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
