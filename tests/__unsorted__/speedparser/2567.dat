<p>Some notable takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooley handled 112 deals in Q2, with total deal volume amounting to more than $2 billion in invested capital, a level not seen since 2006.</li>
<li>There were more up rounds than at any time since Q4 2009.  Up rounds increased to more than 72 percent of financings in Q2.</li>
<li>Average valuations for Series A deals were $8 million, a level not seen since Q3 2010.</li>
<li>There was a decrease in deals utilizing pay-to-play provisions, to the lowest level since Q4 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mostly confirms what we are all seeing &#8211; things are extremely busy and investment capital is flowing freely.  Long live the boom!</p>

<p><strong>Update to below: </strong>the start date for prioritized patents has been <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/news/pr/2011/11-30.jsp">postponed</a> indefinitely due to a lack of resources.</p>
<p>Patent applicants will soon be able to “prioritize” their applications by paying an additional fee to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Beginning May 4, for an additional $4,000, the USPTO will aim to provide a final disposition of the patent application within twelve months. Companies who desire patent protection as soon as possible should consider which applications, if any, they would like to enter into the program.<span id="more-57428"></span></p>
<p>The 12 month goal represents a significant improvement over the current average pendancy of 34 months. The program, announced in a Final Rule published April 4, is available to any original utility or plant nonprovisional application filed on or after May 4, 2011. The USPTO has set an initial limit of 10,000 applications to be prioritized during the remainder of fiscal year 2011, so companies seeking the benefits of this program may want to get their applications on file as soon as possible. The USPTO will revisit this limit at the end of fiscal 2011 to evaluate what the appropriate maximum should be for future years.</p>
<p>While it is unclear how quickly prioritized applications will issue, the prioritization process will likely result in patent issuance much sooner than normal. This will allow patentees to begin enforcing or licensing their technology sooner, and may also provide an earlier indication to investors of the technology’s potential value. In considering whether to take advantage of prioritized examination, a potential participant should be aware that prioritized examination may be terminated based on certain actions by the applicant. For example, a patent applicant will be required to limit their total number of claims and respond promptly to patent office communications. Prioritized examination will also be terminated if the applicant files a petition for an extension of time to file a reply, or files an amendment to the application which results in more than four independent claims, more than thirty total claims, or multiple dependent claims.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding the actions that will result in terminating prioritized examination a potential participation should carefully consider whether prioritized examination is appropriate based on their knowledge of the prior art and the condition of the application, such that amendments can be minimized. In addition, applicants should consider whether the volume of their patent portfolio, resources available, and any anticipated time constraints might preclude their ability to prosecute the application with expedience. Lastly, patent applicants will incur the costs of patent prosecution sooner, because examination occurs earlier and on an expedited track. Companies should weigh the benefits of expedited patent protection and potential for faster issuance of a patent against their readiness for a shortened prosecution period and earlier cost outlays.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/shutterstock_57678514.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-23083 alignright" title="shutterstock_57678514" src="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/shutterstock_57678514-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="140" /></a>Many startups try to control payroll costs by, among other things, classifying all employees as salaried employees “exempt” from state and federal overtime laws.  In doing so, they seek to make payroll predictable and avoid the additional, and often unplanned, expense of paying overtime for hours worked in excess of 8 in a day and 40 in a week.  However, misclassifying “non-exempt” employees as “exempt” creates substantial liability under state and federal law, and is a favorite claim among the plaintiff’s lawyers.  After a recent ruling by the California Court of Appeals, there may be a way to obtain some of the benefits associated with providing a salary to a non-exempt employee without the burdens of misclassification, provided it is done correctly.  In a recent and surprising decision favorable to California employers in <em>A</em><em>rechiga v. Dolores Press, Inc.</em>, “explicit mutual wage agreements” between non-exempt employees and their employers were upheld as being consistent with California’s otherwise inflexible wage and hour laws.</p>
<p><span id="more-22418"></span>Prior to AB 60 which reinstated overtime for all hours worked in excess of 8 in a day for California’s non-exempt employees, employers were allowed to pay a salary that was designed to compensate workers for all hours worked, including overtime, where the employee entered into an explicit mutual wage agreement that paid a salary or amount that included compensation for straight time and anticipated overtime hours. In order to establish an “explicit mutual wage agreement,” the employer is required to show that the parties entered into an agreement that specified (1) the days that the employee would work each week; (2) the number of hours the employee would work each day; (3) that the employee would be paid a guaranteed salary of a specific amount; (4) that the employee was told the basic hourly rate upon which his salary was based; (5) that the employee was told his salary covered both his regular and overtime hours; and (6) that the agreement was reached before the work was performed.</p>
<p>In 2000, the California Legislature enacted Labor Code Sec. 515(d) which states: &#8220;For the purpose of computing the overtime rate of compensation required to be paid to a non-exempt full-time salaried employee, the employee’s regular hourly rate shall be 1/40th of the employee’s weekly salary.&#8221; Following AB 60, the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement took the position that the new statute precluded these explicit mutual wage agreements and that any salary must be divided by 40 hours to calculate the regular rate and time and half of that rate must be paid for all overtime in addition to the salary. The result was a higher amount of total wages due than intended by the employer due to the additional burden of anticipated overtime. On February 7, 2011, in <em>Arechiga v. Dolores Press, Inc.</em>, the California Appellate Court provided a rare employer-friendly decision that harmonized the interplay between the case law allowing explicit mutual wage agreements and Labor Code section 515. The court held that Labor Code section 515 does not prohibit explicit mutual wage agreements, by which an employer and employee may agree to a fixed salary, to include both basic wages and overtime compensation so long as overtime is actually paid at not less than one and one-half times the basic rate.</p>
<p>The appellate court rejected the interpretation set forth in the Enforcement Policies and Interpretations Manual of the Divisions of Labor Standards Enforcement outlawing explicit mutual wage agreements, and instead, embraced the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in <em>Martinez v. Combs</em>, 49 Cal.4th 35, 50 fn 15 (2010) which held that the policies in the DLSE enforcement manual were not entitled to deference because they were not adopted in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p>Having rejected the DLSE’s interpretation, the trial court found that Arechiga and his employer had entered into an explicit mutual wage agreement when they orally agreed he would work 11 hours a day, 6 days a week for a total of 66 hours per week. They further agreed that his salary of $880 would include 26 hours of overtime pay each week. The only written confirmation of this agreement was a statement “Employee shall be paid a salary of $880.” Arechiga argued that because of Labor Code section 515, the salary of $880 could only be considered compensation for the regular 40 hour work week and thus his hourly rate was $880 divided by 40, or $22 per hour and did not include his regularly scheduled 26 hours of overtime. The trial court found that California case law did not support Arechiga’s assertion that Labor Code section 515(d) abolished explicit mutual wage agreements, and the Court of Appeals agreed noting that both federal courts and the Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions continue to acknowledge the viability of the explicit mutual wage agreement doctrine.</p>
<p>While this appellate decision is undoubtedly a win for employers in California, until the state’s Supreme Court decides to grant or deny review of this decision, employers should exercise caution and carefully consider the possibility that the appellate decision may be overturned before making any changes in reliance on this ruling. However, if upheld, the ruling provides employers substantially more flexibility to make pay arrangements with non-exempt employees that include overtime.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a reposting of a Dorsey &amp; Whitney benefits alert regarding a tax filing and disclosure deadline for companies issuing ISO stock options, if any ISOs were exercised in 2010.  ISOs are a form of stock options commonly issued to employees.  If your company is issuing options to employees, the information below may be applicable and you should consult with your legal counsel and/or finance professional.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Deadline for 2010 ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers is Fast Approaching</strong></p>
<p>Employers must file returns with the IRS and provide statements to employees reporting exercises of incentive stock options (ISOs) and transfers of stock purchased under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). For ISO exercises and ESPP stock transfers that occurred in 2010, the information statement must be provided to employees by <strong>January 31, 2011.<span id="more-3739"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deadlines for Providing Information Statements to Employees and Filing with the IRS </strong></p>
<p>Beginning in 2011, each transfer of equity under an Incentive Stock Option Plan or an Employee Stock Purchase Plan must be reported to the IRS and an information statement must be provided to the employee. These obligations, required under Section 6039 of the Internal Revenue Code, are satisfied using Form 3921 (for ISOs) and Form 3922 (for ESPPs). For transfers that occurred in 2010, Copy B of Form 3921 (or Form 3922 for ESPPs) must be furnished to employees no later than January 31, 2011. Employers also must submit these forms to the IRS no later than February 28, 2011 (for paper filings) or March 31, 2011 (for electronic filings). The IRS will impose fines on employers who fail to comply for each instance of noncompliance.</p>
<p><strong>Form 3921 and Form 3922<br />
</strong>Reporting on Form 3921 is triggered by exercise of an ISO.</p>
<p>Reporting on Form 3922 is triggered by the transfer of legal title to the shares purchased under an ESPP if (i) the purchase price of the shares was less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant (generally the case for ESPP purchases) or (ii) the purchase price for the shares was not fixed or determinable on the grant date. If shares purchased under an ESPP are transferred directly to a brokerage account for ESPP participants, this transfer will trigger the reporting obligation. On the other hand, if the Company issues stock certificates or the shares are registered in the participant’s name, then the Form 3922 will not be required until a subsequent legal transfer of title.</p>
<p>Although reporting is required only once per year, only one transaction may be reported on each Form 3921 (or 3922). For example, if an employee exercised an ISO on April 30, 2010, and again on June 15, 2010, then the company must provide two Forms 3921 to both the IRS and the employee.</p>
<p>The IRS information versions of Forms 3921 and 3922 and instructions are available <a href="http://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html?indexOfFirstRow=500&amp;sortColumn=sortOrder&amp;value=&amp;criteria=&amp;resultsPerPage=25&amp;isDescending=false">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Paper Forms Not Yet Available </strong><br />
As of this writing, scannable versions of Forms 3921 and 3922 are not available from the IRS. This means that you cannot download the information versions of Forms 3921 and 3922 available on the IRS website to use for paper filing. Employers should be advised that submitting these non-scannable information versions of the forms to the IRS may result in fines. Employers may pre-order Forms 3921 and 3922 from the IRS by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). When filing paper versions of Forms 3921 or 3922, be sure to include Form 1096 – Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S. Information Returns.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently announced an extension of the Green Technology Pilot Program until December 31, 2011. The pilot program provides for expedited processing of patent applications pertaining to environmental quality, energy conservation, development of renewable energy resources, or greenhouse gas emission reduction.<span id="more-1470"></span></p>
<p>Earlier patenting of green inventions can assist inventors in securing funding, starting businesses, and marketing their products sooner. Expedited processing can shave a considerable amount of time off the pendency of a patent application. For example, as of the USPTO’s November 10 announcement, the average time from approval of a green technology petition to the first action by the Patent Office was a mere 49 days. The USPTO also reported that some patent applications in the pilot program have issued within a year of the filing date.</p>
<p>In addition, the pilot program is now open to green technology related patent applications filed on or after December 8, 2009. Previously, the Green Technology Pilot program was open only to patent applications filed before December 8, 2009, and the program had been set to expire this December. As a result, patent applications directed toward green technology that are filed after December 8, 2009 are eligible for the pilot program.</p>
<p>In addition to the possibility of earlier patenting, potential participants should carefully consider the requirements of the program before entering. To enroll in the program, a patent applicant must agree to earlier publication of their patent application – exposing their technology to the public earlier than would otherwise be required. The application is also limited in the number of claims which may be presented. Lastly, patent applicants will incur the costs of patent prosecution sooner, because examination occurs earlier. Companies should weigh the benefits of obtaining patent protection sooner against the earlier disclosure requirement and cost outlays.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UPDATE TO BELOW</span></strong>:  On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 which included, among other things, an extension of the tax benefit discussed below for all of 2011.  For a summary of the tax law changes, please review the following <a href="http://www.dorsey.com/eu_tax_taxrelief_121710/">Dorsey &amp; Whitney tax alert</a>.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The following is a re-print of a Dorsey &amp; Whitney tax alert that can be found <a href="http://www.dorsey.com/eu_vcec_smallbusinessstock_102110/">here</a>.  This benefit is only available for a very limited time, but it is quite significant for investors that can take advantage of it.  Angel investors making investments in this time frame might want to consider buying equity rather than convertible debt in order to take advantage of this benefit.</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my post <a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/obama-administration-reaffirms-support-for-eliminating-capital-gains-tax-on-small-business-stock/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Exclusion of 100 Percent of Gain on Qualified Small Business Stock</strong></p>
<p>Recently enacted legislation provides investors with a potentially significant tax benefit for qualified small business stock acquired before the end of this year. The Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010 contains a number of provisions aimed at encouraging investment in small businesses. These provisions include an amendment to Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), temporarily permitting the exclusion of 100 percent of the gain from the sale of certain “qualified small business stock” acquired after September 27, 2010 and before January 1, 2011 that is held for more than five years by a non-corporate taxpayer. The amendment also provides that the excluded amount will not be a tax preference item for purposes of calculating alternative minimum tax. As a result, the effective federal income tax rate on any capital gain from the sale of qualified small business stock that qualifies for the 100 percent exclusion will generally be zero. The amount of gain that a taxpayer may exclude with respect to stock in a particular corporation is limited to the greater of $10,000,000 or ten times the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the qualified small business stock.</p>
<p><span id="more-1452"></span></p>
<p>Qualified small business stock is defined as any stock of a corporation acquired at original issuance in exchange for money or other property (not including stock) or as compensation for services if the corporation is a “qualified small business” on the date of issuance of the stock. To be a qualified small business, the corporation must: (1) be a domestic C corporation; (2) have aggregate gross assets (including proceeds received in exchange for the stock) of $50,000,000 or less at all times from August 10, 1993 through the date the stock is issued; and (3) agree to submit reports with the Internal Revenue Service and its shareholders as required by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Stock will not be considered to be qualified small business stock unless the corporation uses at least 80 percent (by value) of its assets in the active conduct of one or more qualified trades or businesses during substantially all of the taxpayer’s holding period for the stock. Research and start-up activities are generally considered to be a qualified trade or business, but certain other types of activities are specifically excluded, including, for example, banking, farming, and operating a hotel or restaurant. In addition, stock will not be considered to be qualified small business stock if the corporation: (1) redeems stock with an aggregate value greater than 5 percent of the aggregate value of all of its outstanding stock during the two-year period starting one year prior to the date the stock was issued; or (2) redeems more than a de minimis amount of stock from the taxpayer or a related person during the four-year period starting two years prior to the date the stock was issued. A number of other special rules apply to determine whether stock qualifies as qualified small business stock under these rules, including a requirement that the stock be held for 5 years. Investors should consult a qualified tax professional to determine whether all of the requirements are satisfied in light of the particular facts and circumstances.</p>
<p>For qualified small business stock acquired on or before February 17, 2009, Section 1202 generally provides that taxpayers may exclude 50 percent of the gain from the sale of such stock that has been held for more than five years. For stock acquired after February 17, 2009 and on or before September 27, 2010, the exclusion is increased to 75 percent. Unlike the temporary exclusion provided by the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010, the tax advantages of these partial exclusions are typically limited because of the effect of other special rules.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">﻿<a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Dorsey-CEO-Survey-Report.pdf"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1421" title="Survey" src="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Survey.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="251" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today the Palo Alto office of Dorsey &amp; Whitney released the results of a <a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/ceo-survey-beyond-valuation-what-is-driving-your-selection-of-an-investor-win-an-ipad/">survey we conducted</a> of startup founders and CEOs about the criteria they use to select investors. The full survey can be downloaded <a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Dorsey-CEO-Survey-Report.pdf">here</a> and a press release about the survey’s key findings was released today <a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/CEO-Survey-Press-Release.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Many people have asked us why we conducted the survey.  First and foremost, we wanted to get a snapshot of the early stage financing market to determine if the trends we are seeing in our own practice of representing startup companies and investors matches up with broader trends in the market (and it did).</p>
<p>Second, a lot of the talk in blogs and popular press about the different types of investors and the purported competition of Angels vs. Super Angels vs. VCs has focused on how investors define themselves.  We wanted to give entrepreneurs a voice to express what is important to them and how they view investors.  We think the results speak loud and clear.</p>
<p>First, some information about the survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survey was conducted online over a 4-week period.  We had 363 respondents that completed the survey.  Participants were automatically registered to win an iPad, which went to <a href="http://twitter.com/hnshah">Hiten Shah</a> of <a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/">KISSmetrics</a> (congratulations Hiten!).</li>
<li>42% of survey respondents were based in the San Francisco Bay Area/Silicon Valley region, with 20% international and the rest distributed throughout the U.S.  All respondents had either raised funds over the past 12 months and/or were planning to raise funds within the next 12 months.</li>
<li>Respondents represented a range of sectors, spanning IT infrastructure, software, gaming, life sciences/biotech, and green tech/energy.  However the majority of startups participating in the survey were in the consumer Internet, cloud computing/SaaS or mobile sectors, 34%, 17% and 13%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage people to read the full survey because it produced some interesting results, some of which are highlighted below.<a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/funding-chart-who.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1436" title="funding chart who" src="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/funding-chart-who-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>While CEOs still find traditional deal terms like valuation, dilution, liquidation preferences and board control as very important elements in completing a deal, the survey illustrated the importance of other criteria. Following are some of the findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>91% ranked the speed at which the deal can get done as “somewhat important” to “very important.” &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 91 percent of CEOs ranked deal speed as somewhat to very important. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
<li>92% ranked whether the investor understands the startup’s funding requirements and encourages them to not take more or less than what the business requires as “somewhat important” to “very important.” &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 92 percent said understanding funding needs is somewhat to very important. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
<li>While valuation rated important, a full 32% of CEOs said that this factor was only “somewhat important” to “not important.” &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 32 percent of CEOs said valuation was only somewhat important to not important. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/funding-chart-how-much.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1435" title="funding chart how much" src="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/funding-chart-how-much-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>64% of the respondents are seeking $1 million or less in funding, underscoring the new funding requirements of today’s tech startups. &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 64 percent of CEOs are seeking $1 million or less in funding. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
<li>48% of respondents ranked prior relationships with an investor as “not important.” &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 48 percent of CEOs said prior relationship with an investor is not important. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The perception of the investor’s brand does not appear to carry the same prestige and value with today’s entrepreneurs. Approximately 75% thought that a tier-one “brand name” VC was only “somewhat important” to “not important.” &gt;<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Dorsey Investor Survey: 75 percent of CEOs said top tier VC brand is somewhat to not important. http://wp.me/pO3cT-l5 via @mbartus">tweet this stat</a>&lt;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We hope that people find the survey results informative.  It’s an interesting time to be working with early-stage startups and the technology industry in general.  We think the survey provided a helpful overview of what early-stage startups founders and CEOs are looking for from investors and where those needs are being met.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We welcome any feedback or input people have so please drop us a line or note.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a re-print of a post written by my partner Ted Hollifield that was originally posted in </em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/5-tips-on-how-to-leverage-that-first-big-customer-2010-9"><em>Business Insider</em></a><em>.</em><a href="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dogpicture2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1283" title="dogpicture" src="http://www.mattbartus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dogpicture2-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>So your startup has finally landed a deal with a huge customer that could potentially put your company on the map. Now how do you negotiate this deal so that your company (not just theirs) gets the most out of this relationship (and avoids a situation like this one: <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/in-a-partnership-of-unequals-a-start-up-suffers/">In a Partnership of Unequals, a Startup Suffers?</a></p>
<p><strong>1.  Term Sheet, Term Sheet, Term Sheet</strong></p>
<p>Did I mention the term sheet? In large companies, the business guys you’re talking to (who are very excited about you and what you’re doing) are far removed from the legal folks who create and negotiate the final contract (which you will have to live by). In order to make sure your contract matches your business goals, be sure that any and all important deal terms and conditions are in your term sheet … otherwise they’re not going to end up into your contract.<span id="more-1263"></span></p>
<p>Right about now you’re thinking, “Of course!” But here is how startups end up in trouble. Imagine the term sheet includes a 99.999% uptime, although you were upfront with the business guys that you cannot provide more than 99% uptime because that’s what your current cloud provider gives you.  The business guy says, “Oh, it’s all right.  We don’t expect five nines, it’s just the standard language in all of our deals. Don’t worry about it.”  Fast forward to a year from now – and, guess what, that guy has moved to another group, and suddenly you find out that the company is in breach of contract.</p>
<p>Your startup company will never have more leverage in terms of making changes to an initial agreement than you do at the beginning of a relationship.  So make sure your important deal points are in your term sheet.  Unfortunately you’re not going to be able to add anything into the contract that wasn’t in the term sheet.  Large companies know that startups are hungry to get deals closed and use this to great effect; they will make last minute changes to the deal, but you won’t be able to.</p>
<p><strong>2.  The Essential “Termination for Convenience” Clause (ie: Your No-Fault Divorce)</strong></p>
<p>Right now it might not seem like you would ever want to terminate this relationship, but believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of reasons you might want to. For example, this company’s competitors may want to do business with you in the future (and pay you more money), or you may want to take the product roadmap in a different direction. Maybe you realize that the amount of time it takes to service this customer is preventing you from pursuing other opportunities or is distracting you from your primary product vision roadmap, or you no longer want to continue the IP rights you agreed to earlier.</p>
<p>Part of being a successful startup is being nimble and opportunistic, and if you have no way to leave this customer if you want to, you could be in trouble (ie: think ball-and-chain). Do include a clause that gives your company an out if you want it.  Of course the customer may want it to go both ways and that’s fine.  Because, in practicality, they can just walk away from you whenever they want, don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>3.  Educate your Attorney on the Background of the Deal – an email with “Please Review” Falls Short</strong></p>
<p>Unless you give some context, your attorney is going to err on the side of caution and come up with a laundry list of issues, and that’s not going to get you to the closing table.  Instead explain to your attorney what is important in this deal (and what isn’t), as well as what your concerns are.  You should have a conversation with your attorney before he or she spends your money talking to the attorney(s) on the other side. Make sure your attorney understands what you’re trying to achieve with this customer, so you can receive useful feedback on the contract, rather than just a red-lined version created in a vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Understand the Pace of a Larger Organization</strong></p>
<p>As a startup, you are all about agility and speed.  Larger companies are all about process.  Remember that there are a lot of people who need to vet your product, understand your deal terms, and buy off on the relationship. Your large customer will likely want to draft the documentation, which will seem to move at a glacial pace compared to how fast your attorney works.<br />
Set your and your company’s expectations accordingly, since there’s very little you can do to affect their timeline.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Keep your Perspective: One Customer is Not Your Entire Market</strong></p>
<p>While deals with large marquee customers can be helpful, they rarely make or break a startup. As you think about really successful companies, including your large marquee customer, the early deals they did with large companies were certainly helpful to their business, but they weren’t their important inflection points.</p>
<p>Your company’s success is really dependent on your ability to apply repeatable business processes to a lot of customers, as opposed to your ability to service a single (and sometimes very demanding) customer &#8212; think of the difference as “outsourced labor” versus “stand-alone business.” Creating the right product for a large market is how your business is going to take off and enable you to scale it.</p>
