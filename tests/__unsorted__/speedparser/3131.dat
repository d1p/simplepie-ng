			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s another Monday and another start to the week. Not to mention it&#8217;s officially October.. we can finally stop rolling our eyes to statuses like &#8220;Wake me up when September ends.&#8221; I love sleeping, but I&#8217;m sure sleeping for a whole month isn&#8217;t the best idea. Last Friday I went out with old Uni friends I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. We basically went our own ways after graduating; a friend went to China to study Mandarin for a year (he said it was like a year-long vacation, envious!), another got married not too long ago, one started his own online gaming business while still working, some maintaining family businesses and the rest being part of the working class. Just less than 2 years ago we were still sitting in class trying to figure out what to do with our lives and here we are, all employed. Quite surreal.</p>

<p>We went out for dinner then went clubbing (which was packed, packed, packed so I didn&#8217;t take any photos). Even as we went out the Security team was crowding over a few men because they were too drunk and wanted to use their power (pun intended) to fight the security. It was more lame than scary. Men of the douche circle are so laughable sometimes.</p>
<p>The night was closed with a sleepover with my girls like what we used to do back in uni when we had deadlines, assignments and exams to cram. Part of me still wishes I was still living that life but at the end of the day I&#8217;m glad I have a job and a little money to shop, wine and dine.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some few weeks ago while in the car with my parents both of them wouldn&#8217;t shut up about this guy that may or may <em>not</em> be part of my life right now. My mom friended him on Facebook (GAH) and just kept grilling me with questions about him and if all my recent statuses had something to do with him. So I shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;M GONNA UNFRIEND BOTH OF YOU TOMORROW!&#8221; My dad laughed, my mom shouted back, &#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU DARE!&#8221; Being an only child for 12 years and have an extremely close relationship with your parents, conversations like these with them aren&#8217;t unfamiliar at all. </p>
<p>I remember when I first started out with Facebook and had a lot of crazy photos (aka when parents had no knowledge about social networking) account privacy didn&#8217;t have much of a strong impact then so I made sure my parents didn&#8217;t know I had one but it&#8217;s so different now. Family members started getting their accounts from your aunt to your uncle even your great-aunt. It&#8217;s like my Facebook is solely for family and family members that live outside the country. I don&#8217;t mind really, it&#8217;s just that when my parents start bringing up questions like that and friending said guy it gets annoying. This is also the reason why I don&#8217;t like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline">Facebook Timeline</a>. As much as it is a very good concept and well thought out and not to mention it looks great, I hate knowing that people can just easily scroll down my timeline and look at the demons of my past (figuratively speaking). Not that I have anything to &#8220;worthy&#8221; to hide really, but you would know what I&#8217;m talking about right now about the preference of happenings in the past being archived in the depths of your new updates.</p>
<p>This is actually pretty funny coming from me because I was actually the one who sent my parents a friend request in the first place since I was curious with their profiles. Although before that I did make sure my parents wouldn&#8217;t find me or search me on Facebook at all. Now twitter and this blog is pretty much all I have when it comes to online rantage about things that I don&#8217;t want them to know. My mom loves to read blogs and has had twitter for over a year now but I still hope she doesn&#8217;t find me here. If she has, then all I can say is.. HI MOM!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Douglas Booth at #LFW.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lruqdulsWG1qz5ug4o1_400.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="475" border="0" /> <img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lruqdulsWG1qz5ug4o2_400.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="475" border="0" /><br />

<p>How gorgeous is this guy? Not to mention he&#8217;s so well dressed, you can&#8217;t go wrong with that. If he doesn&#8217;t have a stylist who works for him, kudos! I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the Burberry poster boys (George Craig, Alex Watson, Sam Riley, Tom Guinness and Alex Pettyfer to name a few) and their campaigns are always spot on in terms of model casting. My top favorites have to be George Craig and Douglas Booth because they look a little rough on the ages but really fit the bill of the smooth look Burberry offers.</p>
<p><strong>Suits</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://mediagalaxy.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Suits.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>Suits is the 2nd best TV show I&#8217;ve seen this year after Shameless US (What is up with my favorites this year being only 12 episodes and not coming back until a whole full year?). It is SO good and I finished it in less than a week despite work. Until now I&#8217;m still in a Suits withdrawal and I&#8217;m still thinking about Harvey and Mike&#8217;s shenanigans in the world of law. This show is so witty, all the characters have such great chemistry, none of the stories are ever dragged out (you have to keep up with it, just like law) and you can&#8217;t help but love the whole ensemble. It&#8217;s pretty damn brilliant and as soon as I told the world (my twitter) that I was watching the series, more than a few twitter friends echoed their love for the show too.</p>
<p><strong>Medium-length wavy bob</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Brooklyn Decker" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brooklyndecker-29-80.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="411" /> <img title="Kang Ji Young of KARA" src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrrr50X7yL1qbokdxo5_500.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="411" /></p>
<p>My hair is very long now and I&#8217;m leaning towards a hairstyle change. The last time I cut my hair really short was 3 years ago and I cried in the salon. Yup, not the best experience. The last time I had a haircut though, was 4 months ago and I don&#8217;t know what the Korean hairstylist did to my hair because it grew almost twice as long in the past 3 months, which is really weird because it takes forever for my hair to grow back! I&#8217;m bent on whether to keep my hair long and dye the ends in pink or bright red or cutting it short like Brooklyn&#8217;s and Jiyoung&#8217;s above. What I like about this medium wavy bob is that it doesn&#8217;t look like it needs high maintenance and I&#8217;ve always liked my hair to be as it is. It&#8217;s also not too short that you can&#8217;t style it. Oh how I love being a girl <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-smiley-switcher/squaresmilies/icon_wink.gif" alt="" /> but the dilemma such as these definitely come with it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom is really into reading blogs now. She e-mailed me today telling me to check out a blog. It&#8217;s funny, because she doesn&#8217;t know about mine. The author writes simple entries but posts nice interesting photos about the simplest things, like peeling off stickers inside a taxi cab (weird, right?). I really enjoyed it. Then I thought, how come I can&#8217;t write simply anymore? I just want to use small simple words, like how I&#8217;m writing now.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I blog or when I want to blog, I think of so many things to say, that I end up not blogging at all.<br />
It&#8217;s very annoying. I want to blog more and post more pictures.<br />
I just need to get over over-thinking things to write about.<br />
I haven&#8217;t even finished sorting out photos from our recent beach trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG9988.jpg" rel="lightbox[1106]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1108" title="IMG9988" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG9988.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5840506/canon-s100-the-new-pocket-powerhouse-point+and+shoot">Canon S100 was just released</a>, have you seen it?<br />
When I was at the Changi Airport in Singapore I went to an electronic store and I asked the sales associate if I could take a look at the Canon S95 and test it out. He gladly gave it to me, he was really nice and accommodating and professional. The Canon S95 has always been in my wishlist but I don&#8217;t really take pictures anymore because I get lazy (blame smartphones), but I want to change that. I don&#8217;t even really touch our SLR because all the settings give me headaches. So I want to get the S100 when it comes out here in Jakarta.<br />
I&#8217;m a little bit glad I didn&#8217;t get the S95, but also a bit sad because I&#8217;m sure the price will be higher for the S100.</p>
<p>Today I changed my ringtone to Super Junior&#8217;s Mr. Simple intro. I hope I get used to it fast.<br />
The Skins opening theme song has been my ringtone for almost 2 years now so I thought, &#8220;Hey, maybe I need a change.&#8221;<br />
I remember before when my ringtone was still Royksopp&#8217;s Happy Up Here, then I changed it to the Skins theme.. whenever I&#8217;d hear Happy Up Here I would always think it was my phone that was ringing. It will be probably be the same for this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Friday! Happy happy. I think I&#8217;m going to take a rest this weekend. I really need to stop spending so much.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally back to blogging after the holidays, which were great. First 5 days spent lazing about, watching City Hunter and adopting DOLCE FAR NIENTE into my life, something which I never have the luxury of doing anymore ever since I got out of uni and the next 5 days were spent with family in a vacation to Singapore and Bintan Island. Shopping, the beach.. too good.</p>
<p>Before I talk about the vacation and upload some photos, when I was in Singapore I did a bit of shopping. Some new clothes, new shoes, make-up, skin care, foodtrips, accessories.. not too many but enough to make me satisfied and quite broke. Sigh, but no sigh!</p>
<p>Out of everything I bought these are probably the top 3 buys which I was most happy about, and also another edition of TILT.</p>
<p><strong>1. Kameria Baby Face BB Cream</strong>, about $25</p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/B2kzndgCWkKGrHqZjIErF-enepBMjGMy8Mi_35.jpg" rel="lightbox[1094]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" title="Kameria Baby Face BB Cream" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/B2kzndgCWkKGrHqZjIErF-enepBMjGMy8Mi_35.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard a lot about BB Creams before, the wonders they&#8217;ve done to women and how some people swear by these products. In the beginning I wasn&#8217;t really swayed but I&#8217;ve been wanting to really try one these past few weeks. I was at Sephora and they had a whole counter full of BB Creams so I chose the one which I thought was most suitable for my skin and budget. My face gets oily easily, not too mention also a victim of breakouts so I chose the Anti-Acne and Pore Tightening with SPF 20 BB Cream. I&#8217;ve been using it for close to a week now and I&#8217;m glad I made this purchase because I love it. The texture isn&#8217;t too moist so my skin doesn&#8217;t get too oily anymore and the color is quite dark which suits well with my complexion. It pretty much does its job.. and more.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/subdepartment/LADIES?Nr=4294966587#Nr=4294959749">H&amp;M Bag</a></strong>, $39.99</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Bag" src="http://www.hm.com/josh/media/sys_master/8883027476510/2011_C01_Women_Accessories.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="407" /></p>
<p>H&amp;M finally made its way to Southeast Asia by opening their first flagship store in Singapore. Perfect timing because it opened just as I got there. During the first few days the lines were basically crazy like you were queueing for the newest roller coaster but I decided to go during the 4th day when the lines were moving at a normal pace. Even though the store was full of people, it wasn&#8217;t that crampy because it really was big.. but the cashier and fitting room lines were still very long. I managed to snag a few things.. mostly accessories because I really didn&#8217;t wanna line up in the fitting room for clothes, that was my last night in Singapore and I was extremely hungry for dinner that time and getting really dizzy in the store with all the people. H&amp;M was not <em>that</em> worth it, but there were so many nice affordable clothes inside! They really need to open one in Jakarta so we won&#8217;t be this deprived.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting a cheap daily bag for a while now, mostly for work. Something that is light and something I don&#8217;t mind putting on the floor on most days and shoving all my junk inside. Before I went to the store I was browsing through bags on their website already (funny thing when I went back today the bag&#8217;s not there anymore.. but the model&#8217;s still wearing it) so that I could figure out what I want and not get lost in retail oblivion. The moment I found what I was looking for I grabbed it straight away. It&#8217;s really light and fits a lot of my things inside, which is perfect for everyday use.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-lancome_us-Site/default/Search-Show?q=juicy%20tubes&amp;sz=8">Lancome Juicy Tubes</a></strong>, about $18</p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-thing.jpg" rel="lightbox[1094]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" title="Juicy Tubes" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/img-thing.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of lip stuff (lip gloss, lip balm and quite recently, lipstick). I remember reading a magazine article about Elizabeth Jagger back when I was still in school and she mentioned that she couldn&#8217;t live without these Juicy Tubes things. Then I found out <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2002/06/12/jaggers-girl-grows-up">she actually got to endorse the product</a>, I really really wanted one but I&#8217;ve always been shy to ask my mom to buy me $18 lipgloss. At the airport before boarding I came across a row of them so I decided just to go ahead and finally get one (in #17 Fraise) and so far so good! I like that it has a thick texture as opposed to other glosses which are quite thin and oily, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like your lips are covered in hot goo. It also smells nice. Score.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t plan on going into too much detail about my purchases but I couldn&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;m in a blogging mood today!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t watch a lot of K-dramas, but when I do watch one I make sure it&#8217;s good and I make sure it&#8217;s Lee Min Ho. The number of K-dramas I&#8217;ve seen, I can count with my fingers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_in_My_Heart">Endless Love: Autumn in my Heart</a> (the start of it all), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House_%282004_TV_series%29">Full House</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Beautiful_%28TV_series%29">You&#8217;re Beautiful</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Preference_%28TV_series%29">Personal Taste</a> (which I loved), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_Lady!">Oh! My Lady</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Girlfriend_Is_a_Nine-Tailed_Fox">My Girlfriend is a Nine-tailed Fox</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Garden_%28TV_series%29">Secret Garden</a> (one of the best) and this one which I recently finished, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hunter_%28TV_series%29">City Hunter</a>. It is good, it is damn good. I was a bit hesitant because of the action and suspense genre which I tend to stay away from because first of all, I don&#8217;t have much knowledge when it comes to the Korean government and secondly, well I really do prefer the romantic drama theme.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Cityhunterpromotionalphoto2.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="416" /></p>
<p>The reason why I started City Hunter was not only because people were recommending it to me, but also because it stars Lee Min Ho and I was curious about how he&#8217;ll go about pulling off an action role. I didn&#8217;t watch him until Personal Taste so didn&#8217;t really get the whole craze with him being on Boys Over Flowers. Besides, the Meteor Garden theme was kind of really annoying to me. Lee Min Ho definitely has the acting chops and seeing him jump into this type of genre didn&#8217;t go wrong because it fit him. They also made him flawless with the right background to become the kick-ass character he played.</p>
<p><span id="more-1083"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i630.photobucket.com/albums/uu26/dramabeans/drama/2011/cityhunter6/hunter6-00011.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" border="0" /></p>
<p>What I loved most about City Hunter is that there were no unnecessary secondary love stories. In the beginning of the drama you’d think that Sae Hee would have feelings for Yoon Sung or Prosecutor Kim Young Joo and Nana would be all  jealous and plot their own rendezvous together but the truth was it wasn’t that way. I also loved how fragile the relationships were being portrayed but we weren’t being robbed off them. Nana and Yoon Sung had their fair share of sweet moments, bickering and drama and Young Joo and Sae Hee’s relationship as an ex married couple was also really portrayed well. You weren’t really sure if they were still in love but they definitely cared enough about each other to maintain that kind of relationship. Of course there was the issue of the &#8220;noble idiot&#8221; K-drama cliche that in order to protect himself and the girl he loves he must let her go thus sacrificing their relationship altogether. That was sort of an issue, but it wasn&#8217;t too glaring for me beneath all the action, the familial entanglements and all the plotting and scheming going on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i630.photobucket.com/albums/uu26/dramabeans/drama/2011/cityhunter19/hunter19-00011.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" title="City Hunter vs Prosecutor" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lqpapwmVuu1qz5ug4.png" alt="" width="562" height="317" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My most favorite scenes in the drama always involved scenes between Lee Yoon Sung and Prosecutor Kim Young Joo. Their chemistry whether as comrades or foes were amazing. Not to mention they are both so easy on the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i630.photobucket.com/albums/uu26/dramabeans/drama/2011/cityhunter19/hunter19-00349.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></p>
<p>If there was one consistent thing in this drama, it was Lee Min Ho&#8217;s styling. I&#8217;m usually at a lack of better words to say when it comes to fashion but it was close to perfect. He usually wore blazers, low hung shirts and slim pants which did wonders to his tall and lean figure. When tall guys are dressed in a preppy manner and given the right fit you generally can&#8217;t go wrong with it. I guess you&#8217;ll have to watch the drama to know what I mean.</p>
<p>I finished this series within a week and a half, just in time for the holidays. The suspense and &#8220;WHAT THE FUCK?!?!&#8221; factor it gave me made me really look forward to watching it despite sleeping at 3am (thank goodness it&#8217;s the holidays, right?). I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to watch another drama with the same genre as this because it&#8217;s going to be pretty hard to top. The producers mentioned that there might be an upcoming sequel in the works or a second season and if that happens and it&#8217;s the same characters and story flow, then you can definitely count me in.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being someone who always has music revolved around her literally 24/7, I really need a good pair of earphones. Not only good, they also have to be cheap because I suck at earphone maintenance. I&#8217;m not saying I keep a low disregard of my things (let&#8217;s just say, selectively) but there&#8217;s just something about earphones—I always have bad luck because they break so fast. That alone makes me discouraged and I feel that it&#8217;s a waste if I buy expensive ones because, what if they break again right?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve probably tried almost all the recommended brands out there. Sony, Philips, Creative, the Apple ones which come with my iPods, Sennheiser, Koss, JBL, Audio-Technica.. I&#8217;ve had all of those in my 7-year span of extensive music listening. I&#8217;ve yet to try the more expensive brands like Shure but I feel like right now it&#8217;s not worth my money because I&#8217;m a girl and I have other needs you know? SHOES BAGS CLOTHES WINE AND DINE scream out my name all the time. I&#8217;m beginning to have personal finance issues, I swear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently using a <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/home_en.nsf/root/private_headphones_street-line_502851">Sennheiser MX 471</a> which I got as a gift and has lasted for more than a year now (GASP), the longest I&#8217;ve ever had working earphones. I usually only get the entry to middle level products from each brand because yeah, I&#8217;m very clumsy with them. Apple earphones are standard and produce a fairly good sound but the thing with them is, they break too easily, so fragile and basically have low durability.  The thing with me is I&#8217;m really picky with sound. My 471&#8242;s are great but only with ear foams. I lose ear foams all the time and I hate it! My <a href="http://www.koss.com/koss/kossweb.nsf/p?openform&amp;pc%5Eeb%5EJAMS">Koss Jams</a> were really cheap and I had a good run with them, they sounded good despite the price but due to the price too, they didn&#8217;t last very long. My <a href="http://www.audio-technica.com.sg/con_product.php?prodid=47">Audio-Technica C500M</a> on the other hand, the sound was too thin in my ear and felt like tin cans, and the durability wasn&#8217;t very good either&#8211;it barely lasted for 2 months. Crazy, my cheaper Koss&#8217; lasted more than it.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing about earphones I don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s those in-ear ones. The thought of sticking something into the depths of my ears is horrendous and kind of gross. I think it&#8217;s also the reason why I&#8217;m having a hard time finding the right earphones these days because most of the ones in the market right now are in-ears. I hope they don&#8217;t make the earbud types obsolete. What will become of me and my listening habits? If you could recommend me good and affordable earphones, that would be great! <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-smiley-switcher/squaresmilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while! I&#8217;ve been meaning to write another TILT but I keep on forgetting and when I get the idea it&#8217;s not Thursday anymore plus when I feel like drafting a post and it&#8217;s not Thursday I feel like I&#8217;m cheating. So here&#8217;s the 2nd edition!</p>
<p>1. <strong>My new MacBook Pro</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/oldnewmacbook.jpg" rel="lightbox[1066]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1068" title="Old vs New" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/oldnewmacbook-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666" /></a></p>
<p>Fresh two nights ago, I finally replaced my 4 year old white MacBook. It was with me all throughout my college/university life and not to mention my first Mac so there&#8217;s definitely a sentimental value attached to it. I&#8217;m passing it on to my little sister and hopefully getting some kinks fixed like the random LCD quirks that&#8217;s been bugging me the past couple of months. As for this new baby, I&#8217;m beyond happy! No more hindrances to work and fangirling.</p>
<p><strong>2. Running</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been consistently running for about a month now and I love it! No form of exercise since dancing has made me this motivated until this one. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed running and won 1st place in a few races back when I was in high school but I always regarded it as just wanting to get over the whole sports meet so I can hang with my friends after (lol). I&#8217;m back to beginner stage now, I started with walking, then sprinting then jogging and now here I am tracking my progress with <a href="http://www.adidas.com/com/micoach/">adidas miCoach</a> (but ironically wearing Nike shoes). My running goals are still all over the place but hopefully I break the 3km soon. So far my average for about 3-5 times a week is only around 1.5km and pushing myself to do better! There&#8217;s just something about the night breeze that calms me because I can only run when I get home from work and I sleep better.</p>
<p><strong>3. Teen Wolf &amp; The Borgias</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="MTV's Teen Wolf" src="http://www.mtv.com/onair/teen_wolf/images/series_images_2/456x330.jpg" alt="" width="456" height="330" /></p>
<p>Ya I know, they&#8217;re two really different shows but I&#8217;ve been hooked! My love for Teen Wolf started because of a free iTunes download and forcing my sister to watch with me. Even though we were both hesitant, we didn&#8217;t want to let a free download go to waste. Fast forward 12 episodes later we&#8217;re totally fangirls of the series. I guess it goes with my surprise about how good it is despite being an MTV production (low expectations, okay). The storyline is actually simple, not overdone and the characters are convincing, not to mention the effects aren&#8217;t all that bad. I&#8217;m not even surprised it&#8217;s doing so well that it&#8217;s been picked up for another season and on every tween&#8217;s radar these days, mine included. Yeah, I&#8217;m forever a tween.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="The Borgias on Showtime" src="http://www.i-moviechannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/The-Borgias-Season1.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="582" /></p>
<p>I admit I started looking into The Borgias because Luke Pasqualino [ side note: I MISS SKINS!!! ] is one of the recurring cast but when I watched the pilot and the episodes after I just couldn&#8217;t get over how great the production is, the cast, the stories, the subtle evil that comes out of all their actions. Having the best History teacher in high school made me a History buff so the stories behind the Borgia family really fascinated me and until now I can&#8217;t stop reading about them and what they did to the Christian society. Pretty deep stuff.. definitely one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hump Day Holidays</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday was the Independence Day of Indonesia (FREEDOM!) and being a Wednesday, it gave me time to relax and unwind in between working days. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I love a long weekend just as much as you do but something about a break in the middle of the week is good too you know? It feels like I only have 2 working days to look forward to all the time. Can&#8217;t life be like that? Yesterday was spent having brunch at noon with the boss and lazing around for the rest of the day. Ahh, bliss.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can finally write about k-pop now that most of the groups that I follow are releasing stuff left and right. The first half of 2011 was kind of a dud to me. I barely kept up with k-pop and 2PM was mostly doing activities in Japan so my fangirling was a bit on the low side. For me, the only solid releases during the first half was <strong>TVXQ&#8217;s Keep Your Head Down</strong> which I followed for weeks, EPIC EPIC song and performances that were worth the time. <strong>Big Bang</strong> also released <strong>Tonight</strong> which is one of my favorite k-pop tracks for 2011 and <strong>Love Song</strong>, which was a solid melody but unfortunately had boring performances. Other than that I loved <strong>Joo&#8217;s Bad Guy</strong> single, <strong>Dalmatian</strong>&#8216;s mini, <strong>U-Kiss</strong> surprised me with less cringe-y songs after Xander and Kibum&#8217;s departure from the group and <strong>Kahi</strong>&#8216;s single which was melodically okay, but still kind of a dud. The most disappointing comeback for me so far is definitely <strong>4Minute</strong>. <strong>Mirror Mirror</strong> is a horrible song and <strong>Heart to Heart</strong> does not suit them! I was expecting so much after last year&#8217;s epic with HuH and I My Me Mine. Better luck next comeback I guess.</p>
<p><strong>AFTER SCHOOL &#8211; SHAMPOO</strong></p>

<p>May rolled in and one of my favorite girl groups, After School, released Shampoo. It was also the last record before Bekah (one of my favorite members) &#8220;<a href="http://www.allkpop.com/2011/06/bekah-to-leave-after-school">graduated</a>&#8221; from the group. After School is the only group I really like outside of the BIG 3 (SME, YGE, JYPE) + CUBE and Bekah is one of my favorite girls in k-pop so I know this comeback counted for something. They ditched their fierce persona but unlike 4Minute (whose concept did not resonate with me at all), their replacement track was great. I genuinely loved Shampoo from the start. The soft synth mixed well with the soft feel of the song. I will miss Bekah&#8217;s flawless English rapping.. but I wish her all the best back home in Hawaii.</p>

<p><strong>F(X) &#8211; DANGER &amp; HOT SUMMER</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Hot Summer</p>
<p>f(x) released 피노키오 (Danger) and I was pleased another girl group I liked had came out with something worth following. Before anything, can I say how hot Krystal is now? I know how she&#8217;s a bitch and everything but you can&#8217;t deny this girl&#8217;s hotness. She rose from being my least favorite members to one of my favorites now. Of course, I still love Victoria and adorable boyish Amber.. I think it&#8217;s Amber who really makes f(x) a significant group that it is. I was more pleased with Hot Summer, their follow-up single than Danger although both aren&#8217;t wow-songs. They still follow the format of f(x) speaking out the lyrics but I like how you don&#8217;t have to take these tracks seriously and just enjoy them as it is.</p>
<p><strong>JAY PARK &#8211; ABANDONED</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Abandoned English version</p>
<p>Jay finally released his first solo mini album on April but because I was too busy having fun during my vacation I didn&#8217;t get to listen to his singles until May. I have to admit it took me time to get used to his new sound. Of course, being a 2PM fan through and through, even though I don&#8217;t fully follow Jay&#8217;s activities he&#8217;s still got my support one way or another. Abandoned was a really solid track which showcased his true talents and where his music direction is headed. It&#8217;s very American though.. I would&#8217;ve preferred it in English rather in Korean <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://other-worldly.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-smiley-switcher/squaresmilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="" /> this track really proved to have a strong American R&amp;B influence.</p>
<p><strong>BEAST &#8211; FICTION</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>Since I didn&#8217;t really follow many k-pop releases this year (aside from my favorites) I managed to skip Beast&#8217;s Fiction too. But after I saw their last few performances of Fiction on music shows I realized I actually liked this song. There&#8217;s this love/hate thing I have with Beast. I only like them when they&#8217;re promoting and performing but other than that the only members I care about is DJ and JH. I thought Fiction was really really good. It&#8217;s solid, it shows that Beast really has the vocal and dancing talent. Plus of course like all their recent songs I loved the choreography of this one and the styling wasn&#8217;t bad either. They&#8217;ve really managed to establish themselves as a group rising to the top with strong synthpop backing and complex choreography.</p>
<p><strong>2PM &#8211; HANDS UP</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>HANDS UP!!! Of course, the only comeback I was longingly waiting for finally came. Remember how I was in Singapore on my birthday? 2PM was there on the same weekend shooting an MV and little did I know it was for this song. I didn&#8217;t even know they were gonna have a comeback as fast as June. Anyway, it was everything I wanted and more. JYP explained that 2PM&#8217;s finally out of their emo and ridic stage and they&#8217;re just here to party and have fun. And boy they did. If there&#8217;s one thing you can count on 2PM to be consistent on, it&#8217;s their energy. Nobody can deny that. They&#8217;re not perfect singers but they can bring a stage alive like no other singers can and that&#8217;s what I love most about them. On-stage and off-stage they&#8217;re my boys forever &lt;3</p>
<p><strong>2NE1 &#8211; I AM THE BEST &amp; UGLY</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I AM THE BEST</p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">UGLY</p>
<p>2NE1&#8242;s releases this year were both instant favorites for me. Being one of my favorite girl groups, I thought I AM THE BEST was amazing. It was alive and stayed true to 2NE1&#8242;s position as a top girl group in Korea. The only gripe I have is the ridiculous styling and how they can&#8217;t seem to get away from this concept. I missed their old styling when it was hip, crazy, fun and over the top awesome without having to be over the top ridiculous. Whatever though, 2NE1&#8242;s still undeniably a great group. Especially after their last album To Anyone, which was great don&#8217;t get me wrong but after a while it just felt like pots and pans so I AM THE BEST was a step up. 2NE1 also followed up with UGLY, which was different but not unusually different you know? They only moved away from the booming beats and sang a song with deep feelings and CL nails the choruses perfectly (What can&#8217;t CL nail actually?).</p>
<p><strong>MISS A &#8211; GOOD-BYE BABY</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>When it comes to JYPE I admit I am pretty biased because it&#8217;s my favorite entertainment company (it&#8217;s got 2PM after all). So when miss A debuted last year, they had my instant following. It helped even more that they adapted the no-concept concept which is pretty new when it comes to k-pop because there ALWAYS has to be a concept. It was refreshing. They only showed their talents in singing and dancing to a catchy song with simple outfits. That&#8217;s what made them one of 2010&#8242;s biggest rookies. Fast forward this year, they finally made their comeback with Good-bye Baby and again, I found myself really loving the song. I loooooooove this song, genuinely. Their concept still follows the no-concept concept (lol) but this time with a more glamorous and mature feel. miss A did it again.</p>
<p><strong>AFTER SCHOOL RED &#8211; INTO THE NIGHT SKY</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>After Bekah&#8217;s graduation, After School was left with equally 8 members so their company decided to split them into two sub-groups. After School Blue and After School Red. I already knew which group I would like from the minute the members for both subs were announced. A.S. RED presented the fierce sexy concept while A.S. BLUE adapted the cute and girly one. Red has 3/4 of my favorites: Kahi, Jungah and Nana so with UEE it completes the tall and sexy roundup. The song is okay, it&#8217;s very catchy and addictive but it doesn&#8217;t really spell FIERCE. The video on the other hand, it&#8217;s like a Korean Pussycat Dolls mv. Suffice to say it&#8217;s one of my favorite k-pop videos so far. The direction was simple but the execution didn&#8217;t come out cheap.</p>
<p><strong>SUPER JUNIOR &#8211; MR. SIMPLE</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2011/08/k-pop-releases-2nd-half-favorites/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>The whole of k-pop blew up the minute the concept photos of the group were revealed. They were shocking, weird, colorful, ridiculous, crazy, outrageous but purely Super Junior and that&#8217;s what we love most about them. The boys are finally back with their 5th album. The single still follows their pattern of Sorry Sorry and Bonamana, I mean why wouldn&#8217;t they, those 2 songs were long-term hits. Mr. Simple is a weird weird song, but it&#8217;s listenable and very enjoyable. It mixes all the components the group has and being 10 members, it&#8217;s certainly not easy. I guess that&#8217;s what I like about k-pop. No level of crazy can really shock me anymore. As always, SJ is always consistent with their over-the-top-over-the-place choreography but I thought the MV didn&#8217;t do it justice and they looked really tired. The live performances on the other hand, are always the ones I look forward to watching.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Superman + Mr. Simple comeback stage</p>
<p>New comebacks to look forward to are coming soon! GD&amp;TOP are coming back in a few weeks (LIKE FINALLY), Taeyeang my love is out with a new song on September and so is Girls&#8217; Generation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been following <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com">A Softer World</a> for more than 3 years now, sometimes I don&#8217;t understand it but the wit is usually on point and incredible. Like the one above.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.asos.com/inv/media/4/5/1/3/1243154/black/image1xl.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I bought these from ASOS the other day. So cute and cheap for only less than $11. I&#8217;ve become kind of an ASOS junkie lately.. I can&#8217;t resist their sales but in the end I do anyway. I recently bought a bag and another bag is on the way, it hasn&#8217;t arrived although it&#8217;s been close to a month. Patience and self-control is really what you need when it comes to online shopping.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://rapfix.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/watch-the-throne-cover-full.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Have you listened to Jay-Z and Kanye&#8217;s Watch The Throne? It&#8217;s automatically included in my 2011 Best Album list. The level of epic is just awesome. My favorite tracks are New Day, Lift Off (feat. Beyonce) and everything else.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/66858274/incubusjakarta.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://other-worldly.org/2008/03/minimalistic-approach-incubus/">Unlike 3 years ago</a>, I didn&#8217;t get to watch Incubus in Jakarta this time. It&#8217;s a shame now because I have money to pay for concerts but no time to go because they&#8217;re on a workday/night. Back when I was a student I had all the time in the world but no money. Funny how life works. I was pretty bummed out, I had to keep myself from crying and couldn&#8217;t listen to anything Incubus for a week until I broke it with rocking out to all their David Letterman performances. So envious of my Incusisters but I live vicariously through them.</p>
