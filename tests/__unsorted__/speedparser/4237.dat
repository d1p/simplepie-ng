<p><strong>&#034;Social media is great and all, but can it move the needle for me in my small business?&#034;</strong></p>
<p>Most of the great stories of social media success involve large brands and corporations like Dell, Best Buy, and Pepsi. While the case studies are interesting it is hard to pull salient information to help small businesses engage in successful social media marketing.</p>
<p>After 7+ years working in the corporate social media space I am going to be turning my focus and consulting practice towards helping smaller, local businesses get up and running with success-driven social media programs.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve been writing about Twitter, LinkedIN, Facebook and social media strategies since 2009, and while I&#039;ve learned a lot in that process, my focus has been more on corporate social media success. I am creating a <a title="Social Media Strategies for Small Business" href="http://uber.la/social-media-strategies-for-business/">Social Media Strategies for Small Business</a> page that will organize and capture relevant information that should help you help yourselves.</p>
<p>That&#039;s my goal. I am here to help, as a consultant, but much of what you need to do, only you can do. I can help guide you with content strategies, help you structure your web page/blog/facebook page, all those details, but the real social part can only be added by you and your employees and ultimately your customers.</p>
<p>My primary refrain in social media, <strong>&#034;It&#039;s not about what you say about your business, it&#039;s what others are saying about your business.&#034;</strong></p>
<p>That&#039;s social media. Uber.la is great resource for tools and strategies for getting the conversation started and figuring out how to turn that &#034;social&#034; activity into business.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the journey. And I&#039;m <a title="How to work with John McElhenney for your social media success" href="http://uber.la/work-with-me/">here to help</a> if you need me.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve had a hard time keeping up with the conversations I want to keep up with on Google+ Things are much like Twitter in the early days, when we only had Twitter.com to view the stream. Google+ is an endless stream that updates and puts commented posts back to the top of the stream from time to time. But I am continually losing threads under the rush of the stream.</p>
<p>So this ONE extension has made a huge improvement in my Google+ experience. I thought I&#039;d make a quick share about it.</p>
<p>It&#039;s called G+Me and it only works on Google&#039;s own Chrome browser. Here&#039;s what the stream looks like once the extension is installed.</p>

<p>Violá! It&#039;s like an email inbox. With comment counts in red.</p>
<p>Now I can track the discussions I want and ignore those pesky animated Gifs. Heck, you don&#039;t even see them in this view.</p>
<p>So until the next Tweetdeck-like app comes along that allows us to manage our Google+ Circles as cascading columns, this will have to do.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, back in the early days of the internet and blogging and tech writing, <strong><a title="The former blogging and writing authority" href="http://technorati.com/" target="_blank">Technorati</a></strong> was THE Authority. Now I&#039;m wondering if my authority on Technorati has any authority at all? I used to work hard to build affiliations and affinities with others hoping to gain traction on a subject. Unfortunately today, the Technorati site looks like a fairly generic news site. Digg Lite with the style of Yahoo 2008 and the colors of Wired 2001.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s the site profile that I use to work on and manage with care.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-15-at-2.10.29-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20662" title="Screen shot 2011-07-15 at 2.10.29 PM" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-15-at-2.10.29-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 15 at 2.10.29 PM Does Technorati Carry Any Authority Today? Where Do We Turn for Reputation and Authority?" width="565" height="419" /></a></p>
<p>I remember getting that first authority point.</p>
<p>Today I doubt if anyone outside the very techie ever visits Technorati. Did Google&#039;s Blog Search kill what was once the defacto Blogging Tracking and Searching engine?</p>
<p>If so, what is in it&#039;s place?</p>
<p>Klout? Um, not exactly. <strong><a title="My Klout Score dropped on one of my busiest days of activity" href="http://klout.com/#/jmacofearth" target="_blank">Klout</a></strong> is an algorithmically generated authority score. It&#039;s okay, but it doesn&#039;t have the care or clarity of Technorati&#039;s curated authority. I&#039;m sure there is a way to game your Klout score.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-22-at-10.05.52-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21934" title="My Klout score dropped on one of my busiest days" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-22-at-10.05.52-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 07 22 at 10.05.52 AM Does Technorati Carry Any Authority Today? Where Do We Turn for Reputation and Authority?" width="439" height="179" /></a></p>
<p>On a day when my blog experienced a nice spike in traffic my Klout score actually went down. Oh, yeah, it&#039;s based on Tweets and Facebook LIKES. Hmmm. (I&#039;m seriously worried that they&#039;ve added Foursquare into the K mix. How is a check-in a Klout building activity?)</p>
<p>And then there&#039;s <a title="Rank among your Peers." href="http://www.peerindex.net/" target="_blank">PeerIndex</a>. I&#039;ve just joined to see what they are all about. I will update this post when I&#039;ve done my research.</p>
<p>Or maybe the <a title="Ad Age Top Marketing Blogs" href="http://adage.com/power150/" target="_blank">Ad Age Power 150</a>, if you are in marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I&#039;d love to see Technorati return to it&#039;s former glory, but it&#039;s going to take some serious social campaigning. Or perhaps KLOUT could buy them and incorporate their years of work into the K-score. Or better yet, Technorati could come out with their own BADGE and REWARDS system. I might just have to make my own, for now. (grin)</p>

<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-21-at-11.34.10-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21647" title="Block Formulists from Twitter" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-21-at-11.34.10-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 07 21 at 11.34.10 AM Why I Just Blocked You On Twitter; An Open Letter to Twitter About the @Formulists Problem" width="274" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>I am included in 413 Twitter lists. At one point this was a stat that I looked at to gauge how I was connecting with people. If I was added to someone&#039;s list, it meant that they valued what I was tweeting. Each list I was added to was like the rush of one hundred new followers. Someone adding me to a list was deliberate. It felt like a validation.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21589 alignnone" title="Screen Shot 2011-07-20 at 11.31.07 PM" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-20-at-11.31.07-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 07 20 at 11.31.07 PM Why I Just Blocked You On Twitter; An Open Letter to Twitter About the @Formulists Problem" width="212" height="77" /></p>
<p>Today, however a good portion of these lists look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-20-at-11.34.58-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21590" title="a few @formulists inclusions" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-20-at-11.34.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 07 20 at 11.34.58 PM Why I Just Blocked You On Twitter; An Open Letter to Twitter About the @Formulists Problem" width="287" height="164" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, I&#039;ve just finished looking through all of the lists and only about 5% are formulist generated. That&#039;s a lot fewer than I thought it would be.</p>
<p>But here&#039;s the problem with the entire formulists formula. The auto-list generation kills the value of being listed in the first place. Daily I am injected into Autolists with helpful parameters like People I Follow, People Who Recently Followed Me, People I Retweeted, People of People I Wanted to Follow But Didn&#039;t So I Created a List for That. (Okay, I made up the last one, but&#8230;)</p>
<p>When Twitter Lists as they were first created they quickly became an indication of authority and &#034;klout&#034; based on people actually following and then adding you to list. (Much like Circles on the new Google+). With the auto-Listing features of Formulists and others the list has become less useful.</p>
<p>An example of how I still use Twitter lists. When I am included manually by someone, I often follow a number of the others on the list. Twitter Lists had true value in the process of discovering others of similar interests to follow. If another person added me to a List called &#034;Health Care Thinkers&#034; then I could be fairly confident that the other hand-picked people would also be REAL and not spam. I don&#039;t think anyone hand-picks a spam account and adds it to a list.</p>
<p>BUT&#8230; The auto-listing apps do not have a REAL filter. Their lists, often at the maximum members of 500, include spammers, scammers and anyone who &#034;followed&#034; or &#034;retweeted&#034;. It&#039;s easy for the abusive Twitter accounts to get into these lists. And thus they are passed along with some new (albeit suspect) authority of being added to a LIST.</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> It is getting harder and harder to filter the crap tweets out of Twitter. Lists provided a way to at least follow actual people, if they were hand-picked the likelihood was good that they were real accounts. So now Auto-List generators like Formulists have filled the LIST function of Twitter with a lot (and I mean A LOT) of bad accounts. Bad accounts with false validation of being included on a List.</p>
<p><strong>COUNTERPOINT:</strong> One wonderful new authority measure is Klout. I am happy to have a new system of filtering out the pornsters. The pornsters are following in groups of 10 &#8211; 15 at a time, and I&#039;m sure Formulist would gladly add them to a &#034;recently followed me&#034; auto-List if I used them. I&#039;m not sure how long it will take for the scam accounts to start generating Klout, but I assume it&#039;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR TWITTER LEADERSHIP:</strong> Please disallow Formulists API stream. If not banning them, at least force them to add a <strong>DO NOT AUTO-LIST ME</strong> feature where your users could <strong>OPT-OUT</strong> of being included on a Formulist. Only you can do this.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you would like to see Formulists add an OPT OUT feature please use the #hastag #nofomulists in your tweets about this subject.)</p>
<p>The previous Formulists post: <a href="http://uber.la/2011/06/formulists/">How @formulists Killed the Value of the Twitter LIST</a></p>
<p>Here is the <strong>GetSatisfaction</strong> Post I added myself to about this subject: <a title="Get Satisfaction on Formulists OPT-OUT request" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/formulists/topics/can_i_block_myself_from_being_included_in_formulists_lists" target="_blank">Can I Block Myself From Being Added to A Formulist List?</a> (please add your voice to the thread)</p>
<p>And here is Natalie&#039;s response on GetSatisfaction, much like her response on my original post:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This issue is a bit trickier than it might first appear. One major concern is the confusion it may cause for our users; for example: someone creates a Formulists list to filter all the people they follow from &#034;Vancouver&#034; into a list; it&#039;d be almost impossible for them to realize that the reason why someone isn&#039;t on the list is because they&#039;ve opted out and our system would appear broken.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">We are considering a few different options including allowing users to block themselves from being automatically added to certain kinds of public Formulists lists, such as Formulists lists where they are not followed by the person doing the listing, or public 2nd-degree connection lists (lists like &#034;who-my-friends-talk-to&#034; and &#034;mutual-friends&#034;). Each has some complications associated with it and regardless of the selected option, users always have the ability to manually add anyone they want through twitter (even without Formulists). This issue is in discussion right now so we are open to ideas if you have any.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Thanks,<br />
Natalie</p>
<p>Is it my understanding that the only way to get off someone&#039;s Auto-List is to BLOCK THEM. (Bummer.) Not good enough Natalie. We want an OPT OUT option NOW. It&#039;s easy, just do it.</p>
<p>UPDATE 7-25-11: This morning the problem is demonstrated again:</p>

<p>No offense Drew, but liked it a lot better when I was only on the lists YOU made.</p>
<p>Update 7-25-11 pt 2: Check out how Paper.li has done their opt-out program. I think Formulists should take a lesson and offer OPT-OUT of all @formulists lists.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t recall exactly, but I think GMail was in BETA for a few years before Google decided it was done. I expect Google+ will be in BETA for a while to come. As it is, what we have is something between Twitter and Facebook. Something that is pretty. That is integrated with GMail and Picasa. Something that is eventually going to influence Google&#039;s search results, so you&#039;d better get your SEO cap on over to G+ and figure it out. BUT, there is a real problem with Google+ that everybody is talking about.</p>
<p><strong>We need to filter the Stream in Google+.</strong></p>
<p>At the moment everything is in the Stream. Here are my Circles so far:</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-18-at-10.06.22-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21220" title="The Circles in my Stream - Google+" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-18-at-10.06.22-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 18 at 10.06.22 AM Problem with Google+; The STREAM is Too Fast   Filter the Stream or Pause the Stream" width="85" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Currently you can listen to all or one of the Circles at any given time. I suspect that one of the first things Google is going to do is allow us to toggle Circles in and out of our stream. The User Interface element is there. Just make the circles radio buttons and either IN or OUT of your stream. But that&#039;s not there yet.</p>
<p>Instead the flow of your Stream just continues without pause. (That&#039;s another feature we need, <strong>PAUSE THE STREAM</strong>) Sometimes you are entering a comment and the Stream keeps moving and your entry screen moves down the page, often out of the browser view. So V2 of Google+ needs Filters and Pauses.</p>
<p>But what Google+ really needed was to buy a client like Tweetdeck. (Purchased by Twitter a month before G+ was opened.) In Tweetdeck I can manage a real Stream of input from Thousands of users and map it to my columns of attention.</p>
<div id="attachment_21233" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/googles-stream-mcelhenney"><img class="size-full wp-image-21233" title="Filtering Google+ Streams" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-18-at-10.42.44-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 18 at 10.42.44 AM Problem with Google+; The STREAM is Too Fast   Filter the Stream or Pause the Stream" width="468" height="292" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to view full-screen and download a PowerPoint version</p></div>
<p>Perhaps the immediate answer is to create an RSS feed of the stream and then use Tweetdeck to filter that.</p>
<p>I&#039;m sorry Twitter bought Tweetdeck before the launch of G+. Planning perhaps? Strategic block? Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s the problem with APPS: With a tool like Tweetdeck we&#039;d never need to go to the Circles/Google+ page, and that&#039;s where the value is for Google. That&#039;s what&#039;s happened to Twitter. No one goes to Twitter.com. 80% of Twitter&#039;s traffic is via APIs and 3rd party Apps. Twitter cannot serve you an AD if you&#039;re not on Twitter.com. (But I&#039;m sure in-stream ADs are coming, because Twitter has yet to figure out how to make money on Tweets.)</p>
<p>So for now the value to Google is to get us into the their G-Universe and then sell us, track us, know us. With Google it&#039;s all going to be about integration. I&#039;m not so convinced that&#039;s a great thing. Sometimes we need separation to keep things straight.</p>

<p>Google+ uses the Circles metaphor to help you organize your contacts. But before you go off building large networks of people and randomly adding strangers to your network, get a grip on what you want to make PUBLIC vs PRIVATE. Do you really want those party pics showing up as part of your LinkedIN profile? Do your private images get shared via Friends of Friends settings in Facebook? What do these settings look like in Google+? (That&#039;s a topic we should cover in a future post.)</p>
<p>But getting a grip on your Public vs Private networks is a good first step. Before you make the decision to join everything with Google+ take stock of how you share now. I am keeping Facebook as my &#034;Private&#034; network. (Kinda funny, considering Facebook&#039;s privacy settings are some of the worst in the business. But I keep mine as tight as possible: <strong>Friends Only</strong> on everything.)</p>

<p>It&#039;s always good to remember that anything you share electronically can be reshared without your permission.

If you share privately, now that &#034;privacy&#034; is a concept that Facebook and now Google+ will change on a regular basis.

<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-14-at-10.21.11-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20362" title="The Circles of Social with Google+" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-14-at-10.21.11-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 14 at 10.21.11 AM Ready to Start Over with Google+?

<p>The heart of Google+ is called Circles. It&#039;s how you organize and manage your network of friends, associates and possibly enemies in G+. Above is the default Circles that Google did for you.</p>
<p>So here&#039;s what&#039;s cool about restarting. You&#039;ve got a clean slate with Google+. You can refine and redefine how you want to organize your connections. Old friends, new random &#034;has added you to their circles,&#034; even some old blockers are connecting on Google+. Because it&#039;s like a wild frontier out here. And it&#039;s no fun if your PLUSSING (kinda like a LIKE in facebook) to nobody.</p>
<p>And so the influence grab has started in Google+ too. Who will be the leaders? Who is the most followed? Why did Mark Zuckerberg&#039;s Google+ profile suddenly drop off the network and then reappear? We&#039;re all giggly about Google+ on Google+. And we&#039;re also posting our Google+ thoughts back on Facebook and Twitter. Go figure!</p>
<p><strong>BUT THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RECONSIDER YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK.</strong><br />
(I&#039;ve written about this before: <a href="http://uber.la/2011/05/cutting-back-on/">Cutting Back on My Social Scene and Focusing the Conversation</a>)</p>
<p>Before you ADD and ADD and ADD to your circles, think about what went wrong with Twitter and Facebook. What about those experiences is less than fulfilling?</p>
<p>I guess that&#039;s why my &#034;following&#034; (not sure I know you, but thanks for the add) and &#034;social&#034; (we know each other through this social media channel thing) circles are the largest at this point. I have not begun to sort or organize much in Google+. But already I&#039;m a bit tired of the endless stream. I can look into the stream of content from ALL of my circles of any ONE of them. And in broadcasting (posting) a message, I can define if I want the message to go to my +Circles or my +Extended Circles (sort of like friends of friends) or the massively attractive +Public. Where is that Public stream shown anyway?</p>
<p>And one of the biggest challenges for me and Google+: How do I tag or retrieve information that passed by in the stream? I had to do some digging inside Google+ to find the graphic below. So what are the tools that will help us store and retrieve within Google+?</p>
<p>Well, one of the best things about Google+ at the moment is all the talk about Google+. And here, John Jantsch, the author of Duct Tape Marketing, nailed the Circles conversation for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-14-at-1.50.16-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20368" title="John Jantsch's REAL CIRCLES" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-14-at-1.50.16-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 14 at 1.50.16 PM Ready to Start Over with Google+?

<p>The good news, is you get to REDEFINE how you are going to connect with people. Note to self: start over and don&#039;t f-it up this time.</p>
<p>Now I just have to go implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Have fun, go slow. Don&#039;t over populate your G+ until it&#039;s as unusable as, say, Twitter without Tweetdeck.</p>

<p><strong>This is the two-minute Google+ review.</strong></p>
<p>What you don&#039;t need is another Google+ review of features and benefits. This isn&#039;t that review. Here is a link to my <a title="All the Google+ Reviews and Commentaries You Might Need" href="http://www.delicious.com/john32mac/google%2B" target="_blank">Google+ aggregation</a>, for all your full-review needs.</p>
<p><strong>You&#039;ll like G+ if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You like using Twitter via Twitter.com</li>
<li>Animated Gifs don&#039;t bug the crap out of you</li>
<li>You want to talk about Google+</li>
<li>You&#039;re really mad a Facebook and looking for &#034;any&#034; alternative. (The any place but Facebook, crowd)</li>
<li>You want to be IN with the cool kids like Chris Brogan, Gary V, Michael Arrington, Scobble&#8230; (if you don&#039;t know these names, you might be okay waiting on G+ a bit)</li>
<li>You don&#039;t want to be left out of the conversation about Google+ and social media in general (though you can catch most of this on Twitter anyway)</li>
<li>You really want to restart your social networks, and build new Circles (see: groups/lists) with new names and new friends</li>
<li>You&#039;ve got some blockers on Facebook and/or Twitter who you want to try again with and they&#039;re on G+</li>
<li>You don&#039;t have enough social media stimulus during the day, and you want another tab on your browser to check-in on</li>
<li>You want to watch Google take over the world as they fold every single web function and web app into Google+ (don&#039;t worry, this might take a while)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You&#039;ll hate G+ if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&#039;ve got a pretty well organized Tweetdeck or Hootsuite setup for managing Twitter</li>
<li>You&#039;re social needs to have commerce attached to it</li>
<li>A endless stream of comments, and people &#034;trying out&#034; Google+ annoys you</li>
<li>You&#039;re pretty happy with your &#034;friends&#034; set up on Facebook</li>
<li>You really don&#039;t want to start over, reorganizing and categorizing and learning a new set of social media skills</li>
<li>You think discussions about social media are boring</li>
<li>You&#039;re concerned that Google already knows too much about you (they do regardless of your *privacy* settings)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My big thoughts about Google+</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting over is fun (since discovery is the most addictive quality of social media, then you can have that &#034;look who I just discovered on Google+&#034; feeling over and over again</li>
<li>Circles are just groups with a nicer user interface to organize and sort</li>
<li>At the moment the filtering (how you tune in to what you want to hear) is none existant (you can mute a post, but not a circle)</li>
<li>I personally love talking about social media, therefore many of the discussions about Google+ that are happening exclusively on Google+ are interesting to me</li>
<li>The best discussions about Google+ are suggestions and questions about how to make it better (here&#039;s the <a title="Google + Features and Suggestions (a Google Group)" href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-feature-suggestions?pli=1" target="_blank">Google Group</a> that seems to have the most educated discussions about future Google+ functionality.</li>
<li>Video chat with Michael Dell and 10 or so other people can be really entertaining, or boring, depending on your perspective (Yes, MD is regularly using the final AH HA feature of Google+: HANGOUTS, video chat with 10 of your social associates.)</li>
<li>Google+ really is a beta, there&#039;s nothing quite perfect about it. Mainly the apps to manage the flow of information inside Google+ don&#039;t exist yet.</li>
<li>Google IS going to hook all this stuff up into an even more formidable social network. Previous attempts failed, but they are betting the farm and the 2011 and 2012 company bonuses on social projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The social media 101 summary:</strong> If you like Facebook, stay there. If you like Twitter check out Google+. If you work in social media, you don&#039;t need to be *reading* about Google+ you need to be *using* Google+.</p>
<p>Of course I&#039;m sticking with Google+. I do love a good social media semantic discussion. I aspire to Brogan&#039;s social footprint. And there is a Chrome extension that lets you turn off animated gifs in Google+ (link to <a title="A Google Chrome extension to stop animated gifs in google chrome" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gemmknjnneiojfjelmgappppbaneikda" target="_blank">StopAnimations</a>)</p>
<p>So if you&#039;re going to make the plunge, by all means, get ready for either fun or overwhelm. Here&#039;s my <strong>Google+ address:</strong> <a title="Quicklink to my Google+ Profile" href="http://gplus.to/jmacofearth" target="_blank">jmacofearth</a> so you can hook up with me once you are inside. And if you need an invite let me know. The floodgates appear to be open to all.</p>

<p>[This is a Twitter Hack walk-through. How I got hacked, and willingly gave up my password to the scam. RE: <strong>StalkTrak</strong>, <strong>LTwitteri(d0t)com</strong>, <strong>"who's stalking your twitter."</strong> I've done it so you don't have to. Another popular variant, DM "Is this you in this picture &lt;link&gt;?"]</p>
<p><strong>Update 7-20-11:</strong> Just got this in my Direct Message inbox on Tweetdeck. The hack is still running folks.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-20-at-11.50.22-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21611" title="StalkTrak, LTwitteri(d0t)com, Twitter Hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-20-at-11.50.22-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 07 20 at 11.50.22 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="178" height="110" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Update (24 hrs):</strong> Steps: 1. UnAuthorize App, 2. Change Twitter Password. Seems to have done the trick, no further intrusions. Stay safe out there.</p>
<p>What was I thinking? I got what looked like a legitimate message about a new Twitter tool. And something about stalking. Perhaps that should&#039;ve been the clue. But I went along for a looksee. And in the process opened my account up to a scam of some sort. Here&#039;s how it got started.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.39.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19410" title="StalkTrak, LTwitteri(d0t)com, Twitter Hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.39.42-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.39.42 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="241" height="62" /></a></p>
<p>Not sure what &#034;stalks&#034; means in this case, but I&#039;m interested to find out.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s what the site logo and URL look like.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.43.04-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19419" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Twitter Virus, Twitter Hack, Twitter Scam" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.43.04-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.43.04 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="171" height="122" /></a></p>
<p>They ask for an email address and a password.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.47.17-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19421" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="StalkTrak asks for Twitter Authorization AND email and password" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.47.17-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.47.17 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="412" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>And on the same screen is a Twitter OAuth link. It&#039;s odd to have both on one screen. I was curious, and I was feeling somewhat bulletproof. So I authorized the &#034;StalkTrak&#034; to see what was what.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you put in, here is the resulting page.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.47.45-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19422" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="StalkTrak Twitter Scam, twitter hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.47.45-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.47.45 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="513" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>And that was it. Nothing. I couldn&#039;t tell anything from this mash of data and for a few hours, nothing suspicious happened.</p>
<p>And then late last night these started going out as DM message from me.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.51.37-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19426" title="StalkTrak, LTwitteri(d0t)com, Twitter Hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.51.37-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.51.37 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="192" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, so I went back to Twitter and revolked the Twitter OAuthorization. Here&#039;s how you do that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-7.15.03-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19439" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Edit your Profile on Twitter.com" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-7.15.03-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 7.15.03 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="152" height="90" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">And go to the</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-7.15.18-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19440" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Applications screen on Twitter.com to kill Authorizations" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-7.15.18-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 7.15.18 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="435" height="181" /></a></p>
<p>And I was comfortable that I was done.  And I posted a few warning Tweets to alert anyone that had gotten a DM from me about LTitteri.com not to click on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.35.15-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19411" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Alerting the masses to the LTwitteri twitter hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.35.15-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.35.15 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="416" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>And so at that point I figured I was done.</p>
<p>Until I checked back into my Twitter account. And found these lovely tidbits. I can see how these might really pose a problem for some folks. I think I&#039;m okay, though. I think&#8230; (grin)</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.34.47-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19409" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Slanderous tweets could cause problems for some" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.34.47-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.34.47 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="420" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, so one more trip to Twitter to change my password. Yes, dumbass that I am, the password I gave in the LTwitteri screen WAS also my Twitter password. Now that was Dumb. My own dumbness, that I&#039;d been meaning to change for months. Okay, it&#039;s changed now.</p>
<p>And it looks like the Twitter Authorities are on the scam as well. When I tried to click one of the original links from the bogus Tweets, here&#039;s what I got.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.41.13-PM.png"><img title="Twitter scam caught by Twitter authorities" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-09-at-6.41.13-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 09 at 6.41.13 PM Twitter Hack Could Cause Problems: The Latest Hack Got My Password (StalkTrak)" width="371" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, that&#039;s what it looks like when you walk into a Twitter ambush. You go off on a link from someone (I did not know the original &#034;stalk&#034; tweeter) and give authorization to an app and then your stream gets flooded with crap. I&#039;ve seen a similar scam on Facebook, usually with sex-ish topics in their pictures and subject lines.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to warn you about  LTwitteri. Stay away, check your Twitter Authorizations and change your password. Stay safe out there.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;">[This is an unsolicited, un-sponsored review of Gaug.es. No promotional money or incentives were offered.]</span></p>
<p>Why would you pay for analytics when Google Analytics is free?</p>
<p>This little package <strong><a title="Gaug.es is a wonderful little analytics package" href="http://get.gaug.es/" target="_blank">gaug.es</a></strong> might just be one answer.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaug.es/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19087" title="Gaug.es logo and tab overview" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.49.05-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 08 at 11.49.05 AM New Simple Analytics Package, Gaug.es, Worth Paying For, the Micro Review" width="213" height="97" /></a></p>
<p>At $6 per month, I was skeptical, but kept coming back to the gaug.es dashboard during my free trial period and liking what I was seeing.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s the overview screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.48.49-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19088" title="gaug.es overview data screen" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.48.49-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 08 at 11.48.49 AM New Simple Analytics Package, Gaug.es, Worth Paying For, the Micro Review" width="491" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>And the Top Pages screen can really show you a lot of information about your deep content. How many posts are actually getting traffic? Do you know what your highest, overall, traffic generating pages are? Which ones continue to get hits months or years after they&#039;ve been written? Questions like these can lead you to some healthy content strategies about what to write next.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.53.30-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19089" title="Top Pages in Gaug.es" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.53.30-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 08 at 11.53.30 AM New Simple Analytics Package, Gaug.es, Worth Paying For, the Micro Review" width="445" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>Standard Referrers, Search, and Browsers Stats</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.55.55-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19090" title="Referrers, Search and Browsers in Gaug.es" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-08-at-11.55.55-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 08 at 11.55.55 AM New Simple Analytics Package, Gaug.es, Worth Paying For, the Micro Review" width="460" height="331" /></a></p>
<p>And the Current Visitors page. Now  has a map to pinpoint where your content is being consumed. This is again, more fun than useful, but that&#039;s part of the fascination with metrics. You can be obsessed by them, but opening GA is often a pain, and the internal WordPress plugin-type stats are often incomplete.</p>
<p>For my $6 a month, Gaug.es is a deal. And it got me thinking about the deeper content on my blog and how I can make the long tail SEO traffic work for me.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18675" style="border-width: 5px; border-color: white; border-style: solid;" title="delurk yourself and say something" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-10.14.52-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 07 at 10.14.52 AM Pulling You Out of the Lurker Mode; How Can We Make It Easier To Connect?" width="124" height="57" /></p>
<p>I would do almost anything, short of pay you money or beg, to get your input on this blog. So what does it take to get a conversation going these days?</p>
<p>Here are a few of the patterns that I&#039;m noticing.</p>
<ul>
<li>People are happier to LIKE something than to comment on it. (It&#039;s better than nothing, but it doesn&#039;t really add to the conversation.)</li>
<li>Some people like to comment on my posts on the Facebook link rather than on the site. I asked a social media friend about this and he said, &#034;I click over to your site, read the post [um, maybe he does] and then I make my comment on Facebook, because I&#039;m already there.&#034; So it&#039;s easier sometimes to comment on the system that we know and <del>love</del> tollerate.</li>
<li>Systems like Disqus actually discourage comments. Well, this may be the case, but the experience once someone has engaged using Disqus is fantastic. I&#039;m willing to keep the comments damped down, to have a Disqus experience once they have decided to engage. [I might need to look at this decision. What do you think? Oh, and please comment here using Disqus.]</li>
<li>Sometimes it&#039;s the random incidental Tweet that gets a response. Something about coffee or music or TGIF.</li>
<li>Political discussions on Facebook are really fun. Especially when the haven&#039;t-been-doing-this-long users hope into a liberal discussion and have no clue how to respond, but to fall back on tea party talking points and NObama epithets. [Sorry, I didn't mean to go political.]</li>
<li>People engage when there is something they want. I just had a run of connections with people I hadn&#039;t heard from in over a year, when I posted that I had open invites to Google+.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, 85% of browsers on the web are simply skimming and way to busy to comment. You know how you can get the gist of a post in the first few sentences? The web is kinda like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#039;re all looking for something when we come on line. Distraction. Entertainment. Support. And going beyond a minute or so on any one blog or post is asking a lot. Something in the content has to be engaging you on a personal, this is immediately relevant, level. And when that alchemy happens, the comments can take off. Again, primarily by the high-sharers.</p>
<p>Another method for delurking lurkers is to say something controversial. Ignite the conversation by being inflammatory. But that&#039;s a double edged sword, that must be used carefully.</p>
<p>So what (I am kinda asking, but not begging, for your response here) can content producers do to entice you out of the lurk and into the conversation? And the real kicker here is, I&#039;m REALLY asking this question of the LURKERS. (Waves. &#034;Hi There.&#034;)</p>

<p>You&#039;ve written a great post. You&#039;ve posted it and tweeted it. What else can you do to get the word out, to engage your first-time visitors? Here&#039;s the 10th discipline of social media, socializing your content effectively.</p>
<div id="attachment_17566" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 648px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/socializing-contentmcelhenney"><img class="size-full wp-image-17566 " title="Socialize Your Content - The 10th Discipline of Social Media" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-05-at-10.57.59-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 05 at 10.57.59 AM The 10th Discipline of Social Media; Socializing Your Content Effectively " width="638" height="443" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click on image to view fullscreen on Slideshare.net (downloadable PowerPoint file)</p></div>
<p>So even beyond having all the great social tools on you site, as seen in the slide above, it is critical that you begin to use the social networks as well.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the post, go through the process of clicking on each one of the social network types and adding your own entry for your post. Yes, it&#039;s okay to Digg your own content.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s are the top 10 referral networks leading to this blog over the last 30 days:</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-05-at-11.11.01-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-17570 alignnone" title="referral traffic to uber.la - socializing your content" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-05-at-11.11.01-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 05 at 11.11.01 AM The 10th Discipline of Social Media; Socializing Your Content Effectively " width="258" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>The only one I&#039;m surprised by is the <a title="I don't like it, but you can build a newspaper like page of content" href="http://paper.li" target="_blank">Paper.li</a> traffic. I pretty much hate the &#034;daily&#034; publications people are posting, as if they are creating content. But it&#039;s part of the social network that sometime shows an impact on my traffic. And I can tell you the Twitter number is actually about 9X that number, Google only tracks Twitter links from Twitter.com.</p>
<p>And here&#039;s the most valuable socializing tip I can give you: <strong>Post your content to your LinkedIN Groups.</strong> (Don&#039;t spam them, but one or two a week, as long as the content is related to the group.) My &#034;time on site&#034; and &#034;pages per visit&#034; stats are HUGE with LinkedIN.</p>
<p>So get out there are network your stuff. And here&#039;s one last tid bit. Yesterday a single Tweet from a Twitter authority drove over 500 views to my site in less than an hour. That&#039;s traffic I can&#039;t pay for. But I can say thank you as many ways as possible. And you can bet I&#039;m paying attention to that Twitter account. It was <strong>@<a title="TweetSmarter on Twitter, amazing tips and social media education" href="http://twitter.com/tweetsmarter" target="_blank">tweetsmarter</a></strong>, and I&#039;d suggest you get over there and check out what they&#039;ve built. (My own social way of saying thank you.)</p>

Yesterday a single Tweet from a Twitter authority drove over 500 views to my site in less than an hour. That's traffic I can't pay for. But I can say thank you as many ways as possible. And you can bet I'm paying attention to that Twitter account. It was @tweetsmarter, and I'd suggest you get over there and check out what they've built.

<p><strong>UPDATED 7-7-11 (final update):</strong> God bless Dell. They have done so much for Austin and even my career. But this is the cherry on top of bad summer ads.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-7.21.52-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18527" title="Dell's July 7th Summer ad - 2011" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-7.21.52-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 07 at 7.21.52 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="530" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>This time there is no offer. Free shipping is not an incentive! They&#039;re talking about the Big Weekend, but that was kind of last weekend. And 4 days? Most people&#039;s weekends are only 2 days. You know they have to do this. They have to keep pounding out the deals and coupons, but at some point, to the consumer, it&#039;s just noise, junk mail, spam. Even if I asked for it. (AdAge has a great article on <a title="AdAge The Discounting Disease" href="http://adage.com/article/al-ries/discounting-s-disease-positioning-cure/228557/" target="_blank">The Discounting Disease</a>, that makes my point.)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED 7-5-11:</strong> Dell&#039;s newest summer message/deal is much clearer. And the actual offer is at the top of the page. Well done. Sort of.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-07-05-at-7.52.13-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17538" title="Dell's July 5th Student deal" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-07-05-at-7.52.13-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 05 at 7.52.13 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="522" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>The almost got some humans into the shot. Hey is that a scene from The Social Network? Kinda looks like Zuck. Um, but how does Dell claim it has &#034;the thinnest 15&#034; PC in the world&#034;? Are they counting some technicality I don&#039;t know about? And is thin really the most important feature? [At this price you're pushing up against the Mac.] Nope, that&#039;s the price and the free X-Box. At least with this ad we know what&#039;s what.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED 6-24-11:</strong> You didn&#039;t really think the deals were going to end, now did you? Here&#039;s the latest &#034;Limited Offer&#034; to show up in my inbox.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-24-at-7.33.46-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15600" title="Dell's need to drive deals to drive sales never stops" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-24-at-7.33.46-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 06 24 at 7.33.46 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="519" height="95" /></a></p>
<p>And is &#034;free standard shipping&#034; really a HOT selling point? And the real problem with a deal-addicted company like Dell, is you can never tell when you are getting the best &#034;deal.&#034; Spend any time on their site and you find so many &#034;deals&#034; that comparing prices and coupons and special offers is almost impossible. And this ultimately causes people to NOT BUY, because they think the better deal is just around the corner, or more likely, at Best Buy, where Dell has to compete along side Apple, HP, Toshiba, Acer and Samsung. Visit Dell.com and ask yourself, &#034;<strong>What&#039;s the deal?</strong>&#034; Prepare to be overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED 6-20-11:</strong> And the END of DELL&#039;S SUMMER DEALS is TODAY!</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-7.50.51-AM.png"><img title="Last Day to Save with Dell's Summer Deals, REALLY?" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-7.50.51-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 06 20 at 7.50.51 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="428" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, this might very well be the LAST BIG DEAL OF THE SUMMER from Dell. But somehow I bet they&#039;ve got a few more lined up right behind this one. The false urgency is what irritates me. Driving demand through some sense of &#034;holy cow if we don&#039;t buy this amazing computer today, tomorrow we&#039;re gonna pay twice as much&#034; mumbo jumbo. Who believes this stuff? And who wants to be I get a NEW DELL DEAL this week?</p>
<p><strong>++ The original post ++</strong></p>
<p>Two promotional &#034;summer&#034; emails arrived in my inbox this morning. And the stark contrast between Apple and Dell could not be clearer. Here are two slides I presented today on SlideShare.net, that cover the huge differences in the Dell and Apple approach. The presentation is available for full-screen viewing and downloading as a PowerPoint presentation here: <a title="Comparing Apple and Dell with their Summer promo emails" href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/apple-dellsummeradsmcelhenney" target="_blank">Apple and Dell Summer Ads</a> (powerpoint)</p>
<p>Here are the screen grabs of that presentation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/apple-dellsummeradsmcelhenney"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14171" title="Apple's Summer Promo Email" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-8.55.08-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 06 16 at 8.55.08 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="553" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>and then Dell:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/apple-dellsummeradsmcelhenney"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14174" title="Dell's summer promo offers, June 2011" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-9.20.14-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 06 16 at 9.20.14 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="442" height="304" /></a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 6-17-11:</strong> I missed the <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>actual offer</strong></span> in my initial post. Thanks to a comment I went and looked at the rest of the ad. Here&#039;s the REAL summer offer Dell was pushing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmacofearth/apple-dellsummeradsmcelhenney"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14402" title="Dell's summer promo offer, page 2, june 2011" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-17-at-8.46.26-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 06 17 at 8.46.26 AM Apple vs Dell: The Summer Promo Deals In Your Inbox" width="483" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">* thanks to the dr. who fan that commented below</span></p>
<p>I think the contrast is remarkable.</p>
<p>Apple does not compete on price and therefore their &#034;offer&#034; is actually a gift card from their online app store.</p>
<p>Dell on the other hand, competes on price and even competes with itself on price. Does any consumer think that the SPECIAL, or LIMITED TIME OFFER will not be made even better tomorrow, when Dell unveils their NEXT SALE? I believe Dell thinks urgency is the key to selling computers. Now, Today, Limited Offer, Today&#039;s Offer, 30 Days of Offers, 365 Days of Offers. But their Big Savings Everyday slogan sounds more like Walmart.</p>
<p>But then again, perhaps <strong>Dell is the Walmart of computers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(an hour after initial posting): Major ah ha. Apple is about the people. (human in ad is happy, dreaming of better things) Dell is about the computer. (no human, only prices). Visualise this brand strategy for me.</p>
<p><strong>Apple = Human</strong><br />
<strong> Dell = Computer</strong></p>

<p>We&#039;ve all done it. Sent out the link or youtube video suggestion with zero context or added value. The Tweets and Shares look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funny video &#8211;  http://xyz.com</li>
<li>Check this out - http://xyz.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Those look a bit like this example of a common Twitter hack.</p>
<div><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-11-at-1.59.43-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19902" title="a common twitter hack" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-11-at-1.59.43-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 11 at 1.59.43 PM The Social Sharing Golden Rule: And What Excites You About That?" width="203" height="55" /></a></div>
<p>If you don&#039;t want you sharing to be ignored. Give a bit more info.</p>
<p>And we often make random tweets or comments that are more like talking to ourselves than to an anticipatory audience of &#034;followers.&#034;</p>
<ul>
<li>You mean it could all be my LowT? Oh Pharma how you taunt me, promising the fountain of youth.</li>
</ul>
<p>But some of the worst offenders are the gowalla/4square check-ins that have no additional information.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am at McDonalds in Tempe AZ.</li>
<li>I&#039;m just ousted the Mayor of Starbucks on Cedar Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here&#039;s the new golden rule of social sharing. (And I am writing this to myself, also, I tweet a lot of bs, I&#039;m sure)</p>
<p>Before you hit the &#034;share,&#034; &#034;comment,&#034; or &#034;check-in&#034; button, ask yourself, &#034;<strong>And what excites you about that?</strong>&#034; and try to add that extra tidbit of content on as part of the social share. Here&#039;s an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#034;I am at the Whole Foods Downtown, waiting for a 15-minute chair massage on a Friday afternoon. We&#039;ve almost made it to the long weekend.&#034;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several parts of this post that are exciting. Friday, massage, Whole Foods. It gives a little more to engage with. And yes, it&#039;s that simple. If you&#039;re gonna check in, or send a funny link, tell us why you are excited about it. Add the human part that a Twitter Coupon, Facebook Clone, Auto-Bot cannot generate. A bit of story to go along with your share.</p>
<p>If you can&#039;t articulate a quick&#8211;why this is exciting&#8211;then you might reconsider telling us all about it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7-4-11:</strong> Maybe I&#039;m overreaching on this. I know a friend in the Twitterati who recently BLOCKED my account. What? I know I gave him a poke when he would check in with the &#034;I&#039;m at&#8230;&#034; generic Gowalla&#039;s from time to time, but that was well over a year ago. I guess social media never forgets. He responded, back then, with a &#034;What&#039;s it to you?&#034; And I dutifully responded, &#034;Well, I was just curious why your &#034;I&#039;m at&#034; checkin at Starbucks was of interest. Are you trying to be the mayor?&#034;</p>
<p>And then most likely an unfollow from then on. I still had this liminary in my ATX friends list, so his tweets popped up from time to time. And even when I was genuinely interested in his topic, my @s were ignored. Okay, unfollowed and ignored, I get that. So this morning, as I was working some twitter lists and adding social media &#034;experts&#034; to my twitterstream, I came across this person&#039;s Twitter account again. And alas in some Unfollow of those not Following me I had Unfollowed him. I guess. But when I click on his &#034;FOLLOW&#034; button here&#039;s what I got.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-04-at-9.13.31-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17434" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="The Twitter BLOCK message" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-04-at-9.13.31-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 04 at 9.13.31 AM The Social Sharing Golden Rule: And What Excites You About That?" width="446" height="46" /></a></p>
<p>Oh well, maybe his tweet will come up in a #hashtag search sometime, cause he&#039;s definately not interested in having me participate in his Twitter world. That&#039;s fine. Disappointing. But people can block and unfollow and tweet at who ever they like. So, to you, blockers, so sorry to miss your valuable Tweets. Not so sorry to miss your generic &#034;I&#039;m at&#034; GEO check-ins.</p>
<p>But the real sadness comes from missing out on this person&#039;s wisdom. I can&#039;t even have them in a list, they&#039;ve removed any opportunity for engagement. That&#039;s what I was working on the entire time. Even when I poked him about his Starbucks checkins. My loss, I&#039;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>Funny Note:</strong> Just as I&#039;m posting this, my now-blocked friend posted a SB check-in. At least this time he included a picture of his coffee. That&#039;s *some* context. And I&#039;ve been known to tweet &#034;I&#039;m here now, lookin at this cup of coffee&#034; posts.</p>

<p>++ and now back to the post ++</p>
<p>Why are the Twitter continuance rates so bad? Why do so many people try Twitter and then leave? <strong>Up to 80% of new Twitter users will stop using the service within a month.</strong> What&#039;s wrong with this statistic? Is Twitter hard to use? Part of the problem is definitely the spammers.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&#039;ve written a lot about Twitter in the past few years. And some of it is &#034;how to&#034; some of it is &#034;here&#039;s how I think you should do it,&#034; and much of it is &#034;auto-bot, twitter spammers, and pornsters are killing twitter, here&#039;s how to fight back.&#034; So I guess there might be a problem. And it&#039;s not getting better.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was amazed when my Twitter Follower count (how many people are subscribed to my tweets) went up by several hundred in one day. What I was more amazed by was the list of some of my new followers.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-02-at-6.24.05-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17138" title="a new breed of Twitter spam" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-02-at-6.24.05-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 02 at 6.24.05 PM Auto Bots Are Killing Twitter; Why Auto Social & Robot Social is Bad for Social" width="313" height="418" /></a></p>
<p>And this was a long list. What&#039;s going on here?</p>
<p>Jibberish Twitter IDs and random names. What&#039;s the point? What&#039;s the game with creating a bunch of zombie Twitter accounts? How does that provide value or commerce for anything? And then this morning I am reminded of these type services.</p>

<p>A site that will do it all for you. Let the robots do all your Twitter management. And guaranteed followers. Perhaps the two things are connected.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-03-at-6.44.14-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17146" title="And how they talk about themselves says a lot, SPAM" src="http://uber.la/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-03-at-6.44.14-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 07 03 at 6.44.14 AM Auto Bots Are Killing Twitter; Why Auto Social & Robot Social is Bad for Social" width="635" height="119" /></a></p>
<p>Automatic Twitter Software. Ah, very nice. Auto what? Auto-SPAM. I love the idea of MASS TWEETS. What the heck do you suppose that is? Will this crap software write the tweets for you? In what language, ESL?</p>
<p>Okay, so Twitter is hard to learn. And trying to sift through the barrage of auto-SPAM-tweets is one of the most arduous tasks. And the &#034;adder&#034; &#8230; well,  different *adder* comes to mind when I see their name.</p>

<p>Yah know, the adder is a pretty bad ass snake, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so what can we do to fight back?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#039;t auto anything</strong>? In social auto is bad. It turns social into robot-social. And unless you are a machine or a coupon outlet, you need to express your humaness with every tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Report spammy Tweeters</strong>. You can use the &#034;Report as Spam function on Twitter.com&#034; or you can use a tool like <strong><a title="A quick way to eliminate spammy followers" href="http://www.twitblock.org/" target="_blank">TwitBlock</a></strong> to cull the crap.</li>
<li><strong>Use a tool like <a title="How to use Klout to improve your social media experience" href="http://uber.la/2011/06/klout/">Klout</a></strong> to up your own reputation online and learn what followers are REAL and which ones are bots.</li>
<li>And spread the word. <strong>Let people know that Auto-DMs piss you off</strong>.</li>
<li>Ask <a title="About geo-locating check-ins" href="http://uber.la/2010/09/goin-geo-i-am-the-mayor-of-my-mind/" target="_blank">auto-checkin friends</a> why they checked-in at McDonalds?</li>
<li>And then try and <strong>tweet like a human</strong>. As they say, you only get what you give.</li>
</ol>
