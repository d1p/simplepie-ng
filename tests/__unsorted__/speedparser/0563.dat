Internal company documents show that the company made those sales through foreign subsidiaries, thwarting a U.S. trade ban. Koch Industries units have also rigged prices with competitors, lied to regulators and repeatedly run afoul of environmental regulations, resulting in five criminal convictions since 1999 in the U.S. and Canada.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2011 10:50:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://lgrd.co/ppwo47</guid><word_count>7127</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Asjylyn Loder and David Evans</author><publication>Bloomberg</publication><publish_date>2011-10-02 10:50:54</publish_date></item><item><title>Tweet Science&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;New York Magazine&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Oct. 3, 2011&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Minutes (6,151 words)</title><link>http://lgrd.co/oJj14d</link><description>The intense pressure to convert Twitter into a profitable business, and before a tech bubble pops, is palpable here. And it’s happening as the company struggles with an interlocked set of existential questions, starting with the most basic one possible: What is Twitter? Initially, the idea was of a kind of adrenalized Facebook, with friends communicating with friends in short bursts—and indeed, Facebook rushed to borrow Twitter’s innovations so it wouldn’t be left ­behind. But as Twitter grew, it finally ­became clear to Twitter’s brain trust that the relevant analogy was not a social network but a broadcast system—the birth of a different sort of TV.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2011 06:04:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://lgrd.co/oJj14d</guid><word_count>6151</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Joe Hagan</author><publication>New York Magazine</publication><publish_date>2011-10-03 06:04:27</publish_date></item><item><title>How a 'Parks and Recreation' pitch becomes a joke, part 1: Inside the writers room&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;HitFix&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sep. 29, 2011&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Minutes (2,323 words)</title><link>http://lgrd.co/n2Xo5A</link><description>Writers rooms may vary in terms of the decor or the available food ("Everybody Loves Raymond" was always the champ in that regard), but the basic atmosphere is the same from room to room, show to show.

Yesterday’s hearing came hard on the heels of a contentious gathering at the Pershing Auditorium in Lincoln on Tuesday and was one of eight such listening sessions crammed into a week of marathon hearings in cities and small towns across the six states the pipeline would cross, all in an effort to settle whether such a project is in the national interest.

We'd known Animal since grade school: the north-born shitkicker, like Mick Dundee. A lone ranger, or something. Then in 2002 the three of us crammed into his '67 Camaro to tear-ass down the Trans-Canada at eighty miles an hour. Vic and me had a couple hundred bucks and time to kill before she went back to university. That'd make it August, or just so. Animal had a way of not caring too much and a way of hitting on Vic. He was twenty-six and hunted looking, with engine-grease stubble and red eyes sunk past his cheekbones.

It’s mid-September and the wiry billionaire founder of Amazon.com is at his brand new corporate headquarters in Seattle, in a building named “Day One South” after his conviction that 17-year-old Amazon is still in its infancy. Almost giddy with excitement, Bezos retrieves one by one the new crop of dirt-cheap Kindle e-readers—they start at $79—from a hidden perch on a chair tucked into a conference room table. When he’s done showing them off, he stands up, and, for an audience of a single journalist, announces, “Now, I’ve got one more thing to show you.” He waits a half-beat to make sure the reference to Jobs’ famous line from Apple presentations hasn’t been missed, then gives his notorious barking laugh. With that, Bezos pulls out the Kindle Fire, Amazon’s long-anticipated tablet computer—and the first credible response to the Apple iPad.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 10:43:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://lgrd.co/q8FZVP</guid><word_count>4239</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Brad Stone</author><publication>Businessweek</publication><publish_date>2011-09-28 00:00:00</publish_date></item><item><title>Scientist in a Strange Land&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Popular Science&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sep. 26, 2011&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Minutes (5,736 words)</title><link>http://lgrd.co/pukwHs</link><description>[Not single-page] The research, financed mostly by NASA and published initially in the online edition of &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, jolted the scientific community.

His agent, Bud Holmes, handled most of the necessary filings and contacts regarding Payton's quest to own an NFL team. His accountant, Jerry Richman, handled financial matters. Quirk and, later, Tucker, managed the day-to-day running of his charity. Now, thanks to that pampering, upon his retirement in the winter of 1988 as the NFL's alltime leading rusher, Payton found himself burdened by a realization that had struck thousands of ex-athletes before him: &lt;i&gt;I am bored out of my mind.&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 08:37:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://lgrd.co/qdQjQT</guid><word_count>6734</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Jeff Pearlman</author><publication>Sports Illustrated</publication><publish_date>2011-10-03 08:37:56</publish_date></item><item><title>Moving Day&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fictionaut&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;May. 10, 2010&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Minutes (3,022 words)</title><link>http://lgrd.co/nz50vC</link><description>(Fiction) I didn't hear that Duncan Pratt had been killed until I'd been out of the Army for two weeks and had gone four days without a single thought about that final year in Vietnam.

But among the extremely middle-aged, births aren’t just inching up. They are booming. In 2008, the most recent year for which detailed data are available, about 8,000 babies were born to women 45 or older, more than double the number in 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Five hundred and forty-one of these were born to women age 50 or older—a 375 percent increase. In adoption, the story is the same. Nearly a quarter of adopted children in the U.S. have parents more than 45 years older than they are.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 09:40:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://lgrd.co/odlgZ8</guid><word_count>5895</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Lisa Miller</author><publication>New York Magazine</publication><publish_date>2011-09-26 09:40:53</publish_date></item><item><title>Diary: Which One of You Is Jesus?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;London Review of Books&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sep. 22, 2011&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Minutes (4,405 words)</title><link>http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n18/jenny-diski/diary</link><description>In 1959, Dr Milton Rokeach, a social psychologist, received a research grant to bring together three psychotic, institutionalised patients at Ypsilanti State Hospital in Michigan, in order to make a two and a half year study of them. Rokeach specialised in belief systems: how it is that people develop and keep (or change) their beliefs according to their needs and the requirements of the social world they inhabit. A matter of the inside coming to terms with the outside in order to rub along well enough to get through a life. As a rule people look for positive authority or referents to back up their essential beliefs about themselves in relation to the world: the priest, imam, Delia Smith, the politburo, gang leader, Milton Friedman, your mother, my favourite novelist. It works well enough, and when it does, we call ourselves and others like us sane. When it goes awry, when people lose and/or reject all positive referents in the real world for the self inside, we call them delusional, psychotic, mad. </description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 09:36:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n18/jenny-diski/diary</guid><word_count>4405</word_count><reading_time>None</reading_time><author>Jenny Diski</author><publication>London Review of Books</publication><publish_date>2011-09-22 09:36:18</publish_date></item></channel></rss>
