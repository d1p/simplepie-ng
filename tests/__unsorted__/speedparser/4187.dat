		<book_description><![CDATA[Awarded 2008 &quot;Best Information Science Book&quot; by the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T).    Scholars in all fields now have access to an unprecedented wealth of online information, tools, and services. The Internet lies at the core of an information infrastructure for distributed, data-intensive, and collaborative research. Although much attention has been paid to the new technologies making this possible, from digitized books to sensor networks, it is the underlying social and policy changes that will have the most lasting effect on the scholarly enterprise. In Scholarship in the Digital Age, Christine Borgman explores the technical, social, legal, and economic aspects of the kind of infrastructure that we should be building for scholarly research in the twenty-first century.    Borgman describes the roles that information technology plays at every stage in the life cycle of a research project and contrasts these new capabilities with the relatively stable system of scholarly communication, which remains based on publishing in journals, books, and conference proceedings. No framework for the impending &quot;data deluge&quot; exists comparable to that for publishing. Analyzing scholarly practices in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, Borgman compares each discipline's approach to infrastructure issues. In the process, she challenges the many stakeholders in the scholarly infrastructure—scholars, publishers, libraries, funding agencies, and others—to look beyond their own domains to address the interaction of technical, legal, economic, social, political, and disciplinary concerns. Scholarship in the Digital Age will provoke a stimulating conversation among all who depend on a rich and robust scholarly environment.]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[Winner, ICA 2009 Outstanding Book Award given by the International Communication Association. and Winner, 2009 CITASA Book Award given by the Communication and Information Technologies Section of the American Sociological Association    While the public and the media have been distracted by the story of Napster, warnings about the evils of &quot;piracy,&quot; and lawsuits by the recording and film industries, the enforcement of copyright law in the digital world has quietly shifted from regulating copying to regulating the design of technology. Lawmakers and commercial interests are pursuing what might be called a technical fix: instead of specifying what can and cannot be done legally with a copyrighted work, this new approach calls for the strategic use of encryption technologies to build standards of copyright directly into digital devices so that some uses are possible and others rendered impossible. In Wired Shut, Tarleton Gillespie examines this shift to “technical copy protection&quot; and its profound political, economic, and cultural implications.    Gillespie reveals that the real story is not the technological controls themselves but the political, economic, and cultural arrangements being put in place to make them work. He shows that this approach to digital copyright depends on new kinds of alliances among content and technology industries, legislators, regulators, and the courts, and is changing the relationship between law and technology in the process. The film and music industries, he claims, are deploying copyright in order to funnel digital culture into increasingly commercial patterns that threaten to undermine the democratic potential of a network society.    In this broad context, Gillespie examines three recent controversies over digital copyright: the failed effort to develop copy protection for portable music players with the Strategic Digital Music Initiative (SDMI); the encryption system used in DVDs, and the film industry's legal response to the tools that challenged them; and the attempt by the FCC to mandate the &quot;broadcast flag&quot; copy protection system for digital television. In each, he argues that whether or not such technical constraints ever succeed, the political alignments required will profoundly shape the future of cultural expression in a digital age.]]></book_description>

		<book_description><![CDATA[Creator to Consumer in a Digital Age provides a snapshot of the Australian book production industry at the beginning of the new millennium. We find an industry in transition between the old economy of mass production, and the new technologically enhanced economy that enables mass customisation.  <p>Written as a joint project between Common Ground Publishing and RMIT University, and based on research funded under the Infrastructure and Industry Competitiveness Scheme (EPICS) of the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources our report scopes developments of both marketing and technology. We make a three-fold case for the future of the book within a reinvigorated Australian book production industry: a business case, a technological case and cultural case.  <p>In so doing, we canvass a number of issues including:  <p>the interests of current stakeholders in the supply chain  <p>the current state of play ion digital publishing trends:  <p>business models for the future  <p>viable e-text markets and technologically-mediated text:  <p>changes to print technologies  <p>the book and its place as a carrier of cultural information  <p>copyright in a digital age  <p>multilingualism in cyberspace  <p>as well as providing a number of case studies, centres on academic research and other nice publishing requirements, illustrating the creator to consumer (C-2-C) system as a solution to both supply chain and market inefficiencies.  <p>Australia is ideally located geographically and developmentally, to make a constructive contribution to new and emerging global information economies. This landmark compilation provides all industry players with a reference point, and stimulus for thinking strategically about how to move forward. It also provides a framework for assessing the most appropriate infrastructural support, from all tiers of government for the industry as a whole.  <p>Research Objectives  <p>The intention of this project was to assist the Australian book printing and publishing industries as they shift into new generation technologies. The project involved:  <p>industry needs analysis - seeking the views of key players in the book production supply chain regarding technical, business and cultural prospects for Australian book production.  <p>development of materials for RMIT degree courses training programs on the convergence of e-Books (internet accessible) and d-Books (digitally printed books), and planning of a program of industry-wide e-Book and d-Book seminars.  <p>The project aimed to foster broad industry collaborations around the development of business systems and supply chain relationships including printers, publishers and equipment manufacturers.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>]]></book_description>
