I just found out that the composition client on my phone was quite happily feeding me an error message and leaving the previous post as an unpublished draft while the server was quite happily publishing the post.</p>
<p>On to the fun bits.  This weekend was fairly productive for the garden.  We finally got the Irish moss in the ground on Friday.  We also put in some <q>Confetti Garden</q> flowers.  They&#8217;re a fairly generic bundle of small flowers that say they&#8217;re suited for full to partial shade.</p>
<p>I also planted a handful of mini-pots that are on the window to germinate.  We have: a pepper planting in the mini-greenhouse from last year, three strawberry pots, a marigold, and an oregano (if I remember right).</p>
<p>Sunday, we drove out to the farm market because our daughter had finally fallen asleep (in the car).  We picked up a couple melon plants, a couple cucumber plants, and a few more partial shade flowers.  Then, we followed a sign for &#8216;Fresh Strawberries&#8217;.  We were expecting to find another farm market, but we found a <acronym title="pick-your-own">PYO</acronym> farm.  They&#8217;re called <a href="http://mackintoshfruitfarm.com/">Mackintosh Fruit Farm</a>.  They grow apples, peaches, pears, strawberries (which taste lovely), cherries, raspberries, and pawpaws.  Most of this is available for PYO when it&#8217;s in season.</p>

The only reason that this is important is that for the first time ever, I am using produce from the garden.  Tonight&#8217;s dinner will be baked tilapia with olive oil, rosemary, oregano, and thyme.  While we did have herbs growing (very well) last year, we never used them because of their location.  They were near the corner of the house farthest from the kitchen.  The new herbs are growing in a container on the front porch which is a little closer and <strong>a lot</strong> more convenient.  If you ever find that you want to grow herbs, make sure they&#8217;re not an effort to harvest (especially if it&#8217;s raining as it was for me last night).</p>

They are so good at it that the composter they bought several years ago is now in my back garden because they never put it up.  So, we now have two bin style composters and one tumbler.  We&#8217;re loading the tumbler first on the basis that it doesn&#8217;t handle ongoing additions very well.  It&#8217;s getting all the kitchen scraps and last piles of leaves.  When I get the chance, the leaf mould pile will be added to it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added some oregano and parsley to the planter with the rosemary.  We have a small pot of thyme that needs to go in a bigger pot, but that has to wait for free time.  The herbs we planted out in the garden last year look like they have come back after dying (we thought) under the snow.</p>
<p>I still need to get the Irish moss put in.</p>

Specifically, we had snow.  Two days before, it had been around 18&deg;C (63&deg;F).  We through some plastic bags over the plants, but the blueberries are looking kind of pathetic.  They have about five leaves between the two of them (we bought them as bare bushes).  The leaves looked like they were healthy near the stem, but the outer half of the leaf is kind of wilted looking.</p>

<p>First, we bought some new plants.  We now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>two blueberry bushes growing in a big storage tub</li>
<li>four strawberry plants in two large terracotta pots</li>
<li>two rosemary plants in a five-gallon bucket</li>
<li>some lavender we had seeded in a big pot last year</li>
<li>some broadcast-seeded catnip in the kind of shady patch between our house and the neighbours&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also bought some Irish moss to go in that shady bit.  This is all added to the existing yard plantings:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Russian sage &#8211; a truly beautiful plant when it&#8217;s in bloom; I don&#8217;t like a lot of plants that are just there for decoration because of my allergies, but this just looks awesome.</li>
<li>some <em>really</em> random daffodils &#8211; they&#8217;re in the middle of the yard.  I thought I had seen them last spring, but my father-in-law mowed them after the flowers faded, so I couldn&#8217;t find them.  I put some of the cheap wire fencing around them this year.  After they die back this year, I plan to lift them and replant them near the front steps.</li>
<li>two ornamental grass clumps &#8211; the previous owners don&#8217;t seem to have had a real plan.</li>
<li>a small conifer which I think might be on its way to the firewood pile &#8211; it&#8217;s almost yellow and is planted under the edge of a much older tree&#8217;s crown.</li>
<li>two unidentified deciduous trees &#8211; I need to get samples when they leaf this year and figure out what they are.</li>
<li>a bunch of ill-planned bushes &#8211; they were planted right against the walk when they were significantly smaller.  Now that they have grown, at least one of them has smaller roots in the concrete walk which is rapidly disintegrating.  They&#8217;re also pushing the fence off its posts.  We&#8217;ve decided that we want to replace them with something that doesn&#8217;t require trimming several times a year.  If we redo the fence, we might put in some blackberries and raspberries; this would leave the wildlife corridor, and also make it productive.</li>
<li>some small flowering bushes in planting bed &#8211; my mother-in-law told me what they are, but they fell into the &#8216;decorative plant in a fiddly location&#8217; category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, I have rebuilt the front gate again.  This time, I got some really evil-looking screws, metal hinges (which still need to be put on), and a hook closure instead of the basic automatic latch.</p>
<p>Third, we&#8217;ve been picking up the walk bits and storing them for use as container drainage.  Last spring, I bought a bag of the cheapest rock I could find at the hardware store and paid about US$3 or US$4 for 0.5 cubic feet.  The bits we picked up from the walk the past week or so came out being about 3 cubic feet for free (sort of; we will probably need to replace the walk, but since we already need to have the front stairs redone, not that big of a problem).</p>
<p>Fourth, we bought a new compost bin.  The tumbler is not practical for long-term waste use.  We&#8217;ll probably switch to loading it once a year with leaves in the fall.</p>
<p>Fifth, we have reseeded one of the bare patches in the lawn.  We&#8217;re using an all-in-one fertiliser/seed/soil mix.  My wife has told me that there are a few shoots coming up, but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to verify this myself.</p>
<p>To do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the rebuilt gate on its posts.</li>
<li>Finish clearing the broken walk bits &#8211; this gets tiring and tedious because the surface underneath the bits is rough, preventing easy sweeping of the little stuff.</li>
<li>Plant the carrots.</li>
<li>Look in to having the walk repoured.</li>
<li>Look in to having the steps repoured.</li>
