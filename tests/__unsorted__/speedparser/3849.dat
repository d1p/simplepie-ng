			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My boy has started liking to hear a story each night from whichever parent is present for bed time. It started out that he just wanted to hear us (my darling wife more particularly) tell a story. Then I got in on the action. Finally, just these past few days, he&#8217;s started telling stories back. He often incorporates an element or two from the other stories he&#8217;s heard, but he&#8217;s getting pretty creative. Tonight, I got three stories. They started like this:</p>
<p>-&#8221;One day, Susie (imaginary character from these stories) went to Lukey (my son)&#8217;s house. But Lukey wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221; At which point he fell apart in giggles.</p>
<p>- &#8220;One day, the stars were talking to each other. And then they couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>- &#8220;One day, the school buses were talking late late late in the dark time. And they forgot the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hysterical. The kid totally cracks me up!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the ramifications of that are, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s the case. Of course, it could be because you&#8217;re watching reality television, too. But then it&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re too busy with unimportant things.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My son comes up with creative ways to get his point across. One of my recent favorites is the word &#8220;Terrible.&#8221; As in,</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m terrible afraid my bandaid is going to fall off.&#8221; or</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, it&#8217;s terrible hard for me to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s got a good point. Terrible is a good modifier. He&#8217;s using it like very, which is almost accurate. It&#8217;s certainly not a complete understanding, but he&#8217;s really pretty close. And he only uses it to communicate the most dreadful of circumstances. (The bandaid, after all, had Diego on it. Losing the bandaid would&#8217;ve been&#8230; well, terrible.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s probably a lesson here for writers &#8212; one day, my little guy will be told stories about how he used to use terrible incorrectly. And he&#8217;ll be able to use it right. He&#8217;ll be shocked that he ever couldn&#8217;t use it right. Practice makes perfect. It works for writers too. Keep on writing. Always be learning. One day, you&#8217;ll be surprised at the mistakes you used to make.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcToH9tj92F8KALaxDZpSNd4OjH38K-wOQxKVAPyfFMMwT0l2rM" alt="ipad" width="48" height="48" />I&#8217;m starting to think that this is the challenge of this particular period of history. We are simply inundated with different ways to be overwhelmed with content. I say that as I write this while listening to a gadget podcast. And worry about the email notification in my dock that says I have 33 new emails since 9:30pm last night. And watch my facebook stream in another window.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, how much of the issue is the changing environment? How much of it might be our inability to say no to ourselves? Sure, it&#8217;s easier to envision focus in a world without 2 phones (and three voice mail systems) on my desk, combined with 2 email accounts, 3 video capable devices, (etc., etc.,). But, it&#8217;s not like there weren&#8217;t still distractions. Different? Sure. But maybe the bigger deal is the ability to say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not a good idea,&#8221; or, &#8220;No, that won&#8217;t create an effective work environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, now that I think about it, that&#8217;s probably always been the difference between people who get things done and people who don&#8217;t&#8230; the ability to say <em>no</em> to things that detract from effectiveness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather keep on blaming distraction on my gadgets and the white-noise they create, though.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caffeine that is. At least, in my case. Caffeine is my favorite coping mechanism. I don&#8217;t think I was aware of how true it was until I started working with a new employee and realized how often I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go fill my coffee cup and then we&#8217;ll&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s like my reset button, or something.</p>
<p>Once I noticed it, I realized that it tends to happen even more often in the midst of a creative task. It&#8217;s like I subconsciously reach the point of overload, and then I reset. I&#8217;m usually ready to roll once I get back to my desk.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your coping mechanism? Or, am I just crazy?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! We&#8217;ve made it through the holidays. I hope you all had as much fun as I did. Doubtful, but I still hope so. We had a blast around the Mackay household. Lots of playing games, building with new blocks, making things with playdough. And not a lot of Create!-ing going on. In fact, I encountered what may be one of the biggest roadblocks to creation in existence in a little iphone game called Angry Birds. It&#8217;s addictive. It&#8217;s silly. It&#8217;s fun. It keeps me from creating.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s helped me to realize that the environment in which I attempt to create is perhaps not as important as I thought. The reality is that in any environment, I&#8217;d find distractions. Creating has far more to do with putting down those distractions consciously and picking up your tool of choice. Lately mine has been a pen or a laptop, yours might be a hammer and a saw or a needle and thread.</p>
<p>In spite of the challenges, so far I&#8217;ve succeeded in at least pushing myself towards more creation. I&#8217;m not to the point of breaking-even on my consumption v creation challenge, but that&#8217;s the goal. I&#8217;d like to be creating with at least as much (if not more) time as I use consuming.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
