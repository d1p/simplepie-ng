It took all of a week before us lazy Americans decided that is a crazy amount of work. Never mind that many leading airlines offer this service.</p>
<p>The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) filed a <a class="offsite-link-inline" title="http://www.apfa.org/content/category/9/17/626/" href="http://www.apfa.org/content/category/9/17/626/" target="_blank">grievance</a>, and because &#8220;this is too much work and we&#8217;re lazy&#8221; isn&#8217;t cause for filing a grievance the APFA is conducting a survey asking if the bedding or act of changing into pajamas is a safety hazard on the aircraft. Again, never mind that many leading airlines already offer this service.</p>
<p>The survey, which can be found via the previous link, asks questions like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="_mcePaste">&ldquo;Were there any safety issues with the bedding before landing?&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">&ldquo;Were there any safety issues with the turndown service at all?&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">&ldquo;Were there lines for the lavs when passengers changed into/out of pajamas?&rdquo;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Service sucks in the USA because we Americans are lazy, and we&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;prove we are unable to provide quality service to our customers.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">Long story short, hackers are gaining access to popular South Korean gaming servers to prevent their accounts for being flagged for cheating. They are using scripts to automatically play Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games and gain gold and items which they then sell for real currency on places like Ebay. In turn the hackers get to keep 55% and the rest of the money gets forwarded to North Korean agents. South Korean officials tracked the money to the North Korean nuclear program and to Kim Jong-Il&rsquo;s purchases of Rolex watches which he uses to placate senior North Korean military officers.</div>

<p>12 years ago on this day&#8230;</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#8230; most people didn&#8217;t yet realize how much the story sucked - still in zOMG-THAT-WAS-AWESOME mode</li>
  <li>&#8230; I had no idea who played the decoy Queen Amidala (a girl named Keira Knightley or something)</li>
  <li>&#8230; I had an AMAZING Diamond Rio 600 32MB MP3 player (it could JUST hold an album at crappy bit-rates)</li>
  <li>&#8230; The very first iPod was still two years in the future</li>
  <li>&#8230; I had a Hotmail account (actually still do)</li>
  <li>&#8230; The CLOSEST thing I used to a &#8220;Social Network&#8221; was AIM</li>
  <li>&#8230; AsianAvenue was 2 years old by this time, but I didn&#8217;t use it</li>
  <li>&#8230; LiveJournal was one month old</li>
  <li>&#8230; I knew how to make a website, but it was fugly. WTF is CSS?</li>
  <li>&#8230; Apple was still in trouble and the iBook did not yet exist (although the colorful iMac was gaining popularity)</li>
  <li>&#8230; Mac OS 9 was still in development and Mac OS X was two years in the future  <li>&#8230; Tablets were a miseriable, horrible failure (as I type this in the SquareSpace iPad app)</li>
  <li>&#8230; Bluetooth 1.0 spec was defined, but almost no one knew what Bluetooth was</li>
  <li>&#8230; I had a computer with a brand new Pentium III processor (500 MHz) and an incredible 14GB hard drive</li>
  <li>&#8230; Zip Disks were the way people moved data</li>
  <li>&#8230; I searched the internet with DogPile</li>
  <li>&#8230; I used IE5 because, well, it was the best and Netscape 4.x was getting super-old
  <li>&#8230; I was still two years away from having a cell phone (the obligatory Nokia 33xx)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, this post makes me realize how MUCH happened in the year 2001.</p>

IE10 will bring CSS3 support, HTML5 support, and a few W3C APIs.</p>
<p>Typical for Microsoft, they were pretty tight lipped about the future of IE except to take a potshot at Chrome (and also Firefox) nothing that faster cadence (releasing more versions more often) does NOT mean more progress. True, but ideally it means more frequent security updates so&#8230;</p>
<p>The amazing thing about this preview was that IE10 (and therefore the version of Windows 7 running on the demo rig) was written to run on ARM. Exciting news.</p>
