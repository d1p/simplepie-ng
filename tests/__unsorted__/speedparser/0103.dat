<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am fine, it was an ocular migraine!&#0160; </p>  <p>That is a very important first sentence because yesterday I went to the Mount Sinai Emergency with one of the 5 signs of a stroke – vision problems.&#0160;&#0160; </p>  <p>All of a sudden, while I was in a cab I could not see.&#0160; More accurately I could see, but what I saw looked like chaos – 2 streams of visual data coming in at the same time.&#0160; Colours, bright, shapes, out of focus, and completely unrecognizable.&#0160; Kind of like a kaleidoscope without any patterns at all. </p>  <p>Each eye was giving me different data and none of it made sense.&#0160; When my eyes were closed it was fine, normal. When my eyes were open it was terrifying and triggered dizziness, disorientation and vertigo.&#0160; I kept my eyes CLOSED most of the 20 minutes this was going on. Opening them just to see if it was better yet. Hoping it was better!</p>  <p>I was lucky. Gerry was with me. Gerry took me immediately to the hospital and it was only an ocular migraine (not something you want… but way way WAY better than a stroke.)&#0160; </p>  <p>Going to the hospital was the right choice because strokes can be treated especially if you respond FAST! There is a medication, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator">tPA</a>, which if taken within 3 hours of the time symptoms appear, can treat, reduce or eliminate the impact of a stroke.</p>  <p>That&#39;s why it is so important to recognize and respond to the warning signs.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weakness</strong> - Sudden loss of strength or sudden numbness in the face, arm or leg, even if temporary.</p>    <p><strong>Trouble speaking</strong> - Sudden difficulty speaking or understanding or sudden confusion, even if temporary.</p>    <p><strong>Vision problems</strong> - Sudden trouble with vision, even if temporary. </p>    <p><strong>Headache</strong> - Sudden severe and unusual headache. </p>    <p><strong>Dizziness</strong> - Sudden loss of balance, especially with any of the above signs. </p> </blockquote>  <p>The warning signs or symptoms of stroke may occur alone or in combination. They may last a few seconds or up to 24 hours, and then disappear.&#0160; Symptoms occur in a variety of ways, so <a href="http://www.unsweetened.ca/.a/6a00d83453f97269e2014e8bf87a62970d-pi"><img align="right" alt="signs-of-stroke" border="0" height="244" src="http://www.unsweetened.ca/.a/6a00d83453f97269e20153920496bd970b-pi" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="signs-of-stroke" width="180" /></a>the<b> FAST test </b>is an<b> </b>easy way to recognise and remember the most common signs of stroke.<b>&#0160; </b></p>  <p><b>FAST</b> stands for: </p>  <ul>   <li><b>F</b>acial weakness – can the person smile; have their mouth or eyes drooped? </li>    <li><b>A</b>rm weakness – can the person raise both arms? </li>    <li><b>S</b>peech difficulty – can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? </li>    <li><b>T</b>ime to act – act <b>FAST</b> and <b>call 911 immediately</b>.</li> </ul>  <p>If you or the person has a problem with any of these functions, dial 911 for an ambulance immediately or get to a hospital immediately. Remember, stroke is a life-threatening emergency.</p>  <p><strong>I did NOT have a stroke. </strong>I did have a symptom and went immediately to the hospital where they responded quickly and identified that <strong>I was having an <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ocular-migraine/AN01681">ocular migraine</a>.&#0160; </strong></p>  <p>Note: <a href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/ocular-migraine.htm">this article</a> on ocular migraines is not what I had, though I do get this too occasionally. It’s more like the aura that I do occasionally experience before or instead of my migraines lately. This was another thing all together!</p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow. What a whirlwind my adventure at <a href="http://dinerenblancto.wordpress.com/">Diner en Blanc</a> was!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192737692/" title="Karen @ Diner en Blanc"><img alt="Karen @ Diner en Blanc" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/6192737692_7e76ef8b54.jpg" /></a></p>


<p><strong>The “Plan”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, about a month ago <a href="http://www.twitter.com/foodie411">Joel</a> had invited me to a dinner party on Sept 27th, but the invite was kind of cryptic. <em>“Mysterious,”</em> I thought and immediately said <em>“yes”</em>.</p>
<p>But then life got in the way and my schedule got shifted, twisted and turned on its ear so Mom was visiting the night of the party.&#0160; I suspected this was an intimate affair with limited seating so I sent my regrets.&#0160; Only to find out almost immediately that “intimate” was 400 diners at a Toronto’s first <a href="http://dinerenblancto.wordpress.com/">Diner en Blanc</a>.&#0160; 400 people all dressed stylishly in white, dining al fresco, just mom&#39;s kind of thing.&#0160; Time to shift gears again, and ask mom to join me! But she said “no”.&#0160; Unfortunately, due to mobility and pain issues she decided it wouldn’t work for her this year.&#0160;&#0160; So I resigned myself to missing <a href="http://dinerenblancto.wordpress.com/">Diner en Blanc</a>. I don’t actually have to go to every cool food event in the city. Honest I don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Mom and Gerry don’t agree.&#0160; Yesterday, while watching me fielding tweets, emails and texts from friends asking if I’d be there, both mom and Gerry finally told me to “just go!”&#0160; After a token objection, I grabbed the phone and called Joel.&#0160; At 4:30. While he was setting up! What a patient friend. He had an extra ticket for me!</p>
<p>I zoomed around the house finding anything white I could wear, then zoomed around the kitchen packing up my table wear and trying to find something I could bring to eat.&#0160; I grabbed my camera, cell phone and credit card and jumped in a cab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Event</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I arrived at the corner of Parliament and Mill Street where there were 2 or 3 other people all in white. No one I knew.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192218103/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6155/6192218103_4ac1972512.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I waited, more people arrived, some familiar faces. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192218323/" title="Alex Waiting"><img alt="Alex Waiting" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/6192218323_1179a3a91e.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Then more and more people laden with baskets of food, fresh flowers, hats, feather boas, masks…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192218447/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6192218447_7fd0e82936.jpg" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192219053/" title="Rushing to Diner en Blanc"><img alt="Rushing to Diner en Blanc" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6160/6192219053_2544ac0f96.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>at this point cars were slowing down and drivers were leaning out their windows with cameras to photograph us.&#0160; We were causing a scene. An all-white, stylish and happening scene.</p>
<p>&#0160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192736050/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/6192736050_7d224dd79c.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Then, a little after 6pm, we were escorted in!&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192735728/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6192735728_d2e442a9c2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We walked parade-like down Mill Street and into the Distillery District where a fenced dining area had been setup.&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192736200/" title="Streaming Into Diner en Blanc"><img alt="Streaming Into Diner en Blanc" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6178/6192736200_ee94f8da26.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>2 long tables down either side, and at the bottom where the courtyard area is a collection of round tables. Everything was white, clean and crisp. Candles were flickering&#0160; alongside a flower and a basket of fruit (from our buddies at <a href="http://www.longos.com">Longo’s</a>) on each table</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cavarestaurant.ca/">Cava</a> was serving appetizers. Lifford was selling wine.&#0160; Grindhouse was serving coffee. Sid was setup DJing.&#0160; And then Rossy came around with a jar of hot sauce for each table (or group).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192221633/" title="The Beautiful Rossy!"><img alt="The Beautiful Rossy!" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6192221633_b60453eb04.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Things were getting good.&#0160; But where to sit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Table</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<p>As people were settling in I got waved down to the end and the big round tables by Joel and Suresh.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192740780/" title="Joel at Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Joel at Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" height="160" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6192740780_988c8ae326.jpg" width="240" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192224961/" title="Suresh Stopped for One Moment"><img alt="Suresh Stopped for One Moment" border="0" height="160" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6192224961_0dd5a11665.jpg" width="240" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192736330/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6192736330_bdb7472200.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I was welcomed at an almost empty table by Joanne who was setting up a fascinating hot plate and waiting for her friend, Vanessa.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192740312/" title="The Lovely Joanne"><img alt="The Lovely Joanne" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6192740312_17dbbea371.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It was just the two of us at a table for 8, and I was a little worried about my pathetic offerings since she kept telling me she had more than enough food to feed me too. So, I decided wine was on me!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192738692/" title="Wine &amp; Hot Sauce!"><img alt="Wine &amp; Hot Sauce!" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6192738692_e7da2fc8aa.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I grabbed my credit card and went to buy wine from Nicole.&#0160; Unfortunately, since Lifford was cash-only and I was cash-free. Then Pat stepped up and showed me another bit of kindness by buying me a bottle of wine. I’m a lucky woman to have such generous and kind friends.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Menu</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I returned from the wine station, people were already laying out their meals. Some brought elaborate multi-coursed plated dishes; others brought big luscious looking charcuterie plates with cheeses, fruits and salads; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192737190/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6164/6192737190_4af813960e.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>and still others opted for trays of pasta, roasted chickens or Longo’s pizza (yup.)<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192218521/" title="Longo&#39;s For Diner en Blanc"><img alt="Longo&#39;s For Diner en Blanc" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6192218521_8f4b6c90fb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I waved Matt and Andrea over to join us. Andrea came with another bottle of the Pinot. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192221685/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" height="500" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6192221685_6cbd12a32c.jpg" width="333" /></a></p>
<p>Matt came with a complete spread (no surprise) and proceeded to start plating his dishes – <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192738020/" title="Matt @ Diner en Blanc"><img alt="Matt @ Diner en Blanc" border="0" height="500" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6192738020_c262719577.jpg" width="333" /></a></p>
<p>Bacalau – a Portuguese cod &amp; potato spread (which I spent all evening saying I <em>“couldn’t pronounce” </em>because I kept forgetting the name); Burrata &amp; Beet salad – burrata is a mozzarella ball filled with fresh cream; a duck salad; and his lovely dark chocolate cake with a dulche de leche topping. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192741062/" title="Burrata w/ Beets"><img alt="Burrata w/ Beets" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6192741062_dcc16b065f.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Joanne already had her 4 cheese Mac&amp;Cheese on the hot plate <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192739280/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6192739280_91da27638c.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>and when Vanessa arrived,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192222033/" title="Vanessa &amp; Her Feather Explosion"><img alt="Vanessa &amp; Her Feather Explosion" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6192222033_b61a1c34f6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>she hauled our her contributions to the table: braised chicken with leeks and mushrooms, Maple Pudding Chômeur.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192224631/" title="Chicken Braised with Leeks &amp; Mushrooms"><img alt="Chicken Braised with Leeks &amp; Mushrooms" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6192224631_428b5ccd28.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>What I brought scavenged from the fridge and pantry? 1 log of goat’s cheese, 1 box of crackers, 1 small pot of Skillet St. Food’s Bacon Jam, and 1 bag of Xococava’s chocolate w/ chiles.</p>
<p>Yup, I could not have found a better table.&#0160; They all insisted on sharing, not that I was complaining as I pathetically attempted to encourage people to try my cheese and bacon jam so I felt like I had contributed to our feast.</p>

<p>Our table was one of the few that had hot food, and when Joanne brought out the blow torch to finish the crust of the Mac and Cheese, it was tremendous!&#0160;</p>

<p>More than a few cameras popped up around us to capture that moment, and we discussed all the other things we could brulee!</p>
<p>Throughout the evening people from every part of the party dropped by to see what was happening on our table.&#0160; We had some squeals of delight as people realized this was “that Bacon Jam”… this was a foodie crowd after all, so I felt a little better.&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192740990/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6192740990_37a23fb5d4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>But mostly people were showing up with spoons to try the Mac &amp; Cheese.&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192225303/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6192225303_8a80e72261.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The Night</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the evening started there were a couple of short welcome messages and to show our appreciation for organisers of this wonderful event we all waved our napkins in the air. It filled the Distillery with little white dervishes whirling at the ends of our fingers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192221267/" title="Waving Our Napkins"><img alt="Waving Our Napkins" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6154/6192221267_c9367810d5.jpg" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192225303/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"></a></p>
<p>Then as dusk started to fall, the organisers handed out sparklers. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192740526/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6192740526_136f0d543b.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>At 9:30, as dark descended,&#0160; we all lit them together.&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192225921/" title="Diner en Blanc Sparkling!"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Sparkling!" border="0" height="333" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6145/6192225921_fb199ebea0.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Wow, that was spectacular!&#0160; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192226405/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/6192226405_aa1dbaea60.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Not just all the sparklers, but trying to hold 4 of them while taking photos and not get burnt. And the crackle and burn of sparklers filling the street!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192225391/" title="Lighting Our Sparkles"><img alt="Lighting Our Sparkles" border="0" height="160" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6192225391_102df3a96f.jpg" width="240" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192225537/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" height="160" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6192225537_ac8e37b9ba.jpg" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>The music kicked up a notch, and as some people packed up and headed home, others started dancing.&#0160; I got a little dancing in before finding a cab to bring me home to enthuse at Gerry and mom about what a wonderful evening I had had.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46602640@N00/6192226713/" title="Diner en Blanc Toronto"><img alt="Diner en Blanc Toronto" border="0" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6121/6192226713_1e77bf6d66.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>One of the organisers asked me what I thought and if I saw any areas for improvement.&#0160; It’s rare for me to say this, but as a guest I couldn’t see a single way the event could have been improved. It balanced wonderfully between carefully organised to keep things running smoothly and give a cohesive feel to the night, and beautifully self-directed to allow for personal preference, creativity and expression.&#0160; It was a flash mob dinner at it’s best.</p>
<p>Thank you to the organisers and my table mates who together made this one of the best guest experiences I’ve had in a long time!</p>

<description>I know how important it is to get photos and of the people you love… and with the people you love... even if they are sometimes reticent. This last one was especially hard.

<title>Chipotle S&amp;rsquo;mores!</title>

<description>Yes I did! I used chipotle marshmallows from Bobbette &amp; Belle to make s'mores! When Matt, Sarah and Allyson discussed making Chipotle Marshmallows for Matt’s twisted Tacos de Mole dish at the last Secret Pickle Supper Club, I couldn’t get the thought of using them for S’mores out of my head.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I did! I used chipotle marshmallows from <a href="http://bobbetteandbelle.com/">Bobbette &amp; Belle</a> to make s&#39;mores!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lexnger/6153507657/" title="Chipotle S&#39;mores by LexnGer, on Flickr"><img alt="Chipotle S&#39;mores" height="386" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6153507657_ecda501f3b.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.mattkantor.ca">Matt</a>, Sarah and Allyson discussed making Chipotle Marshmallows for Matt’s twisted Tacos de Mole dish at the last <a href="http://www.secretpicklesupperclub.com">Secret Pickle Supper Club</a>, I couldn’t get the thought of using them for S’mores out of my head.</p>
<p>These Chipotle Marshmallows aren’t readily available. They were a custom flavour Sarah &amp; Allyson, from <a href="http://bobbetteandbelle.com/">Bobbette &amp; Belle</a>, made for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lexnger/tags/pastrypickle">Pastry Pickle</a></p>
<p>So when I saw a little pile of marshmallows left over after the dinner I  snagged a small stash of them for marketing and experimentation  purposes… i.e. playing with food with friends.</p>
<p>The proportions were off in the s’more since I needed thinner chocolate or bigger marshmallows (or both). But they were still damned tasty!</p>
<p>On the off chance you don’t know how to make a S’more, here’s the recipe:</p>


<p><strong>S’mores</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>fire</li>
<li>stick </li>
<li>graham cracker</li>
<li>marshmallow</li>
<li>chocolate</li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>start your fire (everyone in Canada knows the best way to start a fire, and why what you are doing is wrong.)</li>
<li>separate 2 graham crackers per serving, and put one piece of chocolate on ever second cracker</li>
<li>put your marshmallow on the end of a stick</li>
<li>roast it until golden, or burning, over an open flame</li>
<li>put your hot marshmallow on a graham cracker and chocolate stack, then immediately top with the second cracker.&#0160; </li>
<li>Squeeze the two crackers together to help melt the chocolate and remove the stick while leaving the marshmallow in that yummy yummy sandwich.</li>
</ul><div class="feedflare">
