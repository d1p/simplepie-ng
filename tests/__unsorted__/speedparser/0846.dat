                <title>2011 CSA Week #4</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>And here&#8217;s what I picked up earlier today:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Head Green Romaine Lettuce</li>
<li>1 Bunch Green Kale</li>
<li>1 Bag Rainbow Chard</li>
<li>1 Bag Baby Scarlet Turnips</li>
<li>1 Bunch Garlic Scapes</li>
<li>1 Bunch Tatsoi (Japanese Spinach)</li>
<li>1 Bunch Collard Greens</li>
<li>1 Bunch Red Scallions</li>
<li>1 Package Shiitake Mushrooms</li>
<li>1 Head Green Leaf Lettuce</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we&#8217;ll have a Caesar salad one night, maybe steak this week. And probably another salad night with the leaf lettuce. The rest of that stuff &#8212; particularly the Tatsoi &#8212; is going to be more challenging.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

                <title>Blue Corn Tacos with homemade seasoning and sauce</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I made tacos tonight &#8212; ground beef, blue corn taco shells, shredded pepper jack cheese, shredded romaine, green onions, and cilantro. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://yfrog.com/h363njbj">a photo</a>. (I really need to get off my ass and start hosting my own photos again&#8230; but I digress.)</p>

<p>The really cool thing about these tacos was that I made the seasoning mix for the meat <em>and</em> the taco sauce we used. Pretty easy, and <em>extremely</em> tasty &#8212; that&#8217;s TheWife&#8217;s thumbs up in the back of that photo, just so you know I&#8217;m not singing my own phrases. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe for the seasoning mix, based on <a href="http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/recs/13/Homemade_Taco_Seasoning_Mix48001.shtml">this recipe</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>6 teaspoons chili powder</li>
<li>5 teaspoons paprika</li>
<li>5 teaspoons cumin</li>
<li>3 teaspoons onion powder</li>
<li>2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<p>(I didn&#8217;t bother leveling those teaspoons off at all; just tamped them down roughly, erring on the side of &#8220;heaping&#8221;.)</p>

<p>Throw all the spices &#8212; everything save the flour &#8212; in a small mixing bowl. Whisk it together until it&#8217;s well mixed. Stick a finger in there and taste a little bit of it. Tweak as you see fit &#8212; next time, for example, I think I&#8217;m using more cayenne; I&#8217;ll probably bump it up to a 1/2 tsp.</p>

<p>Once it tastes good, add the flour and whisk until throughly mixed.</p>

<p>Brown your ground beef (or ground chicken, turkey, whatever &#8212; basically, get your meat cooked, in a skillet). Drain off any grease. Add 3 tablespoons of the seasoning mix per 1 pound of meat, plus 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water. Simmer off the liquid under medium-low heat &#8212; about 7-10 minutes.</p>

<p>ANd here&#8217;s the recipe for the taco sauce, based on <a href="http://teriskitchen.com/meats/tacosauce.html">this recipe</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 eight ounce can tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried minced onion</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano <em>I used some of the oregano I dried a few weeks back</em></li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper</li>
<li>goodly amount of chopped fresh white and red scallions <em>both the bulbs and the leafy green parts</em></li>
<li>decent amonut of chopped fresh cilantro </li>
</ul>

<p>Mix everything together with a wooden spoon. Taste &amp; tweak to suit &#8212; depending on whether you used unsalted tomato sauce, you may need to add some salt. Let sit on a counter for at least 20 minutes so flavors can blend (taste again at the end).</p>

<p>The tacos were made using the seasoned beef from above, crunchy blue corn shells (heated at 425 for 3 minutes), shredded pepper jack cheese, shredded romaine lettuce, more of the green scallion tops, and the sauce &#8212; and they were phenomonal.</p>

                <title>2011 CSA Week #3</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>And now I&#8217;ve missed a week entirely&#8230; ho hum. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what we got last week:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Head Green Romaine Lettuce</li>
<li>1 Bunch Spinach</li>
<li>1 Bunch White Scallions</li>
<li>1 Bunch Spearmint</li>
<li>1 Head Red Leaf Lettuce</li>
<li>1 Bag Baby Lettuce Mix</li>
<li>1 Bunch Red Scallions</li>
<li>1 Bunch Green Kale </li>
<li>1 Package Sliced Portobello Mushroom Caps</li>
<li>1 Package Cremini (Baby Bella) Mushrooms</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a tough week, due to the holidays &#8212; we ended up over at friends&#8217; houses two nights over the weekend, so we didn&#8217;t use as much of this stuff as we should have.</p>

<p>Friday night, we took the spearmint and the baby lettuce mix over to some friends &#8212; they had grilled up some chicken. The mint went into mojitos.</p>

<p>Saturday night&#8230; not sure what we did Saturday night. I think we may have eaten out.</p>

<p>Sunday was a post-birthday party at different friends &#8212; excellent burgers. </p>

<p>Half of the mushrooms got fried up with some onions on Monday, used to top grilled hamburgers (only we forgot we&#8217;d put them in the oven to stay warm &#8212; they&#8217;re in the fridge as leftovers now&#8230;) We also had salad with the red leaf and baby lettuce. </p>

<p>The romaine went into a chicken Caesar Tuesday &#8212; home-made croutons, and then the chicken was grilled up in the same pan, to pick up the remainder of the spices. </p>

<p>And tonight, I made tacos &#8212; see the next entry for details. Some of the scallions were used as toppings, and in the homemade taco sauce &#8212; we&#8217;ve still got <em>so</em> <em>many</em> <em>scallions</em>&#8230;</p>

                <title>2011 CSA Week #2</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a bit late getting this posted, but better late than never&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what was in our share this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bunch Green Kale</li>
<li>1 Bag Spinach</li>
<li>1 Bag Broccoli</li>
<li>1 Bunch Green Romaine Lettuce</li>
<li>1 Bunch Red Scallions</li>
<li>1 Bunch Oregano</li>
<li>1 Head Red Leaf Lettuce</li>
<li>1 Bag Spicy Lettuce Mix</li>
</ul>

<p>We had the red leaf lettuce and spicy lettuce mix in a big salad on Thursday night, along with homemade croutons, the last of the radishes from last week, some parsley from last week, some oregno, and some scallaions, topped with a homemade balsamic vinegarette.</p>

<p>Friday night was grilled pizza &#8212; I used more oregano mixed in with the tomatoes. The rest of the oregano is hung up drying in bundles in the basement. </p>

<p>Saturday night was carne asada fajitas with homemade guac (and homemade margitas!). There were some scallions in there as well &#8212; we&#8217;ve got <em>so</em> many scallions at this point!</p>

<p>Tonight, Sunday night, we had beer can chicken along with the brocolli, lightly steamed, served with salt and pepper. It was great.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is slated to be sour creme enchilladas &#8212; more scallions used up, yay! &#8212; and we&#8217;ll probably finish off the last of the guacamole too. Tuesday will be grilled skirt steak over the romaine in a Caesar salad. Wednesday will be spinach salad and a chicken dish. Oh, and at some point, I plan to make kale chips &#8212; I was supposed to do that today, but didn&#8217;t get around to it.</p>

<p>(In the extremely unlikely event that you&#8217;re reading this, are interested in seeing this food in addition to reading about it, and don&#8217;t already follow me on Twitter, you should <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/genehack">follow @genehack</a>.

                <title>Tuesday dinner</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Tuesdays can be a bit hectic around here &#8212; Ms8YearOld has a post-day-care activity with TheWife and Ms4YearOld, so they get home about an hour later than usual. That means Tuesday dinner has to be something relatively simple that can be known to satisfy everybody. Consequently, we eat a lot of freezer pasta on Tuesdays &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit of a cop out, but it satisfies the requirements. The trick is finding some way to make it interesting&#8230;</p>

<p>This week, I had leftover grilled sausages from the weekend and a lot of produce: dandelion and radish greens, some slicked up Shiitake and crimini mushrooms, a bunch of scallions, some garlic (there&#8217;s <em>always</em> garlic at our house), and about half a red onion. </p>

<p>First, I fried up a couple of slices of bacon in my cast iron skillet &#8212; and I fried them up pretty hard, much crispier than I normally would. (I wanted to get all the fat out of the bacon.) I pulled the bacon out onto a paper towel and tossed the dandelion and radish greens (already torn up into chunks), some chopped scallions, and some chopped onion into the grease. I stirred everything up real good then pulled the pan off the heat and covered it. Three minutes later, I dumped everything out into a salad bowl and crumbled the bacon over it. Gave it a good toss and sat it aside.</p>

<p>Next up, the sauce. I started with a jar of red sauce, to which I added about 4 good size cloves of garlic, minced; 2 leftover grilled sausages, sliced thin; a good amount of chopped red onion; and a bunch of sliced Shitaake and crimini mushrooms. Put that on some low heat and gave it an occasional stir while boiling the pasta up.</p>

<p>The kiddos got pasta tossed with butter; TheWife and I had the greens with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette (4 parts olive oil to 1 part balsamic vinegar plus oregano and thyme to taste.) and the pasta with sauce over. </p>

<p>Wilting the greens in the bacon grease really did cut the bitterness &#8212; they were actually less bitter than most radicchio. I worked off <a href="http://herbgardens.about.com/od/herbrecipes/ht/dandelionsaute.htm">this recipe</a> but as you can see above, went pretty far afield.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://yfrog.com/gyys8fbj">the salad</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="http://yfrog.com/hsatirdj">the pasta</a>.</p>

<p>And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I think I&#8217;m going to lapse into a pasta coma for a bit&#8230; </p>

                <title>2011 CSA Week #1</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve subscribed to <a href="http://sandyspringcsa.com/">Sandy Spring CSA</a> for vegetables, fruits, and herbs this year. Assuming I keep up with it, I&#8217;m going to post what we get each week as well as post on how we&#8217;re using our share.</p>

<p>TheWife picked up the first week&#8217;s share on the 11th, as I was in route back home from a visit to Toronto. We got the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 bunch white scallions</li>
<li>1 bunch red scallions</li>
<li>1 head romaine</li>
<li>2 heads bok choy</li>
<li>1 head red leaf lettuce</li>
<li>1 bunch French breakfast radishes</li>
<li>1 bunch rhubarb</li>
<li>1 bunch curly parsley</li>
<li>1 bunch dandelion greens</li>
<li>1 package Shiitake mushrooms</li>
<li>1 package cremini mushrooms</li>
</ul>

<p>We had the romaine in a Caesar salad on Thursday night, and it was excellent. (<strong>Update:</strong> Actually, we had one of the heads of bok choy; I fail at produce identification. I <em>thought</em> the veins on the leaves were a bit more pronounced and whiter than usual&#8230;) I used a modified version of <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/caesar-salad-dressing-recipe/index.html">this recipe</a> &#8212; I&#8217;ll post with my modifications shortly.</p>

<p>Tonight we&#8217;re going to have a salad with the lettuce, radishes, red scallions, and mushrooms, along with burgers with parsley, red scallions, and garlic, topped with bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms.</p>

<p>Later in the week, we&#8217;ll have another Caesar salad (with chicken this time, I think), some pasta with the dandelion greens on the side, and a stir fry with mushrooms, the white scallions, and the rest of the bok choy &#8212; and that&#8217;ll take us up to Wednesday, at which point we&#8217;ll have another share delivery. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve usually been making the market run on Sunday or Monday; since the CSA shares show up on Wednesday, I think I&#8217;m going to shift over to Thursdays for the market run, and do menu planning on a Thursay->Thursday cycle, instead of the Sunday->Sunday cycle we have been using. I think this week I&#8217;ll have to hit the market twice; hopefully this is a one time thing&#8230;</p>

                <title>Sleep</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="sleep.jpg" src="http://genehack.org/images/sleep.jpg" width="587" height="653" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>On my first day of working at home, I had a couple of cups of coffee later in the afternoon &#8212; not so much as a pick-me-up; more because we have the heat off during the day and I wanted a shot of something warm. That night, I slept for crap. Yesterday &#8212; my second day &#8212; I avoided the coffee after about 11am or so. Last night, I slept like a baby.</p>

<p>Now, clearly, more research may be needed &#8212; but I think in the meantime, what&#8217;s also needed is some decaf. Bah.</p>

                <title>Teaching Whine</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>The thing I hate about teaching the most &#8212; more than dealing with the ever-changing bureaucratic nonsense, more than the students grubbing for every little point &#8212; is the way it destroys schedule flexibility. Normally, I&#8217;ve got a fair amount of flex in my schedule, and if I get on a roll with some work stuff, I can let that roll go as long as it wants. When I&#8217;m teaching, I frequently have to turn the work stuff off and put on my professor hat, because things have to get done before the next class session.</p>

<p>I know, I know, whinge whinge whinge&#8230;</p>

                <title>Late February beer run</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I had a chance to get back up to <a href="http://perfectpourcolumbia.com/">The Perfect Pour</a> this weekend, and I stocked up on a little bit of this and that. As an aside, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/genehack/5462994633/">here&#8217;s a shot of some of the Mikkeller varieties available</a> at the Perfect Pour. The only other place in the DC area I&#8217;ve found with Mikkeller carries a single selection from them, and says that&#8217;s all they can get from their distributor. If you&#8217;re in the area and like beer and haven&#8217;t been to the Perfect Pour yet, you should go. </p>
