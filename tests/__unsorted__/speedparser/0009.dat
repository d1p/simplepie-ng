</div><p>Does it strike anybody else as absolutely crazy that the man who continues, against all reason and despite a complete lack of necessity, to defend a historical reading of the creation story (see tweet below&#8230;)</p>

<p>Really, Mohler? You deny science on NPR, but we should care about your thoughts on bioethics?</p>
<p>On a related note, I met this week with a new friend, the influential writer <a class="zem_slink" title="Karl W. Giberson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_W._Giberson" rel="wikipedia">Karl Giberson</a>. Giberson has been the executive vice-president of The BioLogos Foundation and is author of several books that prove that the kind of willingful suspension of being-a-reasonable-human-being that Mohler continues to display needn&#8217;t set the benchmark for Christian consideration of science. And, unlike Mohler, Karl Giberson also happens to be a scientist. Incidentally, Karl has gone head to head (or, at least, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karl-giberson-phd/charles-darwin-versus-the_b_688485.html?view=print">blog post</a> to <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2010/08/25/a-letter-to-professor-giberson-on-darwin-and-darwinism/">blog post</a>) with Mohler on this very issue.</p>
<p>In the midst of seemingly daily debates amongst the current Republican candidates for their party&#8217;s nomination, the ugly and unthinking underbelly of conservative Christianity has been on prominent display. We have heard cheers for the death penalty, boo&#8217;s directed at members of the military who happen to be gay, and a ridiculous number of climate change deniers. Now, more than ever, we need to hear from intelligent, thinking Christians like Karl Giberson. By all means, let the pastors teach and preach, but let&#8217;s leave the addresses on bioethics and biotechnology to those who actually know a thing or two about such topics.</p>

</div><p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Lost in Transition" src="http://img2.imagesbn.com/images/118570000/118577013.JPG" alt="" width="185" height="279" />A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/opinion/if-it-feels-right.html?_r=3&amp;emc=eta1&amp;src=ISMR_HP_LI_LST_FB&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">op-ed</a> by David Brooks brought my attention to a study conducted by Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith and some of his colleagues &#8212; the results of which have been published in a book entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Transition-Emerging-Adulthood-ebook/dp/B005FVPEW8/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp" target="_blank">Lost in Transition</a> &#8211;</em> that found that young adults are bad at &#8220;thinking and talking about moral issues,&#8221; as Brook puts it.</p>
<p>I presented Brooks&#8217; piece to a couple of classes I teach at a small Christian college and asked the students to read it and respond. Without exception, they confirmed Smith&#8217;s thesis. Even in their attempts to show evidence that contradicts the assertion that their generation views morality as personal and subjective, based on feeling, and nontransferable to others, the language they used betrayed their foundational belief that morality is in fact a personal matter.</p>
<p>Brooks does not put the blame on young people for this shortcoming, but rather sees older generations as responsible. He writes, &#8220;Smith and company emphasize, they have not been given the resources &#8212; by schools, institutions and families &#8212; to cultivate their moral intuitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>These &#8220;institutions&#8221; include the church. Evangelicals in particular, and the mega churches their movement spawned, are absolutely guilty of propagating extreme individualism. They &#8220;modernized&#8221; the gospel in such a way that gave us a &#8220;personal savior&#8221; found only by praying a &#8220;sinner&#8217;s prayer.&#8221; Now, when I ask students raised in these churches how they make moral decisions, they talk about what feels right or, in spiritual terms, how the spirit leads them.</p>
<p>I intend to explore this a bit more in-depth and publish my thoughts in my <a class="zem_slink" title="Patheos" href="http://www.patheos.com/About-Patheos/Jonathan-Fitzgerald.html" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Patheos</a> column next week, but I&#8217;d be interested to hear what readers think? Do you see this? Do you see a solution?<img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: none; float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=4d9fb4af-7206-4f10-a4ce-84e86c6c8c8b" alt="" /></p>

</div><p><img class="alignnone" title="9/11 Memorial" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/03/27/nyregion/27groundzero.span.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="295" /></p>
<p>This weekend marks the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the attacks against our country on September 11, 2001, and New York City, Washington DC, and just about every other major metropolitan area in the US is planning to mark the anniversary with one kind of commemorative happening or another. The main event in New York, a service to be held at ground zero, has become the center of controversy revolving around the intentional exclusion by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg of any religious leaders or clergy from the service.</p>
<p>This controversy is occurring at the same time as a similar clamor just a few hours south of New York, in Washington DC, over the exclusion of any evangelical leaders from a service there that does include clergy from the Episcopal church as well as representatives from Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu faiths. As Bobby Ross, Jr. <a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2011/09/got-news-evangelicals-snubbed-by-911-service/">noted</a> at GetReligion, this issue has not received much national coverage, though, as his colleague Mollie Ziegler <a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2011/09/no-clergy-at-ground-zero-ceremony/">points out</a> today, the New York <em>Times</em>, prominently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/nyregion/omitting-clergy-from-911-ceremony-prompts-protest.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all">featured</a> a story about the controversy in this morning’s paper.</p>
<p>In addition to the <em>Times</em> piece, Dan Gilgoff, editor of CNN’s Belief Blog, got to the story about the New York event on Wednesday. In his <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/progressive-christians-join-controversy-over-excluding-clergy-at-911-event/">piece</a>, he notes that Jim Wallis and other religious leaders are staging a press conference near ground zero today, to discuss why they believe Mayor Bloomberg made a tremendous oversight in excluding religious leaders from the ceremony.</p>
<p>Gilgoff quotes Tim King, communications director for Sojourners, and, I think, King’s explanation of the situation provides an extremely insightful analysis not only of this controversy, but also of a major flaw in many people’s understanding of the relationship between religion and civic life. Here’s what he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Religion, and religious leaders, have caused a lot of unnecessary conflict and controversy…But avoiding religion entirely does not get to the root of the problem…The answer is better religion…</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a point I’ve made time and again, and will undoubtedly continue to make, but I really like the way King puts it here. No reasonable religious person is going to claim that religion hasn’t caused a lot of problems both in recent history, and throughout time. That is, the so-called “New Atheists” are right in their assertion that strongly held religious beliefs often lead to conflicts and wars. But, as King notes, this does not mean the answer is to simply avoid religion. In fact, I would argue, avoiding religion, or trying to act as if it can be cut out of public life, is in large part responsible for the “unnecessary conflict and controversy” that King refers to.</p>
<p>It was a mistake for Bloomberg to exclude religious leaders from the commemorative event, but anyone can see what he was thinking. He was operating on outmoded assumptions that separating religion from state means ignoring the importance that religion plays in all life. It needn’t be this way.</p>
<p>Turning to the evangelical uproar about being excluded from the DC event, Bobby Ross, Jr. points out that an even larger swath of Christianity, Roman Catholics, have also been excluded from the event, and yet, at least as far as anyone has bothered to report, the Church has been silent on the issue. Perhaps this is because what is needed now is not infighting and clamoring for a spot, but a unified front among religious leaders. I’ll yield, once again, to Tim King, whose comments on the New York controversy, I think, can be applied to the Washington DC issue as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>To those religious leaders who are stirring up a media controversy about this decision &#8230; you are showing exactly why Mayor Bloomberg didn’t want you there in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Christianity is represented at the DC event. In fact, originally it was supposed to be held at the National Cathedral until a crane that was clearing debris caused by the recent earthquake <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/crane-collapses-at-washingtons-national-cathedral/">fell</a> onto the south side of the cathedral. Regardless, there will be Christians represented at the ceremony. So, relax evangelical friends; identify as Christian first and foremost, and remember that the day is about unity, after all.</p>

</div><p>Today, in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/opinion/crashing-the-tea-party.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=all">op-ed</a> at the New York <em>Times</em>, David E. Campbell and Robert D. Putnam, authors of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Grace-Religion-Divides-Unites/dp/1416566716" target="_blank">American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us</a></em>, turn their attention to the Tea Party and determine that it’s not their desire for a smaller government that unites Tea Partiers, but their desire to “mix religion and politics.” This, Campbell and Putnam suggest, is counter to the will of the American people. They note that Americans have become more conservative economically, but less likely to support the commingling of religion and politics.</p>
<p>This would seem to blend with Andrew Sullivan’s rhetoric about “Christianists” that I addressed <a href="http://www.patrolmag.com/2011/08/11/jonathan-d-fitzgerald/we-are-all-christianists/">here</a> last week. Sullivan suggests that Christians should express their faith in a more “libertarian” way; faith should be a private matter and citizens should not expose their politics to their beliefs.</p>
<p>If Campbell and Putnam suggest that this is what Americans want, and Sullivan’s libertarian Christianity provides a way forward, perhaps that should be the end of the debate. Except, of course, that there is a disparity between what Americans say we want, and how we actually live our lives.</p>
<p>The underlying notion that buoys the popular opinion that religion and politics should not be mixed is a good one. It is based on the understanding that we live in a pluralistic society that is ruled by a secular government. The founders of our nation sought to avoid the kind of religious intolerance and theocratic rule that had dominated history to that point. This is good. But maintaining a pluralistic society and a secular state does not require citizens to divide themselves into believers on certain days and citizens on others. It is both impossible and undesirable to maintain this kind of split personality.</p>
<p>It feels progressive to say that we should’t mix religion and politics, because it feels like by saying so we are upholding the dream of our founders, but when citizens allow their politics to be informed by religious convictions, they are not leading our country down a slippery slope toward theocracy, they are being fully engaged citizens. This requires dialogue and compromise, give and take; it is not the easiest way forward, but, really, it’s the only way.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://theamericanscene.com/2011/08/09/the-cause-of-all-the-trouble">The American Scene</a></span>, Wheaton professor Alan Jacobs took Andrew Sullivan to task on his recent <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/08/was-mlk-a-christianist.html">remarks</a></span>  about &#8220;Christianists,&#8221; a term he often uses to describe the Christian right, but which, more generally applied, refers to people who fuse &#8220;politics and religion for the advancement of political goals.&#8221; In his original post, Sullivan dreams up a kind of libertarian Christianity in which Christians stop trying to control others&#8217; lives and souls and focus on what they can do to affect social change. In the past, I&#8217;ve cheered Sullivan on as he took so-called Christianists to task, so I took pause when Jacobs, certainly a voice I&#8217;ve long listened to and respected, challenged Sullivan.</p>
<p>Jacobs&#8217; response forces the reader to consider Martin Luther King, Jr., a <a class="zem_slink" title="Christianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianism" rel="wikipedia">Christianist</a> by Sullivan&#8217;s definition if ever there was one. Jacobs points out that there was no separating religion and politics for King, that, for him, bringing about the kind of radical change that he was working for was tantamount to bringing about the the Biblical Israel.</p>
<p>Sullivan acknowledges that King was in fact a kind of left-wing Christianist, and concedes that it is possible that Christianism lead to some good results, but, he asks, &#8220;does this fusion of politics and religion, overall, help or hurt our polity?&#8221; He concludes that it hurts. King succeeded, Sullivan argues, because his Christianism was bolstered by being actual Christianity.</p>
<p>Ah, but who&#8217;s Christianity? This gets to a point I made <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Norway-Killer-Is-a-Christian-but-So-Am-I-Jonathan-Fitzgerald-08-08-2011.html">elsewhere</a></span> in regards to the Christianity of the Oslo terrorist. There isn&#8217;t just one Christianity, and trying to parse whose version is right is always treacherous. Sometimes it&#8217;s obvious; certainly a majority of Christians denounce the murder of children. But, at other times, like when trying to decide who&#8217;s Christianism will help our polity, it is a bit more difficult to do.</p>
<p>Most often, I agree with Sullivan on this. It&#8217;s no secret at I&#8217;m always eager to decry the actions of the Christian right. But I can&#8217;t go with Sullivan down the road of libertarian Christianity. If MLK was justified in his attempt to right social wrongs using his faith and convictions, so too should Rick Perry, or Michele Bachmann be. I don&#8217;t agree with their version of Christianity, and I&#8217;ll do everything in my power to show a different side of our shared faith, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to act out their convictions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Alan Jacobs" src="http://jacobsar.googlepages.com/Photo21smaller.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Alan Jacobs concludes his critique by exposing what is really at the heart of Sullivan&#8217;s message. He notes that if you accept that Dr. King mixed religion and politics with great success, &#8220;then maybe your problem is not with anyone and everyone who brings Christian convictions into the public sphere, but rather with some particular convictions that some Christians emphasize.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is certainly true of me, but I don&#8217;t want to pretend that Christians can or should leave their beliefs at home. Sullivan&#8217;s concept of libertarian Christianity rests on outmoded, modernist assumptions that people should fragment themselves &#8212; that they should bring their reason to the public square, but leave their beliefs at home. But, the more distant the modern era becomes in or cultural rear view mirror, the more clearly we can see the dangers of this kind of fragmentation.</p>
<p>The solution is not to continue this pretense of separation, but to learn to do better integration, to understand what it means to be people with religious convictions in a pluralized society &#8212; to learn how to work together for a common good. Ultimately, we need to figure out how people of all religions, and of no religion, can all find a seat at the table. We won&#8217;t get there, however, by closeting our beliefs.</p>

<p>The latest issue of <em>U.S. Catholic</em> features a <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2011/07/born-again-catholics-evangelicals-crossing-tiber" target="_blank">story</a> with a title that will be familiar to long-time Patrollers, &#8220;Born-again Catholics: Evangelicals crossing the Tiber.&#8221; If you recall, almost exactly two years ago I published a <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/2731/evangelicals_%E2%80%98crossing_the_tiber%E2%80%99_to_catholicism/" target="_blank">piece</a> in<em> Religion Dispatches</em> entitled &#8220;Evangelicals ‘Crossing the Tiber’ to Catholicism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I know I&#8217;m not the first to use the phrase &#8220;crossing the Tiber;&#8221; in fact, in my essay it was a reference to the book of same name by Stephen K. Ray, which details his conversion story.</p>
<p>The <em>U.S. Catholic</em> piece, by J. Peter Nixon, is well written, and provides yet another set of examples to counter Marvin Olasky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/augustweb-only/44-21.0.html?start=4" target="_blank">remarks</a> in <em>Christianity Today</em> in which he attempted to undermine my piece by saying that he didn&#8217;t see any such trend and, further, &#8220;If anything&#8230;more Catholics are becoming evangelicals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truthfully, this, like any trend story is nearly impossible to prove using anything more than anecdotal evidence, though that kind of evidence is certainly readily available. More importantly, as both my piece as well as the recent story point out, those who do combine these traditions find the fusion to be an asset to their faiths. At the very least, we can be assured that each evangelical turned Catholic represents one less person <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/michele-bachmanns-former-church-explains-popeanti-christ-claims/2011/07/15/gIQAzMG7FI_story.html" target="_blank">claiming</a> the Pope is the Anti-Christ.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" title="Jumping the Shark" src="http://static.tvguide.com/MediaBin/Content/100830/News/Todays_News_Our_Take/5_fri/100903HappyDays1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" />When a television show remains on air long after it ceases to be quality, it is said to have jumped the shark. In the latest issue of World magazine, Marvin Olasky has finally jumped his own <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/18283">shark</a>.</p>
<p>In what should have been a column that Christians of all stripes could rally around, a criticism of the right’s blind embrace of Ayn Rand, Olasky instead arrives at the pinnacle of several years of ideological calcification. The “shark” moment comes in the second paragraph in which Olasky, in his typical condescending tone, gives “a bit of recent history:”</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div>Democrats have not gained much white evangelical support on healthcare and environmentalism. In 2008 they successfully used guilt over segregation to elect the first African-American president, but that may not work again as concern over Obamanomics trumps the ghosts of generations past.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>This claim is outrageous and if not racist, certainly borders on racial bitterness. It echoes a sentiment that Ralph Nader expressed back in the 2008 campaign season. It was crazy then, but that’s kind of Nader’s thing. Obama rightly responded that the ill-fated independent candidate was just trying to “get attention,” according to CNN.</p>
<p>But Marvin Olasky is supposed to be a respected voice of the Christian Right. I mean, he coined the term compassionate conservatism! Yet, this careless overstatement is the culmination of a long-running cascade of bogus trend pieces, absurd claims, and embarrassing opinions that have served to level a man once thought to be one of evangelicalism’s best minds.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, several pieces from this year alone. Back in <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/17639">February</a>, he used some creative methods of interpretation to counter the claim that young evangelicals are “pro-liberal.” As we’ve pointed out repeatedly, he’s right that young evangelicals aren’t liberal, but he failed to mention that many of them are no longer evangelicals, either.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/18026">May</a>, he claimed that all of what he perceives as America’s problems have their roots in an imagined 1960s push to “put an end to hardship.” I countered at <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/60s-Made-Life-Harder-and-More-Just-Jonathan-Fitzgerald-05-11-2011.html">Patheos</a> that rather than make life easier, the revolutions of the sixties forced us to consider difficult options for making life more fair for more people.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.worldmag.com/2011/05/18/self-hating-evangelicals/">Later</a> in May, Olasky offered a characteristically absolutist criticism of Rob Bell and what he called “self-hating evangelicals.” Comparing them to “left-wing Jews who ally with anti-Israeli Muslims,” he claimed that Rob Bell and other Christians who “display virulent opposition to the existence of churches that are not emergent, or don’t meet in a house, or are not radically redistributionist, or are not something other than standard” are full of self-hatred. This claim, aside from being extremely reductionist, is demonstrably false.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://online.worldmag.com/2011/06/25/same-sex-marriage-cancer-and-fig-leaves/">June</a>, he predictably responded to the bill legalizing same sex marriage in New York by accusing the Associated Press of violating their own “Statement of Ethical Principles” by not offering two sides in an article about the celebrations that took place in New York City. Is it difficult to believe that among the revelers there weren’t too many dissenters? But once again, Olasky passes up the opportunity to engage with a difficult issue by churning out color-by-numbers resentment of the “liberal media.”</p>
<p>Finally, just a few days ago in a <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/18188" target="_blank">piece</a> that considered the influence of evolutionary theory, Olasky made a claim that perfectly and sadly underscores the extent to which he has lost his ability to navigate between extremes, “If Darwin was right, the Bible is wrong, and we are foolish to follow it,” he wrote. Really? We have to choose between the Bible and The Origin of Species? He goes on to look at the influence of evolutionary thought on politics, economics, sex, abortion, and infanticide (wait, what?). Rather than engaging with ideas, Olasky is fueled by issues. He has allowed his ever narrowing vision to obscure the nuances necessary for actively interacting with a world of ideas.</p>
<p>Thus, Olasky’s world is becoming more and more polarized&#8211;more us vs. them, more black and white&#8211;while the complexities of the real world make the gray all the more apparent. The problem is that he’s taking a generation (albeit an older generation) of readers with him down this road.  Some television shows continue for years after they’ve jumped the shark, how much longer will we have to be exposed to Olasky’s reductionist views?</p>

<p>In light of the news that New York is joining the small group of states that allow same-sex marriages, and in response to the fear-addled <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/albertmohler" target="_blank">tweets</a> of Al Mohler upon hearing the news, I wanted to repost this <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Stop-Fighting-to-Save-Marriage-Jonathan-Fitzgerald-02-23-2011.html" target="_blank">column</a> I wrote for <em>Patheos</em> back in February. No matter your take on whether or not same sex marriage should be legal, this ruling is about equal rights, not the sacrament of Christian marriage. No government can legislate a sacred covenant; let&#8217;s celebrate equal rights. Here&#8217;s the column:</p>
<p>Almost six years ago, in June, my wife and I, with the help of some very loyal friends, were preparing for our wedding. We are the &#8220;do-it-yourself&#8221; type and that was reflected in our plans for the big day. This was a wonderful thing because, as our guest would agree, the day definitely felt like it reflected our personalities; but it was also difficult because where some couples enjoy the serenity of knowing all the particulars are attended to, we were running around like crazy people trying to attend to every minute detail. In the midst of this running around, however, we forgot to notice one important detail: the state of Massachusetts, like most states with some notable exceptions like Nevada, requires a three-day waiting period before a couple can obtain a marriage license. That is, you have to apply for the license and then, if you&#8217;re still serious about getting married, retrieve the license three days later. We didn&#8217;t know this.</p>
<p>So, on the Friday before our Saturday wedding we showed up at the county clerk&#8217;s office in Salem, Massachusetts, and requested our marriage certificate. This, we were told, was impossible. We pleaded with the clerk, noting somewhat sarcastically (on my part) that this was our first time. Finally, she told us sternly, like a high school teacher bending to pressure to change a grade, that there was a loophole. In order for us to obtain the license on that day we would have to stand before a judge and plead our case—that is, convince him we truly loved each other—and pay a fee.</p>
<p>We were desperate. We went to the courthouse, wrangled an appointment with a judge and stood before him, assuring him with everything we could muster that we were in love, and, with his permission, that we would really like to get married the next day. Fortunately for us, he was extremely friendly, and far more interested in our menu for the reception (being that our wedding was happening in a picturesque seaside town north of Boston, we were having a clambake). He granted us the necessary waiver and we invited him to the reception. And we paid the fee.</p>
<p>At the end of a long day of running around, we returned to my soon-to-be-wife&#8217;s parents&#8217; house and told them our story. Then, my wife&#8217;s father, a seminary graduate, former pastor, and elder at our church, asked something I&#8217;ll never forget, &#8220;Why&#8217;d you bother with all that?&#8221;</p>
<p>What? Why&#8217;d we bother! Well, if we didn&#8217;t, we explained to him, we couldn&#8217;t get married. Calmly—as is his way—he told us that what we wanted was a Christian marriage, a commitment between ourselves, God, and our community, and that, quite frankly, God&#8217;s not all that interested in local government bureaucracy. The way my father-in-law is right so often has the tendency to infuriate, and never more than in this instance.</p>
<p>I thought of this story recently as I was writing a kind of cheeky <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.patrolmag.com/2011/02/culture/justin-beiber%e2%80%99s-understands-biblical-sex-better-than-focus-on-the-family/" target="_blank">post</a> for <em>Patrol</em>, the blog I co-edit. Last Friday I came across a call to action <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.citizenlink.com/2011/02/bieber-concern/" target="_blank">piece</a> by Focus on the Family&#8217;s Citizen Link, which detailed a recent <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/justin-bieber-talks-sex-politics-music-and-puberty-in-new-rolling-stone-cover-story-20110216" target="_blank">interview</a> that <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine conducted with Justin Bieber. In it, they tried to get the self-professed evangelical Christian to comment on sex before marriage. As much as they tried, however, all they could get from him was variations on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my post I controversially quipped that when it came down to it Justin Bieber understood biblical marriage better than did Focus on the Family. I knew my argument was half-baked, and the piece was mostly meant to be a bit of Friday afternoon fun, but toward the end I did arrive at the lesson I learned that day from my father-in-law. That is, really—biblically—there is no such thing as premarital sex.</p>
<p>The logic goes thusly: if sex is the sacramental act that binds the covenant between a couple and God, then when a person has sex they are marrying their partner. I acknowledge that this idea bodes better for people who have married their only sexual partner, but it is like my father-in-law said, God doesn&#8217;t care much for government forms and the like. In light of this, I thought as I read Bieber&#8217;s quote, he&#8217;s actually spot on, even if he hasn&#8217;t completely thought through the ramifications of what he is saying.</p>
<p>One thing I love about writing and editing <em>Patrol</em> is that the commenters we attract are, for the most part, adept at picking out holes in writers&#8217; reasoning and, rather than viciously exploiting them (with some exceptions), helpfully filling them in. This is certainly the case for at least one commenter there who pointed out that my assertion rightly carried marriage out of the domain of the government, but a bit too far into the domain of the personal. That is, he reminded me that marriage involves Christian community as well.</p>
<p>The implications of this understanding of Christian marriage are far reaching. Not long ago I found myself in a meeting with some top ranking members of a prominent conservative evangelical organization. In this meeting we discussed many things, in hopes of taking the ideological temperature of young Christians. Much to my surprise, and simultaneously not all that surprisingly, one of the representatives of that organization admitted that evangelicals seemed to be winning on abortion, but may have lost on marriage. That is, many polls show that young people are less likely to support abortion rights than previous generations, but are much more likely to advocate for gay marriage than their antecedents.</p>
<p>Though I took some exception with the way this assertion was framed—in terms of wins and losses—I acknowledge the truth that it captures. But, I wouldn&#8217;t call the fact that young Christians believe in equal marriage rights a loss. Rather, if we want to talk about marriage in terms of wins and losses, it seems it has been a losing race for as long as any young Christian can remember. Marriage in the United States is a sham. It is literally the prize one receives at the end of a game show. It is so far from Christian marriage as to be completely unrecognizable and yet, in the realm of gay marriage in particular, Christians fight for it like it&#8217;s the Holy Grail. It isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I recently surveyed the periodicals I most often read for evidence of what marriage looks like in America today. I found stories about applying <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/fashion/13Cultural.html?scp=1&amp;sq=economic%20marriage&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">economic theories</a> to marital relationships, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/yourtaxes/13spouse.html?scp=1&amp;sq=filing%20taxes%20marriage&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">advice</a> on filing taxes separately if you worry your spouse may be involved in some shady dealings, a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/02/28/110228ta_talk_aguirre" target="_blank">story</a> about <em>Playboy&#8217;s</em> Hugh Hefner&#8217;s marriage to one of his models a quarter of his age, and a rather moving <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/fashion/20Modern.html?scp=1&amp;sq=sperm%20donor&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">story</a> about a lesbian couple who decided to share a donor&#8217;s sperm in order to start a family (much like the plot of the film<em>The Kids Are Alright</em>, which I loved, by the way). And none of this even mentioned the divorce rate.</p>
<p>Marriage in America is a secular institution; it has taken a shape of its own and has been a separate thing from Christian marriage for a long time. Let&#8217;s stop fighting to save what hasn&#8217;t been for a long time, and what ultimately, doesn&#8217;t need to be. It is and has been a lost cause. I support any and all people who want to engage in government marriage and pray for God&#8217;s blessing on their lives. I&#8217;ll offer advice and recommend that they file at least three days in advance for a marriage license. But mine is a Christian marriage, bound not by the paper I paid extra for, but by the covenant my wife and I made privately before God, and publicly before our community. In that, no one else&#8217;s marriage, or divorce, or affairs, or &#8220;it&#8217;s complicated,&#8221; or any other relational situation has any effect on my promise.</p>
<p>Christian marriage, however, is worth defending. We believe it is an institution set in place by God. Government marriage is necessary too, but is free of the sacramental weight that Christian marriage carries. There are plenty of good reasons to be married in the government&#8217;s eyes, rights that should be shared by all, and tax breaks that, as the article I mentioned above points out, only apply to married couples filing jointly. In a country such as ours that promises equal freedoms to all its citizens, the benefits of government marriage must be available to all. But government marriages are easily broken, like any non-religious contract. Rather than lament this, or fight over who should have access to these opportunities, Christians should thank God that his covenants are far more lasting, and, ultimately far less expensive.</p>

</div>
<p>A recent U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, and the subsequent fallout here in New York, hits close to home for many of us here at <strong><em>Patrol</em></strong>. The ruling, which came down on June 2<sup>nd</sup>, allows for the city of New York to restrict religious groups from meeting in schools. If the ruling is enforced, it will affect many Christians here, including many friends who attend the Village Church in the West Village.</p>
<p>For the past year or so, The Village Church has been meeting in New York’s Public School 3, and was named in a recent op-ed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/opinion/12stewart.html">piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> by Katherine Stewart, author of the forthcoming <em>The Good News Club: The Christian Right’s Stealth Assault on America’s Children</em>.</p>
<p>Stewart’s essay describes a recent move to the city and the discomfort she felt when she realized that an unnamed evangelical church meets in her daughter’s school on Sunday mornings. She visited the church and reports on what, to her, were some disturbing instances; though, in fact, they range from disturbing to benign. On the disturbing end of the spectrum, the pastor of the church pointed out art on display from some of the school children and encouraged the congregation to pray for the salvation of those children and their families, that they will come to call the school building a “House of God.” That feels a bit like crossing a line.</p>
<p>On the benign side of things, she lays blame on an eight-year-old girl, the pastor’s daughter, for calling the school building her dad’s church.</p>
<p>But this is just the opinion of one New Yorker and, in this case, it may not be up to popular opinion. As a recent <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/juneweb-only/schoolscanbanworship.html?start=2">article</a> in <em>Christianity Today</em> points out, there is a very good chance that the decision by the U.S. Appeals Court will be overturned by the Supreme Court because it violates a precedent set in 2001. Time will tell the fate of these churches, but Christians shouldn’t be surprised if we find that the ruling goes against our interests, if we find ourselves at odds with the government. In the United States we’ve enjoyed a long history of acceptance and sometimes support by the government, but in the scope of Christian history, this should be considered an oddity.</p>
<p>We can hope that this blessing continues, but if the tide turns against the church, we shouldn’t be shocked. Further, though we should exercise our rights as citizens and seek to ensure that the Constitution is upheld, we shouldn’t try to fight against the principalities of the world by arguing with our fellow citizens as some have begun to do.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of Jesus’ admonition to the apostles to “shake the dust off their feet” if they find they are not welcome in a town. I used to read this as a kind of snub, a way for the disciples to say, “Have fun in hell.” But, I’m beginning to see that Jesus was setting expectations, and providing a means to handle the fact that the Kingdom of God is often at odds with the kingdoms of the world. Shaking the dust off was not a move of aggression, but of peace; Jesus was instructing the disciples to not fight for the right to stay. The rest of the chapter goes on to describe the kind of persecution that followers of Christ should expect, though being kicked out of meeting places is not listed, it seems to be in line with the spirit of the persecution Jesus predicts.</p>
<p>New York City needs churches like the Village Church and countless others that meet in schools around the city. The good work they do is absolutely essential to the furthering of the Kingdom and the betterment of the city. But, if meeting in schools is going to present a stumbling block to the sharing of the Gospel, it is best that they start looking for new space to rent.</p>

</div><p>Over at the blog of the journal <em>Image</em>, there&#8217;s an excellent <a href="http://imagejournal.org/page/blog/bad-christian-art" target="_blank">post</a> about what&#8217;s wrong with &#8220;Christian art,&#8221; and, more specifically, &#8220;Christian writers,&#8221; by Tony Woodlief. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>In short, if Christian novels and movies and blogs and speeches must be stripped of profanity and sensuality and critical questions, all for the sake of sparing us scandal, then we have to wonder what has happened that such a wide swath of Christendom has failed to graduate from milk to meat.</p></blockquote>
<p>This excerpt comes toward the end of what is, on the whole, an excellent and insightful look at what many people refer to as &#8220;Christian writing.&#8221; Woodlief begins by reflecting on a review of the recently released film &#8220;Soul Surfer,&#8221; which is directed, he notes, at evangelical audiences. He posits that, &#8220;bad art derives, like bad literary theory, from bad theology,&#8221; and then goes on to show how this is true.</p>
<p>The part quoted above immediately brought to mind something I&#8217;ve been reflecting on a lot lately when it comes to the kinds of things that evangelicals deem acceptable forms of culture. It never occurred to me when I was a child, but looking back it seems strange that Christian adults I knew were attempting to hold themselves to the same standards that they maintained for their children. That is, I knew a lot of parents who didn&#8217;t watch rated R movies, listen to secular music, read anything other than church-approved literature, or even drink the occasional glass of wine. In short, they were treating themselves like children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying there is anything inherently good about doing any of those things mentioned in the previous paragraph, but, especially as it relates to art and literature, it does actually seem harmful to resist the not-so-pretty parts of life in the name of &#8220;purity.&#8221; Certainly, children must be protected and allowed to believe, for as long as possible, that much of the world is black and white, good and evil. But, at a certain point, it becomes unhealthy to continue living in such a manner. At some point, we all must grow up.</p>
<p>Woodlief&#8217;s point, that &#8220;a wide swath of Christendom has failed to graduate from milk to meat,&#8221; rings a resonant note with my experience. And that worries me.</p>
