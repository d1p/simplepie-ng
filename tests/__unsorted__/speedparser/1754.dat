<p>So I have a confession to make. Despite being a long-time Sussex Countian, living around the corner from the brewery and having been inside the brewery at least a dozen times, I had never been on the official <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/community/events/tours/index.htm" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Brewery Tour</a>. So when the occasion arose to take the tour during this weekend&#8217;s annual Weekend of Compelling Ales and Whatnot at the invitation of my friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/philhagen" target="_blank">Phil Hagen</a>, I finally took the plunge.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;ve known DFH VP Mariah Calagione since I was but a wee lad, and I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.coastalsussex.com/weekly/Issue62410/" target="_blank">written about the brewery</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wZ8ytQRfN0" target="_blank">interviewed Sam at the brewery about Beer Wars</a>, and have been immersed in the brand like everyone else in the Cape Region over the last dozen years.</p>
<p><strong>THE TOUR</strong></p>
<p>But the tour, particularly with <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/community/news/press-releases/international-man-of-mystery-floris-del%C3%A9e-joins-dogfish-as-brewmaster.htm" target="_blank">Brewmaster Floris Delée</a> as the guide, was very enlightening. Floris covered a wide array of topics on the tour, far beyond the &#8220;here is this, there is that&#8221; tour I expected. He dove into the quality control issues that a large-volume craft brewer faces and offered many nuggets of wisdom to the homebrewers on the tour, like the difference between cask-conditioning and bottle-conditioning, and the value of yeast.</p>
<div id="attachment_2332" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 225px">
	<a href="http://www.daveburris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2332" title="photo(1)" src="http://www.daveburris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo11-e1301769403579-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">The famous Palo Santo wood tanks.</p>
</div>
<p>Oddly, I was struck a few times along the tour at how un-hip and un-romantic parts of the facility appeared. When you are immersed in the Dogfish brand, you can get swept up in the David-vs-Goliath, off-centered people, and general craft beeriness of the company. But when they&#8217;re kicking out 160,000+ barrels of beer per year, they have to install a lot of 400- and 600-bbl stainless steel tanks, and a lot of it looked so, umm, <em>industrial</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, like all good tours do, we ended up in the DFH tasting room/souvenir shop. Sam was signing autographs and taking photos with fans while people tasted the flight-of-the-day, which included my two personal DFH faves, Palo Santo Marron and Burton Baton (the greatest beer on the planet.)</p>
<p>And based on my observations, I&#8217;ll say DFH brought in <em>quite a bit</em> of revenue selling clothing, growlers, books and posters.</p>
<p><strong>DOGFISH, ALWAYS AN INSPIRATION</strong></p>
<p>As a friend of the DFH family and a noted booster of all things local and all things Delaware, I&#8217;m awestruck and proud at what Dogfish Head has become. (I can remember back to the days when they had to change the law just to open the brewpub.) The company is a source of pride for many people in the area, and is a great example that you can create a vibrant, thriving business and employ hundreds  right here in coastal Delaware if you have a great idea, the right support and an insane amount of determination. Dogfish Head continues to be a tremendous asset to the area and a true inspiration for up-and-coming Delaware entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST: January, 2010</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fake the funk or your nose will grow.&#8221; &#8211; Bootsy Collins, The Pinocchio Theory</em></p>
<p>Who would have thought that the greatest philosopher of the digital era would be the &#8220;<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bootsycollins/biography" target="_blank">the clown prince of comic, psychedelic, good-times funk</a>,&#8221; the legendary Bootsy Collins, sideman for James Brown and George Clinton?  But it&#8217;s true. If there is one abiding principle of the current age, it is this: you can&#8217;t fake the funk.  If you fake the funk, you will be found out. Authenticity is king and transparency is no longer an option</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a company, and you are using social media as a one-way broadcast channel instead of a two-way engagement channel, you are faking the funk and you will fail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are a politician, and you tell one crowd that you oppose higher taxes and another crowd that you support higher taxes, you are faking the funk and you will be discovered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are doing more for yourself than for others while pretending the opposite is true, you are faking the funk and will be rejected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are marketing yourself as a business consultant or a social media shaman, but have no prior results to justify the selling of that advice, you are faking the funk and will be exposed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are emerging from the era of big company marketing budgets dominating our psychies with a barrage of messaging, where product quality wasn&#8217;t a factor in success.</p>
<p>Today and in the future, only the cream will rise to the top. If your product sucks, people will know. If your customer service sucks, you will lose business. You can not hide your shortcomings anymore, you can only work to improve them.</p>
<p>And what a great day it is! What will emerge from this new era of transparency and accountability is a true meritocracy!</p>
<p>No longer will it be up to a few suits at the record label to decide what music gets widespread recognition. No longer will the mass-producers of funk-faked food be guaranteed a bigger reach in your community than your local farmer&#8217;s market. No longer will your government be able to sneak one by you without your knowledge.</p>
<p>So I encourage everyone to prepare for the new era. Cast off the pretense, for it will only weigh you down.</p>
<p>Expose your weaknesses, and watch as the solutions arise, seemingly from nowhere.</p>
<p>And listen to the crowd, for there you will find free wisdom.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bootsy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>What will the effect of the new health care funding system be on startup entrepreneurship? Basically, I see it two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help because entrepreneurs who once were tied to their company health plan can now leave their jobs to pursue their big idea knowing that they can get care; OR&#8230;</li>
<li>It will hurt because entrepreneurs who would have opened shop before won&#8217;t now because where before they could have gone without health care, now it is an additional mandated expense.</li>
</ol>
<p>What say ye?</p>

</div>
<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep last night.</p>
<p>And I didn&#8217;t sleep because my head is exploding with ideas. Now those of you who know me know that I have an idea problem. Ideas are always popping into my head. But not like this. It&#8217;s like a burst dam inside my oversized cranium.</p>
<p>Yesterday I drove to Wilmington to attend the first <a href="http://www.archer-group.com/insights" target="_blank">Trust Summit presented by the Archer Group</a> with bestselling authors <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com">Chris Brogan</a>, <a href="http://www.inoveryourhead.net">Julien Smith</a> (authors of Trust Agents) and <a href="http://www.twistimage.com/about-mitch/">Mitch Joel</a> (author of Six Pixels of Separation). First of all, the magnitude of these people coming to Delaware, together, for an appearance is greater than most people realize. I took to telling people that if there was a Mount Rushmore for social media, they&#8217;d all be on it.</p>
<p>What amazed me most of all is that three people who have emerged as leaders in this space, when each given 40 minutes or so to speak, brought three different perspectives &#8211; Joel&#8217;s passion, Smith&#8217;s depth &amp; Brogan&#8217;s showmanship. I learned a massive amount from each, and I&#8217;m not exactly new to this stuff.</p>
<p>And none of them talked about technology. Mitch Joel even pointed out at the end of his talk that he had not done so. All three seemed determined to focus on the mindset, the paradigms, that need to change. Economy 2.0 is an attitude, an approach. Social media are just a suite of tools and platforms used to implement that new approach.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into the specifics of each presentation but suffice it to say I&#8217;m as convinced as I ever was that business as we know it and as you practice it is changing forever right now. And it&#8217;s people like <a href="http://www.archer-group.com">The Archer Group</a> who are out in front.</p>
<p>Can you see down there, down the road a few years, when the new economy is in full swing? The Archer Group is already there.  You should take the time to learn about Lee &amp; Patrick and their team and what they do. (Lee &amp; Patrick have a hotly anticipated book &#8211; <a href="http://www.engageblog.com" target="_blank">Engage Your Brand</a> &#8211; coming out in a few weeks, too.) These guys are visionaries in this space and they&#8217;re right here in Delaware. The drop-in appearance by the Governor at yesterday&#8217;s event just highlights that fact and the importance of where the economy is moving.</p>
<p>Another reflection from yesterday concerns Ken Grant. I&#8217;ve known Ken for quite some time, before social media emerged. So I have a little different perspective than most, but seeing Ken take the reins of the social media movement in Delaware has been awesome. Yesterday, when Chris Brogan stayed around for two extra hours at the request of the Governor and <a href="http://ldpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Whitney Hoffman</a> to meet with some government economic and communications officials, it was Ken Grant who ran the show. Now Ken is not a government official or the representative of a business or nonprofit group. But yet there he was, running the show.</p>
<p>And he deserves it. While many people are doing great work to increase the use of social media in Delaware (Whitney Hoffman, Rodney Jordan, Rebecca Faber, the Governor, AGS Printing, the VRG guys, I could go on and on), Ken has been the guy who steadfastly steps on the gas at every opportunity. He&#8217;ll deflect all the credit and take none for himself, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s absolutely critical to shine the spotlight on him. Ken&#8217;s a doer, and there&#8217;s no higher honor I can bestow.</p>
<p>Between meetings, I had the opportunity to stop at the nearly-completed coworking space in Wilmington, <a href="http://www.thecoinloft.com/" target="_blank">the CoIN Loft</a>. This fundamentally necessary operation is the brainchild of Wes Garnett &amp; Steve Roettger of the <a href="http://vergebusinessgroup.com/" target="_blank">Verge Business Group</a>. These young guys are full of ambition and generosity of spirit and are hell-bent on creating a thriving, vibrant incubator of entrepreneurial endeavors in Downtown Wilmington. Much like The Archer Group, these two guys will be a driving force for Economy 2.0.</p>
<p>So again I travel northward and return enthused about the future of our great state. Now it&#8217;s time to take action on these new Brogan/Smith/Joel-inspired ideas.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Financial reform is on its deathbed. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/opinion/01krugman.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">So says Paul Krugman</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>So here’s the situation. We’ve been through the second-worst financial crisis in the history of the world, and we’ve barely begun to recover: 29 million Americans either can’t find jobs or can’t find full-time work. Yet all momentum for serious banking reform has been lost. The question now seems to be whether we’ll get a watered-down bill or no bill at all. And I hate to say this, but the second option is starting to look preferable.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so says the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/business/economy/01regulate.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">Times&#8217; news division</a>, too. </p>
<blockquote><p>Details of part of his plan became public in news reports on Friday. The most hotly disputed elements — the creation of a consumer protection agency to watch for deceptive and abusive terms on mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and other financial products — are a reminder of how intense lobbying and partisan gridlock threaten to significantly weaken what the Obama administration has called a top priority.</p>
<p>“The financial services lobby and particularly the big banks are driving the agenda right now,” Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said. “They are the ones gaining ground. Their strategy is clear: death by a thousand cuts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But there are those, primarily progressive think-tankers and Huffington Post matriarch Arianna Huffington, who have proposed a Move Your Money campaign, one based on a principle that conservatives will remember well &#8212; starve the beast. </p>

<p>Remove your money from the global finance casino and invest it in your own community. Find a credit union or local bank. Even our statewide banks like Wilmington Trust and WSFS are community-responsive and do a lot of small-business lending. The best way to reform a &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; bank is to make them not so big anymore.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>UPDATED &#038; BUMPED.</p>
<p>I encourage any of you social-media fans to attend the upcoming #140Conf Meetup in Philadelphia on March 8th. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/140conf/calendar/12592403/">Click here for details</a>. Below is my recap of the first Meetup back in January.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<div id="attachment_1995" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 252px">
	<a href="http://www.daveburris.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/WithJeffPulver.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1995" style="margin-left: 10px;" title="WithJeffPulver" src="http://www.daveburris.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/WithJeffPulver-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="188" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Me with Jeff Pulver, founder of #140conf.</p>
</div></p>
<p>Terrible guy that I am, I left my wife and kids to fend for themselves in the bitter cold for a few days while I ventured north to take advantage of two opportunities: the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s annual dinner Monday night and the #140conf Philly Meetup on Tuesday night. Believe it or not, both were profound experiences.</p>
<p>It was not my first time at the DSCC Annual Dinner. My father was the President of the State Chamber from 1989-2000. But it was the first time I&#8217;d been back since the 2000 event, which was packed to the walls with the excitement from a solid economy and the prospect of a Presidential campaign featuring that night&#8217;s keynote speaker, Texas Governor George W. Bush, and a gubernatorial campaign featuring the outgoing Chamber president.</p>
<p>What a difference a decade makes. Bush won the election, and disaster ensued. Dad lost the election, and disaster ensued. Which was the greater disaster lies in the eye of the beholder and more likely in their political affiliation.</p>
<p>Fast forward ten years to the 2010 Annual Dinner. I&#8217;m most certainly a different person at 35 than I was at 25. But the environment at the dinner was incredibly reflective of where we are as a state. The night was dominated by elected officials. In fact, once you accounted for the elected officials, the appointed officials, the staff and the lobbyists, you had half the room covered. A telling statement on the government as the dominant sector in our economy. I can think of only two or three people among the dozens I talked to that weren&#8217;t tied to the government in some meaningful way.</p>
<p>The keynote from DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman confirmed for me one thing: I have a tremendous indifference for big multi-national companies. This is a massive sea change for me, but basically, I no longer trust any organization that can&#8217;t fit in my car. I&#8217;m not knocking DuPont per se, and we absolutely need DuPont and other large companies to employ Delawareans, but, in the words of E. F. Schumacher, &#8220;small is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s emblazoned on my brain from that dinner is that it was the old economy on display: 900 people in business attire paying big money to listen to the CEO of DuPont talk about globalization while trying to lobby legislators to lean one way or another, backslapping each other in echo chamber-esque fashion while ignoring the mounting evidence of a state whose government and economy no longer work.</p>
<p>For all the talk of the new economy, entrepreneurship, green jobs and innovation that spews out of the government/business PR machine nearly daily, nothing has ACTUALLY changed in Delaware and we are largely rudderless as an economy. No one wants to be the one to say it, but the telling glances and whispers confirm it: <strong>no one really knows what to do</strong>. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re not trying or don&#8217;t care. They just don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And that brings us to Tuesday night and the #140conf Philly Meetup at a great bar called National Mechanics. (Dogfish 90min in the bottle was a welcome find.) The event brought together about 100 people to talk about and share the State of NOW and the Now Economy.</p>
<p>There couldn&#8217;t be a more stark difference. The fact that it was free. The sharing of real, valuable, actionable information. The passion and emotion on display. The feeling of movement and progress. The vibrancy. The community. The authenticity.</p>
<p>I was struck at the end by James Bressi, one of the event organizers, who put into words the way I live my life. I&#8217;m paraphrasing, but he basically stood up at the end of the event and said, &#8220;Thanks for coming, and if there&#8217;s anything you need help with, anything at all, contact me on Twitter. If it is within my scope, I will help you to the best of my ability.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that earnestly to a room filled with people, many of whom I assume he didn&#8217;t know. He didn&#8217;t have to do it. And you could tell he wasn&#8217;t doing it for show. He meant it. Maybe had I not had such a contrasting experience the previous night it would not have been so profound. But it was.</p>
<p>And that was the vibe all evening. Great, great speakers who shared their Twitter experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>#140conf mastermind Jeff Pulver, who stripped Twitter down to its communication essentials and empowered everyone in the room;</li>
<li>Chris Lehman, principal of Philly&#8217;s Science Leadership Academy magnet school, who talked about educating kids vs. training them, about teaching kids to think and question, and about how he&#8217;s used social media to take those lessons to the next level;</li>
<li>Melinda Emerson, the &#8220;Small Biz Lady,&#8221; on her journey and her desire to &#8220;end small business failure.&#8221; (I Love It!)</li>
<li>Author Jonathan Maberry, who has used Twitter to interact with fans, quell concerns (a white guy writing a comic with a black, female character?) and score gigs with Marvel Comics and Universal Pictures. (line of the night: &#8220;140 characters? I write <em><strong>novels</strong></em>.&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m making too much of the juxtaposition of the two events, but here I am the next day and that&#8217;s what stuck. I got more &#8212; much more &#8212; out of 100 people I don&#8217;t know than I did out of 900 people, most of whom I do know. And I can say without equivocation that the future economy of the state I love and fight for needs to look a hell of a lot more like those 100 Twitter misfits in a Philly bar than like the 900 business &amp; government dignitaries in the Chase Center.</p>
<p>And I intend to do my part to make it so. I hope you will, too.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s been six days since I posted so I thought I&#8217;d check in:</p>
<p>First thing&#8217;s first. Holy snow. I&#8217;ve only seen more snow than this once in my life &#8212; winter of 1993 in Syracuse, NY. Wow.</p>
<p>Second, a little reflection on Wednesday&#8217;s Tweetup in Newark. It&#8217;s worth noting the atmosphere of the DelTweet event matched perfectly with the themes I introduced in my &#8220;<a href="http://www.daveburris.com/reflections-on-a-few-days-away/" target="_blank">Reflections on a Few Days Away</a>&#8221; post. In attendance were diverse political luminaries like the Governor, Rep. Kovach, Charlie Copeland, Treasurer Velda Jones-Potter and Newark City Councilman Paul Pomeroy, media types like WDEL&#8217;s Rick Jensen, Doug Rainey from The Business Ledger, and a wide variety of business interests, including representatives of the State and County Chambers, PR-types from major DE companies and many others.</p>
<p>And there was a great spirit of togetherness in the room, the idea that we were all united in something that was going to change the way we operated the government and the economy. I even gave the Governor a hug.</p>
<p>That kind of buy-in for social media in Delaware was awesome, and is a big step toward a sustainable new economy. A big thanks to hosts Ken Grant, Major Highfield, The Borg, Maya Paveza, Whitney Hoffman and Kildare&#8217;s in Newark and to Markell staffers Brian Selander and Felicia Pullam for pulling all of that off.</p>
<p>Third, (and speaking of sustainable new economy), part of the reason I&#8217;ve been so quiet on here lately is that I&#8217;ve been working on a new project that&#8217;s going to help take these concepts of Economy 2.0 to the next level. But that&#8217;ll have to wait for another day.</p>

<p>Recently, Felix Salmon ran into Barber in Davos, and asked him <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/01/30/world-hunger-and-the-locavores/">about the state of agriculture</a>. </p>
<p>Here is <em>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</em> author Michael Pollan&#8217;s TED talk, including a piece about Joel Salatin&#8217;s Polyface Farm in Virginia. </p>

<li> capable of being sustained</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li> designating, of, or characterized by a practice that sustains a given condition, as economic growth or a human population, without destroying or depleting natural resources, polluting the environment, etc. <em>sustainable</em> agriculture</li>

</ol>
<p>We must create things that will sustain: local economies, governments at all levels, health care, habits, practices. Following a century where everything was about growth at any cost, and a decade that hopefully taught us a lesson about the perils of that approach, we now must change the lens through which we see the world.</p></div>
