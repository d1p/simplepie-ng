			<description><![CDATA[<p>Say the words Mosley Tribes and it sounds like an album Oasis released in their hay day or a place in Birmingham. It is in fact a luxury <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">Sunglasses</a> producer based in West Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Mosley Tribes is an arm of the Oliver's People Vision brand, which has been selling vintage style frames since 1986. They have feature in a range of high-class fashion magazines such as Vogue, GQ, Elle and Cosmopolitan and famous fans include Jay-Z, Usher and Kate Hudson. </p>
<p>Despite the unique frames, Oliver's People Vision has always been noted for its simple glasses cases and brightly coloured cleaning cloths. They were acquired by Oakley in 2006 for a whopping $55.7 Million. </p>
<p>Mosley Tribes was launched back in 2003, a unisex sunglass brand which fuses style and fashion with the active and <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/bolle-ski-goggles">sporty world</a>. The name Mosley Tribes came from the expression of euphoric feeling- Mosley and Tribes- a group of individuals who are united. They design modern versions of timeless frames and lenses. Their brand ethics include classic style, sport culture and street luxury, which as you can imagine creates huge following in the celebrity world. </p>
<p>For summer 2011 Mosley Tribes wanted to base their collection of visions of the world that are incredible and stunning. It was about adventure and getting close to nature, absorbing the great wonders of the world through their sunglasses and your eyes. They chose the island of Kauai, which was perfect for off the beaten track adventures, parts of paradise and rugged landscapes. The ranges of colours and textured were represented in the frames and lenses of the Mosley Tribes Sunglasses, including earth tones and camouflage patterns. Mosley Tribes really do not sacrifice style when it comes to producing highly practical sunglasses, and are definitely a brand to invest in and decorate your eyes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Most of us know about how beer goggles work, but some clever chaps in the USA have created a pair of <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">sunglasses</a> that actually open beer bottles. Yes, no longer do you need a key chain with a bottle opener on it, no longer do you need to break your teeth on the bottle, no longer do you have to the smacking the bottle on your grandmothers antique table. These fantastic glasses look the part and are incredibly practical. </p>
<p>The Brewsees Sunglasses were created for the times when you need sunglasses and a beer opener and let’s be honest these two elements do go hand in hand nicely. You may worry that the bottle opening gadget which is integrated onto the end of the arms of the glasses, the parts that sit behind the ears, would not be strong enough to withstand the pressure of opening a beer bottle top, but Brewsees have this covered. The sunglasses are made from 6061 aeroplane graded anodized aluminium, which is incredibly strong and tough. The polycarbonate frame ensures that it stays in shape no matter how sunny it is or how many beers you drink. </p>
<p>The design of the glasses if very sporty and the bottle opener is not at obvious as you would think. These sunglasses offer 100% UV protection and you can even come with polarized lenses, which for the prices is fantastic. Therefore, for that BBQ down by the beach or lake, Brewsees Sunglasses are the perfect present or pair of sunnies you need.  They look fantastic and are incredibly practical, at $40 (£25) they are a perfect pair of sunglasses. You never know what they will come up with next, an <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/ray-ban-sunglasses">aviator</a> pair of sunglasses that can mend a flat tyre? Some Wayfarers which boil water. Literally, watch this space. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a female, I do realise that the skin around the eyes is possibly the first give away of aging. Yes, unfortunately unless you have amazing genes, we're all going to start getting small lines around the eyes at some point. This is because they skin around the eyes is so delicate and the environment, diet and lifestyle really takes its toll on your skin.</p>
<p>Your eyes show a lot of emotion, happiness, sadness, anger. The muscles used in these expressions can cause the skin around the eyes to wrinkle. The area around the eye is called the Periocular, and if this is puffy, red or dark, it not only hampers your vision, but can change the look of your face.</p>
<p>There are some simple tips that will help you care for the periocular. Firstly getting enough sleep. It is said that on average a human should get 8 hours sleep. Obviously not everyone has this type of sleep pattern, but lack of sleep can affect the eyes making them red and puffy. </p>
<p>Protecting the skin against the suns harmful UV rays is the best way to slow down the signs of aging. The way to do this is choose a daily moisturiser with an SPF and use without fail every day. You may think that because it's cloudy that you wouldn't need to use it, wrong, UV rays are present all the time, even on the dullest of days, if you get into a great routine with this you will notice the difference.</p>
<p>When the sun is out in full force wearing <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">sunglasses</a> will not only protect the eyes but the delicate skin surrounding the eyes. The best sunglasses are oversized and <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/anna-sui-as810-black.html">larger glasses</a> as they protect a larger area around the eye.</p>
<p>There is a range of products available on the market, which will improve the skins firmness and signs of aging. By following our initial tips, you should see a great difference to the delicate eye area.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It could have come straight from the movies, as a spy or a war hero, but night vision <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/bolle-ski-goggles">goggles</a> and sunglasses are the real deal and are being sold by numerous companies.</p>
<p>Night Vision was created to enable the forces to see their own troops and the enemy under the cover of darkness. Compared to animals, humans have poor night vision due to the lack of tapetum lucidum. </p>
<p>Night Vision technologies use factors such as image intensifying and thermal imagining being able to pick our people or animals in the darkness.</p>
<p>Night Vision sunglasses are specifically created to increase vision and clarity when driving in the dark. Strange as it seems wearing <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">sunglasses</a> at night, these particular shades feature a citrus coloured lens, which are fantastic in low light, in the dark reduce glare from other cars, and make vision a lot clearer.</p>
<p>These are incredibly popular shades and worn by many drivers, although the majority would never have heard of night vision glasses, or considered wearing them whilst driving. It does make sense, not matter how safe your car is if using something to increase visibility and clarity during the night, it's worth investing in. You don't have to spend hundreds of pounds on Night vision sunglasses either, you can buy a basic pair from about £10, but if you are looking to a name you trust and want to invest in a designer pair of night vision sunglasses, Tag Heuer have a range of Night Vision Sunglasses, which you can purchase for around £250. Tag Heuer, famous for creating exception time pieces, and basing its design around speed, engines and racing, Tag Heuers range of night Vision Sunglasses which when the pupil dilates in the darkness, their glasses not only protect the enlarged pupil but cut out glare and bright lights from other drivers.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week's news has been full of the revolution in Libya, groups of incredibly happy people lining the streets of the towns in celebration. The other side of this is we see Colonel Gaddafi on many television stations taking part in hard-hitting interviews. It seems that Gaddafi seems to be a huge fan of designer sunglasses, in fact these days you will not see him without a pair.</p>
<p>I have tried to study which brands of sunglasses he has been parading round, and its seems that <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/ray-ban-sunglasses">Ray Bans</a> are quite a favourite, as well as ladies style sunglasses it seems. </p>
<p>There was a bit of rumour that Ray Ban supplied the dictator with free sunglasses until he started playing up and threatening his own people. </p>
<p>We have seen aviators with gold rims, aviators with black plastic rims, rimless <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">oversized sunglasses</a> and frameless reading glasses. It is a bit strange to see Gadaffi without any sunglasses. </p>
<p>Maybe like the ancient story of Solomon, sunglasses were Gaddafi's key to power, maybe he's lost his favourite pair or sat on them, plus if the rumour is true and Ray Ban have stopped their supplies he may have to purchase his own.<br />
As the news breaks who really knows what will happen to Gaddafi, Libyans lining the streets shouted that the dictator was dead but no one knows for sure. </p>
<p>Funnily enough there is a Facebook group called "Colonel Gaddafi likes wearing Sunglasses" and basically tells funny stories about pictures containing the aforementioned dictator in a range of sunglasses. </p>
<p>They say the eyes are the window to the soul, this is possibly why Gaddafi tends to cover his eyes all of the time so people cannot see what he's thinking or plotting next. I wonder due to the revolution if his collection will go up for sale?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the summer, I've managed to not be afflicted by the seasonal curse of Hay fever. After years of suffering, I think I have it down to a fine art and know when it's going to hit me full on in the fact like a train. </p>
<p>I sneeze, I get a runny nose, and worst of all itchy eyes which swell up and can only be disguised by <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/">sunglasses</a>. </p>
<p>It seems to be prevalent when the sun is out, so due to the natural dismal British Summer I haven't needed to take many tablets, until today. I sit here with one swollen left eye, which feels like I've actually taken a punch to it because I've rubbed it so much it's now bruised. Not really a clever thing to do, but I must admit after popping a tablet it has calmed down, it is just superficial damaged caused by my excess rubbing.</p>
<p>Hay fever affects 12 million people in the UK. Also known as pollenosis or Allergic Rhinitis, Hay fever is caused by the inflammation of the nasal airways. Pollen and dust from a range of common plants float around in the air, they are microscopic and obviously, when we're outside enjoying the summer sun, these little terrors float into our airways and cause sneezing and wheezing. They also affect the eyes, making them stream and itch. It's not the most pleasant thing to have or the best look with red eyes and nose, but there are so many medicines on the market, you're bound to find one that does the trick. </p>
<p>I use Cetirizine, I've tried all of them over the years, but this one tends to get to work straight away. If you're like my mother, you will say prevention is better than the cure, and certain medicines command that you start taking them well before the season starts. I’m fine with my choice of drugs. They tend to work very quickly, last the whole day and don’t make me drowsy. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, today I was not quick enough, so it's on with the sunglasses, to hide my big red left eye. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Luxottica, the retail giant who specialises in premium products such as eyewear and sportswear has just bought the Erroca Sunglasses chain for $20 million. </p>
<p>Erroca was purchased in 1996 by Michael Wolf and only had 19 stores, today the company has grown to 63 independent stores and a turnover of $120 million a year. The Erroca brand makes up 35% of the chains sales. For the first time, an international premium Sunglasses Company will run from its headquarters in Israel. Luxottica plan to rename "the sunglasses hut" under which the company operates, and the sales of the private Erroca brand will cease.</p>
<p>The sunglasses hut is the largest retailer in the world, providing ranges of sunglasses to over 2000 stores across the globe. </p>
<p>The renamed chain will benefit from the brand power that Luxottica already holes including sunglasses from <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/ray-ban-sunglasses">Ray Ban</a>, Oakley, Vogue, <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/persol-sunglasses">Persol</a>, Oliver Peoples,<a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/arnette-sunglasses"> Arnette</a> and Revo.  They also sell high fashion brands such as Burberry, <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/bvlgari-sunglasses">Bvlgari</a> and <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/tiffany-sunglasses">Tiffany</a>. </p>
<p>Purchasing Erroca give Luxottica a great strong brand presence in Israel and allows them to supply high quality brands to the country, that they may have never stocked before. </p>
<p>Not only have Luxottica been providing incredible quality and service to its customer over the last 50 years, it also prides itself with committing to its own charitable foundation. Money is raised to provide eyecare for millions of people across the globe from charities such as give the Gift of Sight, the Pearl Vision Foundation in North America and Community I Care in Australia the all merge into Onesight, Luxottica's big charity. </p>
<p>One sight runs eye clinics all around the world, provides free eye exams, and recycled eyewear from the Luxottica stores to 15,000 people in developing countries.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Across the globe, a whopping 96 million people wear glasses due to poor sight, 66% of which are in the USA alone. Apparently, in the UK more that 3 million of us wear glasses.<br />
When it comes to prescriptions, our opticians go through rigorous testing to find a solution that will enable us to see, to read, to drive and will suit our lifestyles. When give a prescription that particular strength of lens or contact lens will last for two years, because unfortunately our eyes tend to degenerate. </p>
<p><strong>Prescription Glasses</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to normal glasses there is a huge range on the market, that will suit your style and face shape, and many vision specialists will offer you two pairs for the price of one, this allows you to have two different styles. It can seem like a big task to find a pair that you love and that suit you but take your time and consider the following; the top of the frame should be no higher than your eyebrows, the lower edge of the frame should not rest on your cheek, make sure the bridge and the whole frame is comfortable before your purchase them.</p>
<p><strong>When the sun shines </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to prescription sunglasses, you can be a bit more adventurous in terms of frames and styles. You can opt for designer <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/anna-sui-as810-havana.html">over-sized</a> frames or even wrap around frames. The lenses in prescription sunglasses are designed to reduce brightness and allow you to see in sunny conditions, you can opt for <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/bolle-anaconda-10335.html">polarized sunglasses</a>, which reduce glare, which if you’re driving or near water is a fantastic addition to your prescription sunglasses. </p>
<p>There is no messing around with prescription sunglasses, no wearing contacts with normal sunglasses over the top, no clip on sunglasses over your normal glasses, it give you the freedom to look fantastic, protect your eyes from UV light and enable you to see clearly and get on with your day. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Persol, the luxury sunglass design, has just launched a new exhibition, based on its appearance of sunglasses in the movies. </p>
<p>The exhibition celebrates iconic film and the obsession <a href="http://www.sunglassessave.com/persol-sunglasses">Persol</a> has built over the years, of producing incredibly high quality sunglasses, which have been worn by the main leads in some of the best films ever produced. </p>
<p>The Exhibition takes place from the 17th July to the 19th July at Centre 548 in New York.  30 stories of craft obsession is the first of three exhibitions from Persol.  They display artefacts from some of the most iconic films, which are rarely seen, plus notes, sketches and behind the scenes footage.</p>
<p>This interesting event aims to show that making a film is not just about the actors but the amount of work, which goes into getting things correct, from the scenery to a pair of sunglasses. It's the art of incredible determination and perfection for all those involved in the film making industry.</p>
<p>You'll find how actors prepare themselves for a role, to how sound is recorded and placed onto the film, and how the wardrobe and props department function. These parts, which make a film crew and ultimately produce and top billing film, can spend months on their trade preparing it for the actual shooting of the film. </p>
<p>Over the past Century Persol as a high quality brand has been closely linked with the film industry. The Italian design and hand artisanship make it an incredibly honoured and desired brand of sunglasses. Unbelievably every pair of sunglasses made by Persol is passed through the hands of 15 different highly trained craftsmen, and it takes 30 steps to create a pair of these amazing sunglasses, which are all hand crafted. </p>
<p>Persol still continues today to champion great design and can be seen on the faces of many a movie star. After New York, the Persol Exhibition will move onto Milan. </p>
