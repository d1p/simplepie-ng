			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a new workout technique from Zen to Fitness which seems to work great not only for results but in its ability to give the body a new shock and cause a certain adaptation, which essentially what we are all looking to achieve from a workout.<br />
The great thing about the workout is the burn, this works for a great pump and as well as an effective way to build the muscle not only in size but for endurance. I have no doubt this workout is a great one for athletes or those training to look better. The other benefit is that time fly’s by and the workout is fun and over in no time. A timer that beeps every minute is also very useful when doing this type of workout&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
