			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MP900309156.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1667" title="Survey" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MP900309156-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>There are so many expenses when you buy a home.  Some of those things are optional, such as: home inspection, radon test, lead based paint test, well and septic tests, and surveys.  So, how do you decide what to do when something is &#8220;optional?&#8221;  Today I want to specifically focus on one, the survey.  How do you know if you should get one?</p>
<p>My recommendation is always going to be to get one, period.  You are making way too big of an investment to let $200-$500 stop from you from getting all the information you need about your new home.  Not convinced?  Let me tell you a story&#8230;<span id="more-1662"></span></p>
<p>I recently had a buyer who wisely obtained a survey, and discovered that her property was encroaching on three other properties!  Encroaching is the word we use to basically indicate there is a survey issue, and you are over the line.  Fortunately, all parties were able to work things out and it was not a big deal.  What if she hadn&#8217;t discovered this until she decided to sell in a few years, and one of her neighbors did in fact have a problem?  It could have cost her a lot of money to correct it, whereas, in this instance the seller had to pay to have the encroachments remedied.</p>
<p>Still not convinced?  Here are some instances that are a red flags to do a survey:</p>
<p>A fence: often homeowners guess as to where the line is when they build them.  Going to build one?  Get a survey first!</p>
<p>Other items that may have been added after the house was built: a driveway, a storage building, a play-set, etc.</p>
<p>How about items not associated with the property you are buying, but the adjoining property?  Do they have any of those things?  They could be encroaching on the property you are about to purchase.</p>
<p>Again, I will always recommend you get a survey.  I&#8217;d rather you spend the money now, and have the seller correct any issues, rather than you having to spend a whole lot more down the line to correct an undiscovered issue, because you were saving some money on a survey.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Luxury-home-foreclosure.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1645" title="Luxury home foreclosure" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Luxury-home-foreclosure-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>There have been several articles recently stating the luxury marketing is starting to come back.  Let&#8217;s look at some stats I gathered from the Triad MLS:</p>
<p>There were <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>14 sales</strong></span> in the<strong><span style="color: #339966;"> last 6 months</span></strong> between <strong><span style="color: #339966;">$1,050,000 and $2,950,000.</span></strong></p>
<p>The <strong><span style="color: #339966;">previous 6 months</span></strong> there were <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>9 sales </strong></span>between <strong><span style="color: #339966;">$1,013,000 and $1,075,000.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The same time frame in</span><strong><span style="color: #339966;"> <strong>2010 </strong></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">there were</span><strong><span style="color: #339966;"> <strong>10 sales</strong> </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">between</span><strong><span style="color: #339966;"> <strong>$1,100,000 and $1,625,000.</strong><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>So, the numbers don&#8217;t lie&#8230;there have been definite improvements in the luxury price point in number of sales and sales price.  This is good news, are you sensing a &#8220;BUT&#8221; in here?</p>
<p>In <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>2005</strong></span> in this same time frame there were <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>22 sales</strong></span> between <strong><span style="color: #339966;">$1,001,659 and $5,912.500.</span></strong></p>
<p>I know, way to be a Debbie Downer Heather.  I only give you this information because I love you my readers.</p>
<p>While we are seeing improvements in the luxury market, I don&#8217;t think it is fair to anyone to call it a comeback.  There are a lot of sellers out there in the luxury market that are getting their hopes up.  It is still a very difficult market given the very small pool of buyers in this price range right now.</p>
<p>It has been predicted that we will never see sales the way we did in 2005, so as LL COOL J would say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t call it a come back.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s instead call it a very welcome improvement that we hope to see more of!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Prices-Down.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1362" title="Prices Down" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Prices-Down-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Good news&#8230;houses are selling.  Bad news&#8230;the prices continue to decline.  So, if you listed your house 6 months ago at the price your Realtor recommended at the time, and it hasn&#8217;t sold&#8230;then you need to reduce, well you should have reduced a while ago, so if you haven&#8217;t: Do it!</p>
<p>Why? Well, if prices have continued to fall that means that <span id="more-1359"></span>new listing, you know your competition up the street, if it was priced based on the most recent comparables (and it should have been) than it is likely going to be priced less than yours.  You see, your house isn&#8217;t worth today what it was 6 months ago.</p>
<p>Make sure your house is priced today for what it is worth today, what the comparables show.  If you Realtor hasn&#8217;t given you an updated CMA in the last 6 months, let them know you want one.  When you get it, don&#8217;t ignore the information!  If it shows you need to reduce $10,000 to be in line with today&#8217;s values&#8230;then do it, or you need to take your house off the market if you can&#8217;t bear to go that low.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Due-Diligence.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1352" title="Due Diligence" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Due-Diligence-150x116.png" alt="" width="150" height="116" /></a>If you have been looking at real estate for a while you have probably noticed some changes.  The North Carolina Offer to Purchase and Contract changed January 1st of this year.  I summed up <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2010/11/19/major-changes-january-1st-2011-to-nc-offer-to-purchase-and-contract-for-real-estate/" target="_blank">the changes to the Offer</a> in an earlier blog post.  One of the major changes was the addition of a &#8220;due diligence&#8221; period.  This is the time the buyer has to check out anything they want to know about their potential home, such as: schools, restrictions, inspections, etc.</p>
<p>These changes meant some changes to <span id="more-1350"></span>other things we utilize such as the MLS (Multiple Listing Service), and in the Triad many of us use <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/free-listing-book-account/" target="_blank">Listing Book</a> as well.</p>
<p>Prior to this change I had a lot of clients ask me about what <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2010/04/05/what-does-pending-and-pending-ab-mean-listing-book/" target="_blank">Pending and Pending AB</a> meant when they saw that in <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/free-listing-book-account/" target="_blank">Listing Book</a>.  You will also now see Due Diligence in <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/free-listing-book-account/" target="_blank">Listing Book</a>.</p>
<p>If a home is marked as &#8220;Due Diligence&#8221; it means that they are still within the time frame of the contract when the buyer is doing all of her research about the home, such as inspections.  If it states the home is Pending then it is after the due diligence period.  An important thing to note about the difference in these two time frames is that a contract is more likely to fall apart during the due diligence period, so if you see a home you like, just keep an eye on it during this time.  If the home shows as pending it is more likely the home will actually close.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate.png"></a><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate1.png"></a><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate2.png"></a><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate3.png"><br />
</a><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1345" title="Summerfield Absorption rate" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summerfield-Absorption-rate4-1024x768.png" alt="" width="655" height="491" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Source: Triad MLS, Actives in Summerfield for the date of 7/29/11, Solds in Summerfield for the last 6 months as of 7/29/11</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on this calculation it appears Summerfield currently has enough homes on the market to last for over one year.  So, what is important about that?  If you don;t want your home to sit on the market for a year (or more) you need to price it right and have it in top condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I can calculate absorption rates for any city, neighborhood, zip code, etc.  If you would like information please contact me!</p>

<p><em>Greensboro residents seeking to make energy-efficient upgrades to their homes now have access to a federally funded program available through the City. The BetterBuildings program offers grant assistance and a rebate and incentive package to homeowners who make qualified upgrades that result in at least a 15 percent improvement in their home&#8217;s energy usage.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The $5 million program allows the City to assist homeowners in making their homes more comfortable and healthy while lowering energy usage and cost. The program qualifies homeowners for a grant that will provide $2,000 worth of energy upgrades designed to lower energy costs by 15 percent. Lower income homeowners can qualify for the grant program, while those with higher incomes can receive a rebate on their energy assessment and other incentives. Duke Energy will also make $425 rebates available to the first 100 homeowners who do not qualify for the grant.</em></p>
<p><em>The grant provides for basic upgrades, such as insulation improvements and heating and air duct sealing. All participants in the BetterBuildings program will receive a complimentary introduction package that includes CFL light bulbs, a programmable thermostat, and low-flow shower heads. Homes receiving energy-efficient upgrades will be &#8216;Home Performance with Energy Star&#8217; certified. To learn more about the program or download an application, visit the <a title="City's Website" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=pssvarcab&amp;et=1106412549929&amp;s=1491&amp;e=001nM5J60rhbmjoSXyx4vI6JSTYrQBhFKqU3Zb9KB-Yexr0HY-kWUdkOQtBv6Pcw404eurZ2FX5g-_3O_dv8hObyipD_N76LF9SOgQxjEzuQQbOIIwz5CEs5g==" target="_blank">City&#8217;s website</a> or call 336-373-CITY (2489).</em></p>

<p>This is a loan that allows you to get money for renovations or repairs, and the best part is- all the work can be done after closing.  You can get money available for minor repairs such as carpet &amp; paint… you can remodel bathrooms and kitchens… fix or upgrade air conditioning… add appliances, new windows and siding, a new roof – you can even add an addition.  For the most part, if it is attached to the home and adds value and is not considered a luxury item, you can pretty much use this loan to take care of it.</p>
<p>Since this is an FHA loan, this is for primary residences only  and will be subject to FHA’s loan limit (varies by county, Guilford County is $271,050).  FHA purchase loans require a 3.5% down payment, and on a 203(k) loan the 3.5% is based on the sale price + the cost of renovation.  Interest rates are slightly higher than a ‘normal’ FHA loan, but considerably less than construction loans.  They are based on a normal 30 year fixed term, so you won’t have to worry about payments increasing down the road.</p>
<p>Procedurally, you will need to make your wish list of all the items you want to repair or improve in the home.  Next a licensed and insured contractor will create a bid to do the work, and then you are ready to move forward. (Certain renovations may require a HUD inspector to review the contractor’s bid to ensure it is in line with FHA guidelines, most basic renovations do not require this).  It is a good idea to get your home inspection and all program required inspections completed (termite, well &amp; septic) within the 1st week of going under contract so if there are any hidden defects to the home, they can be addressed by your contractor.</p>
<p>Don’t miss out on an opportunity just because the home is not quite the way you want it – fix it up and make it your own, you will be glad you did.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MP900314084.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1315" title="Travel" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MP900314084-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>We all like to take vacation, and Realtors are no exception.  Worried about what might happen to that offer you put in, or what if you get an offer on your home, and your Realtor is away?</p>
<p>This can be handled a couple of different ways.  Sometimes I take my <span id="more-1314"></span>office with me, and can work from where I am, if needed.  I may not check my emails and voice mails as frequently, but once or twice a day to handle anything should be sufficient.  This is typically if I am somewhere closer to home, and that I know I will have good phone service and access to wireless interenet.</p>
<p>Now, what about the other way?  That is what you really need to know about.  I am about to leave the country on a mission trip in a remote village and there definitely will not be wi-fi.  Oh, and honestly, on a mission trip, real estate is the last thing I will be thinking about.  So, what happens to my business while I am away?</p>
<p>Part of planning a trip like this is planning for my business.  It is important that my clients know they will be taken care of without a single misstep in my absence.  I elicit the help of another agent in my office that is experienced, and I know treats his or her own clients well.  I make sure the agent that is filling in has my clients contact information, their files, and that they are aware of anything in particular that is going on.  I also make sure my clients have the other agent&#8217;s contact information.  Any Realtor I am working with will also have the contact info for the agent that is filling in, so if we are in the middle of negotiating a contract negotiations won&#8217;t stop and wait for me, and they don&#8217;t have to!</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t fret over your Realtor&#8217;s travels&#8230;.just make sure they have got you covered!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMAG1106.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1305" title="IMAG1106" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMAG1106-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>My first two posts in this series told you about<a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2011/06/20/north-carolina-mountains-linville-caverns/" target="_blank"> Linville Caverns</a>, and then our drive on the <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2011/06/27/blue-ridge-parkwa/" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>.  Today we move on to our time at <a href="http://www.tweetsie.com/" target="_blank">Tweetsie Railroad</a>.</p>
<p>Our hotel, a brand new and super cool <a href="http://www.lq.com/lq/properties/propertyProfile.do?propId=6073" target="_blank">La Quinta</a>, was only minutes from Tweetsie Railroad, which was nice because there was no rushing out of the hotel to get there early.  We were early enough though to park very close, so no long walk back to the car at the end of the day-score!  The tickets seemed a little pricey, $34 for me and $22 for my son, but hey-it is<span id="more-1304"></span> a one time thing, and a unique experience.</p>
<p>The park isn&#8217;t huge so it is easy to get around, and doesn&#8217;t wear you out like other theme parks, but there is still lots to see and do.  My son wasn&#8217;t interested in any of the shows, but of course wanted to go into all of the shops and check out the western stuff.  It is worth going into the stores and trying on some of the funny hats for some good picture opps.  There were no cute T shirts for me or the kiddo to commemorate our trip though.  Bummer, they could have had more of my money!</p>
<p>The highlight of the whole park is the train and the train ride.  It goes right through the center of the park at the front area, and it is huge, especially to the little ones.  There was no wait to get on at all, and plenty of seats.  It really is a nice ride through the cool mountains on a summer day.  They do a wild west style show that is cheeky and funny.  The cowboys ride the train with you and give all the kids a bullet to take home.</p>
<p>The rest of the rides were perfect for my son, who is not a huge thrill seeker, he likes little thrills, and that is exactly what they offer.  They even have the scrambler which is my absolute favorite (I am also a small thrill seeker).  Although, after eating the fare offered, a few rides had me calling for mercy and sending the kid to ride the next few on his own.  The nice thing is the park is small enough (and not crowded) that I could do that while watching him the whole time from a pic-nic table.</p>
<p>They also offer gem mining and a petting zoo, although my kiddo stuck to the rides.  We also did one of those funny pictures where they dressed my kid up like an old gun slinger.  It turned out great-he looks super tough!</p>
<p>The scariest part of the entire park: the chair lift.  I was half way up the mountain before I realized I have become very afraid of heights and had to beg my child not to move or talk.  Ridiculous! He thought this was hilarious of course and started rocking the chair lift.  Goober.</p>
<p>Tweetsie is a great place to go for a special day with your kids.  It is close enough to the Triad that you can make it a day trip, and like I said, it really doesn&#8217;t wear you out like the big parks.</p>
<p>One more post to go!  What do you like to do in the North Carolina Mountains?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMAG1075.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1300" title="Blue Ridge Parkway" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMAG1075-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In my last post on enjoying the summer in the North Carolina Mountains, I told you about my trip to <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2011/06/20/north-carolina-mountains-linville-caverns/" target="_blank">Linville Caverns</a>.  This post picks up where we left off, leaving the caverns and heading to the <a href="http://www.blueridgeparkway.org/" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that every American who comes within 100 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway should go there.  If you want to experience nature, and the way it changes with the season, there just is no better place.  We were on the parkway for about an hour, but you could <span id="more-1299"></span>really enjoy it for days.  There are a lot of trails and camping.  I am definitely going to bring a pic nic next time!</p>
<p>We were headed to our next destination and fortunately the Blue Ridge Parkway was the best way to get there.  I explained to my son that there are no commercial vehicles allowed, so the parkway is quieter and more enjoyable, and maybe even safer.  There are also no signs allowed except for the ones that point out scenic overlooks, etc. so you have an unblemished view of the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>We were driving at about 5 or 6, so the sun was still up but the air was getting cooler.  We got out at several overlooks, and were glad that we had our jackets-even in June! My son marveled at how beautiful the mountains were, and said that he wished we could live in one!  They truly are breath taking.</p>
<p>Along the way we saw two deer eating on the side of the road.  The were not afraid of our car, so they didn&#8217;t stop enjoying their dinner.  There wasn&#8217;t a car behind me, so I stopped so we could watch the deer for a few minutes.  That was really neat!</p>
<p>I may even venture to the Blue Ridge this fall to see the leaves in their glory.  I have heard it get&#8217;s pretty busy on the Parkway, because North Carolina has some beautiful falls, with vibrant colors.  If you have been on the parkway in the fall, let me know what your experience was like.</p>
<p>After we got off the blue ridge we had another fun attraction waiting for us, but you&#8217;ll have to wait for the next post about that!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMAG1067.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1293" title="Linville Caverns" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMAG1067-150x150.jpg" alt="Linville Caverns" width="150" height="150" /></a>Last week I took my son a short vacation to the North Carolina Mountains to celebrate the end of a great school year.  Our first destination was <a href="http://www.linvillecaverns.com/" target="_blank">Linville Caverns</a>.  It is approximately a 3 hour drive with a food stop from the Triad. It is tucked back away from any real city area, so you really do feel like you are deep in the mountains.</p>
<p>There was hardly anyone there with it being the middle of the week, so we got <span id="more-1291"></span>a tour all to ourselves.  The tour guide was informative, funny, and tried to engage my 7 year old in conversation as much as he could.</p>
<p>The caverns are one of only two places in the world that you can truly be without light.  You are after all in the middle of the inside of a mountain.  It is 52 degrees all the time inside the caverns, and thankfully we knew this and brought jackets.  At one point they turned off all the lights so we could experience what the total darkness was like.  Pretty spooky!  People used to hide out in those caverns, but I can&#8217;t  imagine!</p>
<p>There are some incredible and ancient rock formations with many different colors.  They had named a lot of the rocks for what they looked like, and even had us make up our own names for some of them-my son loved that!</p>
<p>There is a creek that runs through the inside with some fish in it.  We squeezed through a tight walkway over a metal bridge where you could see the lower level of the cavern, which is a pool that is so still and deep you would think it was glass.</p>
<p>My son wants to go back when the bats are there-lucky me!</p>
<p>Our next leg in this journey took us to the Blue Ridge Parkway&#8230;.to be continued&#8230;</p>

Property Condition!  Appraisers are becoming more like inspectors than simply appraising the house.</p>
<p>The other side of the equation is some of these sellers are distressed and trying to sell &#8220;as-is&#8221; &#8211; this isn&#8217;t passing the appraisal process. Remember a buyer who is getting an FHA loan can’t buy a house with certain conditions present, for example, a broken window.  I had one recently where the lender required a piece of insulation be tacked back into place.</p>
<p>Sellers-Listen to your Realtor® when he or she mentions a needed repair while your home is being listed.  “As-is,&#8221; is challenging in today&#8217;s market due to new appraisal guidelines. Price and condition are the two most important elements in any market, but condition is becoming more critical to the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Buyers-if you are getting an FHA loan remember that a foreclosure or short sale may be difficult with the condition requirements by FHA.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2011/06/08/the-top-two-reasons-real-estate-contracts-are-falling-through-part-1-of-2/">number one reason real estate contracts are falling through.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pre-qualify-buyer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1261" title="Pre qualify buyer" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pre-qualify-buyer-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The number one reason?  The buyer didn&#8217;t qualify for the loan.  This is why I require all buyers to get pre-qualified for a loan before we start looking.  Not only does this keep me from wasting time with a buyer who cant&#8217; close anyway, but it keeps my buyer from getting broken hearted when they think they have found the perfect house and then they can&#8217;t qualify!</p>
<p>The mortgage process seems to be different every day, and sometimes the banks are asking for some really strange things, and often at the last minute.  This makes it difficult for everyone.  It is so important to have a great team: great agent, great attorney, and great mortgage officer.</p>
<p>Sellers-don&#8217;t feel like this is out of your control.  Make sure your agent is requiring a pre-qualification letter with every offer.  This isn&#8217;t a guarantee that the buyer will ultimately be approved for the loan, but sure is a step closer.</p>
<p>And reason #2 will be next post.  Why did I not make you wait for #1?  Because #2 really sticks in my craw.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taxes.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1246" title="Taxes" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taxes-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Recently I got an email from a buyer who purchased a home during the initial <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/category/tax-credit/">First Time Home Buyer Tax Credit </a>asking me some details about repayment of her tax credit.  She is considering selling her home to move into a bigger one, and wanted to know what the implications <span id="more-1245"></span>would be.</p>
<p>I contacted David Scheumann, CPA and have posted his response below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">In general there were two credits. The 2008 credit for $7500 that has to be repaid over 15 years…$500/year for 15 years. Then the 2009/2010 credit that does not have to be repaid. For the $7500 credit if you move before you repay, all bets are off &amp; it has to be repaid then/there….unless some exclusions apply. For the 2009/2010 credit, if you move within three years of buying, you have to repay the full $8000 (or $6500 if you were the long-time buyer) back immediately….again, some exclusions apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Yes, you only have to repay any of these credits to the extent you have a gain on the sale. But again, that is somewhat misleading. A big piece that is not very clear is that you have to reduce your basis in the home by the amount of your credit received or the balance of the credit still to be repaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">For example….house price = $100,000, you received the $7500 credit and for simplicity you have not repaid anything yet.  Your adjusted basis is $92,500.  You are selling it – sales price $105,000, commission 6% = $6,300…net sales price = $98,700.  Normally, you would think your gain is $1,300 &#8211; $100,000-$98,700.  However, you actually have a gain of $6,200….$98,700-$92,500. You would have to repay the $6,200.</span></p>

<p><strong>Greensboro, NC</strong> – <strong>Heather DeDona </strong>with <strong>Allen Tate</strong> has been awarded the National Association of REALTORS<sup>®</sup>’ <strong>[NAR’s]</strong> Green Designation, the only green real estate professional designation recognized by NAR.</p>
<p><strong>DeDona</strong> achieved this prestigious designation after completing 18 hours of course work designed specifically for REALTORS<strong><em><sup>®</sup></em></strong>.  The courses were created in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of industry experts from across the country; ensuring designees gain comprehensive knowledge of green homes and buildings and issues of sustainability in relation to real estate.</p>
<p>More specifically, <strong>DeDona</strong> was trained in understanding what makes a property green, helping clients evaluate the cost/benefits of green building features and practices, distinguishing between industry rating and classification systems, listing and marketing green homes and buildings, discussing the financial grants and incentives available to homeowners, and helping consumers see a property’s green potential.</p>
<p>“Living green is about making healthy choices that are also easy on your wallet. NAR Green Designees have the necessary resources &amp; relationships to effectively work with you on your next green project.” said Al Medina, Director of NAR’s Green Designation.  NAR’s Green Designation was developed in response to growing consumer awareness of the benefits of resource-efficient homes and buildings. The designation helps consumers who care about energy efficiency and sustainable building practices identify REALTORS<sup>®</sup> who can help them realize their green real estate and lifestyle goals.</p>
<p>As an NAR Green Designee DeDona has gained the knowledge and the tools necessary to become a trusted green resource for <strong>Greensboro. </strong>For more information about Heather DeDona, please visit www.TheTriadAgent.com or e-mail <strong><a href="mailto:Heather@TheTriadAgent.com">Heather@TheTriadAgent.com</a> </strong></p>

<p>Quite simply, the house isn&#8217;t yours&#8230;yet.  When you go to the attorney&#8217;s office and do all the paperwork that is called &#8220;settlement.&#8221;  The house isn&#8217;t your until &#8220;closing.&#8221;  Closing is when the attorney goes to the county courthouse and records the deed, at that point the house becomes yours and you can then get your keys.</p>
<p>Usually the attorney will record within a couple of hours of settlement. So you need to consider this when scheduling closing.  If you are planning on moving into your house over the weekend and settlement is scheduled for 4pm on Friday the attorney likely will not record until Monday, meaning you can&#8217;t move in over the weekend because the house isn&#8217;t yours!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/downsizing-greensboro.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1215" title="downsizing greensboro" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/downsizing-greensboro-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Whew!  It has been a busy few weeks here in the Triad for real estate.  Things are really heating up!  More and more of my clients, both buyers and sellers, are DOWNSIZING.  People no longer want an upstairs that they don&#8217;t use because the kids have gone off to college, and they hate going up and down the stairs.  Folks don&#8217;t want to heat and cool those unused spaces, because, hey, it is getting expensive!</p>
<p>Is it really downsizing?  I guess so, but I would call it RIGHTSIZING.  People are looking for homes that are going to meet their needs and wants, instead of a home that is a status symbol, or that has a bunch of rooms they don&#8217;t need or use.</p>
<p>What if you don&#8217;t fall into that category, or what if you need those extra rooms?  Good news!  As more people downsize that means there are more people willing to sell their bigger homes at likely a lower price so they can move on.  You get the big house you need and they get to move into a home that is better suited for them.  It is a win win!</p>

<p><em>The City has launched a program to assist residential and commercial property owners in making energy efficient upgrades to their homes and businesses. The Early Adopters Program is an element of a $5 million BetterBuildings grant awarded to the City by the Department of Energy. </em></p>
<p><em>To participate in the program, property owners must first have an energy assessment of their building conducted by a BPI or RESNET certified professional. Once completed, owners must submit a copy of the assessment along with an Early Adopters application to the City for approval. If approved, the City will rebate 50 percent of the cost of the assessment, up to $150 for single-family homes. </em></p>
<p><em>After the assessment rebate is approved, recommended energy upgrades should be completed by a contractor. If enough improvements are made to make a building 15 percent more energy efficient, the City will then rebate 20 percent of the total cost of the home improvements, up to $4,000 for single-family homes. Rebate amounts for other types of buildings, including multi-family and commercial properties, are also available. </em></p>
<p><em> More information about the program can be found <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=pssvarcab&amp;et=1104851285234&amp;s=1491&amp;e=001Y2qMvLQNXTdD-rXlRxB4jaU_WQflBz0Qagsq_ReX46FzmKGEZ3kX-ksVgCbWtKN0hEpYbojBOs-fl5yOPLh-l6ZXFFsrmrt6Ur7prZYek-31HtQGZKlLvkl9wewRVuMYvTjpoI5HYBiwaGYAtkzK-Q==" target="_blank">online</a>.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from some of you who are taking advantage of this program!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The below was distributed to Guilford County Employees in an email:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/guilford-county-school-bus.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1181" title="guilford county school bus" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/guilford-county-school-bus-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>At tonight’s meeting, the Board of Education approved a new multi-tier bus schedule for the 2011-12 school year. This means that some students will ride the bus at different times and that the start and end times for the school day will be different at some schools next year. The purpose of the changes is to reduce transportation operating costs and increase efficiency.</p>
<p>These changes will not affect all schools in the same way. For most schools, the schedule will change by five to 15 minutes. For a few schools, the change is 25-30 minutes. Please visit <a href="http://www.gcsnc.com/transportation/pdf/Multi-Tier2a.pdf">http://www.gcsnc.com/transportation/pdf/Multi-Tier2a.pdf</a> to view the bus route times and bell schedule for each school. In short, the schedule for the instructional day at traditional schools for 2011-12 will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Elementary:                               7:45 a.m. &#8211; 2:25 p.m.</p>
<p>Middle (5 schools):                    8:10 a.m. &#8211; 3:05 p.m.</p>
<p>Middle (13 schools)/High:          8:55 a.m. &#8211; 3:50 p.m.</p>
<p>Allen, Guilford, Jackson, Kiser and Mendenhall middle schools will be in the second tier from 8:10 a.m. &#8211; 3:05 p.m. Aycock, Eastern, Ferndale, Hairston, Jamestown, Kernodle, Northeast, Northern, Northwest, Southeast, Southern, Southwest and Welborn middle schools will be in the third tier from 8:55 a.m. &#8211; 3:50 p.m.</p>
<p>The potential savings from using the new multi-tier schedule for all traditional schools is estimated between $706,000 and $1.3 million, and the Transportation Department will be able to remove about 23 to 43 buses from service and increase the district’s efficiency rating by 3.2 to 5 percent.</p>
<p>As we have said previously, these changes will not cause any of our Transportation employees to lose jobs, as the reductions will be absorbed through attrition. However, there may be some shifts in positions and routes. Our transportation employees work hard each and every day to drive our students to and from school safely, and we appreciate their efforts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part 4 in a 4 part series on avoiding foreclosure by guest blogger Damon Duncan of <a href="http://www.duncanlawonline.com/bankruptcy/greensboro-bankruptcy-lawyer/" target="_blank">Duncan Law, PLLC.</a> Check out the <a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/2011/03/14/three-common-ways-to-avoid-foreclosure-on-your-home-part-1-of-4/" target="_blank">first post on avoiding foreclosure</a> too.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Stressed-in-Greensboro-150x1503.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1177" title="Stressed-in-Greensboro-150x150" src="http://www.thetriadagent.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Stressed-in-Greensboro-150x1503.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Bankruptcy</span></p>
<p>When a property has been on the market for a while and there have been no offers, bankruptcy may be a good option for the seller. This is usually the best option when the seller <span id="more-1176"></span>owes a lot more on the property than what it is worth <em>and </em>there are other debts owed the seller would like to eliminate (credit cards, medical bills, unsecured personal loans).</p>
<p>You may ask, “why should I file bankruptcy before I know how much the deficiency balance is?” The answer to this question is pretty straightforward. If you file bankruptcy while you still own your home and you surrender the property in the bankruptcy, the only strike against your credit is the bankruptcy filing – there are no foreclosures, short sales, or deficiency balances on your credit. Instead, the bankruptcy filing acts as an “umbrella” in that it covers up the foreclosure on your credit. In other words, all that will show up on your credit report is a bankruptcy – there will be no foreclosure reflected on your credit report.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you do a short sale or a foreclosure and <em>then </em>file bankruptcy on the deficiency balance, you will have either a short sale or foreclosure on your credit <em>and </em>a bankruptcy filing on your credit. In the meantime, you will have also dealt with harassing phone calls and potential lawsuits.</p>
<p>It is important to realize bankruptcy is not for everyone. However, for the individual or family who is upside down on their mortgage and owes on credit cards, medical bills, personal loans and other unsecured debts they are having trouble keeping up with, bankruptcy is likely the best option. Bankruptcy will allow a family in financial difficulties to eliminate debts that are hindering their ability to gain financial freedom and in turn gain a fresh financial start.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are options available to individuals and families who are suffering from financial difficulties and are unable to make their regular mortgage payment. What may be the best option for one person may not be best option for the next person. Therefore, it is important to review your options with a realtor, financial advisor, or attorney to ensure you choose the best option for your situation.</p>
