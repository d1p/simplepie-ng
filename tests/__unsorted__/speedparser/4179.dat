			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Jenni posted on Facebook for friends to sign up for the <a href="http://warriordash.com/register2011_upper_midwest.php" target="_blank">Warrior Dash</a>, a trail run featuring several military-type obstacles, in southern Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Man, I thought, I would if I were closer.</p>
<p>Obstacle races haven&#8217;t reached Wyoming yet. Honestly, running races are scant and when I look for races, I always end up looking in Colorado.</p>
<p>A few days passed and I realized I had more vacation days left than I though, days that had to be used before the end of this fiscal year. I was already taking two days for a wedding in Missouri, but the four-day series running this week made it easy to take the rest of the week off.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t too late to sign up for the Warrior Dash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t corral our siblings and friends to join us, so we battled the cold, rainy (and challenging) course on our own. The 5K course involved climbing a lot of 12-foot walls and hanging and dropping down on the other side — two things Jenni have never done and rarely do.</p>
<p>But we did it at our own pace and had fun, finished in about 43 minutes. The race was very well organized and I would definitely do another.</p>
<p>Before</p>

<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>When we finished (wading through a mud pit under barbed wire), the announcer saw our shirts and said, &#8220;We need some Kool Aid over here!&#8221; And spectators chanted, &#8220;Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a good time. Getting hosed down by firemen was not.</p>
<p>Even better: Changing into dry clothes before retrieving our free beer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long time, no post. I blame it on busy days at work — <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/casper/article_28389490-c6ea-5af8-b891-59571545429f.html" target="_blank">school starting</a> and <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_db3f2d28-1775-5a31-a551-141b94d0e3da.html" target="_blank">lots</a> of <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/casper/article_2bbacfef-3ee2-50be-ab94-6c1df0f32b8a.html" target="_blank">state</a> <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_fc22d342-a26c-5071-ab10-f0385ae6d876.html" target="_blank">issues</a> — and having way too many fun summer things to do when I&#8217;m not working.</p>
<p>I was a little homesick after my brother and dad visited. So the next weekend, my mom drove from Illinois to Wyoming. She brought her two little dogs.</p>
<div id="attachment_1192" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 522px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1192" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/09/03/return-to-running/photo-on-2011-08-20-at-17-16-3/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1192 " title="Sophie" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-on-2011-08-20-at-17.16-3.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It was really, really hard to let this dog leave me. (Aug. 20, 2011)</p></div>
<p>While Mom was here, we went for a 4.5 mile hike along the Bridle Trail at the base of the mountain. And, for the first time in a month, I didn&#8217;t hurt afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Rewind:</strong> I hurt what I thought was my knee after running the Parade Day 5K way, way too fast and failing to stretch properly afterward. How fast? Try an 8:15 first mile — my PR 5K pace was about 8:40. I ran the first mile alongside a group of Marines, which should have been my first warning sign. Soreness went away a few days later and I attempted to run. I gimped through 5 miles and another 7 that weekend. The point of injury moved from my knee to the top of my quad. The next week, I (stupidly) ran 12 in <a href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/" target="_blank">New York</a>.</p>
<p>I hobbled through two runs a week for about a month. When I saw other runners — especially younger, perkier, faster runners — I got insanely jealous and a little sad. I just wanted to run.</p>
<p>Harder than running through the pain was realizing I wouldn&#8217;t be able to run the full <a href="http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/denver" target="_blank">marathon in Denver </a>next month. I signed up in May, intending to complete my first marathon close to home with friends and family cheering me on. I told myself I could always drop down to the half in case I didn&#8217;t get the training in. I didn&#8217;t get depressed, but I was pretty down for a few weeks.</p>
<p>After the hike with Mom, I dialed back, focused on <a href="http://strengthrunning.com/2011/02/the-itb-rehab-routine-video-demonstration/" target="_blank">strengthening exercises</a> for my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome" target="_blank">IT band</a>. The injury made sense in hindsight — I stopped lower body weight training a few weeks before the injury, stressed all my muscles too hard in the 5K and didn&#8217;t cool down properly. I&#8217;ve hiked every week since and gradually added shorter runs in.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s runs have given me hope that I can finish the half. My legs felt like new on Thursday and this morning I only felt a little pain after 4 of 6 miles.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m back in the saddle with a modified plan that includes lots of stretching, foam rolling and trail running.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the two years I&#8217;ve lived next to the North Platte River, I have not gone fishing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2010/08/" target="_blank">floated the river</a> (three times). I&#8217;ve run past it at least twice a week. I&#8217;ve eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner on its banks. <a href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2010/05/26/first-camping-trip/" target="_blank">I camped next to it</a> and watched friends fish at <a href="http://www.wyomingfishing.net/fishtails/ft_mmile.htm" target="_blank">Miracle Mile</a>.</p>
<p>But I hadn&#8217;t fished until Friday.</p>
<p>My dad and brother visited for the weekend and my dad booked <a href="http://www.crazyrainbow.net/" target="_blank">a guided fly fishing trip in Alcova</a>, about 20 miles southwest of Casper, for us. We fished from a boat, which was nice because we had lots of room to stow stuff and could sit down and lean back once we found a good seam. The best part: the guide would row us upriver to ride the seam over and over.</p>
<p>My brother had fly fished before, so I think he was disappointed with the seven rainbow trout he caught.</p>
<p>I caught 14.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I visited college friends in New York at the end of last month — my first real vacation (not tied to work or family obligations) in a year.</p>
<p>I had a few must-do&#8217;s but I left the weekend up to my friends, with the goal of relaxation. We walked, ate well, shopped and saw some sights — in record summer heat. I&#8217;ve lived in big cities before, but Wyoming has turned me into somewhat of a country girl. Dinner at 9 p.m.? You don&#8217;t smile and say &#8220;hi&#8221; to people you pass? Buying jewelry on the street?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t take many pictures. I was too busy living it.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1157" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/runroute/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1157" title="runroute" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/runroute-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A 12-mile run was on the calendar for Saturday, so I decided to do it Friday morning while everyone else had to work. I didn&#8217;t plan for 101 degree heat. I decided to go for it, carrying 2 water bottles and cash for Gatorade on my person.</p>
<p>I mapped a route from Brooklyn to Manhattan and back, &#8220;laminated&#8221; it with tape and pinned it to my shirt. I didn&#8217;t care I looked like a total dork; I didn&#8217;t want to get lost. But then I did, right away, by taking the wrong bridge into Manhattan. I planned to take the Brooklyn Bridge over (to avoid tourist crowds) and the Manhattan Bridge back. When I realized I was on the Manhattan Bridge, I decided to go with it and reverse the route. It was a little tricky, but I did it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1158" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1158" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/eataly/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1158  " title="eataly" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eataly.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nosh at Eatly. (July 22)</p></div>
<p>You just ran 12 miles on the hottest day of the summer, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p><a href="http://eatalyny.com" target="_blank">Eatly</a>!</p>
<p>Foodie heaven on earth: Giant Italian food store with restaurants themed around a food group such as seafood or salami. All the seating was full, so my friend Monica and I saddled up to a wooden cutting board full of meat and cheese, with a side of sardines, caprese salad and soft, rustic Italian bread.</p>
<div id="attachment_1159" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1159" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/met/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1159" title="met" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/met-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Waiting in line at the Met. (July 23)</p></div>
<p>We woke up earrrrrrly to make it to the museum member hours for <a href="http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/" target="_blank">Savage Beauty</a>, the <a href="http://www.alexandermcqueen.com/" target="_blank">Alexander McQueen</a> exhibit. This line was nothing; when we left 1.5 hours later, the line was easily a couple hours long. Quotes from McQueen scattered throughout and the eerie music made the exhibit more than just clothes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1165" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1165" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/latenight/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165  " title="latenight" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/latenight.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Late night cab back to Brooklyn.

<div id="attachment_1166" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 528px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1166" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/banana/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1166   " title="banana" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/banana.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="601" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Frozen bananas at the Brooklyn flea. (July 24)</p></div>
<p>Sunday Funday started at <a href="http://www.brooklynflea.com/" target="_blank">the Brooklyn Flea</a>. Holy hipsters, Batman! We cruised through vendors selling costume jewelry, records, old artwork and other <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">crap </span>knicknacks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupusa" target="_blank">Pupusas</a>, biscuits and fruits were consumed. And the cloud cover and light breeze offered some relief from the sweaty weekend.</p>
<div id="attachment_1167" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1167" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/mepolaroid/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1167 " title="mepolaroid" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mepolaroid-e1312512867359.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I bought a Polaroid camera, and then continued to take Polaroid style photos on my smartphone. (July 24)</p></div>
<p><a href="http://joshuabickel.com/blog" target="_blank">Josh</a> bought an old SX-70 Polaroid camera at a garage sale the week before. Polaroid stopped making film years ago, but a handful of Polaroid employees saved the last film production plant in The Netherlands and started <a href="http://the-impossible-project.com/" target="_blank">The Impossible Project</a>. And one of the few places they sell film happens to be in New York. I picked up some film for him and a new-to-me Polaroid 600.</p>
<div id="attachment_1169" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 494px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1169" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/08/04/empire-state-of-mind/subway/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1169  " title="subway" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/subway.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="484" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Subway.

(July 25)</p></div>
<p>The weather cooled down Monday, so I took the subway to Central Park for an easy four mile run. Like Friday&#8217;s 12 miler, it went by quickly due to the constantly changing scenery. I ate breakfast in the park, cleaned up and walked around the Garment District and Midtown. I met a more college friends, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen in years, for dinner at <a href="www.westvillenyc.com" target="_blank">Westville</a> in Chelsea. Good food, great conversation.</p>
<p>And very, very early the next morning (too early), I left. Sixteen hours later, I crawled into bed for an early evening nap.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new house feels more like home now that we&#8217;ve had three visitors.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/06/20/still-moving-in/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve only been here one month</a>. But remember, I had 10 visitors in my first year here. And people say Casper is in the middle of nowhere&#8230;</p>
<p>1) My sister who lives in Colorado helped me move in the first weekend. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have much time outside of putting away my kitchen and running to Walmart/Menards/Target. We did have enough time to stuff our faces with sushi.</p>
<p>2) Two weeks ago, my brother stayed for a few days after a bachelors&#8217; weekend in Vegas. He spent the first day on my couch, nursing a hangover of the magnitude you&#8217;d expect from a group of frat brothers celebrating three upcoming weddings. Once his stomach settled, we ate well and made it up to Casper Mountain for a mini hike.</p>
<p>3) Last Thursday and last night, Eric, a high school friend, stopped in Casper during his 48-state motorcycle trip. Casper was a little out of his way, but I&#8217;m glad he stopped in. He&#8217;s documenting and reflecting on his travels in <a href="http://edavison.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">a blog worth checking out</a>.</p>
<p>Only after taking him to dinner at <a href="http://www.thewonderbar.com/" target="_blank">the Wonder Bar </a>did I realize I took all three visitors there.</p>
<p>Another high school friend might stop in on the way to the Tetons in July. Who&#8217;s next?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that it&#8217;s been a month since the biggest change in my life to date, it&#8217;s only appropriate to blog about it.</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 557px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1103" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/06/20/still-moving-in/wyosign/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1103" title="wyosign" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wyosign.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="453" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nearly two years later and I finally get a picture in front of the welcome sign.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.joshuabickel.com/" target="_blank">Josh</a>, my boyfriend of three-ish years, moved to Casper three weeks ago. The Star-Tribune hired him to produce videos, piece together photo slideshows, find enterprise stories around Wyoming and cover breaking news. Basically, he was hired to be a super journalist. Only a few weeks in, he&#8217;s covered <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/vmix_bb0efe58-91a2-11e0-9fe8-001cc4c002e0.html" target="_blank">flooding</a>, Wyoming&#8217;s drum and bugle corps and <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_e6a5d6e3-6bf0-58f2-9126-20dfc0fc441d.html" target="_blank">a legendary bucking horse outside Pavillion</a>.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been here a month and it really hasn&#8217;t felt strange any step of the way.</p>
<p>Although we lived 14 hours apart for the last two years, we saw each other quite a bit — at least once a month for the first year, a series of coincidental days off and vacations. It worked, we thought, but knew it was far from ideal.</p>
<p>But when Josh finally left academia for a photographer job, we lost that flexibility. Finding time became more difficult. More of our trips involved <a href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/01/03/holidaze/" target="_blank">at least one of us working</a>.</p>
<p>So he decided to move west and start something new.</p>
<p>Everything about the move just worked out. I found a house to move into the weekend he arrived.</p>
<p>We were so excited for the move, you&#8217;d think we would be all unpacked by now.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>We got rid of about half the boxes after we bought two bookshelves but the second bedroom is still full of boxes marked &#8220;office.&#8221; Only a few pictures have been hung — the rest are leaning against walls behind doors so we don&#8217;t accidentally knock them over.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been in Colorado for three of the last four weekends and working almost every day we weren&#8217;t gone.</p>
<p>We say we haven&#8217;t had time to settle, but maybe we haven&#8217;t because we don&#8217;t want to. Hanging pictures and finding places for every little knickknack admit that we&#8217;re here, and we&#8217;re here to stay for a while.</p>
<p>This is my ninth address in four years and his third job in two years.</p>
<p>We do well with change. Permanence is another story, one we&#8217;re writing every day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s post topic: <a href="http://www.journerdism.com/carnival-of-journalism-lifehacks-and-how-to-rock-your-journalism-and-information-workflow/" target="_blank">Hack my workflow.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to reading what others have to say because I my workflow can get out of hand on erratic days. Also, I don&#8217;t use many tools and purposely unplug every night.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I use a lot of tools &#8212; smartphone with apps, Google (GMail, Calendar, Docs, Reader, Alerts), Twitter, Facebook, Chrome extensions, RSS feeds. Maybe it&#8217;s my youth, but all these &#8220;tools&#8221; are just part of my day. I grew up multitasking, so the idea (and capability) of having 10 browser tabs, Tweetdeck, story notes and a few PDF files open at a time is not intimidating &#8212; it&#8217;s how I work.</p>
<p>I decided to focus on a few things I do that have dramatically improved my daily life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank"><strong>Evernote</strong></a><br />
This notetaking software syncs your notes to an online account so you can access them from anywhere &#8212; cell phone, home computer, public library. Notes can be tagged and organized in &#8220;notebooks,&#8221; which are fully searchable. You can save cell phone images and web addresses too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only used it from my phone a handful of times, but each time was a particularly desperate measure. Once, I drove two hours away for an interview and the subject wasn&#8217;t answering his phone. I remembered I had his home number saved in an Evernote, found it on my phone and got a hold of him that way. Another time, I enjoyed an awesome bottle of Spanish wine while eating dinner with family in Colorado. Instead of writing down the winemaker, varietal, etc, I snapped a photo of the label and saved it in Evernote.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://desktop.google.com/" target="_blank">Google desktop search</a> </strong><br />
Before Evernote, I saved all my notes in Word documents, organized by story, then month and year the story was written. It sounded like a good idea at the time, but when I wanted to revisit a topic later, it took a while to find the old notes. I haven&#8217;t moved notes pre-August 2010 over to Evernote yet, so being able to Google my computer has been very very helpful. It works with Google search terms too, like &#8220;filetype:PDF&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipkfnchcgalnafehpglfbommidgmalan" target="_blank"><strong>Send to Kindle, Chrome extension</strong></a><br />
This extension will send text shown on a webpage to your Kindle, for free. (I view the story in print or full-page mode first.) I can save several long reads at a time, load them to my kindle and read them in the car, while I&#8217;m getting a pedicure, while I&#8217;m getting my oil changed, etc.</p>
<p><strong>PDF/Excel shortcut</strong><br />
Did you know you can copy spreadsheet data from annoying PDF files by using the ALT key? Changed. My. Life. Just hold the ALT key and select a box around the data you want to copy, by column. CTRL+C that crap and CTRL-V it in a column in Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong><br />
Morning runs and evening walks bookend stressful days. The run wakes me up, gets me going. The walk forces me to quit working for 30 minutes or so and clear my mind.</p>
<p>I once wrote a story about a school that believed so strongly in the link between exercise and brain activity that they <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/article_a07ee302-3556-5989-9ded-9887b983f2c2.html" target="_blank">require regular exercise breaks during every class period</a>. <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/article_66ca3802-22f2-5465-955a-9981a370d216.html" target="_blank">They put kids on treadmills and then sat them down in front of a reading computer program</a>. The kids&#8217; reading skills skyrocketed over a short period of time.</p>
<p><strong>A to-do list. On paper.</strong><br />
So so so old-school, I know. But once something makes it on my daily list, it will get done (or slightly modified in order to get done.) At work, my lists are on a Post-It pad so I can stick it to my notepad and take it with me. The pad stays in front of my at all times, probably the only thing I can locate on my desk within milliseconds.</p>
<div id="attachment_1097" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1097" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/06/09/carnival-of-journalism-tools-to-improve-life-and-workflow/todolist/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1097" title="todolist" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/todolist-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pre-vacation to-do list, before I added at least 6 more items</p></div>
<p>At the end of the day, I peel off the sheet and start the next day&#8217;s list. I transfer any leftover items and bang out the first things that come to mind, check my calendar and write a few more down.</p>
<p>The list is a plan waiting for me first thing in the morning. No matter what happened before I get to work &#8212; car problems, burnt oatmeal, computer didn&#8217;t start up properly &#8212; I can get started on at least one thing on the list.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By JACKIE BORCHARDT &#8211; <a href="http://trib.com" target="_blank">Star-Tribune</a> staff writer</p>
<p>Unpacking, sorting and packing are loathsome chores to most.</p>
<p>Jessica Cousineau does them every day &#8212; and she likes it.</p>
<p>As the sole employee at the Natrona County School District Science Depot, Cousineau is responsible for the contents of more than 1,400 boxes of science materials. Each box contains a teacher guide, student handbook and materials to conduct science experiments around a theme, such as the human body and magnetism and electricity.</p>
<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.fossweb.com/">Full Option Science System (FOSS)</a> &#8220;kits&#8221; have been the districtwide science curriculum in elementary and middle schools since 2009-10. The curriculum teaches &#8220;inquiry-based&#8221; science lessons, meaning students learn by conducting experiments and asking questions.</p>
<p>Teachers each check out a kit for a few months. District trucks collect the kits at the end of the semester and return them to the Science Depot, which moved from the Fairgrounds Center to the gym next to Star Lane Center on South Fairdale Avenue.</p>
<p>When the semester ends, Cousineau switches to autopilot, sorting through each box and preparing its contents for the next teacher in the fall. Cousineau said Natrona County&#8217;s Science Depot is the only one she knows that doesn&#8217;t have at least two employees.</p>
<p>Except for the radio playing in the back corner, Cousineau works alone in the gym converted last year into the Science Depot. Six-foot-high shelves full of boxes take up most of the space. The old school stage holds more boxes.</p>
<p>Buckets of twine, paper clips, masking tape and materials that might otherwise be found in a kitchen junk drawer line the back wall and one row of shelves. Cousineau pulls from these buckets to replace broken, missing or used-up pieces of the kits.</p>
<p>There are rubber bands that would fit snug around your pinkie and bands that could wrap around a watermelon, twice. One section of buckets holds cups, cups of all types &#8212; paper, plastic, plastic foam &#8212; and sizes &#8212; 3 ounces, 3 ounces with two holes, 5 ounces, 6 ounces, 8 ounces, 9 ounces, 16 ounces.</p>
<p>Some pieces, such as teacher guides and instruction videos, have to be specially ordered if they don&#8217;t get returned. Some of the kits require extra materials, which Cousineau gathers and puts in boxes before they arrive in schools. If a piece is missing or breaks or isn&#8217;t working after the kit is delivered to its destination, Cousineau runs to the school with a replacement or fix.</p>
<p>She hatched chickens a few days before teachers began theirs so she could answer questions and share tips. This summer, Cousineau plans to build an organism center to house pill bugs, mealworms, snails and other critters to be used in several classrooms.</p>
<p>Cousineau has performed many of the experiments, but doesn&#8217;t know the purpose of every material. She didn&#8217;t major in science and thought she applied for the wrong job when she showed up for her interview.</p>
<p>But it was the right job, Cousineau said, a job she enjoys. For each day she spends unpacking and packing, she spends one researching experiments or testing new equipment or running materials to schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kids don&#8217;t know me at all,&#8221; Cousineau said. But they welcomed her when she arrived at schools with the chicken eggs. &#8220;I had kids run up to me and give me giant hugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She knows teachers by the names and bar codes on the boxes but often doesn&#8217;t know what happens when the kits leave her. She plans to visit schools this year to see the lessons being taught, to be able to better help teachers who use the kits in the future.</p>
<p>That is, if she has time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My sister graduated college a few weeks ago. I drove to Fort Collins to watch her (and 800 other liberal arts grads) walk across the stage and spend time with my parents and grandparents who flew in for the week.</p>
<p>Another reason to drive to Colorado: My dad found a new car in Wisconsin for me to buy. The price and timing were right, so he drove the 2010 Corolla out and drove my 2001 Corolla back to sell in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Someone in my immediate family has graduated every other year since 2003. We&#8217;ve sat through a lot of graduations and graduation speeches.</p>
<div id="attachment_1092" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 329px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1092" href="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/2011/05/29/commencement-words/samgrad/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1092  " title="samgrad" src="http://www.jackieborchardt.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/samgrad.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="260" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The graduate, smiling before yet another graduation speech.</p></div>
<p>The CSU president spoke at the liberal arts ceremony. He warned students not to listen to talking heads, to seek facts and make up their own minds. His concise advice: &#8220;Be thoughtful, be reflective and avoid false choices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the speeches are fuzzy to me — I spent most of my graduations chatting with friends. (At my college commencement ceremony, we cracked open beers someone hid under their gown.)</p>
<p>I did listen to chunks of my master&#8217;s degree ceremony, enough to remember this part from <a href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/alumni/dorothy-gaiter-73.html" target="_blank">journalist Dorothy Gaiter</a>:<br />
&#8220;There are no unimportant assignments just as there are no unimportant people. And while you are out there doing good journalism, don&#8217;t forget to get a life. No editor will ever care for you the way your loved ones do. Don&#8217;t ever forget that. And if you have a hobby, another passion besides journalism, make time for it. You never know where it will lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passage is on an index card in my desk. I&#8217;ve pulled it out on slow days or during weeks when I feel married to my work, a to make the most of unattractive assignments and make a life outside the newsroom.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been lurking on the <a href="http://carnivalofjournalism.com/ " target="_blank">Carnival of Journalism</a> for a while now. Every month I told myself I&#8217;d write the next month. I finally got around to it for this month&#8217;s topic: <a href="http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/04/12/carnival-of-fail-the-next-jcarn/" target="_blank">Failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A failure in your life (personal or professional) that has lessons. It must be your failure and you must  take responsibility. But this will be a safe space to discuss our failings and what we can learn from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I decided to write about this because I don&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p>What I mean is that I&#8217;ve developed a sense of optimism and resiliency that forces me to see the upside of a crappy situation and move forward. I fail every day — spill coffee on my shirt, forget to ask a key question in an interview, leave an important detail out of my story. But I frame the situations positively — I needed to get rid of that old shirt, I can ask the question again and write another story, I&#8217;ve got a blog post ready for the next day.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where I get this from. A first child thing? Pressure from my parents to always do better? Too stubborn to admit failure?</p>
<p>I stopped moving for a few failures, and the one that sticks out the most happened during my first year in college.</p>
<p>I decided to fill my science requirements by concentrating in &#8220;brain and cognitive sciences.&#8221; It sounded smart and cool, which I thought I was — I won a big-money scholarship, achieved a 4.0 GPA first semester, edited the features section at the student newspaper as a freshman.</p>
<p>I signed up for Foundations of Cognitive Science — perception, language, memory — anxious to have my mind blown.</p>
<p>After a few weeks, the only thing blown was my GPA.</p>
<p>Reading for my three literature classes took priority over the obscure sciency text so I had no clue what was going on during the lectures. Not that it mattered — the class was held the mornings after production nights. If we put the paper to bed on time at 7 a.m., I could fit a two-hour nap in before class. <strong>If.</strong></p>
<p>Final grades were determined by two out of three tests. If you did well enough on the first two, you didn&#8217;t have to take the last one during finals week. I bombed the first test and picked up the studying. But I was too far behind, and I bombed the second test. I calculated my odds of getting anything better than a C on the last test (which I needed to get a C in the class) were as good as winning the lottery and using the money to travel to the moon (this was soon after <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/news/No_Space_for_Lance_Bass_/1113310" target="_blank">pop star Lance Bass announced his mission to outer space</a>.)</p>
<p>My academic adviser told me I had two options: <strong>Fail or withdraw</strong>. Had I visited her a week later, I would have missed the withdrawal deadline and been forced to take a D on my shiny transcript.</p>
<p>My hand shook so much while filling out the paperwork that I had to start over. I cried in the adviser&#8217;s cubicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail at waterskiing and playing video games against my brother,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t fail at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t fail,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You withdrew. You got out and are going in another direction.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> It&#8217;s not failing to change midcourse, make a plan, move forward. Also, it&#8217;s better to seek help at the first sign of trouble — not when the ship is halfway (or two-thirds of a semester) to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Impending failures can be turned around and I look for them as I work on daily stories, investigative projects and redecorating my apartment. I persist through failures as best I can, and when I&#8217;ve flat on my face failed and there&#8217;s no way to fix it, I document the failure (journal, post-it on my desk) and start over.</p>
<p>I did this last night with this post. I saved the &#8220;failed&#8221; part in a file on my computer, a small reminder that it&#8217;s OK and even productive to fail.</p>
<p>Making and using a Plan B might not be called &#8220;withdrawal&#8221; in the real world, but it&#8217;s not failure either.</p>
