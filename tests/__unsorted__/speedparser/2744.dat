But the writing isn't. I didn't reach 50k. But this project has been extremely cathartic. So lets keep it going. I'll keep posting scenes here if people will keep reading them. Also, check out my poetry blog if that's more your thing.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://passthepoetry.blogspot.com/"&gt;passthepoetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;More posts to come soon, as soon as I can get through finals. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-5483458669370668921?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/12/day-seventeen.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-8109349225003369905</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-19T11:57:36.459-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>mirella</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clio</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>farren</category><title>day sixteen.</title><description>&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style=" font-weight: normal; color: rgb(120, 120, 120);  font-style: italic; line-height: 21px; font-family:'courier new', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

The glint off the bright white of the tile floor momentarly blinded me. My mother stood at the kitchen sink, in a green skirt and dark heels. She always dressed like she was going somewhere important, even when her only task for the day was to saty home and keep Farren and I out of trouble. She was singing softly to herself something in Italian that she used to sing to me when I couldn’t fall asleep at night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: 18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“E non importa niente se capisci che non era vero,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;c'è sempre tempo per un'altra mano e per un sogno ancora intero.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: 18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;It means something close to: “And it doesn’t matter if nothing you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;understand is true, there is time for another hand and for a dream.“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;I pulled on her skirt and she looked down at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“La buona mattina annerisce poco l'uccello.” She smiled indulgently at me, kneeled down and hugged me. Her soft dark hair tickled by neck and my cheeks. “Good morning my little blackbird.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;My mother was the only person that I’ve ever considered perfect. She had a soft heart shaped face and wide dark eyes. Her skin was olive and smooth, and always wore a red lipstick that was bright without being garish. Every kiss was accompanied with a hand wiping off the residue that was left behind. She smelled like rosemary and like the light flowery perfume that she wore. Even now when I go home, I can still smell her perfume in the kitchen. When I asked Farren if he could smell it to he yelled at me, so I don’t know whether this is just my imagination or whether he smell of her does actually linger there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;She worked as a kindergarten teacher before she and my father got married and had Farren, and from then on she stayed home with us, doing art projects, helping with homework and teaching Farren, Clio and I Italian. She was obsessed with the idea that we would respect our Italian heritage and while my father had been born in another country as well, England, he laughed when we asked him about our English traditionse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“The only thing I care about is that you stop calling football ‘soccer’” he would joke in a faded accent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;My mother on the other hand, had us writing and speaking in Italian since we were babies. She made sure that it was our first language and since my father had studied it in school, he kept up with us as best as he could. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;That morning was just like every Saturday morning, my mother kissed me good morning, handed me the box of cereal I asked for and poured milk for me. I chattered away at her in rapid Italian and she did dishes and then sat down across from me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;When I finished breakfast I pulled her out into the yard where Farren was sitting on our swing set, throwing rocks over the fence into the woods behind our house. She sat on the back porch step, watching Farren and I chase each other around the yard and compete to see who could swing higher on the set, looking worried when Farren almost went all the way around the top bar. He laughed raucously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;We passed the morning in the yard, trying to disgust my mother with bugs that we found, roughhousing in the grass and cloud watching at the top of the jungle gym.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;It was lazy summer morning. Then all of a sudden, from her place on the porch step, my mother started to scream. Farren and I turned, from where we sat coloring at the picnic table in the back yard to see her with her arms over her head rocking back and forth. What little we could see of her face was contorted in pain, as if stabbed my a million tiny knives. I’d never seen my mother anything but calm and kind, even when she was annoyed with us or upset about something we had done her temper was always even. It was my dad that usually did the yelling in the house. My mother was the picture of grace. So the pain on her face made her look like another person. Someone that I didn't know. It was an instant like this before she stood and ran over to us, her face written with terror and we looked at each other, not understanding the reason for her fear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;She grabbed my hand and pulled me from my seat, I scraped my knee against the rough wood of the table and it started to bleed. My eyes started to tear up from the pain of it and I looked at her restentfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“Hurry. Dante hurry get up, get in the house. He’s here.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“But Mom, what…?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“I said GET in the HOUSE Dante.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;She grabbed Farren as well and pulled him away from the table, looking at the fence and when we ran to the house throwing her arms out as if shielding us from something. She stood straight and tall, her posture one that suggested she was ready to fight. From the door of the kitchen Farren and I looked out into the yard, not knowing what was happening. I remember that I started to cry, I didn’t know what was happening, what she could see that we couldn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“Leave my children alone. Leave my children alone.” She yelled the words, looking fierce and my father came running from inside the house as my mother fell to her knees sobbing. He put his arms around her, looking as we did, for the threat in the yard. She collapsed against him, tears streaming down her cheeks. I ran into the yard thinking that I could comfort her, that she needed me and not my father, that for some reason he would not understand in the way that I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;I caught the flow of her words in between her choked sobs as I approached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“Tax…no…please. No more. No…no more. Not my children.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;My father turned his head as he heard my small footsteps, and there was a different kind of fear written on his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;“GET BACK IN THE FUCKING HOUSE!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;I took a step closer to my mother, ignoring my father and looking at her, makeup smeared, red lipstick still perfect. I reached out and touched her hair with the tips of my fingertips, not really sure if she was really there. And then my father pushed me yelling, but I didn’t hear the words. I ran back in the house, pushed past Farren and Clio and ran up two flights of stairs, my chest heaving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;I threw open the door to my attic bedroom and slammed it behind me, locking it and sliding down the door. I ended up huddled against the door, frightened of what my mother could see and frightened of what my father my siblings and I could not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;No one came up to look for me for a long time. I sat there back against the cold door, the sun had not yet gotten low enough to the horizon to show through my window and take the chill off the room. Everything seemed to be awash in greys and browns. I tried not to make any noise, but I cried silently, not bothering to wipe away the tears and snot, hugging my head into my knees as if trying to block out what had happened. I remember that even my room, which was the one place I could escape to when Farren had been mean or my parents had yelled at me, even here everything suddenly felt foreign. Over and over I repeated the one word that I hadn’t recognized in my head. “Tax. Tax. Tax.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;It didn’t make sense. I was nine at the time, and it wasn’t like I didn’t know what the word meant. But it was so out of place, so unexpected. And my mother, she had always been a place of strength for the whole family but especially for me. I liked to think that I was her favorite. I spoke Italian the best, I helped her the most, I was the one that she let push the cart at the grocery store. They were stupid childish things to think maybe, but they were the things that I remember most about her. To see her fall like that, crumble on to the ground and to not understand, not do anything, not even reach out a hand to touch her was terrifying. Still I had no thought that anything else would happen. I was as sure as possible in my nine year old brain that she would be the same tomorrow as she was this morning, standing at the sink in her heels and bright colored dresses.

Little Clio trailed in behind him. We stayed there, the three of us barely speaking, hearing yelling from down below and my brother and I trying to keep Clio from crying. We put her to bed and then went to be ourselves, not daring to go downstairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;The next morning when I woke neither my mother nor my father were in the house.

Like, they’re all part of the same story. And apart from being…well really scary, they’re too real. It feels like when I wake up that I never went to sleep. And when I dream them, I see the most horrible things happen to these people. Theses people that I feel like I know because I’ve been dreaming about them since the beginning of the year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Madison’s eyes widened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I know it sounds crazy.” There was a note of defensiveness in my voice when I said it, a note that I couldn’t keep out considering how touchy of a subject it was for me. “I just…I know what it is that I know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Madison’s smile had faded, her joking tone disappeared and she looked serious for the first time since I had met her. She leaned forward, her head on her folded arms and looked at me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Continue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I wasn’t sure what else she wanted me to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I guess, I just want to have some control over this stuff you know? I thought that they’d go away eventually, my professor says that it’s just about stress but I’m not so sure.” I sighed, “There’s just no stopping it you know? I want to be able to experience my life but instead its flipped.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“How so?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I just mean I’ve been so tired that its like I move through everyday dreaming. I’m not giving my girlfriend the attention that she deserves or focusing on the classes that I need to do well in because when I’m awake I can’t think about anything but the dreams. I feel like I’m asleep all the time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She nodded and let me continue.  “I guess its only when I’m dreaming about these people…I only really feel awake when I’m asleep. But I don’t want to be because then that means all my time awake is time that is filled with these horrible happenings. These horrible nightmares.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Madison didn’t look at me, she instead traced the grain of the wood table with her forefinger, looking at it thoughtfully. I worried that maybe I had revealed too much, maybe she was going to start to think that I was crazy maybe even dangerous. I hadn’t thought about the ramifications of spilling it all out, in a way that I hadn’t with Professor Laurent. I had told her the real truth about these, dreams…visions, whatever they were. And I hadn’t given a thought to the judgment that would accompany my story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“What do you love Dante?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;The question caught me off guard. Not only had Madison used my name, which she never did, but the question seemed to be so far off the point of what I had just told her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I mean just what I said kid, what is it that you love most? What are you passionate about?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I don’t know, my girlfriend I guess.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I mean other than people pintsize. What are you attracted to intellectually?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;It was a strange question, and I wasn’t sure that I was going to find an answer immediately. This new, serious Madison was strange and slightly off putting. It seemed that I didn’t really know her like I thought that I did and this change in attitude was alarming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I don’t really know. I guess I like history.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She rolled her eyes, “Why?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Why? Because it tells the stories of what happened. Its what we’ve inherited but its dynamic and adventurous. I guess…” I paused, trying to pick the words that I wanted carefully, “I guess it’s more than most people experience you know?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Madison grinned cheekily looking up at me, “But you’re experiencing something like that aren’t you? Something extreme and dynamic and adventurous.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I’m not sure that I would put it in such a positive light.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Well no one does when they’re in the darkest part of their story right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I thought about this, and nodded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“There’s always a way to emerge from that darkness a hero right? Because that’s the way that people want to remember history. As a history of heros.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;My head was swimming. I wondered if that meant that she didn’t think that I was crazy. Was she trying to say that these things that I had told her, the dreams that I was having actually were real. I asked her this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Well they’re real to you. So they have something of the real in them right?”I wasn’t sure that this line of reasoning made too much sense. I must have looked confused because she pressed on, “I just mean that your experience is real right? You’re really dreaming these things aren’t you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Well yeah, if I weren’t really dreaming them then I wouldn’t be so tired all the time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Exactly, what I’m saying is that what is real and what isn’t real doesn’t really matter in the end. The only thing that you know for sure is what you experience so that’s all that you can take away from any situation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“What do you think I should do?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She smiled, a calm knowing smile that was so unlike the usual impish grins or seductive glances that her face usually held.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I think you should tell your story. History isn’t history if no one writes it down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;It was hours later, after a bus ride to campus, a trip to the bookstore, a new blank notebook three new pens (two black and one green), that I ended up back in my dorm room, sitting at my desk and staring at a blank page. I felt stupid, I’d never written anything down before, well nothing that was fiction at least. And then I remembered what Madison had said to me about things being real or at least your experience being real. And I realized that I wasn’t really writing fiction, I was just writing what I had seen, the same way that I would describe what happened in a movie or what I had read for class the night before. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;My hand shook a little as I uncapped one of black pens, drawing looping circles on a spare piece of paper that was on my desk to get the ink flowing. I watched the circles become clearer and clearer and when they were as dark as the pen would go I positioned it above the page. There my hand paused for a long time, the way id always did on the keyboard when I had to write an essay. The first few sentences are always the hardest, I reminded myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;And this is how I started to write &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Taxed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Another Morning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I woke that morning with a new sense of purpose. It was early, but I had morning class that day, so I was used to getting up before the crows. It was cold now, the eighteenth of January and there was some frost on the ground underneath my boots. I picked my way carefully down the stree, passing the other two north campus dorms and heading down towards the HUB. I had my messenger bag slapping against the back of my thigh with each step. My headphones were keeping my ears warm with the melodic rise and fall of Explosions in the Sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I reached the building I was looking for and followed the strange pathway into the basement. Whoever had decided to design this building obviously didn’t want anyone coming out alive again. There was no sense to it, some floors had staircases up and down on completely different ends and there were doors in odd places that didn’t seem to have any reason to them at all except to confuse me as to where I was going even further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Once I did actually arrive at the door I was looking for I wasn’t sure that I was going to be able to get back out again. But instead of dwelling on this disconcerting fact I opened it and found myself in a spacious waiting room, the concrete floor covered with a rug and a student sitting behind a desk that looked like it was probably from the nineteen sixties on the other side of the room. She looked up when I came in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Can I help you with something?” She mouthed the words and I pulled my headphones off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Sorry I missed that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“What can I help you with?” She sounded bored but nice enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I’m here to see a counselor about switching my major.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She pointed to one of the doors that was off the room, that had a little brass plaque on it where from here I could read. Susanne Marcus, English Department Undergraduate Advisor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“You can go ahead and knock, she just got in so she should have a few moments for you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I thanked her, knocked on the door and a pleasant mothering voice told me to come in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;The office was warm, with a light wood desk, a few chairs and a filing cabinet all stuffed into a rather small space. The woman behind the desk was pouring a little packet of sugar into a large coffee mug with a picture of a bluebird on it. She had short curly brown hair and kind eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“It's a little early for students isn’t it?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Morning class.” I smiled and shook her offered hand. “My name’s Dante Edwards. I …uh…want to switch my major.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Susan Marcus, you can just call me Susan. So excited! Welcome to the ‘in’ crowd.” She chuckled a little to herself, “You can tell we’re the cool kids because they put our department in the basement in one of the most dated buildings on campus.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She took a few forms from off her desk and asked me for my ID number, punching my information into her computer with fast fingers. It wasn’t long before I had a list of courses that I needed to take, a notice to take back to the history department, and wishes of good luck. The whole process was so much easier than I had thought it would be, for some reason I had envisioned it would be much more of a momentous occasion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Susan shook my hand again as she ushered me out of her office all smiles, pressed one of her business cards into my hand and filled a paper mug of the freshly brewed coffee for me to take to class with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“It’s too early to be studying without a little caffeine.

My father was going to kill me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 28,101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-3256084625469348747?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-fifteen.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-7204554752783452816</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2009 06:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-17T22:59:22.313-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>madison</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>kipp</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>laurence</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the magpie</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>michio</category><title>day fourteen.</title><description>&lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'courier new', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(120, 120, 120); font-style: italic; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

I hadn’t slept in three days and I was pretty sure I was about to fail at least two of my three classes. Every moment was a bleak reminder of how I was falling apart. Zooey looked at me with pity in her eyes, but she was getting frustrated with my lack of focus and with my inability to articulate what was wrong with me. She had stayed the night and I still hadn’t been able to sleep. That was my last hope, that somehow she really was some sort of magic defense against these nightmares. But it didn’t seem that anything could stop them now. Professor Laurent insisted that it was stress but the stress was coming from the nightmares so how does one stop a vicious cycle like that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;It was in this dejected depressed state that I exited the campus. I had to get away, I had to find somewhere to decompress and just run away from these issues. I couldn’t deal with all of it at once. Who could? And so I found myself heading, as I often did on the days when I needed to escape, to The Magpie. I got there in a shorter amount of time than usual, already feeling the burden lift a little as I stepped off the bus and walked a bit down the street to the little coffee shop. Death Cab for Cutie was swaying through my speakers and the cold sky had opened up to let a little bit of light through the clouds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I opened the door and found that neither Laurence nor Madison were leaning on the counter but just little Kipp, who looked a little to short to pull off Madison’s customary bored but sexy pose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Her face lit up when she saw me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Hey Dante!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Hi. Where is everyone?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;She kicked the front counter aimlessly with her foot and there was a systematic thumping noise. “They went out on their breaks to grab cigarettes but they’re late in getting back…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“That doesn’t surprise me. Well I’ll keep you company.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;She smiled. “You want something to drink?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I ordered a forty two and paid for it, passing her two for a tip because I knew if I put them in the tip jar that she’d have to share with the other two. She thanked me over and over again. We spent the next few minutes talking about the Movies on the HUB lawn activity that was being planned for next week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“I don’t know if I’m going to go.” She confessed, “I don’t know if I’ll have to work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“I’m going with Zooey I think, you should come with us if you don’t have to work for sure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Zooey?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“My girlfriend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Dante I didn’t know that you had a girlfriend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I shrugged, I had thus far kept my life at The Magpie and my life on campus pretty separate. I think I worried that if I were to combine the two that suddenly The Magpie would stop being the oasis of calm that it had become for me. Zooey often asked where I went to study when she had a test or we couldn’t see each other. But I was always vague. I know I shouldn’t have kept her out of the loop but, Zooey tends to be the center of attention wherever she goes because she’s so fun and so beautiful. I liked having this secret place, this secret group of friends to escape to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Yeah, she’s great. If you come to the movie you’ll get to meet her.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Kipp nodded but she had lost some of her sunny demeanor and it hit me in that moment that she might be disappointed because she thought that I was single. And if she was disappointed because she thought that I was single then that probably meant she was interested in me. I shook myself mentally. The thought was just too odd to keep in my head. I didn’t think that Kipp really had a romantic life, but I guess that’s just because she never talked about it in front of Madison and Laurence. I can’t really blame her, it’s not something that I would talk about in front of those two either. They would never let you hear the end of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;There was a moment or two of awkward silence before the bell of the door chimed and in waltzed Madison, Laurence and what had to be Laurence’s older brother Michio. They looked so alike that it was impossible to mistake him, though he had short spikey hair and was dressed far more normally than the neon v-necked, studded belt wearing Laurence. Michio was wearing a t-shirt and a jacket, his dark jeans and shoes looked expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;He waved to Kipp as they entered and pushed Madison a little to keep her moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“I found these two loitering outside the liquor store and they promised me that they hadn’t exceeded their break time. When did they leave Kipp?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Kipp looked quickly from on guilty face to the other Madison trying with all her might to will Kipp to keep her mouth shut. But I spoke up to save her the trouble of getting in deep with her boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Uh…I saw them leave sir, only a few minutes ago, maybe ten?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Michio turned to me and looked stern before breaking into a smile. “Sir? You call me sir?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I shrugged and he offered a hand. “Michio Komatsu. I own this place.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Dante Edwards, I drink coffee here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;He laughed, “I like you kid, glad to hear that my employees aren’t slacking off too much.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Oh Michi you know we would never take advantage of your valueable time –“ Madison began in a sickly sweet voice but Michio cut across her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Ha. Ha. Ha. Very funny Madison. Go clean the bathroom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Madison in turn looked at Kipp, “You heard what the boss man said, go clean the bathroom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Kipp rolled her eyes, “No way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;They squabbled about who had the job for a few minutes and an irate Michio tried to maintain order between his employees. Eventually Madison won in a game of Rock Paper Scissors and Kipp, grumbled off to clean the only bathroom in the place. Michio made himself a latte and sat down on the window seat, putting his drink on a nearby side table. Madison sat down at the center table with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Mark my words.” She whispered, “He’ll be out in five minutes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I raised my eyebrows at her, wondering what she meant by that. Laurence joined us with some rock magazine in his hand and a grumpy look on his face,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Michio’s a narcoleptic. He’ll be asleep any moment. For some reason that window seat really does it for him. The great thing is that he won’t wake up for like forever. And no amount of noise will get him up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Madison grinned mischievously, “We’ll turn the music back on as soon as he passes out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I looked over at Michio, who was engrossed in a book and didn’t seem to notice that his employees were talking about him. “Aren’t there medications that he can take for that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Laurence nodded, “Yeah he takes them, they work all the time except for when he’s on that damn window seat. You’d think that he’d pick another place to sit but who knows maybe everytime he comes in he just really wants to have a nap.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Sure enough a few minutes later there was snoring from behind me and Michio’s head was sunk low on to his chest. Laurence looked up at the noise and got up to turn the radio on, starting a conversation in Japanese with Kipp who had just finished cleaning the bathroom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Madison looked at me for a moment before speaking,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“What’s wrong with you kid?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I started, “What do you mean?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“You look just like fucking exhausted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Really?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;She looked at me incredulously. “Come on, its not like you haven’t noticed that you look like a zombie does right before the survivors in the movie shot gun its face off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Wow…thanks Madison.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;She shrugged, “I’m just saying. What’s wrong kid.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“I just, you know haven’t been sleeping much.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;She sighed, “Come on don’t bullshit a master bullshitter. You covered for Laur and I back there and I’m here if you want to talk about anything. I promise I won’t bite too hard.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I somehow allowed a smile to creep on to my face and though I wasn’t sure that I wanted to tell Madison of all people I could tell that she wasn’t going to let me get out of it. She was going to get the truth out of me if it killed her so it really wasn’t worth protesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Well what I said was true, I haven’t been sleeping…well at all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Michio gave a particularly violent snore at this moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Bet you wish that you were him.” Madison jerked her thumb at Michio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Actually…not really. I’m trying not to fall asleep, that’s the problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;“Why not sleep? It’s seriously my second favorite activity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;I grazed over this statement, not wanting to ask what her number one favorite activity was, with Madison it was sometimes better not to ask, something that I learned when I asked her one day who the red head that she hung out with was. “My fuck buddy at the moment, my brother’s best friend. But he’s got it bad for me so I might let him date me.” She had replied with a wink. So like I said, sometimes it was better not to ask Madison the questions that she set you up for. Instead I plunged on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 26,320&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-7204554752783452816?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-fourteen.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-8849246849557005653</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2009 03:17:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-17T19:21:38.326-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fitzgerald</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>nikki</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>race</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><title>day thirteen.</title><description>&lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style=" color: rgb(120, 120, 120); font-style: italic; font-family:'courier new', Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

The only light was filtering like darts through the cracks in the walls and its damp red quality made me think that the sun was setting outside. I found myself in a sitting position and stood, walking over to one of the walls and placing my hands upon them. They were freezing cold, metal, with the exterior chipping off in rusty handfuls. I moved over to one of the cracks of light and looked out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Outside it was indeed sunset, the street that I caught sight of was dirty, wet and rank, with falling decaying buildings lining it. There was a woman wrapped in a dirty grey blanket huddled against a similar metal wall opposite, the dark circles of her eyes peaking out from underneath her hood, but the rest of her face in shadow. Somewhere nearby out of my thin sliver of vision there was a child crying. I stepped back from my vision of what was most certainly the slums and tried to look around the expansive room that I was in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;All that I could see was that the floor was dirt and that in the corner, near where I had found myself sitting originally there were some mismatched armchairs, a deep couch and a couple of cabinets of what looked to be metal as well. I walked back over and sat on one of the armchairs, which on closer inspection had several burnmarks and suspicious stains on it. There was a threadbare rug underneath. I had been sitting there several minutes when there was a scraping, screaming grinding noise of metal on metal and a portion of the wall opposite me opened up, sliding like a warehouse door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;A figure was silhouetted there, but in the light that had suddenly filled the room I couldn’t see who he was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Then he flipped a switch and overhead a million industrial bulbs encased in steel wire flickered on. The hum of their electricity momentarily struck me in what had been until then almost complete silence. His frame was thrown into light, turning to slide the door behind him closed and pull a massive bar lock over the door. He sauntered over to the couch and threw himself down on it, hanging his legs over one of the tall arms, his body flat against the cushions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He himself was all torso, tall and thin but with muscles in his armed that threatened more strength than I would have guessed at first. His eyes had dark rings under them like Fitz’s but they weren’t the same purple bruise color that Fitz sported, instead they were more natural looking, as if he had been born with them. His blonde hair fell in curtains around his face, stopping just short of his shoulders in choppy ends that promised he cut his own hair. Where his wife-beater shirt exposed his chest you could see several lines tattooed. They hung like necklaces, starting around his collar and ending right above his pectoral muscles, long rings that were several different sizes and looked to have been done very unprofessionally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He closed his eyes and smiled in a way that split his face in half. It made him look if anything more predatorily than he had a moment before, as if his wide mouth would open in any minute and swallow you alive, swallow you whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He sat like that for several minutes before pulling a bag from his side, and opening it. He lay there on his back counting coins and singing soft songs in minor key to himself, his voice echoing oddly in the empty space. And then there was a banging on the door that he had come through and he started, opening his eyes wide for the first time since I had seen him&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;They were a bright watery blue, the edges tinged with pink and bloodshot but calculating. His eyes were of the type that made you think if you looked hard enough you could see his brain working behind them. His eyes narrowed again as he packed the coins back into the bag and shoved them into a safe that sat on one side of the couch, flicking the dial with long thin nimble fingers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He opened the door and Fitz fell through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Good evening angel.” The blond’s voice was low and restrained, he was trying to adopt a tone of indifference but the excitement in his voice was obvious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Fuck you Race.” Fitz pushed past him, his movements jerky and his eyes darting back and forth around the large room. He stopped as soon as he was in and Race started to shut the door before a woman’s voice called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Ringneck.” Race halted, looking outside and his predatory grin returning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;A girl slipped through the open door, light brown hair chopped short, her body small and sickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Nikki my love.” Race bowed low sweeping one long hand to his chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She didn’t seem to be fooled by this show of manners and looked at him with an expression of pure revulsion on her face, as if she wanted to, but couldn’t look away from him. This look, though he must have seen it, didn’t seem to faze Race who left the door open a crack and followed the other two into the room. Fitz had thrown himself down onto one of the armchairs but his body hadn’t relaxed into it, he sat as if his muscles did not know how to bend properly and his eyes kept shifting crazily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race almost completely ignored the girl, walking over to Fitz and bending over to look into the other’s fast-paced eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“How does it feel lovely?” His voice raised goose bumps on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Fitz focused with some difficulty on Race, his eyes still shuddering. And the two sat there a minute, no words between them before Fitz shot a hand out and tried to grab at Race’s throat. Race moved so fast that I wouldn’t have thought it possible, his slinking slow movements up until now betraying no lightening fast reflexes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race laughed, but there was no joy in the sound. He in turn reached a hand out and jerked Fitz’s head back violently by the hair. Fitz didn’t betray on his face or in a noise how painful it must have been and Race continued to chuckle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“You little shit. Beautiful mess. Didn’t you come here for help? Let’s not bite the hand that feeds us mutt.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Fitz spit at him and Race avoided it. I thought this would make him more angry but he just smiled and let Fitz go, turning to Nikki, who had draped herself on one of the armchairs and seemed to be staring at the exchange but only half seeing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“And Nikki my love, we’re better behaved aren’t we. What can I do for you tonight?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Nikki looked up at him, pain written in the lines on what have should been a young face and answered in a small voice, “Escape Ringneck…help me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race looked incredibly pleased at this, running a finger along her jaw possessively, his eyes straying down her shirt, his hand gripped for a minute around her throat and then he let go and moved his gaze back up to her eyes. “You’ll be paying…how exactly?” She looked at her fingers and took a minute to respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“The usual way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race thought for a minute, “You’re going to have to bring me real gold at some point love. Your body is enough for me now but I get bored easily. This is the last time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;She looked at him, shock and pain in her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“I need- but I need…Race.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He turned away from her and laughed, “A slut only has so many uses Nikki.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;He went to the safe and flicked it open again and pulled out several items including a bag of the same powder Fitz had before. He kneeled down in front of Nikki and she slid to the floor. Race arranged a lighter underneath a spoon, heating a small amount of the substance from the bag before drawing it up into a needle. He grinned at Nikki, tying off her arm and flicking the needle to disperse the air before injecting it. She sighed almost immediately in a sound that was close to an orgasm. She closed her eyes and leaned forward, kissing Race on the mouth, a gesture that he did not return. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Instead he pushed her head back where it rested on the seat of the armchair she was leaning against. He chuckled and moved back to Fitz, who had watched the drug injection with the kind of eager hungry look of a child in front of a case of sweets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Is it your turn Fitzgerald Curtis Aclin. My favorite, my pet, my beautiful.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Fitz looked up at him with desperate hungry eyes, an internal struggle between hatred and want raging like wildfire there. He put a hand in the pocket of his tight pants and pulled out six gold coins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“Is it enough?” His voice cracked on the last word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race took the coins in his delicate hands and turned them over, counting them slowly and taking his time, probably to make Fitz squirm further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“No.” Race stood and put the coins on the couch before returning. “But you are my favorite. I might have to do a special deal for you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Fitz’s anger returned in full force, “I’m NOT going to fuck you Race.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Race laughed. “As if I would want a dirty little bluecoat bastard like you.” He lifted Fitz’s chin, “You’ll be back to me, and next time you’re paying double. You understand me. I’m not going to give you a lift without 20 gold pieces.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Fitz nodded, his eyes on the needle in Race’s hands, the same needle that he had just used on Nikki. He cooked the drug again and I looked away when he injected it into Fitz’s arm. Fitz’s hips bucked and he groaned, falling forward into Race’s lap and panting for a minute. Race stroked his hair, looking pleased with himself and murmuring soft words, looking at Fitz in an almost mothering way. He smiled that splitting grin again, and got up as the door of the warehouse was banged on again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;“All my pretty little angels coming for a taste of the fall.” He hummed as he stroked Fitz’s hair one last time, rose on graceful limbs and slid back the door of the warehouse again. Then all went dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Calibri"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new', serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 24,676&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-8849246849557005653?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-thirteen.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-2415101158213687253</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2009 06:23:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-16T22:25:20.607-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><title>day twelve.</title><description>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;DAY TWELVE IS RESTRICTED PM IF YOU WANT TO READ IT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 22,969&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-2415101158213687253?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-twelve.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-9188719628593622220</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2009 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-16T22:27:49.083-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><title>day eleven.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=" ;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:courier new;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=" font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;"&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We poured out of the classroom shaking out tired hands and going over difficult questions. Zooey stretched her arms over her head and smiled, closing her eyes in the rare winter sunshine that was filtering through the cherry trees’ naked limbs. Finally, finals were over. I caught up with her and put my arms over her shoulders, even in the chill winter wind, she smelled like summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She put her head back and rested it against my shoulder. “Hey ‘Te.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I leaned down and kissed her softly on the cheek. “Hey Girasole. How did the test go?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She turned around looking confused, “What does that mean babe?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Sunflower. I don’t know, its what you smell like to me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She blushed and turned away. “You’re adorable ‘Te. Lets go get ready for the concert.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She grabbed my hand and led me back to my dorm. Zooey and I had decided that we would go see Mae in Seattle that evening before we both had to leave to go home for Christmas break. We’d been dating almost three months and I don’t think I’ve ever had a better reason to smile. She spent most of her time outside of class at my dorm room hanging out with me and Killian, who loved her. They spent a lot of time talking about art while I did my reading. I’ve never been so happy, whenever she was around during the day, cuddling up on my bed while we watched television or just talked, my pillow would smell like her that night and I would sleep without dreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She made me laugh and needed my attention all the time. A text from her would wake me up in the morning for class and she’d be the kiss I stole as I walked her back to her dorm at the end of the night. I was a man in love, willing to do everything for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She spent so much time at my dorm that most of her books were there, slid underneath my bed and several of her sweatshirts were hung in my wardrobe.  And she was so beautiful and so smart and so perfect for me and I was so lucky to have her around me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I can’t wait for the show tonight ‘Te! I’m so excited.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Me too Zo. They’re amazing live I cannot wait for you to see them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She grinned and clung on to my arm, “Their lead singer has such an amazing voice! Musicians are so attractive.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey!” I pretended to be offended and she looked up at me&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh don’t be silly ‘Te I couldn’t find a better guy than you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“But I can play an instrument.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You can?” Her blue eyes widened and she punched me playfully in the arm, “Why haven’t you told me? Awww ‘Te that’s adorable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I play guitar…well a little. I’m not very good at it really.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“That’s so adorable. You should play me something sometime.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“It's a promise.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We got back to the dorms, parted ways and went to get ready for the show. When I came back an hour later to pick her up she came down from the dorms and my jaw dropped. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She was wearing a white t-shirt that hugged her small frame with the Hello Kitty on it wearing glasses. Underneath the t-shirt read “I &lt;3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She looked like a goddess. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You…w-wow you look…wow.” She smiled a kittenish smile at me and sauntered up to me putting her arms around my neck and kissing me. When she pulled away she winked and stepped back to look me up and down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Talk about wow ‘Te. You’re looking pretty handsome yourself. You clean up well don’t you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked down at my black button up shirt that the sleeves were rolled up on and jeans. It didn’t seem like anything impressive to me, but Blaire had put some product in my hair so maybe that made all the difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We walked hand in hand to the bus stop and hopped a bus to dinner at a nice Italian place before going to the show. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;When we got to the venue there was a short line outside but it was only a few minutes until we were in, and being there early meant that we were in the front right next to the stage. The time passed quickly and the exciting thing about the set was that Mae was going to play the whole time-slot. The music started and Zooey leaned up against me, cheering. Her excitement flowed out of her, she was singing along and swaying in my arms and I was so excited to see them too, but more excited to be there with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The whole night was electric, the melodies rising and falling the whole room seeming to open up and empty until it was just Me, Zooey and Dave Elkins. The guitars filled the room and the colors and shapes of the music wrapped us in a solitary dance. Nothing was better than this, than the music and the pulse of the night and the warmth of this beautiful girl in my arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And then they played our song. I’m just one of those guys that falls head over heals for girls. I’m just one of those romantic sickly sweet passionate guys. I want to be the guy that reminds girls that chivalry isn’t dead, that values them for who they really are on the inside and not for how they look on the outside. I want to be the kind of guy that every girl could bring home to their mother. And I think at the end of the day, that’s what girls want too. So yes, I’m the kind of guy who has a song that reminds him of his girlfriend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I heard and felt Zooey’s breath catch when the first chords of the song were played, she squeezed my hand excitedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;Is that your song I hear playing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;'Cause I'm feeling it too Does it take all direction,&lt;br /&gt;all control over you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She turned and faced me, her eyes reflecting the orange and red glow of the lights, smoldering looking up into mine. Her mouth forming the words while mine mimicked them back at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;When you sing do you slip away?&lt;br /&gt; Back to that place in your mind?&lt;br /&gt; Let our love be the one thing you wont leave behind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;There was nothing else in the world but those eyes, nothing but the sweet smell of her skin, nothing but the endless sky and the music and this moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;Rewind and play &lt;br /&gt;Time to go backwards again &lt;br /&gt;I'm moved by the way&lt;br /&gt; All the notes in time make the melody&lt;br /&gt; Hold me and sway into the moment we share&lt;br /&gt; Where we can stay so attached to the memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I threaded my hand through her soft hair and smiled down at her, my chest was so full I felt like it was about to burst. And as I looked into those firey eyes of hers I knew more certainly than I had known anything else that I was in love and there was nothing that could stop me from being with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I love you.” I whispered it against her neck, breathing her in and exhaling the words like a million tiny prayers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;How I long just to hold you &lt;br /&gt;And see you let go as we dance&lt;br /&gt; I know you're reminiscing through our romance&lt;br /&gt; Can you hear the piano? &lt;br /&gt;And the pulse of the drums?&lt;br /&gt;Does the tune and the groove bring you back to our love? &lt;br /&gt;Oh, come and find it Honey...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And she put a hand to her mouth, her eyes lighting up even brighter if it was possible. She threw her arms back around my neck and spoke my words back to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I love you Dante Edwards.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;Rewind and play&lt;br /&gt; Time to go backwards again &lt;br /&gt;I'm moved by the way &lt;br /&gt;All the notes in time make the melody&lt;br /&gt; Night into day Can we move onward from here? &lt;br /&gt;Where we can stay on and on attached to the memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I bent my down and captured her lips in a kiss that was endless. It could have been months, years, lifetimes between where we started and ended. The world could have been falling down around me and still I wouldn’t have been able to pull myself away from her. She ran her fingers through my hair and deepened the kiss as the melody rose to a crescendo, the whole room bursting with sound and light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;"&gt;Oh I know you can feel it &lt;br /&gt;Let it take you there  &lt;br /&gt;Rewind and play&lt;br /&gt; Time to go backwards again&lt;br /&gt; I'm moved by the way&lt;br /&gt; All the notes in time make a sweet melody&lt;br /&gt; Night into day&lt;br /&gt; We have been captured again &lt;br /&gt;A new time and place to make a million new memories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And then the song and the kiss were over and the whole world came flooding back. And there were people clapping and whooping and even the band members were looking at us with satisfied smiles. And Zooey was giddy and I was blushing and before I knew it she had pulled me outside and was kissing me outside the venue and we were laughing at nothing and she was just so radiant under the streetlights and the dark Seattle night sky that all the words I have could never explain it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We waited outside on the side of the building, Zooey insisting that we’d be able to catch the band before they got back in the trailer that was parked there. And we did meet them, her giggling excitedly while they signed the t-shirt and CD that we had bought. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You guys are amazing.” She gushed, “Thank you for making such amazing music.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And they looked pleased. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You two kids have fun!” They called as we headed back to the bus stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Zooey and I didn’t speak on the way back, her head was curled up against my shoulder but I could see her blushing smile in the reflective windows across from us. There was no need for words. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We walked back through campus which was desperately quiet in the embrace of the winter night. She shivered and I threw an arm around her shoulders, unable to feel the cold myself. I thought that the warmth that had filled me at her words and her kiss might never leave me. I might never feel the cold again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;When we got to her dorm she sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I don’t want to go home and leave you for a whole three weeks ‘Te.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I hadn’t thought of that, and the happy balloon inside of me deflated a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I don’t want you to go either Zo. My beautiful Girasole.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I pushed a stray piece of hair behind her ear and kissed her softly. She pulled back after a minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Come home with me. Come to California for the winter. It’s not like you want to stay here in this weather anyway.” Her voice was wild with excitement at the prospect. “My parents already told me that they want to meet you. And I’ll show you all around LA.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked at her sadly, “Come on Zo, you know I can’t do that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Her face fell, “Why not? What have you got to loose?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What about my Dad? And Clio?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well you go home on weekends all the time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Zooey the money…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She pleaded with me, “I’ll pay for half your ticket. And you still have the money from your last couple paychecks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I had been saving money from my job at the bookstore but it was to buy her something beautiful, a piece of jewelry that I knew she would like that was the Hello Kitty set with diamonds. But the look in her eyes was heartbreaking, she wanted me to come to California more than anything. And how was I supposed to say no?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She saw the decision in my eyes before I was even able to say the words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh my god Dante. I’m so excited!” She hugged me and dragged me by the hand towards her dorm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Zooey I gotta go book the flight.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“No Dante. We can do it on my computer. Come upstairs with me.” She looked up at me through heavily lidded eyes and smirked. It was a look that I had never seen on her face before and I almost didn’t know how to react.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ashley already went home. Her finals were done on Wednesday. So…” She paused looking steadily up into my eyes, “You can…you know…come up if you want. For the night..” She flushed scarlet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I had no idea what she was talking about until I saw her blush and then I realized what she meant. I turned bright red and my heart raced but I let her pull me into the elevator and into her room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The next day after a strained conversation with my father, a hasty packing and $200 spent on a ticket I found myself in the airport with my girlfriend waiting for a flight to L.A.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;"&gt;20,503&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-9188719628593622220?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-11.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-4246538237320987110</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 20:06:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-12T12:11:42.894-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>madison</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>kipp</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>laurence</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the magpie</category><title>day ten.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Homecoming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;It was a long day. It was one of those long days that drag and drag and you have no idea how they can possibly be as long as they are but then you look at the clock again and you realize that you’re still in lecture and that professor is still droning on about something unrelated to the course matter. I hadn’t slept in two days. They say that if you don’t sleep at all that after three days you can go crazy, but I’m not sure I believe that. I filed out of class with the rest of the students when the professor dismissed us but I just didn’t feel like going home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Home meant studying, eating and going to sleep, none of which sounded appealing. So I drifted off onto the Ave and before I knew it caught the number 42 bus. When I got off I realized that I was right next to the coffee shop from the day that I was stuck in the storm. Not having anything else to do, I opened the door. I laughed in my head that maybe my feet had carried me back here because it was destiny, then dismissed the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I’m not sure that I described to you The Magpie before. The Magpie is dimly lit, the few lights on in the place and the little light that filtered through the window and the glass on the door battled to tint the place, the former a orange red and the later a grey slate like the Seattle sky. Near the window there is a built in bench, and there are maybe four or five tables scattered in the shop, the largest of which is round and can seat probably like seven people. It is in the center of the room. In the corner opposite the window, right next to the end of the counter are two large leather armchairs separated by a bookcase, which contains few books, most of which have seen better days. The counter is wood paneled, the chalkboard menu hanging above it usually has little drawings around the edges. On the wall on the left when you come in is a million pieces of paper pinned up by employees and customers, pieces of art and quotes, song lyrics and short stories, poetry and paintings. The wall is so full of them that you can barely see the red paint that is underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Its cozy because of the darkness, because of the red paint and the homey touches. The chairs are comfortable, the room is always warm and there is always music blasting from the record player that sits on the counter, boxes of vinyl on the floor beside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;That day, when I was in a sleep-deprived daze was the second time that I had been in the little coffee shop and I had butterflies when I opened the door. Just as before, the brass of the door handle, which should have been cold considering the temperature was war warmer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;The bell tinkled when I opened it and Laurence, who I remembered from my last visit walked out of the back room looking hassled. He gave me an up and down look, then spoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Let me know when you decide what you want.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I nodded and looked at the menu for a moment. Then there was a disturbance in the back. I could hear two girls arguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Madison don’t touch my ass you dirty pervert!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison laughed, “Oh Kipp my love don’t flatter yourself, I was just reaching for that bottle of vanilla there and your wonderful ass happened to be in the way. But you can’t deny you liked it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You’re ridiculous. Just ridiculous.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Go take out the trash cans.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison appeared around the corner smirking, looking pleased with herself. Behind her trailed a shorter girl with long blonde hair that was dark brown underneath. She was pouting, her large eyes giving Madison’s back quite a death glare. She was wearing a black apron that had The Magpie logo on it over a t-shirt and jeans. When she came out into the front she began gathering up the trash bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison’s eyes lit up when she saw me. She winked, shoved Laurence out of the way and leaned over on the counter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence gave her a look that could kill and walked into the back room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey pintsize.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I grinned at her, her voice, the smell of the shop and the warmth had wiped away a lot of my tiredness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She  cocked her head a little to the side then leaned it on a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“We don’t get many customers but we get even less return customers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I laughed as Laurence yelled from the back, “That’s probably because you scare them all off you crazy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison laughed, “Laurence loves me, he really does. I swear. He’s only mean because he wants me for my body.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I laughed again, from the little that I had seen of Laurence he wasn’t likely to be interested in women at all. But I wasn’t one hundred percent sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She paused and then said, “Nahhhh probably not actually, Laurence is about as gay as it gets.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I sorta guessed that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Well you’re a sharp one then pintsize.” She stuck out a hand, “I’m Madison Daily.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I shook her hand, which was soft, large and smelled faintly of the cigarettes that she smoked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Dante Edwards.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You’re Italian?” She asked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Yeah,” I answered “on my mom’s side. She was born and lived in Italy until she was thirteen. Then her family moved over here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison smiled, “I’m Italian too, on my Dad’s side. But he’s only half. The other half is Spanish and then my mom is Greek.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Cool.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You want something to drink?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Yeah will you make me the same thing that you did last time? It was amazingly good.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I can’t even remember what I made you. Was it a 42?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I nodded and she started making it, the steam of the milk hissing over the guitars that were issuing out of the record player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I raised my voice to speak over the noise, “How much Madison?” I pulled out my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Nah nah keep your cash kid. We’re cool.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;The blonde girl reappeared from outside, sans trash bags. She smiled as she walked past me and washed her hands in the sink behind the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hi”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“My name’s Kipp. I just started here, so we haven’t met yet have we?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“No, its uh nice to meet you Kipp, I’m Dante.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison looked over at Kipp, her eyes resting on Kipp’s hips and pushed a mug towards me. “One forty two. On the house.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Kipp rolled her eyes at Madison, who had slapped her butt on the way to change the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“So do you go to UW?” Kipp continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Yeah I’m a first year, a History major.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Cool! I’m a second year Japanese Language major.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison cut in, “Gah you guys are such kids. I remember when I was in school. Awful.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You graduated?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Kipp laughed, “Don’t let her fool you into thinking that she’s all mature and stuff. I mean she did only graduate last quarter.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I laughed, “What did you major in?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Music and musical theory.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I nodded, took my drink and sat down at the largest of the tables. Laurence came out from the back and made himself a drink, taking off his own apron and sat down at the other side of the table, reading a book that was written in some sort of Asian launguage. I sipped my forty two for a few minutes before Kipp too sat down at the table and Madison sat on the counter, flipping through an issue of NME.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I broke the silence a little awkwardly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Its kind of slow to have more than one of you guys working at once isn’t it?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence waved a hand dismissively not lifting his eyes from his book, “My older brother MIchio owns this place and we never get any business, it never makes any money. He doesn’t care. For some reason he keeps paying the three of us. It's a good thing that the rent is cheap.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison laughed, “Its not like Michio’s gonna run out of cash anytime soon. You guys are fucking loaded with a capital L. Probably took a whole boat to get your cash from Japan.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You’re from Japan?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence nodded. “Yeah, came over here right before university.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“That’s really cool. I spent three months in Italy with my mom and my older brother when I was like nine but that’s the only time that I’ve ever been out of the country.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence shrugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison suddenly jumped from the counter and grinned in a seductive way at the door. I thought this odd and turned around to see the door open and a man walk through. He was tall and muscular with shockingly red hair and tattoos covering what was visible of his arms underneath his rolled op sleeves. He nodded at Laurence and winked at Kipp before resting his eyes on Madison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey baby.” His voice was low and sexual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Madison grinned, standing on one hip, her hands flat against the counter behind her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Laurence I’m gonna take a cigarette break.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence and Kipp exchanged looks and Kipp rolled her eyes in an obvious way. Laurence’s eyes on the other hand slid over the body of the newcomer shamelessly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;The redhead threaded his arm around Madison’s waist as she approached him, looking at her with a smirk that matched hers. As they headed back out the door together he dropped his hand from her lower back to her butt and she leaned into the movement. The door shut and all three of us looked at each other at the same time, realizing that we had all been staring. Kipp started to laugh and then turned to Laurence, trying to hold in her giggles,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You were SO checking him out Laur!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence rolled his eyes, “I was NOT. He’s Madison’s boyfriend fuck buddy thing…and whatever he’s not even my type.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“You are such a liar!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Laurence pushed her, “Baka na.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She laughed, “Anata wa hontou ni gei.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I looked lost and she explained. “I told him he was super gay.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;He shook his head, “She’s retarted. I was not checking him out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I laughed, “You kinda were actually.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;From that afternoon, where we spent the time laughing, arguing and making fun of each other, listening to music and talking about school I felt like I had found a new home. Never had I fallen in with a group of people so easily. And I didn’t even know then that this was just a small piece of The Magpie family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 18,279&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-4246538237320987110?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-ten.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-8098367971059956032</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 05:01:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-11T22:55:46.507-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fitzgerald</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the barron</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>darius</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the fountain</category><title>day nine.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

Under one of the trees Darius was walking, this time probably around thirteen. He had a large book under his arm and a thoughtful expression. He reached the outer ring of the fountain and sat down, posture perfect and straight, opened the book in his lap and began to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked around the grounds, wondering if there was something that I was missing. Surely the whole dream wasn’t going to just be me watching a young Darius read right? And that’s when I spotted a brown haired kid about the same age. He was walking, no more like strutting towards Darius, who hadn’t noticed that he was there. His hair was long like Darius’ but straight and he was wearing a similar blue jacket. I almost didn’t recognize him without dark purple circles under his eyes and swear words issuing from his mouth, but then I caught sight of the gold eye under his bangs. This was Fitz, a young, seemingly happy Fitz. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He walked down the path whistling, smirking mischievously and stopped in front of Darius. Darius didn’t raise his eyes from his book, choosing instead to raise his eyebrows and say in a calm tone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Good afternoon Fitzgerald.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz gave a barking laugh and ruffled Darius’s perfectly manicured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Don’t call me Fitzgerald kid.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius finally looked up from his book, setting it down beside him and smiling. He tried and failed to flatten his now messy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What are you doing here Fitz?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Nothing really. Bored.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Lady Aclin…?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Passed out again. So I snuck out. We should take the horses and go check out the 2nd ring or the field.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius’ sky eyes widened at this proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You mean go outside the gate?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz brushed grass of the sleeve of his jacket, attempting to look disinterested but the glint of excited adventure in his eyes gave him away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh sure, you know, look at the rest of the city, I go all the time when my mom’s passed out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What about your father?” Darius looked nervously around the grounds to make sure that they weren’t being overheard as he said this. “Won’t he find out and be mad?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz laughed again, though he looked a little sad as he did so, “Don’t be a dumbass Dar. He hasn’t been back from the Eastern Provence in almost a year. He’s not going to come home and start telling me what to do now. The bastard.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius looked shocked at this kind of language. It was clear that he though Fitz was just as cool and devil may care as Fitz’s own ego did. He looked over at his book, then back at the manor, then down at his hands before looking back up into the eager, wild eyes of his friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“The Barron said that I’m not supposed to be hanging out with you Fitz.” Fitz’s grins slid from his face a bit and he struggled to keep it there, “He said that the sixth is too far down for me to be associating with. That your family’s no good.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz’s eyes turned colder, more angry and started to look more familiar to me. His voice was quieter and more even when he spoke. “What do you think Lorrimer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius looked away before responding, “I think…I think you’re fun. I don’t really have any other friends.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz’s grin was back at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well then, fuck the Barron.” He laughed and pushed Darius, who was still not looking at him, backwards into the fountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius emerged a second later, brilliant blonde hair plastered to his face and wide eyed disbelief on his face. “You…you pushed me!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz stuck out his tongue. “Whatcha gonna do about it PRINCE Lorrimer.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius reached up with lightening fast reflexes and tugged a surprised Fitz into the fountain as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh my god Lorrimer I’m going to KILL you!” Fitz yelled as he surfaced and waded after Darius who was already scrambling to get out of the water, pulling him back and wrestling with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;It was sometime later when both boys had had their revenges several times amidst Fitz’s swearing and Darius’ laughter that they walked arm in arm back to the manor, sneaking up the stairs and past the servants so that no one would see them in their wet and ruined clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius’ room was not a room but more like a suite. He had his own study and sitting room as well as a large bathroom and bedroom. The walls were covered in rich fabrics in dark blue and gold, the floors covered in thick carpets. Darius’s bed was massive, carved out of a dark wood, with curtains hanging from the posts. He had a long balcony attached to his study which looked out to the grounds and let some light into the room which otherwise had all the walls covered with bookshelves lined with dusty tomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The boys passed through the study, stripping and throwing on new dry clothes that Darius pulled from a wardrobe carved with a crane. He pulled on a pair of tan riding pants and boots, tied his hair back in a fresh blue silk ribbon and pulled on a blue-cuffed button up shirt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He passed Fitz a similar pair of pants and Fitz dumped the water in his boots out before pulling them back on. He donned one of Darius’ blue coats over a bare chest and laughing, the two of them headed back downstairs. When they passed the bottom of the staircase one of the servants spotted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Young master Lorrimer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz laughed and broke into a run, pulling Darius along behind him. When they got to the stables they were met by an old gypsy horse servant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius’ smile was instantly replaced by a conditioned imperial look. This was difficult to pull off considering that Darius was looking up at the older man, but the effect was actually quite good. Darius waved a graceful hand towards the saddles hung near the stable entrance and when he spoke it was with an authority that didn’t quite fit his age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ashva saddle Alexander and Cyrus. Mr Aclin and I want to go riding straight away.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The old man’s eyebrows knit together, “Have you spoken to the Barron Master Lorrimer?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius seemed to expect this reply and looked calmly back at the old servant, “I do not need my father’s permission to take my own horse out Ashva.” He paused, “Remember your place.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The old man looked more worried still but did as he was told, bringing the two magnificent black horses out and holding the reins as they mounted them, Darius on Cyrus and Fitz on Alexander. The boys rode out of the gate talking and laughing, it was when they hit the main road that they raced to the gate, causing something of a disturbance as people on the street hurried to get out of their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;They rode out of the 2nd ring and over the Fornax bridge before racing out of the city. Behind the city was a large cleared areas, where the trees had been burned during the building of the city and grass had grown in their place. They the wind whipped through their hair as they reached the top of the hill behind the city and Fitz whooped and yelled racing faster and faster, separating himself from Darius, his jacket whipping behind him and his tan bare chest leaned forward over the powerful neck of the black horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius followed, a smile on his face but nervousness in his eyes. When Fitz got to the top he reined Alexander in and slid from his back with an ungraceful flop, letting the horse rest and graze nearby. He sat down on the grass, his chest heaving up and down. He pulled his long chestnut hair back and tied it back much in the same way that Darius wore his, except for the bangs that covered his golden eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius caught up and dismounted his horse as well, though far more gracefully and sat down beside Fitz, leaning back on his hands and letting his hair fall back behind his back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The sun had started sinking towards the its nightly grave but the air was still warm and humid, licking at their skin. Darius unbuttoned the front of his shirt before laying down in the grass with his hands behind his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz looked over at him. “Is the Barron going to be mad?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The relaxed air of the moment seemed to be sucked out of them both at the question. It was if Fitz has touched, without thinking, a deeply bleeding wound. Darius took a couple of deep breaths before speaking and when he did his voice was carefully monotone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“He isn’t happy often.” He paused to pick his words, “He, he just has high expectations for me. I don’t begrudge him that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz snorted but didn’t say anything. He looked at Darius’ chest when Darius looked away from him and his eyes rested on a large purple bruise that stretched across Darius’ hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What about you?” Darius leaned over on one elbow. “When is your father coming back?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Never.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius’ eyes widened. “What do you mean? Did something happen?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz shook his head, “No.” He looked out over the hill at the dying light that was just clinging like kisses to the tops of the buildings. “He doesn’t want to come back. He’s fucking some dark skinned Eastern whore. Had a new house built. I heard my mother crying the other day. He sent her a letter but won’t send money anymore.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius looked lost, as if he didn’t know how to respond to the situation. But Fitz, who had taken a moment to get started, now seemingly couldn’t stop speaking, which spared Darius the awkward moment that he might have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I don’t care if he doesn’t come back. He never made a difference anyway. I hate her more though.” He picked at the grass moodily, “She keeps bringing men over to the house. I don't have to, but I go listen at her door. She’s always drunk and they always leave after an hour or two.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He sighed, opened his mouth as if he was going to say something else but then closed it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Darius’ confusion remained. It wasn’t pity or even understanding written on his face, but the mask of emotion that I was used to seeing on the older Darius. He had shut down the same moment that Fitz began to open up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The boys sat in silence for a while, Fitz laying down in the grass as well and watching the light fade from the sky. Finally, not looking at Fitz, Darius broke the silence,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You can stay at the manor tonight.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz didn't answer but when they both caught the horses and rode back to the manor to return them to the stables, Fitz didn’t turn and head towards the driveway of the manor, but followed a creeping Darius back up the grand staircase of the manor and accepted the blankets and pillows that Darius gave him. He curled up on the sofa in Darius’ study and was asleep in minutes. Darius went to the washroom and cleaned up before heading through the study to his bedroom, closing the study door softly behind him with a whisper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Goodnight.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as Darius closed his eyes, my own vision faded into darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 16,478&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-8098367971059956032?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-nine.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-7323948025452304694</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2009 03:24:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-11T13:47:22.256-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fornaxirus</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fitzgerald</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>professor laurent</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><title>day eight.</title><description>&lt;p  class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-family: courier new;font-size:85%;" &gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

The more you stress about these things the more likely they are to continue. You just seem to have an active imagination. But you can’t let that get in the way of your studies.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know. I know I should try and let it go.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Laurent nodded and opened his hands as if to say ‘Glad we have this solved.’ I didn’t feel quite as sure. He stood from the edge of the desk and walked over to the door. I followed him, understanding that our meeting was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he opened it he turned to me. “Dante I really believe that you can do amazing things if you devout yourself. Don’t let anything get in the way of that.” He paused, then shook his head a little as if clearing water from his ears, “Look Dante. I know college can get a little, well, overwhelming. So if you ever need any help, or just someone to talk to...” He took out an expensive leather wallet and pulled out a business card. “call me okay?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thanked him as he wrote a number on the back of the card. “This is my home number. If you can’t get me at the office here then call me. I don’t usually get involved in students’ lives but…well like I said, call me if you need to.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked down at the careful script written on the card and then back at the impressive Professor Laurent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I really appreciate it sir.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Laurent waved a hand casually and opened the door. “Don’t thank me, work harder.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes sir.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then we said our goodbyes and I was out of his office and back in the halls of the English building, still running a finger over the raised lettering on his business card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Benjamin T.  Laurent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Professor of English, University of Washington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;BTLaurent@washington.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;206.435.6601&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t leave feeling like the problem of my nightmares was solved, or even that my professor really understood the impact that they were having on my life. But I did leave feeling like there was something that I had to fight for. Professor Laurent wasn’t the kind of man that gave out compliments easily, and the fact that he though I had a great amount of talent reminded me that I had to stay present, because I had things to work towards. I had a future ahead of me that I didn’t want to give up or to waste. And in that way, I was lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the door and the grey light of the Seattle afternoon drifted in as I drifted out of the building. I put the card in my back pocket and adjusted my messenger bag on my shoulder before heading to the library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Addict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was walking along the road in Fornax that Darius lived along. The stones were slick and newly rained on, the smell of damp earth overwhelming the usual smells of perfumed shops and mouth-watering eateries. Servants with blue sashes were running one way and another, and men in blue jackets drinking outside taverns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed past Darius’ house and further away from the center of Fronax in a direction I had never taken before. The shops ended and large empty spaces replaced them, punctuated by long driveways that led to manors much like Darius’, though most were smaller or more careworn looking. I passed a few of these driveways before one caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The gates were not of the same white stone that was used in Darius’ house or in the streets, it was darker, grey and black with white stones mixed in, but each stone was cut so that they shone. On the side of the iron gates was a brass plaque with a coat of arms on it. The coat of arms had a torch in one quadrant, a pine tree trees in another, two swords in the third and in the last three ornate keys. The whole thing was topped with a star and guarded by a wolf on one side and a griffin on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underneath the coat of arms were three words in what I assumed were latin, “Exitus Acta Probat” and a large roman numeral six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up towards the house, which was set back a bit from the gates and which I could see was made of the same dark stones as the gate. I put a hand on the cold metal gates and pushed, and I was surprised to feel the grinding of the hinges give way under my pressure. The gates weren’t locked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yard between the gates and the house was unkempt, the grass longer than any of the other houses that I had passed and overwhelmed with patches of dandelions and clover. It was creeping in between the stones and I had to pick carefully over the slick path in order to avoid slipping and falling. The closer I got to the house the more I realized that it wasn’t like Darius’ manor. There were broken windows on the second floor and the name that was hung over the door was tarnished and falling down. I could barely read it, “Aclin”. The door too, once impressive, was barely hanging on its hinges, pieces of the wolves’ heads had teeth and ears which were chipped. There were several large scars across the wood’s surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the entrance did not look promising I picked through the doors and went on into the house. I’m not sure what made me do it, except that I didn’t entirely control the compulsions that gripped me during the dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the house was much like the outside, a picture of former grandeur that had fallen apart due to disuse or lack of care. It had certainly never been as richly decorated as the Lorrimer manor, but the faded curtains and trampled carpets did whisper of lavish parties and witty conversations past. It was as if the very walls leaned inwards, tired of supporting the heavy roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that the place was empty, since there was almost no sign that it had been lived in recently but I walked up the damp wooden stairs and hoped that the creaking they made was not a sign they were about to collapse. I followed a long hallway to the end and noticed a large open double doors on the left. These too were carved, this time with a two-headed wolf, one looking to the left and the other looking to the right. The door stood cracked open and the air coming out of this room was warmer and smelled like smoke and cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pushed the door open to see a huge wooden bed frame pushed against the wall. The mattress was on the floor surrounded by small empty bags. There were blankets pushed to the side of it, and empty plates stacked in piles. There was a hole in one of the walls, looking about the size of a fist and on another wall the red wallpaper was ripped from the wall hanging in tatters around the baseboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked my way through the rubble and out to a set of double French doors that led out on to a wide balcony. That’s when I saw him.&lt;br /&gt;He was leaned against the stone railing, a cigarette hanging from his mouth, his shirt missing and his jeans ripped and dirty. His brown hair was short, clipped close to his head on one side and longer, hanging over his eye on the other side. He was thin, the bones in his shoulder showing under sinewy muscles, his collar bones sunk deep into his chest. His hands were dirty, with chipped nails, scratches and burns covering his hands and arms. The way he stood screamed tension like he was holding something back with immense effort. His muscles were coiled tight, and his posture uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He turned and looked towards the door I had just stepped through and my breath caught in my throat. His eyes were so intense that it’s difficult to explain. They reminded me of funeral pyres and charred flesh, of oppressively hot nights and the ravaging strength of wildfires. One was the dark brown of the wood wolves that adorned his house and the other, the one that peaked out of the shadow of his long bangs, was brilliantly gold, and feral. They were both sunk deep in his face, with dark purple rings around them as if he hadn’t slept in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cigarette smoke curled up away from his face in lazy spirals and his eyes darted around his room before he threw the cigarette away off the balcony and turned back to the room. He started searching through the bags on the ground until he found one that had a small amount of off white powder in it. A smile broke his face in two then, though it reached neither of his shadowed eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He brought a finger to his mouth and sucked it for a moment before putting it into the bag. The powder stuck there and he put the finger back in his mouth, rubbing the powder underneath his tongue and closing his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sat down against the wall slowly and opened his eyes, staring at the ceiling. When he spoke, his voice was the opposite of what I had expected. I expected something rough and growling, something that would fit the wildness in his eyes. But he was soft spoken, with a voice that reminded me of socks over polished mahogany, smooth, rich and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Breathe out.” He did, “And into heaven.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His eyes rolled back into his head and his tense muscles relaxed, he melted into the wall he sat against. I looked around and noticed for the first time the needle that was next to one of the bags, and the dark color of his veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned, opened the wolf-head door carefully, walked out into the street and breathed out the breath that I didn’t know I was holding before the dark tunnels that told me my time was up impeded my vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-7323948025452304694?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-eight.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-5279714971914836513</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2009 23:11:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-07T15:14:30.089-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>professor laurent</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><title>day seven.</title><description>&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;

The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Advice from a Professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I walked down the hallways dragging my feet. I'd never done anything like this before, and considering what I was about to talk about with my professor I think I had the right to be worried. Professor Laurent's office was on the third floor of the building, I knew because I had been there for office hours a million times before. I reached the heavy wood door and stood for a minute just staring at the brass plaque that was joined to the door. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Professor Laurent, Professor of English" it said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I sighed, wondering whether I should go in or not. He had said that he wanted me to meet with him about a paper I turned in recently and I had a feeling that it wasn't to congratulate me on my wonderful writing. I wrote it the night before, with little thought because I was up the entire night before that unable to sleep. Every time I closed my eyes these days I had another dream, another nightmare. Killian was noticing but I think that he didn't want to bring it up. I was just hoping that I hadn't said anything weird in my sleep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;It was the lack of sleep that was really getting to me more than anything. I looked horrible these days, the bags under my eyes were starting to get larger than the average college student and I knew that I had to do something. Because I couldn't function like this. I had snapped at Zooey more than one, and she told me that I looked like I needed some rest. But how was I supposed to sleep when every time I did drift off I fell back into the horrible memories of Darius or the tortured present of Fitz. Just thinking about the last of these...dreams, visions, whatever they were made my skin crawl. There had been just so much blood. And Darius, he was in so much pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;As I stood facing the door thinking about all this there was a hand on my shoulder. I turned around and looked up into the face of Professor Laurent himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Professor Laurent was a handsome guy. He had chestnut brown hair that was combed back in the front while the sides hung down around his face. He rarely smiled but those smiles lit up his face and were the prized possession of his students, since they were given so infrequently. His eyes were narrow and green like mine, though his were darker. I can't deny I really admired him. He painted such an amazing picture walking purposefully into the room a minute into class, taking off his suit jacket, rolling up his shirt sleeves and flipping open his copy of whatever we were reading before grilling us all on the purpose of what we had read. He was the kind of professor that didn't take "I was busy" for an excuse, who didn't change due dates or give lenient grades to the students that he liked. He was strict about his decisions. But on the other hand he was also willing to give help to anyone that wanted to learn, cherished the students that showed real passion for his subject and his praise, as I have said about his smiles, was all the more exciting to receive because it came so infrequently. In short, he was the kind of teacher that all teachers should be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I looked up at those discerning green eyes and smiled. And he paused a moment, the weight of his hand stragely comforting before asking,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Were you looking for me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Ah yes Professor Laurent. I got an email saying that you wanted to talk to me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Of course Dante, why don't you come in?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I stood aside while he took out a set of keys and unlocked the ancient brass lock, pushed open the door and held it open for me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Professor Laurent had one of the nicest offices that I had seen on the campus. It had a view of the quad that was unrivaled and that was especially amazing now that the Japanese cherry trees were beginning to bloom. It was furnished with comfy Italian armchairs and a rich mahogany desk. There were paintings, unframed, hung on the wall that the Professor seemed to have put there himself. He had a collection of picture frames on his desk and the one that was turned just enough so that I could see it was a photo of the Professor, arm around a smaller man with dark hair and wide laughing eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Have a seat Dante." He gestured to one of the deep armchairs that were positioned in front of the desk. Before walking over to a file cabinet in the corner and rustling through it in order to find something. He found it and pulled it out, and I recognized it instantly as my most recently submitted essay. He walked over and leaned against the front of his desk gracefully instead of sitting behind it, handing the essay back to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;On the top, in red ink that was so typical of the essay corrector was written: B- This is the best you can do Dante? I expected more after reading your first paper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I looked at it and sighed mentally. That actually wasn't too bad. I was thinking that the grade I received was going to be far far worse than that. So I can't deny I was relieved. It must have showed on my face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"What do you think Dante?" Professor Laurent looked at me steadily, one hand in his pocket the other resting upon one of his knees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"It's really not as bad as I thought it was going to be." I smiled guiltily at him, knowing this wasn't really the answer that he was looking for. He looked a little stern but then his face broke and he looked a little too understanding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"You're really capable of far more. If I'm honest with you, which I always try to be with my students, this is really not a B- paper."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I looked down at it again. "Ah..."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;He continued, "This is really a C draft. But there is a lot of good thought in here. I can tell that you wrote it the night before."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I opened my mouth t lie about this fact, since I knew that it was always best to make the professor think that you had worked really hard on their essay. This way, they were more likely to look at it with a favorable eye but he stopped me before I could get there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Oh don't pull that on me Dante," He smiled, or rather the edges of his mouth curled just a little. It would have been almost unnoticeable if I hadn't known him as well as I did. "I know all the tricks in the book. I also read your first essay. This is not the best that you can do. But I gave you a B because I don't want to drag your grade down. I gave you the minus because I don't want to receive any more work that you haven't finished. This would have been an amazing essay if your head weren't somewhere else when you wrote it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I nodded. He was right of course. I hadn't been really paying attention to what I was writing when I was working on the assignment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"So," he continued, "look Dante. You have a lot of talent. You are without a doubt one of the best writers that has come through my classes. Now I haven't been teaching as long as Professor Rady," Professor Rady was a white-haired old man that taught Shakespeare and was well known for being both eccentric and sort of dirty, "But that certainly is saying something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Thank you professor. I...I mean that is quite a compliment coming from you especially." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;He smiled a real smile this time, "You need to put some more effort into your assignments. Not because you will have any problem getting an A in this class, you won't. I think you will probably find the final laughably easy. But the reason that you need to work harder is because I know you can do better. You've been so distracted lately."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I nodded again, trying not to get emotional. I was stressed out, and his words were bringing it all crashing down on me at once. All the schoolwork and the dreams and the lack of sleep...it was a little too much for me to deal with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;He looked a little guilty, so he must have sensed that he had brought up something that was a little close to home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Look Dante, I know when something is bothering one of my students, and honestly normally I would say that college students are adults, and it is time for them to deal with their own problems without the guidance of their teachers. But you have...well a touch of brilliance in you and I don't want to see that wasted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;He shifted a little uncomfortably on the edge of his desk and looked at the photo of him and the younger man that I had noticed before. His expression softened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Is there something that is bothering you? You do look like it has been a while since you slept properly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I took a minute to compose myself before answering. It was several deep breaths before I found the streangth to speak. I knew that telling him about my dreams might mean that he thought I was crazy. He might loose all respect for me, all the respect that he had just told me he had. I wasn't sure it was a good idea to burst the bubble of the way that he thought about me. I just couldn't keep it to myself anymore though, I did need some guidance, I did need a way to deal with the dreams so that they didn't take over my life. Or better yet, a way to make them go away entirely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;So I plunged in, "It's just I haven't been sleeping well lately Professor." He raised his eyebrows. It was clear that he was expecting me to go on and explain, "I've been having...horrible nightmares." My voice cracked a little on the last word and I cleared my throat to cover the fact. He didn't say anything, so I guessed that he expected me to keep speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"They started maybe two months ago, but I just can't sleep because every time I do its just...blood and death and horrible horrible things." I started to tear up now but I forced them back. I wouldn't cry in front of Professor Laurent. I respected him way too much to do anything like that. I continued, "It's always the same cast of characters and I feel like I know them from somewhere, but I've never met them before. And these dreams...they're...well they're so real. I wake up and I believe them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Still Professor Laurent didn't say anything, though now he looked more concerned than anything else. But still, I continued speaking. It was as if the invitation had opened a flood that I didn't know I was holding back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"And the dreams are in sequence, they're not...choppy and disjointed like normal dreams are you know? And so...I try not to sleep...because I don't want to have these dreams. But...well they won't leave me alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Professor Laurent didn't speak for a few very long minutes, he was looking thoughtfully at me, his arms folded over his chest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"Have you talked to anyone about this?" He asked, his voice level and not betraying any of what he was thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;"No. This is the first time that I've talked to anyone about it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;He nodded knowingly. "I thought so. Is there anything else that has been happening in your life recently that might have stressed you to contribute to these dreams?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;I shook my head. "Everything was going really well until they started."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: courier new;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:85%;" &gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 12,813&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-5279714971914836513?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-seven.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-7085491835656611869</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2009 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-07T08:36:49.864-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>killian</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>blaire</category><title>day six.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;A Date (pt 2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She came down a few minutes later. She looked, radiant. He hair was shining golden in the little bit of sun that was filtering through the clouds and her eyes lit up when she caught sight of me leaning against the railing. She half-ran over and when she reached me hesitated a minute before giving me a hug. She smelled like sunflowers and freshly washed skin, and her hair against my cheek was soft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She pulled away smiling hugely. She was wearing a floaty light pink skirt over black tights with a teal v-neck and a black pea coat. I smiled, feeling a little like an idiot and swallowed before speaking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey Zooey.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She beamed, if possible, a little brighter. “Hi Dante. You ready to go?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I nodded and we headed towards University Village. We talked for a while about philosophy and made jokes about our professor. But that was usually what we did during class, and the topic was exhausted by the time we got down to the shopping center. Zooey dragged me into the Apple store and we spent time wishing that we had the money for the shiny new electronics before we went next door to the brewery for lunch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;A cheery brunette sat us down only a minute after we had entered and we opened our menus. There was a few moments of awkwardness where neither of us really spoke that much. We ordered drinks before I got up the courage to start the conversation again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“So Zooey, tell me about LA. Why would you move all the way up to rainy Seattle from a hip place like LA?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She thought for a moment before replying, biting a little on the corner of her lip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I guess I just needed to get away from it all you know? Try somewhere new. LA isn’t all that people say it is.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I must have looked disbelieving because she leaned forward in her chair a little,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“No! It’s true. I mean sure there’s concerts and art galleries, and you know….always something happening but that’s true of every city.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“The traffic get to you?” I laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She smiled but seemed eager to make a point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“It’s just, the people in Los Angeles all think that they’re entitled to stuff.” She leaned back against the seat sighing and smiled sadly, “They’re all a little too concerned with what they deserve. And I really wanted to get out of that selfishness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I nodded, not knowing quite what to say to this, but she spared me and continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I love the city itself. I love the life that it has, but I figure if I don’t get out and try someplace new then I might never have the chance.” Her eyes flashed with excitement and opened her hands, “Everyone needs an adventure now and then right Dante?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I laughed. “I’m not sure how much of an adventurer I am, especially considering that my house is only like half an hour away from here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Well we’ll just have to have some adventures of our own then. What’s life without new experiences?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I’m game.” And I was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;We passed the rest of the lunch without incident and in easy talk. Zooey was easy to like. She was smart and laughed at even my more feeble jokes and kept conversation going with her easy confidence. I kept mentally shaking myself throughout the meal, wondering if a girl like this was really interested in a guy like me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She told me about her family and her two dogs who she had named after Michelangelo and Monet, about sunsets in California and what she called ‘real’ Mexican food, about her high school and her friends. And she made me talk too, about my roommate and about what I wanted to do after school (I had no idea), about my hometown and about exciting things to do in Seattle. She argued with me just the right amount when the check came, but I insisted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Can’t a guy take a girl out to lunch anymore?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;The meal was over all too soon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I think she felt the same way, so we walked across the parking lot to the Barnes and Nobel to waste time wandering around. I immediately pulled her upstairs to the music section to take a look around. I have to add here that I am very particular about my music. It is one of my biggest passions and I know I should share, but I’m sort of one of those people that likes to keep their music to themselves. I pride myself on finding new bands before anyone else does, and listening to exactly what I like. I guess they call that being a music elitist but I can’t help it. It’s an addiction for me. I’m always moving on to the next band and the next, something newer, something less corporate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I try not to be stuck up about it because I know that this attitude turns a lot of people off, especially people that listen to popular music but I can’t imagine living without my music. It’s what gets me through the day, my headphones are my retreat, my best friends. I need a soundtrack in my life, that’s all there is to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;So honestly, there usually isn’t anything that I really want to buy in the music section at Barnes and Nobel but I figured it was a good way to pass time and you never know. We picked through the plastic covered CDs laughing at some of the more ridiculous covers. I was looking at a Chroma Key CD when she came over to see what I was so interested in and saw it in my hand. She smiled widely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I love Chroma Key. I think Kevin alone is way better than Dream Theater.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I think I may have fallen in love with her in that moment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;We spent the next two hours talking music in the coffee shop in the Barnes and Nobel and by the time we left each had a few new CDs recommended by they other to take up to the front counter. Zooey grabbed my arm when we left the store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“It’s so cold!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;And it did look rather dismal, the day was starting to wear on and there were darker clouds in the sky than before. We decided to head back to campus and so we started the longer walk back, heading up a different way to avoid climbing the huge hill that we had descended. It was only five minutes after we had decided not to take the bus that it started to pour down rain. The heavens opened up and just emptied everything on to us. Zooey cursed Seattle weather and we ran as fast as we could, wet clothes slapping against us and our teeth chattering. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;We ran into the entranceway to McCarty, my dorm, because it was closest and she decided that to walk the rest of the way back to Hagget in the rain was out of the question. She was shaking and soaked, it didn’t seem that her coat had provided too much protection from the elements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Look come upstairs and you can dry off before you head back.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She smiled and nodded, teeth chattering to much to speak and followed me up to the 5th floor. I unlocked the door hoping that Killian was dressed and that the place wasn’t too much of a mess. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I walked in and Killian was sitting in a chair in the middle of the room with towels draped over his shoulders staring at the televison. Blaire was wearing gloves standing behind him and pouring something bright blue into his hair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Hey Edwards, how’s California? She want to bang you yet?” He said without turning his head. Blaire caught sight of us and started to laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I blushed bright red and shot her a fairly nasty look. She stopped laughing pretty quickly. I glanced at Zooey and saw that, cold as she was, she was smiling rather sheepishly as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Killian…” Blaire said, turning the desk chair around slowly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Zooey,” I said, and her name felt good in my mouth, “this is my roommate Killian. He’s from Ireland.” He waved and winked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“Good to meet you California.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“And this,” I continued, “Is his friend Blaire that apparently is dying his hair blue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;Blaire looked startled, “What? Oh yeah, I am. But not all of it, only parts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;I rolled my eyes and opened my dresser. I pulled out some sweatpants, picked out my Chroma Key t-shirt and a towel turned back to Zooey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I’m afraid I don’t think I have anything more fashionable to give you but these will be warm enough I think. You can change in the study room and I’ll stand guard, make sure no one comes in. Cause there’s only a guys bathroom on this floor.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She nodded, “Thanks a lot Dante. You’re a lifesaver.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;When she had changed I went to the bathroom to do the same and we argued with Killian about what channel to watch. The whole room smelled like hair dye but I could still pick out Zooey’s floaty sunflower scent. She got along better than I would have hoped with Killian, who tried, after his first mistake, to be extra polite to her. She also seemed a little confused by Blaire, who tended to say strange things at even stranger moments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;The four of us, once Killian had rinsed his hair and had his new blue streaks in place, went down to Ian’s Domain in the dorm to get soup, hot pockets, chips and candy for dinner instead of walking down to the dining hall. After we watched two reality shows and a movie on television Blaire picked up her stuff and said goodbye and Zooey said that she was going to head back as well. She grabbed her wet clothes that we had packed away in a plastic bag and donned one of my sweatshirts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I’ll walk you back to Hagget.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;It was still raining so I gabbed my umbrella and we made most of the walk over to the next dorm in comfortable silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;When we reached the entrance of the other dorm she turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I had an amazing time with you today Dante.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;“I did too…well not with me though obviously…with you.” I sputtered nervously. And then a little more composedly, “We never did get to go over what happened in class while you were gone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;She smiled mischievously, “Well I guess we’ll just have to study again some time soon.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;And then she pressed her lips to my cheek and disappeared into the dorm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 10,808&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-7085491835656611869?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-six.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-8992900832670517489</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2009 21:02:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-07T08:37:33.115-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>killian</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>blaire</category><title>day five.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

I love this place. So cheap too.” Killian was slurping down noodles faster than I would have thought humanly possible at Ichiro's on the Ave one Friday after class. He frequently dragged me there because he swore that they had the best Japanese food on the Ave and you could get enough food for a horse, no, more like a whole stable for around six dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I didn’t really mind the place and since Killian usually went with Blaire and Blaire was at some gallery showing for one of her friends, Killian dragged me along instead. He threw back the rest of his Sapporo and burped loudly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“So Edwards,” For some reason Killian loved calling me by my last name. He did this with a lot of people, “I was thinking about dying my hair blue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I laughed, trying not to choke on my udon. “You’re kidding right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He leaned back in his chair a bit and smiled widely at me. “Is that so unbelievable? You know all the cool kids in the art major have different colored hair or tattoos or piercings or something, I’m just trying to fit in with you Americans is all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I didn’t really know what to say so I just laughed again, “Well you can ask Blaire to do it then, and we’ll just see how it looks in the end.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;My cell phone beeped and I looked down at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;1 new text message from: Zooey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I nearly dropped the phone in surprise. Zooey had never texted me before and she had been missing from class earlier in the day. I figured she was sick or just busy and didn’t feel like philosophy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I flipped open the phone a little apprehensively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;Hey Dante. I totally slept through class this morning. I feel so stupid. Could we meet up some time this weekend so I can borrow your notes? The reading was tough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked up at Killian, a giant grin pasted to my face and he looked at me worriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Whas was ‘hat about?” He said thickly through a mouthful of noodles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You remember the girl in my philosophy class that I told you about? The one that I said was really cute?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Killian swallowed, “Yeah California right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Right. Well she wants to study together this weekend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Killian rolled his eyes. “Study? Well that’s not exciting, unless she wants to study anatomy with you.” He winked cheekily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I’m going to ignore that.” I looked down at the open message again before responding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;Yeah of course. When did you want to meet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;It wasn’t more than a minute before she texted me back. She must have been waiting for my reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;Well I thought that we could make a day of it, maybe grab some lunch tomorrow and study?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I read the message a few times before looking up at Killian again. “I think she just asked me out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Killian burst out laughing. “You’ve got to be kidding me Edwards!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What?!” I was feeling a little hurt by the idea that he thought no one would want to go out with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“These American girls mate, they sure are pushy. And she’s from Los Angeles so that tells you something right there. Here give me that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He grabbed the phone out of my hand and read the message on the screen before laughing again and sliding the phone back over to me. “Yeah she definitely wants your body Edwards.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Don’t be a pervert Killian.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“So? Are you gonna go?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Of course I am. She’s an amazing girl.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Sounds like someone has a bit of a crush.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I ignored this comment as well and responded:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;Sounds good. As long as you promise to let me treat you. How about the brewery place down near the Apple store. I’ll swing by your dorm and we can walk down together. Say around one?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Again her reply came quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" &gt;You’re too sweet! One sounds fine. I’ll see you tomorrow Dante!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I had butterflies in my stomach already, which I know is pretty pathetic of me.  Killian teased me the whole way back to the dorm, even though we stopped to get a new video game and for him to buy beer on the way back. By the time we got home I was completely embarrassed. I have to admit that it had been a while since I was on a date, and my previous, well romantic encounters had been sort of juvenile. And she was this cool girl from California, Los Angeles no less, she was probably expecting a lot. I was hoping that I’d be able to live up to those expectations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well it's a good thing she’s shorter than you mate. Hard to find those.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh that’s just not nice Killian.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Better hope she wears flats.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I scowled at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh come on mate I’m just messing with you. She obviously really likes you if she’s going out of her way to ask you out. Don’t be so uptight about it, just be yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ah…okay…right.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;There was a pause in which Killian turned on the television, flipped it over to the game consol and flopped down on the couch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey Killian?” He grunted in response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What do I wear?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;A Date (pt 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The next day I woke up earlier than I meant to. Killian was still snoring, one of his legs hanging off the top bunk. I chuckled a little to myself and pulled on some jeans and my sweatshirt, as well as my iPod because it goes everywhere with me. I headed down to the dorm down the street where there would be a hot breakfast since it was Saturday. Killian never woke up early enough for breakfast but he always got mad if I didn’t smuggle waffles out for him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;It was misting steadily when I opened the door from the dorm. It was one of those cold crisp northwestern mornings where the air felt thick with water vapor on your tongue and the smell of the pine trees got into your clothing, your hair, everything. The ground was slick and wet, birds out making low noises in the back of their throats. It is those kinds of mornings that you can’t find anywhere else, where the whole world looks like a fading photograph and the very air around you seems to hum with old-fashioned possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The dining hall, The Eight, was almost empty because it was Saturday morning. I grabbed some toast and Life cereal and took a booth near the window where someone had left a copy of the newspaper lying around. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I wouldn’t say that I’m generally a morning person, but there’s something about getting to taste the day before everyone else does, when you’ve slept well all night and you just feel like the day holds an untold number of surprises and possibilities. I know that most of that feeling, which I was getting wave after wave of that morning had to do with a certain girl from Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;You probably think that I’m being ridiculous. I mean I know we had just hung out in class before and that we’d only been talking for a couple weeks but I really thought she was so cool. And me, well, I can be sort of a dork. I mean I know I’m really smart but I’ve never been a charmer. I think that much is probably obvious already. I just wanted her to think that I was as cool as I thought she was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I perused the newspaper and finished my toast before grabbing some waffles for Killian and sneaking out the back door. When I got back to the room he was up, laying in bed and flipping aimlessly through the channels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey Kill?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oi what’s up kid?” He waved sleepily at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I pulled the to go box that I had smuggled out and held it up so he could see it. His eyes lit up and he scrambled out of bed so fast that before I realized he was moving he had snatched the box from my hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“You are fucking amazing man.” He said between shoveling mouthfuls of waffles into his mouth and chewing noisily. “Do you think its too early for a beer?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I laughed, “Are you serious? You need to ask that question?” It’s eleven in the morning Killian.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well I was just asking. You know it's the weekend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Doesn’t make a difference. It’s still eleven in the morning.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Killian shrugged and flipped the television over to Looney Tunes. I laughed at the idea of him eating waffles, drinking beer and watching Looney Tunes at eleven in the morning in his college dorm. I opened my History of South East Asia textbook and started reading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;At twelve thirty I went to get in the shower. I came back and Blaire was in the room, eating my cereal and kicking Killian as she swung her legs from the couch. He didn’t seem to mind this. When I came into the room in my towel she wolf-whistled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey there Dante. Looking good.” She raised her eyebrows and winked at me. I must have turned red because she laughed and started to fan herself. “Hot stuff.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I tried not the be phased by her teasing me, “You’re eating my cereal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He smiled, “Yeah it’s really good.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I gotta change, can you erm…wait in the hallway?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She laughed again and walked past me, my box of cereal still in her hand. Killian had not moved his eyes from the screen the whole time, where two girls who were obviously intoxicated were fighting on some unintelligent reality show. Every now and then he chuckled at them, still eating, though now it was mac and cheese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I threw on a green t-shirt and some jeans and grabbed my blue military-style jacket before picking up my philosophy book, wallet and iPod and heading out of the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Blaire waved as I walked down the hall. “Thanks for the cereal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I shrugged, “At least someone is enjoying it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;By one I was waiting outside Hagget, calling Zooey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey Dante! Are you here?” Her voice was excited and bright over the phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Yeah come down whenever you’re ready.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Okay. I’m on my way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 9,024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-8992900832670517489?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-5.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-4020743951462029584</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2009 07:59:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-05T00:03:33.055-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the barron</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>tax</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>darius</category><title>day four.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: courier new;font-size:100%;" &gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning of a Nightmare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was standing in a spacious room, the walls covered with gilded mirrors and gold and cream hangings. The floor was light shining wood, with patterns and designs inlayed on it. There was a huge white stone fireplace on one side of the room, its sides carved into lions with proud manes. One had his paw resting upon a strange circular symbol that had three lines running parallel through it, the other was topped with a crown. The rest of the room contained little furniture except for a few silk and velvet armchairs that were clustered in one of the corners of the room. Large windows lined one of the walls but the dark blue curtains that hung around them had been drawn shut, so that the only light in the room was the bit that squeezed through the gaps in the curtains, that fluttered in when there was a bit of a draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long moment I thought that I was alone in the room, there was no noise, no movement. But then there was a small laugh and a dog bark from near the fireplace. I walked closer, not yet able to see anything in the darkness of the room. Soon enough though, I caught sight of a young boy, maybe eight or nine sitting on the floor and laughing. He had long blonde hair and the same pale bottomless eyes that I recognized instantly. He was playing with a small shaggy black puppy, who was bounding around him with a pink nose and over sized paws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Xerxes!” And when the boy spoke I was certain that this was a younger Darius. He was dragging a piece of rope around and the puppy, Xerxes, was attempting to wrench it away from him. Darius was laughing, the smile on his face looked so unlike any expression I had seen on him. It lit up his eyes and made them look like light morning clouds, like clear skies. His smile brought his face a sense of humanity that I’d never glimpsed there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His small hands reached out to the dog and caught him. Xerxes wiggled in Darius’s small strong arms, licking the boy’s face obsessively, his whole body wagging along with his tail. It was a minute later, when the dog had calmed down and seemed happy just to sit in Darius’ lap and lick the hand that pet him, that the door to the room slammed open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light shone into the room from the hallway, momentarily silhouetting the man in the doorway. He marched purposefully across the room, riding boots clicking ominously against the floor. Darius’s happy smile had slipped from his face as soon as the door opened and he pushed Xerxes behind him, the passive poker face that he usually adopted wiping his face of emotion. He stood calmly and tried to shield the dog from view while still maintaining his almost militaristic pose.&lt;br /&gt;The man that had walked into the room, was short and thick, not fat but his middle section was certainly threatening a gut that he would probably get in his old age. He was proud and stood straight, his whole posture threatening the severity in his eyes. He flexed his shoulders as he approached Darius, who looked as though he would very much like to shrink away from this figure. His wide jaw, and small calculating eyes certainly did not immediately engender any love in me. I knew instantly that this was a person to be wary of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Darius.” The way he said the child’s name threatened disdain in every syllable. His voice was low and grating, like scraping wounds through gravel. Darius did, at his name visibly shrink from the man a bit, though his impassive face did not crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Barron Lorrimer sir.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this then, I figured, must be Darius’ father. He certainly lived up to the impressive, domineering figure that was painted of him. And Darius, as well as he was hiding it, obviously wasn’t very close with his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Darius what are you keeping from me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius shifted a little guiltily, or perhaps it was to hide the puppy, who was making this no easier by chasing his tail and making quite a bit of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Nothing father.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You are lying you ungrateful little son of a bitch. How dare you lie to your father.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His voice never raised, but the threat in his tone was well expressed. I thought that it might have actually been less threatening if he raised his voice. This deep growl was more animalistic and more unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No father. I am grateful I just…” Darius stepped aside and the puppy came into view. Not that he was well hidden before, but now he didn’t have the young Darius shielding him from the piercing eyes of the Barron Lorrimer. Darius continued on with admirable courage, considering the look that his father was giving him, “I found him near the gate, and he looked like he needed somewhere to stay.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And you thought you’d take in some gypsy bitch’s pup?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius looked sideways at the puppy and said in a small voice, “I’ve named him Xerxes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barron raised his eyebrows. And then, without warning he extended a hand, brought it back and slapped Darius in the face with the back of his hand so hard that the child reeled, unable to keep balance, and fell, sobbing to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You will not bring scum into this house. You ungrateful bastard.” His voice still did not rise, but it actually lowered to more of a growl, threatening more violence in every syllable. Darius looked up at him from the ground, sobbing, with the whole left side of his face turning red and purple. The place would certainly bruise. He seemed unable to maintain his posture in the face of such blatant cruelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But he needs me!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barron looked down his nose at his son, as if he were some sort of pest or beast before lashing out again. This time it was with his thick leather boot. He kicked Darius in the stomach, once, twice, three times and with each kick spit out more insults at the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No one needs you, you little shit. No one needs you because you are worth nothing. It’s a good thing your mother never lived to see your miserable face.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he turned and grabbed the dog by the scruff of his neck and marched towards the same door he entered through, the same boots that had just kicked his son echoing his footsteps in the empty ballroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Randall!” He screamed as he neared the door, and a servant appeared almost instantly. He dumped the whimpering puppy into the servants arms and spoke loudly and clearly enough for both Darius and I to hear his every word, though he stood on the other side of the ballroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Take this abomination out to the yard and shoot it. I won’t have gypsy animals in my house, and certainly not a dirty, smelly, stupid little runt of a dog like this.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The servant’s eyes widened, but he left without saying anything. The Barron turned in the doorway and looked at his son, still on the ground, sobbing and moaning pitifully, and raised his eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Worthless.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he slammed the doors behind him and the room was once again enveloped in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius did not move for several moments, but his tears came on and on. I wondered if the Barron had broken his ribs, or if he was seriously injured. But then the curtains flapped open a little more and what I saw frightened me far more than the Barron’s actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius was still on the floor, in the fetal position, his small arms around his head as if shielding himself from something. He was moaning softly. His face and hands were streaked with a black inky substance that seemed to cling to his body. It was tracing his tear tracks, leaking from the corners of his eyes. And the eyes themselves, abandoning their deep pale blue had turned dark, as if the ink itself and coated his eyes. It leaked too from his nose, fingernails and open mouth, pooling like blood or vomit under his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He let out a scream, a sound that I had never known a human could make. It is, even now indescribable, like the gating of rusted metal against itsef and the sound of slaughtered livestock. It was pure pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I backed up so quickly that I tripped over my own feet, falling on my back and crawling as quickly away from the child as I could. He raised his head a little as I fell and looked at me with those dark ink-bleeding eyes, reaching out one hand, though if it was for help or to attack I never knew. Because the tunnels appeared once more in my vision and I woke panting as if I had been running, tears on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killian, who was up and shaving in the sink, was staring at me and when he saw I had woken up, he quickly looked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat up and held my chest for a moment, willing my breathing to slow and my heart to stop racing. After all, it had just been a dream. Just a dream. I had to keep repeating that mantra in my head. I had to believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the day in a daze, feeling as if I had been up all night. I certainly hadn’t slept well. And when I got home from class Killian was already there, having his nightly beer and watching South Park re-runs on his computer. He took one look at me and looked away again before saying, “You look like shit man. Maybe you need a nap or something.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought for a moment about it, put my bag down and put my head in my hands running my fingers through my hair. But I didn’t think that I would be able to do it. I don’t think there was anyway I could sleep when every time I had closed my eyes that day I had seen the inky blind face of Darius and heard that inhuman moaning and screaming. I was terrified of going back to sleep, terrified of what I might see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few moments like this, on the end of my bed I heard Killian get up from his chair and rummage through a bin under his desk. I lifted my head when I heard his footsteps stop in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He held out two Tylenol PMs and a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Drink up mate. You seriously need it. I know you didn’t sleep very well last night, you were tossing and turning all night. And you look like hell.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the medicine and I thanked him, feeling a little exposed. I wondered what kind of things I had said during the night and I prayed, as I drifted off to sleep, that I wouldn’t have any dreams that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 7,312&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-4020743951462029584?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-four.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-5301223254367927022</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2009 06:17:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-03T22:25:36.881-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fornaxirus</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the barron</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>darius</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the fountain</category><title>day three.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited.

I like to get a seat near, but not too near to the front and in a spot where I can see the most of the board as possible. In Gowen hall this means that I sit on the right side, about three rows back. I really like the way that the classroom feels when it’s almost empty, with shafts of the morning sun filtering in through the high, half-closed windows. The desks are set up in long benches, and the whole hall just feels as if it’s stuck in time, immovable and immutable. It reminded me of the pictures of Ivy League schools, or of the schools in England that always typified college for me when I was young, It was as if the learning was embedded in the walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I was doodling absently on a spare page of my notebook that day in the second week of classes when I heard the whining creek of the lecture room door open. I was the only person in the hall so far, twenty minute before class was set to start. I didn’t look up but instead fumbled with my iPod to change the song. I didn’t notice the person that had come into the room until she sat down next to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Good morning.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Her voice was sunny and kind, it reminded me of summer vacation. I looked over at her, a little startled. The lecture hall seated almost 200 people, but she sat herself down in the seat right next to mine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Uh…hi. I mean..good morning.” I replied rather lamely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I took a better look at her out of the corner of my eye, trying not seem as awkward as I was feeling about the situation. She was short and thin with a round face and wavy blonde hair that shone in the darkness of the classroom. She had large bright blue eyes and was wearing a high-waisted pink and black skirt and a white tank top underneath a grey sweater. She noticed me looking and smiled brightly before pulling out a Hello Kitty notebook and a pen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I have to be honest, I was quite taken with her already. I turned to her and stuck out my hand, trying desperately to be cool and not seem nervous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“My name’s Dante.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She grinned back at me and shook my hand. Hers was soft and dry and seemed to fit perfectly against mine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“My name is Zooey.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“What’s your major Zooey?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ah right now it’s Art History. But my dad really wants me to switch into business.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I laughed. “You can’t do that. Business would be no fun.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She nodded, “Yeah well I’m not sure what I’ll do with Art History and that’s what he’s most worried about I think but…I’m sure I’ll figure it out. What about you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ah…I’m a history major.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Oh really?” She seemed genuinely interested, which isn’t usually something you hear when I tell people that I was a history major.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Yeah.” I shrugged, “It’s pretty cool.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“So where are you from Dante?” She leaned on one of her hands, looking at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Not too far from here, Lake Forest Park.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Honestly I have no idea where that is.” She laughed, “I’m sorry, I’m from California, so I’m still trying to find my way around so to speak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well you’re not missing out on too much. Lake Forrest is not that exciting. Where in California are you from?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Los Angeles.” She smiled warmly, “But don’t go holding that against me okay?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The classroom had been slowly filling up around us, and there was a minute of silence in which she silenced her cell phone and Professor Fotherby straightened the papers on the lectern and plugged in the ancient slide projector that he was going to subject us all to once again. Zooey laughed quietly to herself watching him struggle to make the projector work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She leaned over to me “He does know that thing’s older than he is right? And I'm pretty sure that's saying something.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I smiled, “Well he doesn’t want the technology to upstage him. And considering...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She laughed and touched my arm playfully. I think I may have fallen for her before Professor Fotherby even started speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;At the end of the lecture we walked out together and she left in the quad to go to her Renaissance Masters class. Before she left she promised to find me on Facebook so we could set up a time to study. So I went back to the dorm, skipping my History of South east Asia class, and set up an account on Facebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;A Walk Through the City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The air was hot and dry, and there was a wind blowing. I was standing at the end of a long dirt road, with tall wood buildings leaning in on the street like silent sentinels. Flags and laundry flapped in the wind, making snapping noises against the howling of the air through the cracks in the buildings. On my right were a series of shop fronts, their names in a strange symbolic script that I had never seen before but that looked somehow familiar. There were whole chickens hanging from the rafters in the front and baskets of strange spice set out. But the street was almost deserted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;At the end of the road was a structure unlike the wooden shacks perched around me. It was at least twice as tall, made of white stone and it cast a shadow over the street. I walked down the road, not drawing any attention from the few people that were out on the streets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;When I reached the end of the road and the white stone structure was I looked to the left and the right and saw that it continued as far as I could see. It seemed to be a huge circular wall, with large ornate gates placed periodically. Next to each of these were guards in brown military uniforms that reminded me of the pictures I had seen of English colonial-era generals. They were same tan-brown color, and seemed to be the same lightweight material. They stood leaning against the gates with swords that crisscrossed their backs and bright blue stars on their shoulders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I approached one of the gates where there was a thin guard smoking a strange water pipe laughing with the shorter fatter guard next to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Yeah the Barron Lorrimer came through the other day. Kicked Matthews in the balls when he asked to see the Barron’s card.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The fat one chortled and took the offered water pipe from the skinny one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Serves him right. Stupid idiot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I walked up to the two guards and wondered if they were going to stop me from trying to get through the gate. It didn’t even look like it was a gate I could open myself. It was made of thick wood beams and large brass plates and there was a crank on the side of the stone that was probably used to open it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Uh…excuse me?” I directed this to the fatter one, who seemed the more good-natured of the two. He didn’t even blink; I guessed that he didn’t hear me, so I moved a little closer to him before trying again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Excuse me sir.” Again, there was no response at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Then all of a sudden the guards straightened up, looking more like the officers that they should be in the uniforms they were wearing.  The pipe was mystically gone and they stood at attention saluting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I turned to see the cause of this change. Walking up to the gate, with one hand in the pockets of some expensive looking black slacks was think graceful looking man. He had long blonde hair that was tied back in a think blue ribbon, and a thin aristocratic face with deep-set eyes. He was stunning to look at, each step seemed to be taken with amazing precision that came to him without effort, his long body making him seem perfect, otherworldly. When he raised his head to the guards I caught sight of his eyes and was transfixed. They were the palest lightest blue, and bottomless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He raised a dismissing hand to the guards, and even this casual gesture was measured and graceful. He had long fingers and pale hands, the left one with a large sapphire ring on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;As the guards opened the gate, he waited casually, then walked through. I followed quickly behind, knowing that he was my change to see what was on the other side of the circular wall. The gate shuddered shut with a woody grinding noise behind me and I stopped for a moment to look around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The city on the other side of the wall looked like a completely different place. The structures here were not made of wood, but the same stone as the wall, with darker stone intermingled. Nor did they lean over the road or look mismatched and unplanned. The roads too, were stone, a dark grey instead of the dirt that the road had been before. The flags that stood on the top of the buildings were bright and colorful. There were shops with large open archways and ornate signs as well as several governmental buildings where important looking men ran back and forth or argued on the steps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Not knowing where exactly to go, I followed the young blonde man that had entered the gate with me. He took long purposeful strides up the street, pausing briefly when others in the street offered him a word of greeting and inclining his head but saying nothing. After I had been following him for a while he turned down a large side street which led to a huge wrought iron gate. On the other side of the gate were sweeping lawns and gardens that led the eye to a pure white stone manor. Pulling out a brass key from the coat of his double-breasted royal blue jacket he unlocked the gates and pushed one side open. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Unsure if I wanted to get myself locked into someone’s house I stood on the spot debating with myself. I was on the verge of turning and going back into the larger street when the man spoke for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well, are you coming in?” His voice was smooth and dark, like polished mahogany. He spoke softly, but with such careful emphasis that I felt even if a room were crowded with noise his voice would be easily discernible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked into his pale eyes, trying to figure out if her were talking to me. Thus far it seemed that no one had been able to see or hear me, but this young man, an aristocrat by the looks of it, certainly was addressing me. He was looking straight at me and there was on one else on the street that led to the gate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I wasn’t sure whether I should go with him, it was all so strange, and he was certainly a person of power in the city. Whether that power was to be used to harm or to help me I had know way of knowing. But I took a chance and I followed him through the gate. He didn’t speak again as I trailed after him, walking up the long driveway and towards the impressive building ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We reached the house and he unlocked another set of impressive doors, pulling a bell just on the inside of the entrance as we walked in. Inside the house reminded me of an English castle. The stone of the outside however had given way to right wood-paneled walls and thick jewel toned rugs. Each piece of furniture looked as if it had always been there, though they didn’t seem to match each other. The windows were covered with long pooling drapes and portraits and landscapes decked the walls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;A servant in a long black coat came at the bell and addressed the young man. He didn’t seem to see me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“There will be tea in the study momentarily Master Lorrimer, allow me to take your coat.” He took the blue coat from his master and hung it in a cabinet near the doorway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I require an extra place setting Terence. And call Dash when you have a moment please.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The servant nodded his understanding to these orders and rushed off to fulfill them while the blonde man turned and swept down an entrance way that seemed to lead deeper into the house. I followed him through one hallway after another until we reached the back of the house and he opened a set of doors out into the grounds. In the distance I could see a massive fountain, and lawns set against rows and rows of old birch trees. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;We walked a ways down one of the stone pathways until we neared the fountain. Then the man walked off the path and stood leaning against one of the eldest of the trees looking out towards the fountain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Dante Edwards?” His voice once again captivated me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Y-Yes?” I stuttered, my own sounding frail and childish compared to his.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“My name is Darius Trenton Lorrimer, first and only son of the second house.” There was a pause where he never took his eyes from the fountain, “I need your talents and assistance if you are willing to lend them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 5,461&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-5301223254367927022?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-three.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-5835047002854758584</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2009 09:41:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-03T01:54:33.121-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>zooey</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>killian</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>madison</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>philosophy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>laurence</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the magpie</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>blaire</category><title>day two.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction to The Magpie (pt 2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The first thing I remember when I opened the door was the smell. I have been to million coffee shops since and before that but never have I smelled coffee like this. It smelled warm and comforting, thick like caramel, but smoother and lighter. It reminded me simultaneously of home, of the woods behind my house, of waking up in the morning to see my mother standing at the kitchen sink. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;In that moment I felt a special kind of pull and it unnerved me. Before I knew it I was standing at the counter, and the girl with the heavy-lidded eyes was leaning on one hand, her other flicking through a long box of vinyl that was sitting on the counter. She looked up as I approached and flashed me a winning smile. She had shed her black coat and underneath was wearing a tight tank top that showed red bra straps and a lot of cleavage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Hey there short stuff. See anything that you like?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I felt a little offended. I’m not going to lie, I’m a little sensitive when it comes to my height. I’m 5 foot 7 so it’s not like I’m tiny but I’m no tall Cassanova either. My dad, who is 6’1” keeps telling me that I haven’t hit my growth spurt yet, but I kind of don’t think that’s the truth. I’m probably going to be short forever. I figure there are worse things to be, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt when someone points it out. She must have sensed that I was a little slighted by the jibe because her failsafe smile faltered a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Sorry kid, I just mean you know if there’s something that you wanted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I was about to reply when a voice from the back room of the shop responded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Jesus fucking Christ Madison how many customers do we get? And you’re going to scare them off before they even order? Typical.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;A kid with dark black hair and bright blonde bangs rounded the corner, carrying a bag of coffee beans that looked like it probably weighed more than he did. Madison only ruffled her own short choppy hair and rolled her eyes pointedly at me without looking at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“So what about it kid? What can I get ya?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked up at the menu hanging by wire above her head, all scrawled in chalk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“I’m not really sure. Something hot and caffeinated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well kid that’s kinda what we do best. Look, give me three bucks and I’ll make you something off menu.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;This sounded like a really bad idea to me. She seemed like the type that would take your latte into the back and spit in it if she didn’t like you. I noticed that the record she had pulled out was by the Sex Pistols. Any girl that likes punk music is not a girl to be messed with. She held out her hand and I silently handed over the three dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The door of the till clanged shut and she set about making some sort of drink as the kid with the two-toned hair who’s nametag read “Laurence” and underneath in a different handwriting “resident scenester bitch” dragged bags of coffee into the shelves behind the counter. I tried to be inconspicuous and laid back as I waited for my drink, throwing looks over my shoulder at the bus stop. I would have to run to catch it if it showed up now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Laurence didn’t help my nervousness. After a minute he seemed to give up dragging the bags. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Fuck it. I hate this shit.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;After that he seemed to decide that leaning on the register and staring at me was a better use of his time. I tried not to notice this but it was sort of difficult. I’m pretty sure he was wearing eyeliner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Laurence you strange homo stop staring at the kid, he doesn’t want you.” Madison laughed and punched Laurence in the shoulder such that he slid off his hand and nearly smashed his head into the register. I had to hold back the laugh that rose in my throat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Crazy bitch.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Madison shrugged of this comment with a laugh and leaned forward, sliding a steaming mug past the espresso machine and grinning in a fairly unnerving way at me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“This is, I mean it’s okay to drink right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked down at the mug in my hand. It smelled good, but I didn’t trust it. Even the fluffy foam looked like it could be masking some terrible poison. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Madsion laughed, a laugh that went all the way down to the tips of my toes and back up again, and with it my fears dissolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Trust me pintsize, I’m not going to poison you. First of all I think that is one thing that could even get me fired and secondly I take my coffee very seriously. That is a 42. Named for a couple of reasons, one of which is that bus that you keep looking for.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I smiled, took a sip and felt the warmth reach my previously frozen limbs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Thanks. It’s really good.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Chocolate, hazelnut and the best espresso beans you’ll find this side of the equator.” She smirked, “And as for the bus, it’s always late on storm days. Probably a downed powerline. That’s been happening a lot lately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Ah.” I nodded and looked out of the window again. “Well I guess I’ll just wait here for a bit then and warm up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Laurence looked from Madison to me and back to Madison, watching the exchange with the bored look of someone watching reruns of old television sitcoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“Well, that is what coffee shops are for.” He said in a tone that was more a sigh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I spent a long time there that day, missed one of the buses and had to wait for the next. People popped in and out of The Magpie every once in a while, all of them seemed to know each other, like the whole clientele was one group of friends. Madison gave them all discounts or free drinks and no one seemed to notice that at the end of the day they really hadn’t made much money. Still, this casual customer relationship and the playful banter between Madison and Laurence just enhanced the feeling of home that I had gotten when I first walked in. By the time I got home it had stopped raining and darkness had fallen hours ago. Killian was passed out on his bunk, an art history textbook lying on his chest. I got under the covers and smiled to myself. It had been a good day. I didn’t have any dreams that night. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;A Meeting with Zooey (pt 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;My philosophy class was always difficult to stay awake in. Don’t get me wrong, I actually like the subject a lot, I sometimes think it’s a little too interested in itself, a little too self-absorbed but in general I can appreciate it. However, my professor insisted on making the lectures an extremely dull, if informational affair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He would stand at the lectern in the warm, slightly damp, woody-smelling Gowen hall and speak in a uniform tone throughout the two hour class period. Professor Fotherby also liked, for some strange reason, to use the old slide projector that he had to fish out of the storage closet and dust off on the first day of class. A perfectly good digital projector existed but he never used it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;When I explained this to Killian he told me, “Professors have an allergy to technology. They’re worried that when the super computer comes they will be obsolete.” He moved his arms in a bad impression of doing the robot as he said this, which sent an already tipsy Blaire into fits of laughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 3,222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-5835047002854758584?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-two.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-2211162022965035592</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2009 22:41:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-02T16:16:55.397-08:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>birds</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>fitzgerald</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>darius</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>death</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>coffee</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the magpie</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>the fountain</category><title>day one.</title><description>&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Please remember everything is rough, if grammar or sentence structure isn't perfect or if I've misspelled something its because nothing has been edited. The point is to write as much as possible. Thanks and happy reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death of Fitzgerald&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I took a few steps backwards and leaned forward, bent over double. The bile rose in my throat before I could stop it. I was heaving retching shaking with the pain of trying to throw up without anything in my stomach. I was shaking so hard that my knees felt as if they were about to give up. I closed my eyes but all I saw was the red skin on the back of my eyelids, the same color as the blood. Spots of it swam before me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Someone was screaming and I was sure that it was Fitz, the pain and shock written across his face when he looked down at his bleeding torso is something I’ll never forget. The screaming went on and on but I couldn’t open my eyes. I didn’t want to see what it was doing to him. I couldn’t save him. I couldn’t do anything and I didn’t want to look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Wake up wake up wake up wake up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I repeated it over and over in my head as if it were a prayer. As if it would save me. But the screaming went on and on and I knew I was going to have to open my eyes and look, I knew that I wouldn’t wake up until I saw the whole story. That was the way it had always worked before. So I took a deep shuddering breath, the tears beginning to leak out of the corners of my eyes and I opened them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;But it wasn’t Fitz that was screaming. He lay silent, half his body in the giant fountain and half of it draped over the edge. If it weren’t for the blank stare and blood leaking into the water I would have thought he was just leaning on the edge looking cocky and goofy like he used to when he was younger. But there was no sly mischievous grin playing about his once handsome face. It was pale, eyes staring forward, unmoving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Fitz was dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I grasped my knees and retched again looking at the wounds on his neck and torso. They were torn so deep that they were purple instead of red. They were leaking that purple blood into the water of the fountain where it swirled dispersed and tinted the whole thing a rosy shade of pink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And the screaming, the moaning, the sounds that I thought only Fitz could have been making weren’t coming from him. They were coming from Darius. My eyes widened in shock, my jaw must have dropped when I realized this. Darius was standing over Fitz, looking down at him, grasping the lapels of Fitz’s dirty bloody jacket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“WAKE UP. NO FITZ. PLEASE WAKE UP. FUCK. Please. I…I can’t. Fitz…fucking god…some…someone….”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;He was screaming at the limp body, tears pouring out of him, a desperate aching in his whole posture. He knelt down in the water and the strength seemed to go out of him. His white shirt was sticking to his pale skin, splattered with Fitz’s blood, and with the black inky remnants of Tax. He cried, wailed and shook. He put his fore head against Fitz’s shoulder and leaned on him, whispering something that I couldn’t hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;A much as I didn’t think I could move, I needed to know what he was saying. I had to know if Darius…understood in the end. So I dragged myself upright, feeling as if I had just run a marathon, and took slow measured steps towards the two boys in the fountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;But by the time that I had gotten close enough to hear, Darius had stopped speaking. He was crying on to Fitz, his long fingered hands straightening Fitz’s jacket almost subconsciously. His blonde hair was stained with Fitz’s blood. Whatever Darius had told Fitz, whatever he had said to the corpse he was sobbing over was lost. He hadn’t meant for me to hear. And somehow I thought I knew what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The manor across the expansive yard was burning. I could see the flames licking at the windows, consuming the expensive silk curtains. The smoke was so thick that even from the fountain you could feel it in your throat. I didn’t know how it had caught fire. Maybe the Barron had knocked over a lamp in the struggle. Or maybe Darius had started the fire when he found his father’s body. Maybe he was ready to watch it all burn. The smoke had roused the crows, who cawed frantically from their trees above, the sun was dying on the horizon, casting its last orange rays through the shroud of the burning building. But other than the crows and the quiet sobbing of Darius all was desperately still, muffled. It was as if time had stopped, or as if I was seeing it all through a thick pane of glass. The blood and the violence and the fire burning the pure shock of it all was dulling into a painful ache. They both looked so small.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And as I noticed this, the edges of my vision started to blur and shake. Then everything faded black as if my eyes were becoming tunnels and than fading into blindness. I took a deep breath, tried to steady myself. Then I took another. I opened my eyes and stared up at the worn underside of Killian’s bed, the gray wood stared back down at me. He was snoring and the rain was coming down hard outside. I turned over and looked at my alarm clock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;7:15AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I sat up, grabbed my headphones from where they were hung on the end of the bed and put them on, held my pillow and tried to drift off into that subconscious place that lies between sleep and waking. I didn’t need to get up for another hour, but I didn’t want to have any more dreams tonight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;____________________________&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;Intro to the Magpie (pt 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I walked out of the record store just as the sun was starting to go down. It was raining harder than usual, pelting the ground so hard that each drop disturbed the water that was already coating the dirty sidewalk. I looked up at the dagger-like droplets and smiled, pulling the hood of my jacket over my head and running to the bus stop across the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The bus was warm and dry after the clammy wetness of the street and it wasn’t long before we reached my transfer stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I checked my phone for the time and saw a text message from Killian:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Going out to get Chinese with Blaire. Want us to bring you some?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I smiled and punched in a brief, “No thanks. Have fun.” Before noticing the time and that the next bus wouldn’t be there for a few minutes. I pulled on my headphones and looked around the street as the last rays of the sun clung on to the jagged horizon of the skyline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Across the street were a few nameless shops, without anyone going in or out of them. It was bad weather even by Seattle standards and so most everyone was staying indoors or at least in the warmth of their cars. Everything looked grey and brown under the slate clouds except for one door, squished between a book store on one side and a Chinese food place on the other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The door was bright red, though it looked wine-colored in the fading light, with a little window pane at the top. The sign hanging above the door had a picture of a flying black and white bird and words circling the bird.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;“The Magpie: Coffee, Tea, Conversation”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;There was one small window next to the door, and then it was the window of the Chinese food place and it seemed that the little coffee shop was lost in between.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I looked up and down the street, sticking my head out of the shelter of the bus stop in the hope of finding the headlights of the oncoming bus, but there was no sight of the orange 42 that I was looking for. Instead, I found my eyes drawn back to the little red door across the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;Even through the rain and the sounds of the traffic I could hear a faint tinkling bell as the door of the coffee shop opened. A girl sauntered out pulling the hood of her pea coat up and fumbling with something in her pocket. She stood close to the wall under the short eves trying not to get in the rain. I couldn’t see her eyes but her lips were wide and full and had a smirking, knowing bend to them. She lit up a cigarette, bending over it as in prayer to shield the flame from the wind that whisked up the street. Then she leaned her head back to exhale towards the heaven and I could see a pair of wide, heavy-lidded eyes under her hood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;She noticed me looking at her and smiled, raised a hand in greeting. I waived back, wondering if I was supposed to know her from somewhere. I’d always had a hard time remembering kids from my classes and it was frustrating when someone did something like this and I wasn’t sure whether I was supposed to know her from somewhere or if she was just being friendly. I decided on the latter. On closer inspection (or as close as I could see from across the street) she looked older than me, probably a senior or just out of school. She finished her cigarette, stomping in out under a pair of black Converse high stops with a regretful look on her face. She turned and saluted me again as she pulled the brass handle on the coffee shop door, the bell rang again and she disappeared into the dark indoors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;The street seemed all the more empty without her there. It was as if here mere presence somehow filled the street. I once more stuck my head out of the shelter of the stop and examined the street. There was no glowing 42 on the horizon. And it was freezing, some of the rain was turning to hail, the puddles were beginning to creep up the hems of my jeans and sticking to my ankles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I stared at the little red door that the girl had entered for a few minutes trying to decide what I wanted to do. On the one hand the inside of that coffee shop was probably warmer and more comfortable than the cold metal bench of the bus stop, on the other hand, the bus could come at any moment and I might miss it. I thought for another minute. The bus must be held up because of the weather or a traffic accident. Anyway I would see the bus coming if I sat near the window in the shop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;I decided and ran across the street, the rainwater gutters splashing up on my jeans and making them a darker color. When I got to the other side my steps faltered a bit. For some reason I felt that this decision had much more consequence than catching or missing the bus, more consequence than being dry and warm or wet and cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;And as I turned it, I realized that the brass of the door knob was warm, even though the wind playing in between the buildings was wickedly cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:courier new;" &gt;WORD COUNT TOTAL: 1,902&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-2211162022965035592?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/11/day-one.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-4396826243183390115</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2009 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-10-29T16:42:53.792-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>novel information</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>introduction</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>taxed</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>characters</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>bios</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>november</category><title>a brief overview.</title><description>&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:100%;"  &gt;Okay, I said I'd do a brief plot synopsis and so I will. Its a good way to avoid studying for my Woman's Studies Midterm. I'll see if I can keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Taxed&lt;/span&gt; is the story of Dante Zachary Edwards, a quiet college freshman who has a love of music and history. He attends the University of Washington. He begins, part way through the year, to have strange nightmares/visions of several people including Fitzgerald Curtis Aclin and Darius Trenton Lorrimer. He's particularly worried about these dreams because his mother was committed due to violent schizophrenia. He finds some solace in an eccentric group of friends that he meets at a coffee shop called The Magpie, and with their encouragement and the encouragement of a trusted professor he writes these visions down in a novel that he calls &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Taxed&lt;/span&gt;. Along the way he learns how to embrace his creativity and come to terms with the demons in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next let's do a few characters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul  style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Dante Edwards: Our main character, a short, kind, quiet kid who loves music, coffee, and academia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Darius Lorrimer: The person that Dante sees the most. He's the son of an abusive Barron and both his lack of emotion and incredible grace makes him the subject of intense mystery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Fitzgerald Aclin (Fitz): A high-ranking member of the society that Dante has visions of and an old friend of Darius', his family has fallen from power and he's reduced to being a heroin addict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Race: Another character from Dante's visions. He's a drifter, and he is Fitz's heroin dealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Madison Daily: A spunky recent UW graduate who is the life and soul of The Magpie. It is on her advice that Dante begins to write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Killian Mann: A sophomore student that rooms with Dante, he's an art major and an exchange student from Ireland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Zooey Lancaster: The girl that Dante is interested in. She's an art history major and Dante brings her into his group of friends at the Magpie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Michio Komatsu: Owner of The Magpie, he and his brother moved from Japan when their father died. He's narcoleptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Tsukino (Laurence) Komatsu: Brother of Michio, goes by Laurence because his name is a female name. He is close with Madison, they're housemates. He is a sarcastic, gay college senior majoring in music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Rebekkah Norcutt: A grad student in philosophy who is dating Michio and who has a tendency to talk...and talk...and talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Kipp Merhaut: A japanese language major in Dante's year who often becomes the object of Madison's teasing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:100%;"  &gt;So those are the main characters, I know there are some people that I'm missing and of course there is a lot more to all of them than just what I've written but that should at least help anyone who doesn't know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait for November! Now off to study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:100%;"  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-4396826243183390115?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/10/brief-overview.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-995495265941147023.post-7671272145435060567</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2009 21:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-10-28T15:53:50.519-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>introduction</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>taxed</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>nanowrimo</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>october</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>november</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>dante</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>writing</category><title>introductions.</title><description>&lt;span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:100%;"  &gt;Hey everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So November With Liz is a place for me to post my daily writings from National Novel Writing Month. In case you don't know, National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo, is a contest held each year in the month of November. The goal of this contest is to write 50,000 words in 30 days, around 1,700 words a day. There is no judging at the end of the contest, the goal is just to force yourself to write. It's not about writing perfectly, its about having fun trying to get a story out. At the end, the amount of words tends to equal about 100 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its way more difficult than it sounds, especially trying to work in hours of writing around a full schedule, 18 units, and starting to study for the GRE. But that's the joy of it. It's a challenge and I can't wait to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be writing scenes from my novel&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; Taxed&lt;/span&gt; which has been brewing in my head for around 4 years. Passages will likely be written out of order, and as they come to me. That makes it easier to keep up with my word count and not get too frustrated with minor holes in the plot. This is by no means a finished plot in my head, nor will it be a finished project after it is written here. This is purely to get myself moving on it and to enjoy the process of writing through November. I'll write a brief plot synopsis in the next post so that if anyone is interested in reading my postings they'll have at least something to orient them in the reading. I'll probably do with that a character list as well with some brief descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave me a comment and let me know if you're reading. Let the madness begin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/995495265941147023-7671272145435060567?l=novemberwithliz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://novemberwithliz.blogspot.com/2009/10/introductions.html</link><author>ziggylake@gmail.com (Liz Dunn)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
