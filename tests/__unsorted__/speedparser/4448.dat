<p style="text-align: left;">The boyfriend was off having dinner with a friend and I was hoping to throw something together. I had seen <a href="http://www.cookiemag.com/food/2008/03/spaghetti_omelet">this recipe</a> for Adam&#8217;s Spaghetti Omelet ages ago in a pdf cookbook Cookie magazine (RIP, you&#8217;ll be missed!) sent me. The ingredients are simple and I had the spaghetti left over from Saturday night&#8217;s Chicken Parm dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I used some of the garlic olive oil I had in the cupboard, heated that through and tossed in the spaghetti. As that was heating up, I whisked the eggs, cheese and some italian seasoning and garlic pepper seasoning together. After the spaghetti was heated through (Tinkyada takes a bit longer and is really dense until heated through), I tossed in the egg in, flipping it half way through. Oh, fun way to flip? Put a plate on top like a cover, turn it over, then slide it back in. Saw Giada do it once and it works so well!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While that was working, I decided to make up a bit of protein (well, fat) to go with. Tossed a couple of Italian sausage into a pan, heated them through and added what was left of the jar of Sockarooni. Top a slice of the pasta with the sause and sausage, settle down in front of Good Eats and nom down!</p>

<p>I had some chicken I wanted to use up and while looking into the pantry, it hit me! Chicken Parmesan! The boyfriend loves Italian food and I love it as well, but since going gluten-free, most of my Italian food has been pasta with sauce. Chicken parm would be something new and different, though easy enough to be a good low-key dinner.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had some gf bread crumbs sitting in the cupboard, but if you needed to, I’m sure you could make your own from some gf bread you had hanging around. I grabbed this recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chicken-Parmigiana/Detail.aspx">allrecipes.com</a> (click the link for the original) and added a few tweaks, which I’ll mention as we go.</p>
<p>Chicken Parmigiana (serves 2)</p>
<p>First step, breading and initial bake:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
<li>Kinnikinnick<strong> </strong>Crispy Chicken Coating Mix or gluten-free flour of your choice</li>
<li>1 egg, beaten</li>
<li>Gluten-free bread crumbs (either purchased or home-made)</li>
<li>Some extra seasoning: Italian seasoning, Garlic and Pepper Seasoning, salt and pepper, Parm from a can</li>
</ul>
<p>First thing to do is grab a small baking dish which will fit both of your chicken breasts. Spray it down with some Pam or other cooking oil and set it aside. Pre-heat your oven to 350*F.</p>
<p>This step is pretty basic if you ever learned how to bread things. If not, here’s how! Grab yourself three bowls or plates that you can fit the thing you’re breading in easily. Cover the bottom of the first with your coating mix or flour. Add the egg to the second. In the last, cover the bottom with the bread crumbs. I added some seasoning to help the flavor here as well: garlic and pepper seasoning and some Italian seasoning to the mix, garlic and pepper seasoning to the egg and just Italian seasoning to bread crumbs. I’d also suggest adding salt and pepper to the mix and some canned Parmesan cheese to the crumbs. I’ll be doing that next time for extra yum.</p>
<p>Start by patting the chicken dry. Place it on the first plate and cover all sides in the mix/flour. Brush off your excess and move it to the egg bowl. Coat it in the egg, pick it up, let the excess drip off and then move it to the bread crumbs. Cover with the crumbs and move the chicken to your pre-greased pan. Repeat with the second piece of chicken, then put the pan in the oven for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>After 40 minutes, pop it out of the oven and check for doneness. I don’t care too much about presentation, so I’ll just cut into the thickest part and see if it’s cooked the whole way through. Another way is to slice it and see if the juice runs clear. If it does, you’re good. If not, stick it back in for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Once you’re ready, it’s on to step 2, the second bake:</p>
<ul>
<li>spaghetti sauce (my favorite? Newman’s Own Sockarooni!)</li>
<li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>Cover the bottom of a square baking dish with a bit of spaghetti sauce. Now place your chicken breasts into it. Add a bit more sauce to the top of each breast, then cover in the cheeses. Place it back into the 350* oven for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Around this time, I started up a pot of Tinkyada brown rice spaghetti to serve with. If this is enough carbs for you, it’d be great with a green salad or some spinach.</p>

		<img src="http://www.teawrecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/p_2048_1536_2A823DDA-4A70-49A6-86F2-0D400686DC91.jpeg" width="240" />

<p>I am, quite possibly, the queen of &#8220;tossed together&#8221; cooking, esp. with Italian flavors. For some reason, give me a fridge full of half packs of this and that and I can toss them together into something great. The above is the remains of the one I made this evening (which, yes, I&#8217;m eating out of the Pyrex I mixed it in. It was just little ol&#8217; me!) Pasta lends itself really well to things like this and the pasta I go to over and over is Tinkyada. Not only are the rabbits on the package adorable, they make some fine rice pasta. Tonight&#8217;s dinner was used making:</p>
<ul>
<li>one serving of Tinkyada&#8217;s brown rice spaghetti</li>
<li>one pound ground turkey</li>
<li>some random frozen spinach</li>
<li>a good jarred or homemade tomato sauce</li>
<li>odds and ends from the pantry</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic process is this: assess the situation. You are hungry. Open the fridge. What do you find? This evening I found a pork tenderloin (I was cooking for one. Too long and too much!), mild Italian sausage (had sausage for breakfast. I love pork more than the average person, but twice is too much) and some frozen ground turkey. I chose it. What do I make with ground turkey? Tacos. Eww&#8230; nah. I want&#8230; pasta. So Italian then? OK! Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<p>I started the pasta water (and basically cooked the spaghetti as instructed. That part was pretty easy!) and focused on the meat. Ground turkey can be really dry and bland so I always start the pan with a bit of oil. In this case, I grabbed the garlic-infused olive oil from the pantry, heated that up and added the turkey. I&#8217;m going to assume from here you&#8217;ve cooked ground meat before, so I&#8217;ll be brief: add spices to the meat and cook it until done. I used garlic salt, &#8220;garlic and pepper seasoning&#8221; (basically, garlic powder, salt and pepper) and &#8220;Italian Seasoning&#8221;. Now you&#8217;ll notice something at this point, I&#8217;m sure. Wow, this girl really loves garlic. Yes, yes I do. I&#8217;d go so far as to say (and I have said this, out loud) that I love garlic so much that I find garlic breath a turn on. The only thing I may love more than the flavor of garlic is soy sauce! If you don&#8217;t love garlic the way I do, cut it down to fewer items or try cooking it in a bit of broth or wine. Whatever floats your boat! Remember, this is throw together cooking! Use up that last splash of broth! Add the last swig of V8! Scrape out that tube of tomato paste! And then toss the package into the garbage or recycling and feel proud of yourself for using every last bit (or is that just me?)</p>
<p>At this point, I considered veg. My mom instilled in me from a young age that every meal should have vegetables in it so to this day, I add them to everything: ramen, mac and cheese, Rice-A-Roni, pretty much anything! Basically, junk food is OK if you toss in some veggies. I continue that tradition to this day. Plus, let&#8217;s be reasonable: I knew I was going going to add tomato sauce, but that&#8217;s a fruit! I remembered that I had some frozen spinach in a sad block sitting in the freezer waiting to drop on my toes when I least expected it, so I decided to get it before it got me. After the meat was cooked, I dropped the chunk of spinach in, broke it up and once heated through, we were done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teawrecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/l_2048_1536_9E30621B-7C45-4773-93D8-B6CBF77350AD.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-364" src="http://www.teawrecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/l_2048_1536_9E30621B-7C45-4773-93D8-B6CBF77350AD.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s all preference and ratios. I took the pasta, which finished a bit before the meat, added a bit of butter, some more garlic and pepper and a few shakes of canned Parm (save the good stuff for risotto!) and nuked it for about 30 seconds, just long enough to heat the pasta back up and melt the butter. Stir. Add as much of your meat &amp; veg mix as looks about delicious for you. Add room temp or warmed up sauce (in this case, I used Newman&#8217;s Own Sockarooni, the best goddamn jarred sauce evar) to taste. Stick a fork in it. Twirl. Nom. Repeat until gone. I fully support the idea of eating it out of, say, the Pyrex you warmed the pasta up in, for example, but this would be great date/party food as well. How great will it be when you get all the praises and you can say, &#8220;oh, I just threw this together!&#8221; and you did, you sly fox you!</p>
<p>And now for the bonus round! I&#8217;ve made something similar with chicken! I cubed up the chicken and poached it in just enough broth to cover the bottom of the skillet. Added some zucchini and cooked that until it pretty much fell apart. Then, I added essentially the same spices and the frozen spinach, then tossed in some little pasta shells. The picky boyfriend ate it up and asked for more. If you&#8217;re feeding a less picky person, some added onions or chunked tomatoes would be great too!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a little frightened, and those more accustomed to real recipes could very well be, I say to you, don&#8217;t worry! Use spices sparingly at first and taste often. At this point, I can cook this stuff by sight and smell and you will be too, I promise! For some reason, it always ends up Italian-y in my pan, but I hope to some day get that way with other cuisines, specifically my great love, Asian food. If you happen across other good flavors, or can help me with the Asian flavors, be sure to post them in the comments! Good luck, fellow food adventurers!</p>

		</p><p>One of the things I miss most since going gluten-free has been a lot of my old packaged childhood favorites: Beefaroni, Kraft Deluxe mac and cheese, Big Macs, cheap ramen and, relevant to this post, Rice-a-Roni. This evening was grey, rainy and I wanted nothing more than some beef Rice-a-Roni. For a brief moment, I considered &#8220;glutening&#8221; myself for the sake of it but then I decided it was time to buckle down and try to learn how to make one of my own, gluten-free of course!</p>
<p>A little research showed that a lot of people were using the same recipe: broken spaghetti and rice, butter and broth. The specific ratios which I found <a href="http://www.carriessweetlife.com/2009/06/homemade-rice-a-roni/">here</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup raw angel hair pasta broken into 1/2 inch long pieces (I used Tinkyada brown rice spaghetti)</li>
<li>3/4 cup uncooked long-grain white rice (I used Cal Rose short grain and it was just fine!)</li>
<li>2 cups broth</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
<li>bouillon cube (I used two)</li>
<li>About two shakes each of:
<ul>
<li>seasoning salt</li>
<li>white pepper</li>
<li>onion powder</li>
<li>garlic powder</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, it&#8217;s pretty much the same procedure as standard Rice-a-roni: brown the rice and pasta, add the liquids and spices and cook down. As you can see from the pictures above, I added some frozen peas and carrots (my mom always tried to balance &#8220;junk food&#8221; with some veggies). All things considered: very good and very similar! If you&#8217;re a person who has to or wants to restrict their packaged food, this is a great alternative!</p>
