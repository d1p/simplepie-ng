	<description>The Beautiful Brain Podcast explores the latest findings from the ever-growing field of neuroscience, with particular attention to the dialogue between the arts and sciences. In this monthly program, host Noah Hutton reports on news from the world of brain science, interviews important thinkers about their work, and reviews new literature in the field. The show illuminates important new questions about creativity, the mind of the artist, and the mind of the observer that modern neuroscience is helping us to answer, or at least to provide part of an answer. Instances where art seeks to answer questions of a traditionally scientific nature are also of great interest, and for that reason you will hear from artists as well as scientists on The Beautiful Brain.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/><p>John Goshen just liked to play FIFA.</p>
<p>The videogame, designed in a yearly series by Electronic Arts since 1993, is played by millions of human beings on different home gaming systems and even mobile phones.  Over one hundred million copies have been sold.  Statistics show that most gamers are between 18-49, and male.  Goshen remembers playing a FIFA game for the first time in 2006.  &#8220;It was the World Cup edition,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I played my buddy from down the hall in a best of 101 game series where we chose the teams randomly and you had to drink if you got beat by a team from a different continent.&#8221;  Goshen immediately knew he was a fan.  But did he know that his <em>brain</em> was a fan too?<a href="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/imgres.jpeg" rel="lightbox[3251]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3252" title="imgres" src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/imgres.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the question Andrew and Deidre Schimmelhorn—who are not scientists—sought to answer.  So the Schimmelhorns spent a lot of money on an fMRI machine, which measures change in blood flow related to the cellular activity of the brain.  &#8221;Oh, we just moved some of the furniture around and put it right there in the living room!&#8221; Mrs. Schimmelhorn said.  Then the Schimmelhorns asked 6 subjects—including their son Brent—to participate non-invasive experiment.  &#8221;They told me I was part of a universal phenomenon,&#8221; Goshen said.  &#8220;It sounded sick.&#8221;  The subjects were told that there would be a FIFA tournament following the experiment.</p>
<p>The results were staggering.  It turns out that one hundred percent of subjects experienced increased activity in an area of the brain called the <em>insular cortex</em>, believed to be the seat of speech, language, explicit memory, working memory, reasoning, pain, listening to emotional music, love, compassion, and now FIFA.  &#8221;This area in their brain, sort of in the middle, was like fire,&#8221; Mr. Schimmelhorn described.  &#8221;We Googled it and there seems to be a lot going on.&#8221;  Indeed, the activation was undeniable.  &#8220;I thought <em>I</em> was using my thumbs to control those miniature digital heroes.  But it&#8217;s really my brain, and my brain is totally into it,&#8221; said Toby Warren, 35, a digital consultant.  No matter the interpretation, there is now evidence that some organ in our body is responsible for the best video game ever.</p>
<p>Are all questions answered?  Of course not.  Many still wonder about what else the brain—that shriveled, gray serving of zombie food—may be involved in.  &#8220;I think the brain is maybe part of making the game,&#8221; Mrs. Schimmelhorn said.  The people who made the game were using their brains, just like my son!&#8221;  She added: &#8220;Maybe.&#8221;  John Goshen chose to think more deeply: &#8220;If I have a brain, and FIFA happens in this one part of my brain, then maybe I really love little Ronaldinho, and maybe there&#8217;s a special cell or something for when he scores a goal, and maybe there&#8217;s another cell for when he scores a golden goal, maybe it&#8217;s like a cell made out of gold, and maybe it&#8217;s called <em>the Ronaldinho cell</em>.&#8221;  Researchers cannot yet say that this is impossible, and so the new and exciting field of the neuroscience of FIFA has been born.</p>

K. Pradeep. Wiley, $27.95. </p></div>
<p>We’ve all seen advertisements and commercials that made us smile, laugh and distinctly remember a product, even when we weren’t really sure why. For every company, figuring out how to get more customers to purchase your goods or services seems as much of an art as it is a science. But A.K. Pradeep, Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.neurofocus.com/">NeuroFocus, Inc.</a> and author of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Buying-Brain-Secrets-Selling-Subconscious/dp/0470601779">The Buying Brain</a>”, wants to convince you that successful marketing is the result of fully understanding the fundamental desires of the subconscious brain. In “The Buying Brain”, Pradeep explores the budding field of neuromarketing and describes its current and future applications. While he makes an impassioned case for his approach and clearly articulates the areas in which it can be integrated (from product development to branding, packaging to social media etc.), “The Buying Brain” suffers from a bit too much self-promotion and never really seems to say anything new and revolutionary about the nexus of marketing and neuroscience. More interestingly, however, I can’t help but wonder whether this new field is a good thing. With all the powerful knowledge of how our brains work, I think it might also be worth considering <em>how </em>we deploy these new technologies, what we’re trying to sell with them and who exactly we’re trying to sell to.</p>
<p>Pradeep begins the book by describing some of the methodologies employed by NeuroFocus, Inc. to more accurately and fully measure brain response to different products and images. NeuroFocus, Inc. seems to rely almost exclusively on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG sensors</a>, which allow for instant electrical measurements of brain activity on a fairly global scale (and are significantly cheaper than fMRI machines). The book obviously doesn’t go into extreme detail about the company’s methodology, since it’s a proprietary approach, but I wish that it better described which of the millions of data points they knew to discard from their tests, which data points they knew to keep, and how they extrapolated their conclusions from such a massive amount of electrical activity. Pradeep has quite a bit of “skin in the game” when he describes the approach, since the book presents his company’s own methods, but I would be curious to learn more about other product-testing approaches that rely on fMRI or biometric measurements instead.</p>
<p>The first half of “The Buying Brain” lays out a few different market segments (men, baby boomers, mothers etc.), what sort of brain differences exist between them, and how to best capitalize on those opportunities through strategic branding and messaging campaigns. It’s here that Pradeep tends to play a little fast and loose with gender differences (both social and physiological), but it may be that Pradeep was writing this book more for business people than scientists. The second half of the book then describes the different stages of developing and selling different products to those particular sorts of brains, and that’s where the book becomes more interesting. I found it bizarrely fascinating to learn how each step of a consumer’s unique journey (seeing an advertisement, entering a store, noticing the product on the shelf, deciding to purchase it) was studied, measured and programmed so intensely. It’s not something I’m aware of very often (perhaps a sign of how effective modern marketing has become!), but it was interesting to read about the close relationships between smells, store sounds, font size and a whole laundry list of other attributes that could all be measured, reduced and studied scientifically as part of the “total consumer experience”.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while I learned quite a bit about how neuromarketing is trying to harness some of our recent understandings of the brain, many of the observations in “The Buying Brain” seemed kind of obvious and intuitive: We already know that consumers like simple, clear packaging and we all know how we get overwhelmed in a store when we’re faced with too much choice. Furthermore, I’m not sure that any amount of EEG testing or sample groups will produce iconic, innovative brands like Apple or Nike. The organic production of good artistry and graphic design, in logos, ads and packaging, seems just as (if not more) important in marketing as measuring their effects through sensors.</p>
<p>Finally, I can’t help but wonder whether it’s the best use of our scientific and intellectual capital to learn how to better tailor products to meet our unconscious desires. The subconscious mind is truly a powerful force and not sure that further playing to our base instincts will make us better, more thoughtful consumers. It’s worth remembering that sometimes our natural instincts lead us away from other important issues (eg: what is this product doing to my own health? What is this product doing to the planet?  What message is this product sending to young children?). Perhaps it’s just because I recently watched Morgan Spurlock’s “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1743720/">The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</a>”, but I hope that these breakthroughs in marketing technology are accompanied by a renewed debate over what exactly we’re selling and consuming. My hope is that the market’s best goods and services rise to the top because of their unique value propositions and their thoughtful and positive contributions to the world at large &#8211; not simply because their marketing campaigns tickled our primal brains in the right way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cat-img-bbblog.jpg" width="550" height="50" alt="" title="BBBlog" /><br/><p>Yaron Steinberg has created an installation to show how he imagines his brain.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3231" src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/yaron-steinberg-brain-installation-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>We know about the neurons, the synapses, the neurotransmitters, and some of us have had the privilege of seeing these in person, under the disconcertingly objective lens of a microscope. But to place the idea of thought and emotion with these strangely mundane and tangible elements does not do our brains justice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3233" src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/yaron-steinberg-brain-installation-3-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></p>
<p>Steinberg&#8217;s installation gives us insight into what the artist thinks of his thoughts&#8211;a tightly packed neighborhood that has developed throughout his life, and perhaps a grayness reflecting the dull veneer of neurons and chemicals that hides all the complexity within this community.</p>
<p>But the piece also invites us to imagine what our brains would look like if it could reflect how we think. Is it a green, Swedish field filled with full-bodied aromas, or a city slum where it&#8217;s hard to find redemption? Either way, this imagination-exercise forces a very personal metacognition that one doesn&#8217;t encounter everyday.</p>
<p>For more, see Steinberg&#8217;s <a href="http://yaronart.com/">website</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cat-img-bbblog.jpg" width="550" height="50" alt="" title="BBBlog" /><br/><p>A video has been sweeping the web this week that shows the result of UC Berkeley scientists taking fMRI data, dividing the brain into &#8220;pixels,&#8221; connecting those pixels to thousands of YouTube videos, and generating a novel image that purports to show the subjects&#8217; inner representations of visual stimuli. The setup is crude and the results are not altogether convincing&#8211; but it certainly signals the start of a technology that could one day yield startling results.</p>
<p><object width="250" height="157"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nsjDnYxJ0bo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nsjDnYxJ0bo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="250" height="157" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>In practice, test subjects viewed some video clips, and their brain activity was recorded by a computer program, which learned how to associate the visual patterns in the movie with the corresponding brain activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then, test subjects viewed a second set of clips. The movie reconstruction algorithm was fed 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, which were used to teach the program how to predict the brain activity evoked by film clips. Finally, the program chose 100 clips which were most similar to the movie the subject had seen, which were merged to create a reconstruction of the original movie.</p>
<p>The result is a video that shows how our brain sees things, and at moments it’s eerily similar to the original imagery. [<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/23/scientists-brain-visual-memories/">source</a>]</p></blockquote>

One panel in particular caught our eye: <a href="http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/panel/neuroarts">Neuroarts</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3219" title="Grant_NeuroArts_Image_1" src="http://thebeautifulbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Grant_NeuroArts_Image_1-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="140" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the description from the conference&#8217;s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Philosophies of scale within NeuroArts: from the scale of the single cell to the mesoscopic scale of brain emulations through to emergent large-scale phenomena including self-hood and consciousness. What are the relationships between plasticity, stimulation and firing patterns in small brain circuits? And, how can their adaptation in artistic projects alongside synaptic plasticity, and cellular topologies be exploited to make adaptive art?</p></blockquote>
<p>Very interesting. We only wish we could have attended. If this catches your eye, make sure to check out the paper abstracts from the various presenters featured on the Neuroarts panel at the ISEA <a href="http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/panel/neuroarts">website</a>.</p>
