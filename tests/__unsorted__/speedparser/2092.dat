 <title>Delayed May MoaD - Reason numero dos</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/delayed-may-moad-reason-numero-dos</link>
 <description>In part II of the &quot;why is the May MoaD song delayed?&quot; mystery, we find that it revolves around a particular event. You see, MoaD is going on the RoaD. Sort of. Well, that&#039;s just a kind of lie. But, for real, MoaD is playing live at a show called Breaking Spring, a new band showcase at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL. The show starts at 7pm, doors at 6:30pm. The show is being put on by the fabulous Lay It Down Studios (hit &#039;em up at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:layitdownstudios@aol.com&quot;&gt;layitdownstudios@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/cAMiDn&quot; title=&quot;http://bit.ly/cAMiDn&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/cAMiDn&lt;/a&gt; Join us at the debut MoaD outing! Great tunes, great eats, cool theater... that sounds like a Saturday night to me. AND, of course, we&#039;ll be releasing our new jam, called &#039;kind of lie&#039;. (Yes, I used the word jam. We are going after an 80&#039;s sound, you know. And this, of all MoaD tunes to date, is the most 80&#039;s-enest sound we&#039;ve jammed.)</description>

 <title>Delayed May MoaD - Reason numero uno</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/delayed-may-moad-reason-numero-uno</link>
 <description>So we promised an update with the reasons we&#039;ve chosen to add a &#039;1&#039; in front of the anticipated drop day of the new song (5/15 instead of 5/5). Here&#039;s the dealy... I, Lp, was given the opportunity to test drive several drugs for battling acute sinusitis. All I had to do was get down with the sickness, which I did so well that I was... DOWN with the sickness for about one whole week! This, as you may imagine, was a 7-day speed bump for the band. Though the material was in place and ready to be produced, I could not get to it. However, there is a really good reason, the other reason, why we chose 5/15 as the postponed release date. That reason shall be explained in the next post. Until then...</description>

 <title>&#039;kind of lie&#039;</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/kind-lie</link>
 <description>Hey all you out there... MoaD is due to release a new song. That song is forthcoming (actually it&#039;s fifth coming). And it drops on 5/5!!! Note: the track title is &#039;kind of lie,&#039; and I just told you a kind of lie. In keeping with our 1/1, 2/2, 3/3 theme, the track *should* drop on 5/5. However, for two reasons, MoaD&#039;s May music will be officially released on 5/15, so throw an extra digit in there, will ya? Stay tuned for more deets (and for those two reasons from my explanation).</description>

 <title>Recipe for &#039;the quick win&#039;</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/recipe-quick-win</link>
 <description>100 dB rock,
2 cups post-punk vibe,
1 freakin&#039; slammin&#039; middle 8 section,
2 verses potent lyrics,
handful of sassy vocal delivery,
pinch of synth pop,   
Mix well. Play for 2:40 often. Serves everyone.   
This is the recipe for the next Middle of a Dream (MoaD) tune, dropping 4/4 at a (home) theater near you.</description>

 <title>The next drop is 4/4</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/next-drop-44</link>
 <description>In keeping with the release MoaD (1/1, 2/2, 3/3), the next track will drop 4/4. And, yes, 4/4 is Easter Sunday. That so, we won&#039;t be hosting the usual launch party for this release. We MoaDers will be hanging with family and enjoying the holiday that is Easter. We hope you&#039;ll do the same.
The track will be available at 4:04pm. MoaD will send out the typical link to get you to the song online.
Stay tuned.</description>

 <title>The image is &#039;right there&#039;</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/image-right-there</link>
 <description>DreaMers, I wanted to take a few to discuss the &#039;right there&#039; image.
To begin, MoaD have decided that we will launch one song every month. I&#039;ll discuss this in greater detail in another post. Along with our decision to post up a track each month, we&#039;ve decided to treat each track like a single, complete with artwork that visually accompanies the song. The band is steeped in the fine arts for a variety of reasons. That so, we have determined to pursue artists to create said images or illustrations. Each piece, then, can stand on it&#039;s own merit as a work of art. AND, we have plans for the MoaD art. Again, this is a topic for another post.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://middleofadream.com/content/image-right-there&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>&#039;right there&#039; Virtual Listening Party</title>
 <link>http://middleofadream.com/content/right-there-virtual-listening-party</link>
 <description>So, we are about to launch &#039;right there.&#039; To do so, we wanted to create a virtual listening party through a live chat room. As some of you know, we tried Tinychat last month, and... it appears Tinychat needs to grow up a bit.
We looked around for a bit to find another chat sich that would not require a download or a sign-up. Unfortunately, that&#039;s difficult to find. Meebo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://meebo.com&quot; title=&quot;http://meebo.com&quot;&gt;http://meebo.com&lt;/a&gt;) is browser based, so you don&#039;t have to D/L anything. However, you do need to sign up. Thankfully it&#039;s free.
So if you&#039;re willing, head on over to Meebo and create an account if you don&#039;t already have one. For you iPhone users, Meebo has a great iPhone app (though I&#039;m not certain it works for live chat rooms). Once you sign up, add MoaD as a buddy. Our username is middle_of_a_dream. 
The listening party is official at 9:03pm CST. We will fire up a chat room around 8:45pm or so and invite anyone in our buddy list.
We sure hope you can join us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://middleofadream.com/content/right-there-virtual-listening-party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
