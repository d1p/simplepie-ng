I co-curated an exhibit of Jeff’s work at the Riverside Art Museum in 2009, and Jeff is a good friend, a really generous artist, and a guy who is really blurring many different backgrounds and styles from both traditional painting (whatever that means anymore!) to graffiti and street art, ‘lowbrow’, comix and science fiction, as well as collage and installation. Jeff also makes really cool zines. Jeff lives in Riverside and has a nice studio there. Looking forward to seeing what comes next from Jeff.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9566312511</link><guid>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9566312511</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2011 02:28:15 +0200</pubDate><category>painting</category><category>graffiti</category><category>mural</category><category>riverside</category></item><item><title>Sunday night I visited the Miss Rockaway Armada docked on the...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqecu6V7RQ1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sunday night I visited the &lt;a title="Miss Rockaway" href="http://missrockaway.org/"&gt;Miss Rockaway Armada&lt;/a&gt; docked on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, PA. There was group singing, musical performances, and signed waivers so that we could board and walk around the junk/utopia barges. I first heard about Miss Rockaway perhaps 5 years ago when they built junk vessels and sailed down the Mississippi river. This was my first time seeing them up close and it didn’t disappoint. The collective organizes workshops and parties and ‘solicit dialogue about constructive and subversive ways of living.’ For this incarnation, they received support from the Pew Center For Arts and Heritage through the Philadelphia Exhibitions Initiative. The flotilla was built on Broad Street, towed to a location adjacent to a bridge in the center of the city, and will be deconstructed and placed at the &lt;a title="Miss Rockaway at PAA" href="http://rockawayatpaa.com/"&gt;Philadelphia Art Alliance for exhibition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img height="374" width="500" alt="Miss Rockaway Philadelphia from shore" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6206/6073837285_46112a5605.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reminding me quite a bit of the architecture of burning man, I find a lot of beauty in their ephemeral manifestations. Spending time at art squats in Europe I was continually thinking about the difficulty of establishing and maintaining such a space in the rules-following world of the US. Miss Rockaway is one model of how to create space for community and creativity, but I also think about how it differs as an independent group and how it’s affected when partnering with an arts organization and PEW to receive a grant. Certainly this grant helped them get paid so they can spend time on this project, as well as be able to get a larger audience for what they are doing. At the same time, there are always compromises when accepting money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does it say that a major grant-making organization is helping to fund this? I read this as an indicator of the interest of government and organizations and those with money to support more creative spaces for public engagement and use of the commons. They certainly see this as a way to increase public satisfaction , which they probably link to economic success (for example, see The High Line project in New York City). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s up to us to create more socially engaged creative spaces, and to make them successful. With or without or independent of support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9302529591</link><guid>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9302529591</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 21:58:54 +0200</pubDate><category>Miss Rockaway</category><category>pirate utopia</category><category>grants</category><category>mobile</category><category>TAZ</category></item><item><title>A Young Person's Guide To Hustling In The Arts</title><description>&lt;a href="http://lawrenceenglish.com/post/7443865383/a-young-persons-guide-to-hustling-in-music-and"&gt;A Young Person's Guide To Hustling In The Arts&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;A good read for kidz/adults on the philosophy and grind of trying to make a living while making arts and culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9298761802</link><guid>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/9298761802</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 20:04:47 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title>halfletterpress:

&lt;p&gt;At last, a full length book on these challenging shit-starters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in New York City in the mid-1960s by self-educated ghetto kid  and painter Ben Morea, the Black Mask group melded the ideas and  inspiration of Dada and the Surrealists, with the anarchism of the  Durruti Column from the Spanish Revolution. With a theory and practice  that had much in common with their contemporaries the San Francisco  Diggers, Dutch Provos, and the French Situationists—who famously  excommunicated 3 of the 4 members of the British section of the  Situationist International for associating too closely with Black  Mask—the group intervened spectacularly in the art, politics and culture  of their times. From shutting down the Museum of Modern Art to  protesting Wall Street’s bankrolling of war, from battling with Maoists  at SDS conferences to defending the Valerie Solanas shooting of Andy  Warhol, Black Mask successfully straddled the counterculture and  politics of the 60s, and remained the Joker in the pack of both sides of  “The Movement.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By 1968 Black Mask dissolved into “The Family” (popularly known as Up  Against The Wall Motherfucker—the name to which they signed their first  leaflet), which combined the confrontational theater and tactics of  Black Mask with a much more aggressively “street” approach in dealing  with the police, and authorities. Dubbed a “street gang with analysis”  they were reputedly the only white grouping taken seriously by the Black  Panther Party, and influenced everyone from the Weathermen to the  “hippy” communal movements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This volume collects the complete ten issues of the paper Black Mask  (produced from 1966-1967 by Ben Morea and Ron Hahne), together with a  generous collection of the leaflets, articles, and flyers generated by  Black Mask, and UATW/MF, the UATW/MF Magazine, and both the Free Press  and Rolling Stone reports on UATW/MF. A lengthy interview with founder  Ben Morea provides context and color to this fascinating documentary  legacy of NYC’s now legendary provocateurs.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the places I visited was the Kunsthaus Tacheles (Tacheles Art House), an art squat in the Mitte section of Berlin, Germany. Continuously occupied since February 1990, there have been attempts over the years to evict the art squatters. Today, the building is home to art studios (with artists from all over the world), and until recently a cafe and performance spaces inside and out. The building is covered in graffiti inside and out. Out back, mini shack-like studios were erected, and there was space for performance, and a garden as well with gray-zone (read: unsanctioned) bars. Originally a rougher section of the city, Mitte is now decidedly upscale and the Tacheles property is quite valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properly is legally owned by HSH Nordbank and 2 other banks, who have attempted many times to remove the artists. The bank loaned money to the investor Fundus Group in 2008 to develop the property, and they allowed the artists to stay in the space until construction would begin, but then Fundus group defaulted on the loan, leaving the title to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the eviction pressures, artists inside and outside the building had formed coalitions, but with competing aims. In early April last month, artists based in back of the building and on the ground floor (including Cafe Zapata) who had banded together reached an agreement with an anoymous buyer; they accepted a one million euro payout (wow!) to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlin’s Department of Cultural Affairs is against the eviction of the artists. Last month a 25-foot concrete walls was erected to annoy the artists and probably to prevent new artists from moving into the squat. I visited Tacheles in February this year, about a month before the outdoor/groundfloor artist deal was struck and 2 months before the concrete barrier was put in place. Above you can see a video I shot showing the grounds. I will be very curious to see the future of this space. Although I was not excited by much of the art created onsite, I was inspired by the space itself and the coming together of so many different people.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/5517125018</link><guid>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/5517125018</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2011 20:31:24 +0200</pubDate><category>squat</category><category>travel</category><category>Berlin</category><category>Germany</category><category>eviction</category></item><item><title>The eviction of Kaszino Collective in Budapest
In March this...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ll4d7nFNJU1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eviction of Kaszino Collective in Budapest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March this year (2011!), I visited Kaszino, a collective based out of the old jewish section of Budapest, Hungary in what was originally a jewish-owned Casino (thus the name). My friend Marton told me about the place so I headed over from the Artpool art library where he works. When I arrived I found the residents were in the process of being evicted, with much of their things being placed out on the street in front. I helped them remove their things as they tried to figure out what to get rid of and how to save the rest, and I shot photos between trips carrying out heavy space heaters, yurts and boxes of albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my trip I have visited art squats and collectives, VoKus and pirate spaces, communes and street kitchens - Some are legal, some are entirely illegal, and others are in various states of the gray zone between unauthorized and permitted. In Caszino, the residents had technically paid rent but got into trouble over use of utilities and were being kicked out. This is a loss to the community; I can’t think of many other places that would be offering yurt-building workshops (see photos below), weekly board game sessions, and experimental concerts. In addition to Caszino I visited Firehouse (not sure of the Hungarian name), located in an old fire station and now housing residents, studios, gallery, concert hall, cafe, theater, and boutique artist shops. They worked out a deal with the government to pay utilities but not rent for this huge old building. In exchange for use of the building they renovated the building inside and outside, although it was still covered in street art (not so much graff). The new right wing government wanted to evict the residents and sell the building. They asked for applications to buy the space, but the only people who offered to buy it were the current artist residents. In March, the government threatened eviction and thousands of people showed up to protest in a huge demonstration with stage set up on the street. This demonstration/massing/pressure seems to have worked and the inhabitants of Fire Storage are able to stay for now, though the future remains uncertain and when I visited many of the studios seemed to be temporarily closed (though the cafe remained open). I’ll be posting a video about Berlin’s long-running art squat Kunsthalle Tacheles soon. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been 3 1/2 months and I have about 2 1/2 left. So far I have eaten pizza 40 times. However, I’m in Southeast Asia where pizza is a bit of a rarity, so I may have to do some creative baking and searching if I want to get to 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had good pizza, bad pizza, stuff that isn’t called pizza but resembles pizza and pizza that doesn’t resemble pizza despite its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve photographed 99% of my pizza experiences. Look for a pizza zine at the end of my journey. I am thinking seriously of curating a pizza and/or bread exhibit in Fall 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, Polish pizza (sorry Poland!) is the worst: it resembles garlic bread with sweet ketchup and american cheese. The best pizza I got was in Copenhagen. I had pizza once a day for a week and loved MOTHER’s fine doughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few choice shots randomly selected. The first photo above is from Krakow, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little over a month ago I visited Budapest, Hungary. I went to the fringe fest there, galleries, museums, squats, collectives and a lot of ruin bars (stay tuned for upcoming posts on Caszino collective, other Budapest squats and ruin bars). I also was able to visit the singular &lt;a title="Artpool" href="http://www.artpool.hu"&gt;Artpool&lt;/a&gt; Art Research Center (the website has a  mid-90s style to it with thousands of pages connected to it), a non-profit archive that collects books, pamphlets, music, video, mail art, artist books, invitations, artist’s money and stamps, collections, lists, notes, instructions and lots more. It has particularly strong resources dedicated to mail art and fluxus, Hungarian contemporary art, performance art/happenings, and early video and computer art. Founded in 1979 by Gyorgi Galantai and Julia Klaniczay, the place is thrilling, with tens of thousands of objects. I spent hours poring over documents from John Cage, Raymond Johnson, Allan Kaprow, and many others, as well as listening to sound art and watching video art pieces from their collection. The archive is quite active, and is open for scholars, artists and others who make an appointment to access their archives. Highly recommended. I’ve included photos below which hopefully give a sense of the resources there. One thing I thought a lot about was how Fluxus (and the other aforementioned categories of) artists were engaging in art forms that defy easy exhibition and collection. Ephemeral actions and events occurred and now we are left with writing, and sometimes photo or video. A new form is created: the archive. Reading the original documents transmitted something to me, helped me think through my own art and curating, helped me connect to these artists, informed my own world of art thinking… But it’s also definitely different than seeing these actions live when they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently in Chiang Mai, Thailand and I’ll be traveling in Southeast Asia for at least the next 2 months. I shoot hundreds of photos a day; things like: graffiti, destroyed buildings, street kitchens, squats, pirate radio, confusing handmade signs and questionable market stalls. Send me an assignment and I’ll pick my favorite ones to do, photograph (creating a small series of 8 - 14 shots) and I’ll file a report online here. I’ll mail a postcard to anyone who’s written an assignment I’ve selected, and maybe i’ll send it from Burma, Cambodia or somewhere else. Assignments can be any format, length, style, documentary, poetic or experimental. Example assignments: Track down the best insect-seller in Chiang Mai and try all the grubs and find out which ones are the best; record a film with the fastest tuk-tuk taxi, open a 1-night-only cheesesteak cart and attempt to sell cheesesteaks to Thais. Ok, ok, you get the idea. Email, facebook, or tumblr me with your assignments. No deadline, but send them today: first come, first served.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/5167209742</link><guid>http://leetusman.tumblr.com/post/5167209742</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2011 21:49:09 +0200</pubDate><category>assignment</category></item><item><title>Squats, Social Centers and Autonomous Spaces.
During my travels...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljefie77Du1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squats, Social Centers and Autonomous Spaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my travels in Europe I am actively visiting a variety of collectively organized public spaces including squats, social centers, communes, collectives, co-ops, VoKus and other autonomous spaces. There are no hard and fast definitions here, and these places are quite varied in function, organization and activity. Some of them are residential squats that people live in; they provide free meals of rescued dumpstered food. Others are legalized former squats that are beautifully rehabbed and offer cafes, galleries, radio stations, theaters. There are cooperative restaurant/kitchens (VoKus) and even the huge 800-resident, 41-year old Freetown Christiania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I read the excellent House Magick Zine that went along with the ‘suitcase’ exhibit of House Magick that originated at ABC No Rio and traveled to &lt;a href="http://basekamp.com"&gt;Basekamp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title="University of Trash" href="http://www.universityoftrash.org/"&gt;University of Trash&lt;/a&gt;, among many other places (website &lt;a title="House Magick" href="http://sites.google.com/site/housemagicbfc/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). House Magick Zine 1 can be downloaded &lt;a title="House Magick 1" href="http://sites.google.com/site/housemagicbfc/house-magic-bfc-zine-1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Zine 2 &lt;a title="House Magick 2" href="http://sites.google.com/site/housemagicbfc/house-magic-2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A website with many more resources and artist collectives can be found &lt;a title="Collective A" href="http://collectiva.wikispaces.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These spaces have a long history in Europe and I think that many of us in the US can learn a lot about these spaces, what conditions help them to thrive or shut them down, and what are some of the possibilities for organizing more things like this in the USA. This is the first of many blog posts I’ll be writing about spaces in 5 countries. Many of them have long histories and yet some are still battling for their existence as governments attempt to close down these spaces that operate outside mainstream institutional frameworks. I witnessed this firsthand Sunday as I visited Budapest collective Kaszino as it was being evicted, a sad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following is a preview of some of the posts and photo galleries I’ll be sharing in weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Kommune Karmitz, the 21-year old commune in rural central Germany, I lived on a farm and helped with farm chores. The members of the commune worked together preparing meals, sharing their money, making decisions, making apple juice, baking bread, having discussions, working on anti-nuclear activism, and still go out to alternative bars, community kitchens and social centers for dancing weekly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Amsterdam, I received a tip from Ding Ren about (now-legalized) squat KNM (it houses people, has a gallery/studios, theater/concert hall…) and ate dinner at their VoKu. At this dinner I was befriended by several locals and had excellent conversation and cultural dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Copenhagen I visited social space Stroberiet for a community dinner. I visited one other social center whose name I can’t remember right now, for a huge mega party featuring carnival games, ride-the-bull, noise bands, balkan music, new wave bands, dubstep, and more with maybe 500 or 600 attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Berlin I visited art squat Tacheles, a 21-year old squat that the city has attempted to evict many times. The city scheduled a sale of the building for early April and I have not heard yet or found info online on whether this has taken place yet and its current status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I visited Freetown Christiania, the 41-year old anarchist autonomous village in downtown Copenhagen. I ate there, went to the indoor skate park, talked with locals, sat along the waterfront, had lunch with new friends and attended a hip hop show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Budapest I visited several alternatively organized spaces including a collective being evicted that held workshops and gaming nights, as well as alternatively run social center Fire Storage (this is a translation of its name in Hungarian) that houses a cafe, theater/concert hall, studios and even has residents. It was recently threatened with sale by the government but no one except for the current artist residents offered to buy it!&lt;/li&gt;

I met artist Brent...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljeceko89S1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A studio/artist visit with Brent Wadden&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met artist Brent Wadden via artist/musician Dale Jimenez, a friend of mine from Philly. Brent has been living in Berlin over 5 (6?) years. Brent took me to different galleries and zine/art stores and even some urban exploration (see later blog post) in Berlin, introduced me to his friends, and I did a draw jams with him and a friend on my last night in Berlin. A draw jams seems like a very &lt;a title="Space 1026" href="http://space1026.com"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; thing to do, am I wrong? A draw jam is what it sounds like: you draw, doodle, or make marks - passing papers around, using the marking device of your choice (usually in black and white), all whilst listening to questionable music. Our choice was backed by the chopped and screwed DJ Michael Watt &lt;a title="DJ Michael Watt chopped and screwed" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/11/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-chopped-and-screwed-the-full-album-slowed-down-to-a-cra.html"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of Kanye West’s new album. Enough babble from me. Brent Wadden’s drawing is excellent. His works are in many zines and a bundle of exhibits a year. Here’s some photos of his studio and our drawing jam that night. And his website is &lt;a title="Brent Wadden" href="http://brentwadden.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited Copenhagen a few weeks ago I got to visit &lt;a title="Tryk Tryk Tryk" href="http://tryktryktryk.org"&gt;Tryk Tryk Tryk&lt;/a&gt; prior to its opening. A new and recently-opened space by Louise Hold Sidenius (&lt;a title="at the academy" href="http://attheacademy.org/"&gt;Art and the Academy&lt;/a&gt;), Brett Bloom (member of &lt;a title="Temporary Services" href="http://www.temporaryservices.org/"&gt;Temporary Services&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a title="Lets Remake" href="http://www.letsremake.info/"&gt;Let’s Remake&lt;/a&gt; and art publication online store and imprint &lt;a title="Half Letter Press" href="http://www.halfletterpress.com/store/"&gt;Half Letter Press&lt;/a&gt;), and Bonnie Fortune (her own &lt;a title="Bonnie Fortune" href="http://www.bonniefortune.info/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a title="Let's Remake" href="http://www.letsremake.info/"&gt;Let’s Remake&lt;/a&gt;). It’s a new bookstore, gallery/exhibition space and print shop that just opened March 26. It was beautifully designed to show and sell art publications, and there is a beautiful coffee shop opening inside as well. It’s an inspiring hybrid space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited just prior to the opening, so my photos below show only work in progress, but I find that inspiring as well. I am excited for the many projects and publications and events that will come out of there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I visited the young but huge DOX centre in Prague and saw the substantial exhibit BigMag: Other Magazines in the Czech Republic since 1989. It presents the history of alternative magazines, fanzines and other media in Czech Republic since the revolution, and many of the magazines are hard to find elsewhere. This exhibit presented an archive, a history wall, video and audio and reading stations, as well as readable copies of most of the magazines, a really nice touch that makes the exhibit extremely effective. When I visited a czech news crew were interviewing some of the participants and making a news segment for TV. Excellently curated by Ales Najbrt, Bohumil Vasak and Michal Nanoru. This is a model for any other institution attempting to present mainstream or alternative print media in an accessible, well-designed and user-friendly fashion. Many photos below. A huge online archive in Czech and English can be found &lt;a title="Big Mag online archive" href="http://www.bigmag.cz/?lang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Copenhagen is a city of...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liie8cvcSq1qb45dro1_400.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report on the Copenhagen graffiti scene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copenhagen is a city of 1.5 million, a walkable, bikeable, public transit-riding city. Like Berlin, graffiti is prevalent, with tags, throw-ups and pieces. Caught a few taggers getting up and the enthusiasm was widespread. In America, writers generally avoid writing on housing in favor of public property (an exception would be found in Frisco where apartment buildings, for example in the Mission district, are considered socially acceptable to write on). Many people not active in graffiti are unaware of the socially-determined graffiti rules, almost like rules of engagement. In general, I found Berlin and Copenhagen to flagrantly violate the rules that American writers follow. People do follow the protocol that pieces can go on top of throw-ups, which can go on top of tags, but dissing other writers is way more common than in the US, and writers don’t seem to get caught up on whether they’re writing on public space or on private houses or apartments, maybe because they see those as public space as well. I’m reminded of a photo series in art collective &lt;a title="temporary services public phenomena" href="http://temporaryservices.org"&gt;Temporary Services&lt;/a&gt;’ book &lt;a title="Public Phenomena" href="http://www.halfletterpress.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=11"&gt;Public Phenomena&lt;/a&gt; where they show in several photos how Americans create signs saying “Free” to place next to things in their yard (chairs, couches, firewood) to show that it is acceptable to walk over into the unfenced yard to take those things. In Europe and the rest of the world, that message is unneeded, understood. I asked some Berlin writers and they didn’t see a distinction on where it was okay to write. But then they also thought it was bad form to write on the sidewalk, which is socially-acceptable and even a part of the practice on the west coast of the US. Another distinction can be found on the prevalence of tagging inside buildings. In the US, that is primarily only found in certain bathrooms, and usually of restaurants or cafes around hip communities in the big cities and some other places. In Europe, I found it was generally accepted that walls inside buildings are in play. This was true in Copenhagen, and especially around the social centers (semi or officially legalized squats) and Freetown Christiana, two places I will write about in future blog posts. Another thing I noticed: huge throw-ups or pieces on the big expensive trains in the metro, which you almost never see in the US. Some might say this is due to “Clean Trains” rules in the US, but I think (possibly falsely) that American graffiti rules generally dictate that you don’t write on big expensive new things. Europeans seem to ignore that rule in some ways; Kobenhavn writers are serious. I spotted AMAZE and TWIST tags in one spot downtown, but no other americans. In general, you can see things on every street, wall, apartment building, inside metro and train stations, and along the highways and roads. An active city indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

In short: the graffiti scene...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lii3zn9kmQ1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report on Berlin’s Graffiti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: the graffiti scene in Berlin is thriving, one of the most active places for graffiti in the world. There are an abundance of styles, almost all walls in the city are marked, and people do try to go all-city. I was also surprised by the presence of graffiti in richer neighborhoods and the sheer abundance of tagged surfaces (doors, walls, and subways). I spotted a few Americans (Miss 17, Rime, Ribity, among others), and generally found the action exciting, beautiful, grimey, and well-tolerated. Certain crews predominated, such as 1UP (their roll-downs are divine). Couldn’t find a single streak in the city, no sidewalk tags, and sure, i guess the scene was heavier 2 years ago, but this is a city for graffiti tourism. If you’re going to visit the city, no specific tips needed. You can see it anywhere, everywhere. Some of my favorites in the Neukolm and Kreuzberg neighborhoods, and massive pieces all over the S-Bahn system. But really, you can’t walk more than a few feet without seeing massive amounts of painted surfaces. Ups to eman and krag, and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Wikipedia page on Provo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo_(movement)"&gt;Provo&lt;/a&gt; was an Amsterdam-based anarchist political, social and art movement in the years 1965-67 that profoundly influenced anarchists, situationists, hippies and radicals through the end of the 60s in many countries and for decades beyond their short existence. The Provo activists created many provocative public political spectacles and street theater, published publications and pasted posters up in public. They created happenings, organized direct action, published a magazine, and provoked the police. They published a manifesto, won a seat on city council, interrupted the wedding of the dutch royal monarchy, and published white plans, a series of proposals to address social problems in Amsterdam. These included their famous White Bicycle Plan (a plan to close central Amsterdam to vehicles and have the city purchase 50,000 bicycles to be left unlocked for anyone to get around the city). Other plans dealt with contraception, the direct election of policemen, car-sharing, pollution, auto accident deaths, squatting and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition at W139 is unique. One of the members of Experimental Jetset, Marieke Stolk, is the daughter of Provo co-founder Rob Stolk. At the exhibition talk I attended, Marieke spoke about her (now-deceased) father and his transition from Provo to a professional printer. Influenced by American journalist A. J. Liebling’s statement &lt;em&gt;Freedom of the Press is for those who own one&lt;/em&gt;, Stolk first became a printer because he could find no one else to print his radical publications. Over the following decades he transitioned from an activist publisher to a prolific printer responsible for cultural prints and publications throughout Amsterdam and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition consists largely of hundreds of posters, magazine pages, manifestos, photos and ephemera collected by Marieke that document Provo’s activity through her father’s publications. Color-copied and simply taped to the wall, they are arranged in clusters, with color-coded tape. A pamphlet distributed at the show and possibly available on Experimental Jetset’s website (though I couldn’t find it) explain the groupings and what the objects are. I took dozens of photos and then my phone/camera died; these 3 images, including the one with two Experimental Jetset members and W139 Director Tim Voss, survived by being posted on facebook. And the gallery W139 has posted a &lt;a title="W139 Provo exhibit images" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=56181&amp;id=173723492639100"&gt;small image gallery&lt;/a&gt; on their facebook as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t see the exhibit in person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of information can be found &lt;a title="Provo on Experimental Jetset" href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/provo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Experimental Jetset’s site, with links to many images and articles on Provo. There is an excellent English-language book &lt;a title="Provo: Amsterdam's Anarchist Revolt" href="http://www.akpress.org/2006/items/provoamsterdamsanarchistrevolt"&gt;Provo: Amstedam’s Anarchist Revolt&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Kempton, published by Autonomedia and distributed by AK Press.&lt;/p&gt;

I lived in southern California 5 years and owned a car for only 1 of those years. I do believe a world with less cars is possible and practical and doable. So I’ve been particularly excited this year to visit the bike mecca of the world: Amsterdam, Netherlands. I also visited Portland 3 months ago, and will be going to Copenhagen, Denmark next week. (Along with the slightly lesser bike cities of San Francisco, Berlin and let’s not forget Black Rock City - Burning Man). I think there’s a lot to learn from these cities’ examples. In Fall 2010 I showed photos and video in the inaugural exhibition &lt;a title="Re:Cycle - Bike Culture in Southern California" href="http://www.sweeney.ucr.edu/exhibitions/recycle/"&gt;Re:Cycle-Bike Culture in Southern California&lt;/a&gt; in the new Culver Center at University of California, Riverside, featuring artists and collectives exploring and advocating the restructuring of the urban environment through a bicycle-based transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the exhibit, Curator Tyler Stallings interviewed me in a &lt;a title="Lee Tusman bicycle Re:Cycle podcast" href="http://www.sweeney.ucr.edu/exhibitions/recycle/action.lasso?-search&amp;-database=exhibitions_SAG&amp;-table=online&amp;-op=cn&amp;event_object_ID=2010.0009.0004&amp;-response=exh_audio_01.lasso"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; you may be interested in listening to as well. It’s an extensive interview about my bike background, my photography approach, shooting with large format versus shooting with a cell phone on a bike, lofi photography tricks on the bike, how I explore abandoned warehouse areas, and much more…in short, if you’re interested in my photography, take a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

Karmitz is a...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhjql2fJrM1qb45dro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m at kommune Karmitz in Karmitz, Germany. Karmitz is a tiny village with about a dozen houses, maybe 30 or 40 people total (10 of them live at the commune). This is an anarchist commune about 2 hours west of Berlin, in the middle of nowhere. Gorgeous countryside. Forests. Dirt paths. Fields of wheat. 19th century farm houses. Cows. Chickens. Kommune Karmitz is 21 (!) years old; the residents range in age from 31 to well into their 60s. Many past members of the commune live nearby. Sometimes they come by to talk, to help out on the farm, to trade or borrow food. The commune raises chickens, they have 3 cats, a dog, a cow (about to give birth any day now), several huge gardens, apple orchard, juice factory, solar panels, a wood shop, bike/metal shop, several buildings, and dozens of rooms for apple juice, wine, vinegar, silverware, wood, old bikes, lots of old farm equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commune makes its income from apple juice. There are many varieties, by apple breed, as well as mixes (for example, their celery-beet-apple juice is amazing, and the peach-apple juice is heavenly). There is a bakery on site and they bake bread weekly. They eat it themselves and also trade and sell it to neighbors and a voku (community kitchen, like a squat-kitchen-restaurant, if you’re not familiar). Once a year they have a huge pizza baking festival to raise some money as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of Kommune Karmitz are active. They and their friends (3 other communes and a co-op are nearby; and many dozens or hundreds of activists live within 30km) organize many protests against the proposal to build nuclear waste storage out here. Two people have a semi-weekly punk and protest radio show. At home, there are many anarchist and radical books to be found. They have a large library with perhaps 2000 books. One night i noticed on their kitchen table where they leave each other notes a new book on american anarchism post-Seattle 1999 with a note affixed that said it was for everyone at the house to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested in how the commune works and what people do with their time. People wake up between 8 to 9:30. They have breakfast (almost all food, including the cheese is grown and prepared on site). Afterwards, most go to do a task, like chopping wood, feeding animals or pruning apple trees. Roles are rotated often. They share all income and expenses. There are weekly discussions of finances, actions, feelings, work, etc. Each day a different person is cook and dishwasher. There is rest time too. They are their own boss. For example, after lunch today Rossi fell asleep in his chair and dozed for an hour or two. Other times people take time off to read, or to take a small trip somewhere, or to smoke or to eat or to do whatever they may need or want to do. But they are also hard workers. Chopping wood and farm work all day are not the easiest tasks. I’ve pitched in with chopping wood this past week and I’m a bit sore. Today I was on kitchen duty, but I took off for the afternoon. Tomorrow I’ll try my hand in the bakery. One day we went to gather sand from a mountain and afterwards we spent 30 minutes looking for fossils. At night around 5 or 5:30 or 6 is dinner. Everyone comes together and eats the delicious, filling food. Afterwards, people talk, read, or go out. This week I went to a kitchen night at the co-op, a dance party at a club/cinema in a bigger village nearby, and to an anniversary party for a commune that just turned 1 year old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more I can and will write about. I intend on doing a longer piece and publishing my photo series and interviews either here or in some magazines. In the meantime (and while my film is still being processed) I’ve posted 2 photos by &lt;a title="Nicola Berger" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nikolaberger/"&gt;Nikola Berger&lt;/a&gt; as well as my recordings from washing dishes today and chopping wood yesterday. Lofi field recordings made on a borrowed mp3 player while my devices are in the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

I purchased it, my first car, on my birthday in 2009, and sold it when I drove up to San Francisco at the beginning of my trip in November 2010. I called it the Vanagallery and operated it as a mobile art space with guerilla concerts, roving exhibits, really really free markets, as well as a temporary shelter. It had a bed and plenty of room for blankets, bikes, etc. I was sad to leave it behind. Last week in Amsterdam I stumbled upon these three Swiss travellers in their broken down Van. The clutch wasn’t engaging. They called a repair service and a newer vw van showed up. In the middle of uploading, my iphone completely died, so I didn’t have as many photos to choose from here. Anyway, below you can Gabriel, Remy and Peter and their VW T2, as well as the repairman they’re negotiating with. We exchanged some ideas for a while (they were stuck without the part they needed and would be delayed at least 5 days) but ultimately I took my leave. And now I’m in Berlin photographing the millions of varieties of able workhorse VW Vans.&lt;/p&gt;

John and Monte (my friend and studiomate who passed away last week) lived several blocks from our warehouse/studio. I worked at a museum about 6 blocks away and often visited the studio during lunch or after work. In 2008 during the surge of the recession, I did an informal count and it seemed that about 1 in 7 houses downtown were foreclosed upon in Riverside. In an alley about 2 blocks from the studio we found a trove of photos scattered, probably from a repossessed house’s displaced items. John, Monte and I collected the photos and at John’s urging, we placed them in an alcove in the unused freight yard behind our studio, next to a busy street so that drivers could see them. There was also a small homeless community that used the abandoned rail line to get from downtown to the shelter. I don’t remember if John spoke about his intentions for the project but for me it was a simple gesture to make a memorial of people and hidden lives from our neighborhood during heavy trauma from the recession. We didn’t know if people would stop to look at the photos, take them, or even who exactly was the audience. The photos stayed up several days and then disappeared. About one year later I started a similar project myself near my apartment to post my photos, primarily shot in Riverside, and post them on light poles in a frequented intersection about 2 blocks from my apartment. Early photos stayed several days or up to a few weeks, but slowly the photos would disappear. I’d like to think that it was fans of my work that took them. I continued to add several photos a week until I left at the end of October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are photos of one of the lightposts I posted on, as well as some photos of the recession in Riverside in 2008. There area looks largely the same. I have many more photos.&lt;/p&gt;
