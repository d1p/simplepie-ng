			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Purple-Flag-Twilight-Walk-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Purple Flag Twilight Walk" title="Purple Flag Twilight Walk" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;clear:right;" /><p>Nottingham’s Purple Flag Week has been hailed as a success, receiving praise on both a local and national level.<br />
 <br />
The week-long celebration (19-25 September) was designed to highlight the city’s retained Purple Flag Status, which means Nottingham is deemed to be a safe, clean and varied place to visit at night.<br />
 <br />
As well as special offers at bars and restaurants across the city centre, key buildings such as the Council House were illuminated in purple and Purple Flags were flown in the Market Square and from the Castle.<br />
 <br />
The week concluded with a Twilight Walk around the city, which was started with a rousing speech about Nottingham by former Notts County legend Michael Johnson.<br />
 <br />
With more than 100 members of the public joining in, the event featured entertainment stops along the route, with performances from local Samba drummers, circus performers The Company Contrary, the Gospel Revival Centre Choir and the Caribbean Carnival Queens. The walk also helped to raise vital funds for the Street Pastors scheme, which offers help and support to those in need in the city centre at night.</p>
<p>Nottingham’s retained Purple Flag Status is down to a collaborative effort from key partners, including: We Are Nottingham Leisure, Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire Police, Nottingham Businesses Against Crime and the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership Team.<br />
 <br />
Commenting on the success of Purple Flag Week, Sylvia Oates, chief executive of We Are Nottingham Leisure, said:<br />
 <br />
“The whole idea of Purple Flag Week was for the community to join together to show that we’re proud of our city and the great variety that we have on offer in the evening.<br />
 <br />
“It’s been heartening to hear so many people talking about Nottingham in such a positive way and we’ve heard from lots of people who’ve used Purple Flag Week to go and try something different in the city, whether that be a new bar and restaurant, a cultural venue or activity such as ice skating or bowling.”  <br />
 <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Sherwood-through-the-Ages-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Sherwood Forest through the Ages" title="Sherwood Forest through the Ages" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;clear:right;" /><p>This weekend on Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 October, Sherwood Forest Country Park will celebrate the history and heritage of this world famous place by hosting a ‘Sherwood through the Ages’ event.</p>
<p>Forever associated with Robin Hood, <a title="Sherwood Forest" href="http://www.experiencenottinghamshire.com/site/sherwood-forest">Sherwood Forest</a> has a played an important part in history, much broader than in medieval times. From Copper Age man to the Romans, Saxons and Normans, you’ll get the low down on life in the early forest. You’ll also find a strong military presence as the region was central in the English Civil War and even modern army training.</p>
<p>This weekend, there’ll be re-enactors demonstrating shelter building, period costumes, cooking, combat displays, have a go archery and military displays with many things to see and do.</p>
<p>Take the timeline trail from the visitor centre to discover 14 periods of Sherwood Forest’s history. Taking you on a one mile circular route from the main facilities down to the famous Major Oak and back again, the different historical themes will decorate the route as you make your way around. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>shelter building by Copper Age man</li>
<li>Roman, Saxon and Norman traditional camps</li>
<li>Civil War soldiers</li>
<li>18 century music and highwaymen</li>
<li>military displays and re-enactments</li>
<li>stalls selling medieval bracelets, beads and toy bows and arrows</li>
</ul>
<p>The event, now in its sixth year, has a developing reputation, attracting over 4,000 visitors last year. It’s a welcome celebration of the forest’s history which is much more than Robin Hood.</p>
<p>The 450 acre country park and National Nature Reserve is also a Site of Specific Scientific Importance (SSSI) given the special habitat that the ancient oak trees create for wildlife. It’s carefully managed by Nottinghamshire County Council and Natural England.</p>
<p>The massive major Oak itself is estimated to be over 800 years old and many more of some of the oldest trees in Europe can be found on the reserve.</p>
<p>The once mighty forest stretched from Nottingham to Worksop and over the years this has meant the fragmentation of woodland areas and country parks.</p>
<p>This emerging event is super way to unearth the great history of Sherwood Forest and celebrate a living English legend.</p>
<p><strong>Sherwood Forest Country Park, Edwinstowe, 1-2 October 2011, 11am to 4pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Free event (car parking charge £3)</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hodsock-Priory-PJan10External-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Hodsock Priory" title="Hodsock Priory" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;clear:right;" /><p>Do you ever dream of escaping the office and getting out into the fresh air? Do you ever find yourself thinking that the meeting you’re in could be more productive? Well it seems that you could actually be right.</p>
<p>Recent published research suggests that taking your meeting, conference or corporate event outdoors could lead to better outcomes.</p>
<p>The line is that we humans are apparently able to process more information when we’re on our feet and even walking side by side, rather than facing each other. By removing the confrontational face-to-face position we are more likely to offer honest feedback and be more open in our discussions.</p>
<p>Hodsock Priory an events and <a title="conference venue" href="http://www.experiencenottinghamshire.com/site/conference-venues">conference venue</a> in the very north of Nottinghamshire and in the heart of Sherwood Forest, has seen first-hand how corporate events taken outdoors have grown in popularity.</p>
<p>“We have been hosting superb quality weddings and meetings since 2005 and with a little investment recognised that we could expand our portfolio to accommodate more guests,” said George Buchanan, General Manager at <a title="Hodsock Priory" href="http://www.hodsockpriory.com">Hodsock Priory</a>.</p>
<p>“Our 800 acre estate provides the perfect corporate playground for outdoor meetings, breakout sessions and a variety of outdoor pursuits such as clay pigeon shooting or archery. Our indoor meeting facilities allow between two and sixty delegates and conference and training days for up 160 in theatre style setting with full catering and overnight accommodation available in one of ten luxury suites at The Courtyard.”</p>
<p>One of the popular activities that George mentioned is the ‘The Hodsock Challenge’ – developed to encourage teamwork and broader social skills in the great outdoors. This new product is proving a hit due to its cost efficient way of promoting teamwork and encouraging communication.</p>
<p>One recently satisfied customer was household, health an personal care company Reckitt Benckiser who held a two day conference at Hodsock.</p>
<p>Beverley Towle from Reckitt Benckiser said, “All the team thoroughly enjoyed Hodsock and enthused about the stunning surroundings, facilities and homemade cakes! We shall not hesitate to host further events at Hodsock and many members of the team are looking forward to returning socially in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Next time be honest and take that meeting to the great outdoors for a far healthier and more productive experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cyclists-in-fields-Low-Res-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Cyclists in fields - Low Res" title="Cyclists in fields - Low Res" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;clear:right;" /><p>Local entrepreneur James Blick is calling on residents across the East Midlands to get involved in a very special charity cycle event on 9<sup>th</sup> October, raising money for CHECT, the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust. </p>
<p>CHECT is an outstanding charity, fighting to find a cure for Retinoblastoma and other related cancers which affect approximately 1,500 children each year. In 2003, James’ seven month old son, Jacob was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.  After a heart wrenching course of chemotherapy, numerous check-ups, hospital visits and minor operations, Jacob thankfully recovered from the disease, however many children are not as lucky.</p>
<p>“It is the least I can do, as I am in belated awe of the nurses, staff and all the work the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust do everyday for so many children suffering from such a terrible disease”</p>
<p>On Sunday 9<sup>th</sup> October 2011 join James and his team for a cycle ride across the heart of theEast Midlands. Cyclists will weave their way through Castle Donington, Nottingham, Belper and Derby, covering three counties and approximately 50 miles of the very best the East Midlands has to offer. </p>
<p>The journey will begin at 8am at Donington Manor Hotel in Castle Donington. Those taking part will be greeted with hot drinks and a bacon roll, giving them much needed energy before they set out on their trip. </p>
<p>Stage one follows the River Trent and The Nottingham Canal to the coveted <a href="http://www.experiencenottinghamshire.com/site/where-to-stay/lace-market-hotel-p350611#productlist=/site/where-to-stay/lace-market-hotel-p350611&amp;proxprodtype=attr">Lace Market Hotel in Nottingham</a>, a popular inner city social hub.  As cyclists prepare for their next stretch they will be treated to light refreshments in the Lace Market’s Cock &amp; Hoop pub.</p>
<p>After a short break, the team will trek on to The Lion Hotel, situated in the picturesque town ofBelper. This two hour ride will allow cyclists to take in beautiful views of the Peak District, as they look forward to the afternoon tea that awaits them.</p>
<p>Stage three involves an uphill climb to Cathedral Quarter Hotel in Derby, before returning back to Donington Manor Hotel for a glass of bubbly or pint to celebrate.</p>
<p>A place in the event costs just £35 per person and all profits go to CHECT.</p>
<p>For more information on The Finesse Collection please visit <a href="http://www.thefinessecollection.com/">www.thefinessecollection.com</a> or <a href="http://www.chect.org.uk/">http://www.chect.org.uk</a> for information on Childhood Eye Cancer Trust.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="http://news.experiencenottinghamshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Purple-Flag-Charity-Walk1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Purple Flag Charity Walk" title="Purple Flag Charity Walk" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;clear:right;" /><p>Pull on your walking shoes this Friday to celebrate the Nottingham’s Purple Flag Status and raise funds for a vital night time support service.<br />
 <br />
The Twilight Charity Walk will take place on Friday 23 September and form part of Purple Flag Week (19-25 September), helping to demonstrate community support and pride for Nottingham at night.  <br />
 <br />
The weeklong celebration has been planned to highlight the fact that, once again, the city’s night time offering, and efforts to continually improve cleanliness and safety, have been deemed to be amongst the best in the country.<br />
 <br />
If you’d like to take part in the walk, meet by the left lion in Old Market Square at 8pm on 23 September and wear purple. You will be joined by a host of musicians and entertainers on a route around the city, designed to showcase the cultural and leisure offerings available after dark.<br />
 <br />
The event will also be used to collect donations for the Street Pastors scheme, which is a charitable initiative that offers help and support to those in need in the city centre at night.<br />
 <br />
“We’ve arranged the Twilight Charity Walk to bring the community together and celebrate the great offering that Nottingham has at night,” commented Sylvia Manser, Chief Executive of We Are Nottingham Leisure, one of the key partners involved in the city’s Purple Flag status.<br />
 <br />
“This is about people joining forces to show what a vibrant place the city is in the evening and to raise some much needed funds for the Street Pastors at the same time. They do a great job and were an important part of the whole Purple Flag Status process.<br />
 <br />
“I would urge anyone that wants to support our city to come and join in the fun on 23 September and I know that many of the bars, restaurants and venues across the city will be providing special offers and discounts to those taking part as a way of saying thank you.”  </p>
<p>Other highlights of Purple Flag Week (19-25 September) include a celebration of Nottingham’s cultural talent at the Broadway Cinema, special offers in bars and restaurants across the city, Purple Flags flying in Market Square and from the Castle, and key city centre buildings, including the Council House and Cornerhouse, illuminated in purple.<br />
