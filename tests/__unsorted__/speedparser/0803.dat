Admittedly this is because a version of the title track was realised as a bonus on the reissue CD of the second Buggles album &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0033QEUGI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0033QEUGI" target="_blank"&gt;Adventures In Modern Recording&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first thing that strikes me is how nice is it to hear Benoit David putting his own voice to the songs. Not that he doesn’t do that to the other Yes songs played in concert, but comparisons will always be made so it’s good to hear “his” voice if you understand what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole album has a very “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00009Z576/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00009Z576" target="_blank"&gt;Drama&lt;/a&gt;” feel about it for obvious reasons, and David’s voice is certainly similar to Horn’s. Having made that comparison the album also has a fresh feel to it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The five part Fly From Here suite (six if you count the overture) is unmistakably the highlight of the disc. A modern take on classical pieces with recurring themes and a fairly epic feel. It manages to be a lengthy piece that not only has the full and rich arrangements you expect from both Yes and Trevor Horn but also has moments so catchy that they live on in your head after you’ve finished listening. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first track after the suite (The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be) seems fairly ordinary, possibly simply in comparison with what has gone before. In fact a lot of what follows, although still expertly executed, is eclipsed by the suite. Hour Of Need is quite catchy with a modern folky feel and Into The Storm rounds the album off very well indeed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to hearing whatever gets played of this album on the tour when I see it in November. It already feels familiar and that’s only after two complete plays. I’m fairly sure it will get a few more airings on the media player between now and the gig, and afterwards obviously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;t=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;o=2&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as4&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;ref=ss_til&amp;amp;asins=B004Y1USJE" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;Just the CD&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;t=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;o=2&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as4&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;ref=ss_til&amp;amp;asins=B004Y1USV2" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;CD with DVD (Making of Fly From Here)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;t=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;o=2&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as4&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;ref=ss_til&amp;amp;asins=B0053XDPQK" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;MP3 Download &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-8359816266554635568?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/8359816266554635568/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/07/yesfly-from-here.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/8359816266554635568'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/8359816266554635568'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/07/yesfly-from-here.html' title='Yes–Fly From Here'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-6015662093881554278</id><published>2011-07-03T07:22:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2011-07-03T07:22:53.197-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Five Songs–Mid summer edition</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s quite simple – list five songs, preferably accompanied by a word or two explaining their significance.&amp;#160; Not your five greatest songs of all time, but five songs you’re really into at the moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As ever this was prompted by Tim at his &lt;a href="http://www.kalyr.com/weblog/" target="_blank"&gt;blog over here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00564Q7E8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00564Q7E8" target="_blank"&gt;Dreaming In The Sun – The Wombles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m in a very Wombles frame of mind, posts will follow as I go through the rereleases. As I’m writing this entry out in the garden and yesterday I did actually grab 40 winks out here in the sunshine, so it seems an apt tune to rattle around in my head in this weather.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001WIRDCW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001WIRDCW" target="_blank"&gt;Mr Blue Sky – ELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bit obvious I know, but this isn’t just because of the nice weather, it’s also because I had a dream where I rewrote all the lyrics, but the only bit I could remember when I woke up was “making solenoids for Rover”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/hfHIhlMIX9E" target="_blank"&gt;Lady Luck – Honeybug&lt;/a&gt; (link leads to YouTube video)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This has been rattling around in my head since International Pop Overthrow Liverpool last May. Catching and made entirely of awesome, I find myself dancing to this one every now and again. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001JYABNC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001JYABNC" target="_blank"&gt;Absolute Beginners – David Bowie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a recurring visitor on the jukebox in my head.

Sounded like a win-win situation to me. Some good songs in one of my favourite venues...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was sold out, but I didn't realise quite how loud the audience could be. They sang along, applauded and whooped between songs all at a volume usually reserved for vast arena crowds. And that was great, you really should so your appreciation. However, when during the second part of the show a minority in the audience just talk loudly, shout and chant so the artist can't be heard and whistle continuously and&amp;nbsp;inappropriately&amp;nbsp;through out a song, I'd really rather not be in the same room as you. &amp;nbsp;I really felt for the poor stewards who were verbally abused when trying to get one bloke to get down off his mate's shoulders, and then had to scrabble on to the stage when the very same chap leaped on there and grabbed the microphone at the end of the gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OnhidP0VW_o/TepGlNICRXI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EZLEZkzeBGE/s1600/009.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OnhidP0VW_o/TepGlNICRXI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EZLEZkzeBGE/s200/009.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) SisterBluebird.co.uk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The negative feelings I got due certain audience members were certainly pushed aside by the music though. Roger has a lovely voice, sadly the sound seemed to be adjusted for the ambient noise and ended up sounding like he was singing in a empty warehouse a lot of the time rather than it echoing beautifully around the Philharmonic Hall. Still I've been to gigs where the sound was worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setlist seemed to satisfy the audience. Plenty of tunes that even the most casual of music fan would know, coupled with a good few that certainly pleased the person sat to my right, who was having a whale of a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger moved between a keyboard, the guitar and a grand piano depending on the song and his band were all excellent musicians. &amp;nbsp;Highlights for me were Take The Long Way Home, Hide In Your Shell, his version of Across The Universe (so refreshing for the obligatory Beatles cover not to be one of the usual suspects) &amp;nbsp;and Dreamer. All delivered with quiet display of modest talent. (That's to say he was modest about it.) He looked moved by the vast outpouring of affection for those in attendance, though he did have to quieten them down in order to be heard when he wanted to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xQIW1K8I0rQ/TepGmaEfnEI/AAAAAAAABQU/lgC867-quNI/s1600/022.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xQIW1K8I0rQ/TepGmaEfnEI/AAAAAAAABQU/lgC867-quNI/s200/022.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) SisterBluebird.co.uk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to redress the balance against the audience, for probably the first time ever at a gig, the bloke who was sat in front of me turned around and asked if he was blocking my view because he was taller than I was. He wasn't, but how nice and considerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the minority of "overly appreciative" - for want of a better&amp;nbsp;euphemism - fans and those who were just down right rude and gabbed all the way through it, aside, it was a really good gig and will probably result in me investigating further into Supertramp and his solo stuff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set list &lt;br /&gt;(taken from the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/rogerhodgsonofficial"&gt;Roger Hodgson Official Face Book Page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Take the Long Way Home&lt;br /&gt;School&lt;br /&gt;In Jeopardy&lt;br /&gt;Hide in Your Shell&lt;br /&gt;Lovers in the Wind&lt;br /&gt;Easy Does It&lt;br /&gt;Sister Moonshine&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast in America&lt;br /&gt;Along Came Mary&lt;br /&gt;Soapbox Opera&lt;br /&gt;The Logical Song&lt;br /&gt;INTERMISSION&lt;br /&gt;Child of Vision&lt;br /&gt;Lord is it Mine&lt;br /&gt;If Everyone Was Listening&lt;br /&gt;Across the Universe&lt;br /&gt;Know Who You Are &lt;br /&gt;Don’t Leave Me Now&lt;br /&gt;Dreamer&lt;br /&gt;Fool’s Overture&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Two of Us&lt;br /&gt;Give a Little Bit&lt;br /&gt;It’s Raining Again&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-2626502968725761456?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/2626502968725761456/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/06/roger-hodgson-liverpool-philharmonic.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/2626502968725761456'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/2626502968725761456'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/06/roger-hodgson-liverpool-philharmonic.html' title='Roger Hodgson - Liverpool Philharmonic Hall May 2011'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r3wYohywo00/TepGntyokEI/AAAAAAAABQY/c4AkXTuuipE/s72-c/149.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-7138381426656080800</id><published>2011-06-04T03:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-04T03:13:25.615-07:00</updated><title type='text'>International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 - Quick round up of links.</title><content type='html'>International Pop Overthrow 2011 Bloggage -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mintyandthebeeb.blogspot.com/"&gt;Minty &amp;amp;

This is always guaranteed to be a good night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A notable absence was Ralph, head of the Bongo Beat label, but hopefully he'll be back again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a pleasure to have the Plastic Heroes back at the Cavern. The set included songs from their Escape The Lower End album as well as a few new ones including their new single Fake Revolution which is available on itunes and amazon as a download.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NLbW-pk6ODw?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh okay, they also did Anne-Marie as Simon co-wrote the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kdiq0uhVlTo?rel=0" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne-Marie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After their set I nipped off to the loo but as I passed the band room I was taken in to say hello properly. I reminded them that by the time Dave Rave was to take to the stage it would be Stephen's birthday. I left them working out a special song for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time Mike Badger, founder member of the Las and had of the Viper Records label had taken to the stage with a fabulous set of rockabilly style songs. I particularly liked the one about being kidnapped by Big Foot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last on the bill was Mr Dave Rave, ably backed by The Plastic Heroes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vuUPOVmb7AI?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't Stop Shakin'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About three songs in they unleashed their surprise for Stephen's birthday - a version of, yup, you guessed it, Birthday by The Beatles. Not bad considering they dropped it into the set on the spur of the moment and none of them had played it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HTn1K1dRsyA?rel=0" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birthday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the second time that night we got Anne-Marie, well...it's IS just a good song!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qFbR4TBsS7U?rel=0" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne-Marie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAve usually gets most of the audience to join him on stage but he'd got in trouble for doing that the night before so while he got a couple of people on stage for a rendition of I Saw Her Standing There, he came into the audience and joined us instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ota8E9Jcntg?rel=0" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Saw Her Standing There.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All too soon the event was over for another year and we were off into the night for a taxi home, knowing the next day brought the final round of fonds farewells till next year.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-6918051935012325610?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/6918051935012325610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/06/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/6918051935012325610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/6918051935012325610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/06/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool.html' title='International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 Tuesday Part 2'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://img.youtube.com/vi/NLbW-pk6ODw/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-4864003955405422275</id><published>2011-05-30T15:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-30T15:54:29.210-07:00</updated><title type='text'>International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 Tuesday Part 1</title><content type='html'>Last day of IPO, and the latest we stayed out all week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday saw the second of the Bongo Beat/Viper label nights of 2011, but that wasn't due to start till 9.45pm. So after some food we nipped into the Cavern Pub to see The Flaming Moes. The guitarist/vocalist played barefoot - a brave move on a chilly night. I enjoyed the set and even purchased a CD. I hope they are back again as I missed their second set due to it clashing with Bongo Beat night. I hope they had a better audience in the club, as they deserved it. (Too many people trying to talk louder than the band in the pub.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tx8xOhZjBhE?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venturing into the Club we caught the end of The Fallen Troubadours. They sounded interesting and worthy of further investigation. I was quite surprised to discover they were from Pennsylvania, they have a very English sound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ooB-Nhl5bY8?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were followed by Postcards From Places That Don't Exist, a band from Lincoln who had encouraged us to go and see them as they emerged from their first set at the Pub earlier in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JG3XJ7reb_o?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is getting long and hour is getting late, I will cover the Bong Beat/Viper label Night in a separate post tomorrow.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-4864003955405422275?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/4864003955405422275/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_6333.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4864003955405422275'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4864003955405422275'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_6333.html' title='International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 Tuesday Part 1'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://img.youtube.com/vi/Tx8xOhZjBhE/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-2090994507832844561</id><published>2011-05-30T15:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-30T15:31:33.430-07:00</updated><title type='text'>International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 Monday</title><content type='html'>Monday meant saying goodbye to Honeybug, but with promises to go and visit sooner rather than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in work all day and it was quite odd it not being a Bank Holiday. (The event has been on the Bank Holiday weekend for the last few years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after Honeybug left Dave Rave and The Plastic Heroes arrived! The lows and highs flow fast at IPO!&lt;br /&gt;They were playing the first Bongo Beat night that evening but we were tired and probably would not have made it to the end so our foray into Cavern Club that day was brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After work we went off to watch Kelly's Heels in the club. I filmed more than just one song this time so here's a playlist of four tracks from the set.

This is going to be a long post!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took root in the Cavern around lunchtime where the day started with Bruise. I love Bruise. Isobel has a fabulous voice and I'd already bought the new CD - Little Victories - so I didn't have to wait till this event to get my mitts on it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IB-oMny8TsU?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranger In You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobel did comment that she knew pretty much everyone in the room, so the audience was very appreciative. And for that time on a Sunday there was a good number of people in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following Bruise was a German band called Set Alight. They were very enthusiastic with a lead singer who was definitely easy on the eye. Sadly I don't remember much else about them as people were arriving etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini performed their first set of the day next. I'm am unashamedly biased and love Mini both as a band and as friends. I was quite pleased to share the experience with friends who had never seen them before. I think they were impressed (even when things went a little awry.) I made sure they left with CDs anyway! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CWkEFx59a3w?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the opening number they performed all the songs on their Must Try Harder EP (the free CD mentioned in the video) and after a small bumble over a song we we shan't dwell on, they finished with an amazing rendition of Mr Blue Sky. (If I regret anything about this year's event it's that I didn't video it, but to be honest I was too busy enjoying it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following hot on the heels of Mini came Honeybug's second show of the festival. &lt;br /&gt;By the end of the set Lady Luck had become my new favourite Honeybug song! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hfHIhlMIX9E?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I openly admit that I am biased but Honeybug just make me smile. They make the most beautiful sound and they are beautiful people to boot. I'll stop gushing about them now...honest! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to run back to the shop as Honeybug finished to let Stephen see the Mayflowers in the Cavern Club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were in the Cavern Pub by 6pm ready for Kelly's Heels. Fabulous set from Bob and co. I did film a song but there's a lot of coming and going of people as we were by the door of the venue. &lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for my post about Monday though as I filmed a number of songs then too. There's a new Kelly's Heels CD due out, so I'll be eager to get my hands on that! The highlight of this set, and again, something I wish I'd captured on video was impromptu backing vocals on Who's Been Cheating Who coming from Mini and Honeybug. Fabulous and very much in keeping with the mutual admiration between bands at this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A band called Radio Days were on before The Mayflowers took to the stage with their powerpop/Merseybeat stylings. The Mayflowers were out busking again on Church Street the following day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it was time for the second of Mini's performances of the day. By now we were all in party mood - which is my excuse for being a tad hazy on the running order! I know that they nailed the tune they fluffed earlier, and did so with style and to rapturous applause from those that had been in the Cavern Club. There was a couple of Wings numbers - Jet and Live And Let Die. And they were joined on stage by Erin and Laura from Honeybug for a version of 9 to 5 which had a couple of people up dancing! However the apex of the show was a mighty mighty version of the Cee-lo Green song Forget You. Ni from Honeybug took to the drums and the hybrid "Minibug" just entertained the living daylights out of the audience with this - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ckYAhwkXbeQ?rel=0" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that it was time for goodbyes to Mini as they and we headed home, still buzzing from a brilliant day!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-4650333524154737390?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/4650333524154737390/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_30.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4650333524154737390'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4650333524154737390'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_30.html' title='International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 Sunday'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://img.youtube.com/vi/IB-oMny8TsU/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-635743973714289773</id><published>2011-05-25T08:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-25T08:33:44.990-07:00</updated><title type='text'>In the meantime...</title><content type='html'>While I catch up and sort out photos and videos etc...please go to &lt;a href="http://mintyandthebeeb.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://mintyandthebeeb.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt; to read their International Pop Overthrow reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have updates soon, so much to catch up with!

It was great to see Helen up on stage after so many IPOs as an audience member. The tunes were lovely and despite admitting to getting one song wrong the performance was fab. I think my favourite song from the set was the last one, Intolerence, all about people who talk through gigs. It definitely summed up a few concert going experiences for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wt3y2xfknis?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a quick trip back to the shop to deal with the end of the day rush it was back to the Cavern Pub to catch Richard Snow and The In-Laws. Due to a large German tour group causing us to stay behind I missed the start of the set but I did get to catch the new song Am I Really That Boring? I was feeling pretty rotten by then with my cold so made a sharp exit to dose myself up ready for Friday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/or2waIvqhPg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday was all about Honeybug. I'm very biased of course, but they are my friends and I hadn't seen them since July so I was very excited that they were visiting. I went for food before heading to the Cavern Pub. It was all smiles as we walked in! So awesome to see everyone! The set was marred by the knobheads in the corner by us gabbing all the way through. (I shot some video but one of the afore mentioned knobheads decided to join in and wave on camera! Grrr!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Ni and the girls were jolly good (I don't expect anything less to be honest) and I may have even sang along a wee bit to Open Up Your Eyes. The final song of the set Lady Luck had a very Stevie Wonder vibe to it. I'm off to see them again on Sunday, surprise surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mysgreen/5741378538/" title="016 by mysgreen, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2621/5741378538_9c040a8800_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="016"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following on from Honeybug were a band that my friend Phil described as the missing link between the Jam and Cream. (Make your own doughnut jokes!) The description wasn't wrong. And despite not really being a massive of either of the comparison bands I did rather enjoy Sonic Jewels. They certain had their own sartorial style and I'll be honest, if a guitarist is  wearing eyeliner and a smattering of face glitter I'm going to at least have a look! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also playing before I left for the evening were Susan Hedges and Jeremy. Both were crowd pleasers, in fact I couldn't see most of Jeremy's set as there were that many people in the pub by then, all quite mesmerised. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Jeremy was done it was off for a cab home. Saturday was spent with my friends from Honeybug and Mini. There was shopping and sight-seeing and general hanging out. And as Sunday and Monday are going to be long IPO days, I was home in time for tea and Doctor Who in order to have a restful and decent night's sleep to bolster my stamina!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-7704008744174374938?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/7704008744174374938/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_22.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/7704008744174374938'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/7704008744174374938'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/international-pop-overthrow-liverpool_22.html' title='International Pop Overthrow Liverpool 2011 - so far!'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://img.youtube.com/vi/wt3y2xfknis/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-3516096905452512651</id><published>2011-05-19T07:07:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-19T07:10:07.792-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The Zombies, Liverpool, 18th May 2011</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkDkPSCNI/AAAAAAAABPA/ZKteBshBE0I/s1600-h/zomb_02%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="zomb_02" border="0" height="184" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkENWxGAI/AAAAAAAABPE/FFA_1d20OdE/zomb_02_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" title="zomb_02" width="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is The Zombies’ 50th Anniversary tour, and they are essentially touring a new album. But this doesn’t mean their amazing back catalogue was ignored in anyway. &lt;br /&gt;In total they performed six tracks from the newly released &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004NTVMMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004NTVMMO" target="_blank"&gt;Breathe Out Breathe In&lt;/a&gt; album, and they blended very well in the set list. Sometimes new material from older bands can seem to jar against the hits or drag a bit for the audience, but the strength of these new tracks was shown by the warm and appreciative reception they all received.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the new tracks the set was a pleasant mix of Zombies songs and “solo” projects. They performed six songs from the Odessey and Oracle album explaining all the artists influenced by the songs, including most recently Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters.&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkErNFJhI/AAAAAAAABPI/0Itiu2NTt6U/s1600-h/zomb_11%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="zomb_11" border="0" height="184" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkFJcP8SI/AAAAAAAABPM/Pnya5gPDw_c/zomb_11_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" title="zomb_11" width="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Colin Blunstone relished performing his hit version of What Becomes of The Brokenhearted as well as his solo songs and an Alan Parsons Project track.&lt;br /&gt;As much as I adore The Zombies stuff the highlight for me was the Argent tracks. Hold Your Head Up featured a glorious keyboard solo that went on for quite some time, and &lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkFtNfrXI/AAAAAAAABPQ/fbWUtoC9O9g/s1600-h/zomb_01%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="zomb_01" border="0" height="184" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdUkGHitM6I/AAAAAAAABPU/I5YdyrsPEPI/zomb_01_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" title="zomb_01" width="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; God Gave Rock And Roll To You is a fabulous way to end a gig.

It is thanks to my twitter friend Tim (&lt;a href="http://www.kalyr.com/weblog/" target="_blank"&gt;check out his blog here&lt;/a&gt;) and my gig buddy Phil that I knew what I did of the band before I went to this concert. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was basically armed with the knowledge of a few songs from the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002IJKLPK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002IJKLPK" target="_blank"&gt;Pass The Clock&lt;/a&gt; compilation which I loved, and that the singer on those tracks was no longer with the band.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Arriving at the venue, we were told by the unusually helpful security man that he would find us in the bar when the doors were open upstairs as we wouldn’t need to queue due only around a 100 tickets being sold. However, judge by the number in there by about the third song there were plenty of people who bought tickets on the door.&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuxlvhI-I/AAAAAAAABOo/h_BcWLFZADA/s1600-h/ma_03%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="ma_03" border="0" alt="ma_03" align="right" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuyBMGNNI/AAAAAAAABOs/WnSGGogaSRQ/ma_03_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="184" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you go to see a band that has a fan following you can feel a little isolated but I loved this audience. Everyone respected everyone else’s space and just enjoyed the music. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The band were fabulous. Olivia Sparnenn’s voice and stage presence is awesome. The blend of vocals across the board made for some very pleasurable sounds and the musicianship of the whole band was spot on! The sound was loud, but in no way distorted. &lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuyg7dBKI/AAAAAAAABOw/K-0DeS2no9U/s1600-h/ma_07%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="ma_07" border="0" alt="ma_07" align="left" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuzDbJWHI/AAAAAAAABO0/CvXxd3lnySU/ma_07_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="184" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And Anne-Marie Helder’s flute work was faultless. More bands should had flautists in their line-up I reckon. It works surprising well within a rock band sound. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Confession time now, I’ve had to go searching for a set list to see what was played and the best I could come up with (after a minimal search, I confess) was a list for the &lt;a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/mostly-autumn/2011/the-y-theatre-leicester-england-3d3e1cf.html" target="_blank"&gt;night after in Leicester&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully it jogged the memory a bit. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff from the new album &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0046V11JS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brandxonline-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0046V11JS" target="_blank"&gt;Go Well Diamond Heart&lt;/a&gt;, all of which was greeted warmly by the appreciative audience. I had bought the CD before the gig began, that’s how confident I was I would enjoy it. Before the interval I was already eager to get it on the mp3 player! I could only afford the ordinary release, but the track from the special edition that they performed did tantalise and I almost considered going over budget and getting that instead. (In the end I was sensible, I have a lot of nights out this week and need to make the pennies stretch!)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new songs blended in well with the older stuff. As I said I’m a novice with this band, but there seemed no noticeable difference between old and new.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The date of the gig (Friday the 13th) didn’t go unmentioned, especially as before the second song the drum kit had to be gaffer taped into place, or their was a chance the drummer would end up in the audience by the third song. And at one point one of the amps switched itself off! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Highlights – Fading Colours, Go Well Diamond Heart and the “encore” (they never left the stage) of And When The War Is Over and Heroes Never Die. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In all they were onstage from around 8.15 right through to the venue curfew of 11pm, with a 20 minute break somewhere in the middle. That’s around two and half hours of quality entertainment for under £15! Brilliant! Especially as the band appeared to be having just as good a time as the audience. I can think of a few far more expensive concerts I’ve been to that were shorter and didn’t offer any form of audience engagement. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuzS7jYzI/AAAAAAAABO4/U82QAvbrJIA/s1600-h/ma_06%5B2%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="ma_06" border="0" alt="ma_06" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuz7mu39I/AAAAAAAABO8/DsEBBMrVBwc/ma_06_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" height="184" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mostly-autumn.com/2/" target="_blank"&gt;Mostly Autumn Official Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-103697682432171040?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/103697682432171040/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/mostly-autumn-manchester-13th-may-2011.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/103697682432171040'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/103697682432171040'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/05/mostly-autumn-manchester-13th-may-2011.html' title='Mostly Autumn, Manchester 13th May 2011'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TdOuxB4hjCI/AAAAAAAABOk/KZTPbt4vkqw/s72-c/ma_09_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-92276831025491007</id><published>2011-05-16T12:34:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-16T12:34:33.014-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Facebook Page</title><content type='html'>I've stated a Facebook page for this blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Not quite sure what I'll do with it.

Actually we started at the Philharmonic Pub for drinks with Toni from &lt;a href="http://thedakotas.co.uk/"&gt;the Dakotas&lt;/a&gt; who is currently sitting in on keyboards with The Merseybeats. There was a fair amount of catching up to do as I'd not seen him for ages. I mustn't leave that long again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vanityfare.co.uk/"&gt;Vanity Fare&lt;/a&gt; were on stage when we took our seats, we were just in time for Hitching A Ride.

Still in fine voice he entertained the crowd in his own inimitable style.

He still sounds great. The set list included Handbags and Gladrags, a rather nice new song the title of which escapes me right now and ended, of course, with Out Of Time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oc5yZmpMgPU/TbnZRYSfBbI/AAAAAAAABMc/bfsO1Whnwzs/s1600/ss60s_014.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oc5yZmpMgPU/TbnZRYSfBbI/AAAAAAAABMc/bfsO1Whnwzs/s200/ss60s_014.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the interval it was time for&lt;a href="http://www.cryinggame.co.uk/"&gt; Dave Berry&lt;/a&gt;. Opening with Memphis Tennessee and working his way as only he can through a cover of ZZ Top's Give Me All Your Loving, Mama, Little Things (cue us joining in on the backing vocals) and The Crying Game he gave a great show. He even came back for a kind of encore, which was a version of the BeeGees' First of May.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zdU6fyQs9bk/TbnZRv_iViI/AAAAAAAABMg/e1ATvb__PcA/s1600/ss60s_025.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zdU6fyQs9bk/TbnZRv_iViI/AAAAAAAABMg/e1ATvb__PcA/s200/ss60s_025.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Next was &lt;a href="http://www.terrysylvester.com/"&gt;Terry Sylvester&lt;/a&gt; who was in both the Escorts and the Hollies for a while. As a local lad he must have had a lot of family in judging from the reaction from the audience. Vanity Fare did a fabulous job of recreating the Hollies-esque harmonies for the set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5oDw09lKq0k/TbnZSOs1A2I/AAAAAAAABMk/hInfdnM8Fyc/s1600/ss60s_038.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5oDw09lKq0k/TbnZSOs1A2I/AAAAAAAABMk/hInfdnM8Fyc/s200/ss60s_038.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The evening was rounded off by &lt;a href="http://www.themerseybeats.co.uk/"&gt;The Merseybeats&lt;/a&gt;. They very quickly had the crowd going and even had some up on their feet. By the end we were all on our feet actually! The band never fail to entertain. We got Wishin' And Hopin', a coupel of Everly Brothers tunes, Don't Turn Around, I Think of You, a version of Live and Let Die with pyros and strobe lights...and that was topped with a crowd pleasing rendition of Sorrow before they belted out a version of Hi Ho Silver Lining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oggbf1iy0pI/TbnZSv9SpbI/AAAAAAAABMo/I7pO3vxH5TM/s1600/ss60s_045.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oggbf1iy0pI/TbnZSv9SpbI/AAAAAAAABMo/I7pO3vxH5TM/s200/ss60s_045.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The finale was Glad All Over with all the acts back on stage and the crowd clapping and stomping along. We had a fabulous night and it reminded us how much fun we have at these things. Personally I'm already eager to find out the line up for next year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mysgreen/sets/72157626594538746/"&gt;Full set of photos here at my flickr account.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-3501850390873312319?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/3501850390873312319/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/04/solid-silver-60s-show-2011-liverpool.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/3501850390873312319'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/3501850390873312319'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/04/solid-silver-60s-show-2011-liverpool.html' title='Solid Silver 60s Show 2011, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall.'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y4YIWCZA-dA/TbnZQT-fuQI/AAAAAAAABMQ/k2b272NKmE4/s72-c/ss60s_001.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-2860703857026705071</id><published>2011-04-24T05:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-04-24T05:35:35.445-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Rick Wakeman - Pacific Road Arts Centre, Birkenhead</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RY8sgJELkjE/TbQT2WMwsNI/AAAAAAAABMI/Yvl2X2YIVrE/s1600/2011-04-23+21.29.03.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RY8sgJELkjE/TbQT2WMwsNI/AAAAAAAABMI/Yvl2X2YIVrE/s200/2011-04-23+21.29.03.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This was my first Rick Wakeman solo concert. I had seen a couple of DVDs so pretty much knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The format was simple. The stage was set with a piano and a microphone. Rick introduced each piece with an amusing anecdote before sitting at the piano. Lots of the stories are well known, but he does love telling them. In fact he seemed to be really enjoying himself up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His piano playing is quite something to watch. Luckily from where I was sat he didn't have his back completely to us and I found myself quite&amp;nbsp;mesmerised&amp;nbsp;by his technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlight were A Glimpse of Heaven, You And I/Wonderous Stories, Morning Has Broken, Dance of A Thousand Lights (karaoke version - he played over a recording of the orchestral bits.) and Catherine Howard which is rapidly becoming one of my favourite pieces of his music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was even audience participation. We all got to be birds on The Birdman of Alcatraz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a fun evening all round, and really do hope the opportunity arises that I can go and see him again.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-2860703857026705071?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/2860703857026705071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/04/rick-wakeman-pacific-road-arts-centre.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/2860703857026705071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/2860703857026705071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/04/rick-wakeman-pacific-road-arts-centre.html' title='Rick Wakeman - Pacific Road Arts Centre, Birkenhead'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RY8sgJELkjE/TbQT2WMwsNI/AAAAAAAABMI/Yvl2X2YIVrE/s72-c/2011-04-23+21.29.03.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-6157258029071432358</id><published>2011-04-18T13:51:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2011-04-18T13:51:31.867-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Five Songs</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s quite simple – just list five songs you really into at the moment; not your five greatest songs of all time, but five songs you’ve been listening to a lot recently, for any given value of “Recently”. And give a few words explaining why.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note - I have previously posted a Five Song thing &lt;a href="http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2010/02/five-songs-meme.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But I didn’t look at it till I had finished this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandenburger – The Nice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve just been reading about The Nice and filling in the gaps in my CD collection. This one particularly sticks in my head because for a few days before I acquired it on CD I had the Brandenburg Concerto playing over and over in my head (I think I’d heard it on a TV show or something.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friends Like These – T’Pau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s quite sad that this song as been applicable in my life at least twice. Still I currently don’t have any friends like these, I have fabulous, open-minded, caring, empathic friends of all kinds. And all praise to the powers that be that this is the case. Still like the song though and have done since the album came out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somebody Who Cares – Paul McCartney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it, I have a soft spot for the Tug Of War/Pipes Of Peace albums. This tune lives in my head and surfaces every now and again. Lyrically Paul captures the frustrations of life. It’s a simple analogy but effective. “Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car when you had somewhere to go” He couples this with the assurance that there’s “always someone somewhere, you should know by now there’s always somebody who cares” and he’s probably right!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoot To Thrill – AC/DC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Iron Man 2 soundtrack is one that I often listen to on the way to work. It blows away the cobwebs as well as blocking out the general chatter that drives me insane at that time of day on that bus route – works on the journey back too!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Resistance Is Low – Hoagy Carmichael&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This tune is quite the earworm.

I like all kinds of music, and I'm not keen on being pigeon holed due to whichever type of music I appear to listen to the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I first joined &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/user/mysgreen"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; and someone I know in real life added me there. They seemed concerned that whatever system they use to compare you to your friend meant our compatibility was low. Hardly, we had other things in common other than music and I like my friends to have diverse tastes. This is how I get introduced to and am able to explore different music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In simple terms, I like what I like. If that skews your impression of me in someway, I'm afraid that's your problem. So yes - I will happily listen to a couple of hours worth of prog and follow it with cheesy pop, then a bit of classical music, maybe something with a jazz feel, perhaps a touch of Rolf Harris followed by some battle metal or traditional folk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.mattstevensguitar.com/"&gt;Matt Stevens&lt;/a&gt;' music is in that mix too. I find his work a fabulous soundtrack for winding down at the end of the day or for working on the computer. You can find lots of his music by &lt;a href="http://mattstevens.bandcamp.com/"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt; and you can pay what you want for it too.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-3773107663912328060?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/3773107663912328060/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/03/best-quote-ever.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/3773107663912328060'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/3773107663912328060'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2011/03/best-quote-ever.html' title='Best Quote Ever!'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-7222680415414613163</id><published>2011-02-07T14:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2011-02-07T14:31:39.475-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Jacqui &amp; Bridie's Folk Club: 50th Year and Final Night - Liverpool Philharmonic 23rd January 2011</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TVBut83HlPI/AAAAAAAABIs/dprDWCQM8Fk/s1600/179485_491857389146_670439146_6164385_6563146_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TVBut83HlPI/AAAAAAAABIs/dprDWCQM8Fk/s320/179485_491857389146_670439146_6164385_6563146_n.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Some of you may know that I spend a lot of time in Liverpool, in fact I am there all week now I work full time in the city, going home at weekends. What you may not realise is why I first I fell for this city. &amp;nbsp;It wasn't due to the Beatles as many would suspect given that I am a fan and my day job involves them more than a fair bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love affair with the city of Liverpool began with the songs my dad would sing to me as a child, and many of these would be songs performed by Jacqui &amp;amp; Bridie and The Spinners. &amp;nbsp;(Incidentally, I would go on to a deep appreciation of The Mersey Poets to further my affections for the city before finally proceeding to The Beatles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was first suggested that there was going to be a concert to celebrate Jacqui &amp;amp; Bridie's Folk Club I immediately knew that I wanted to be there and, more importantly, I wanted to take my dad. I didn't particularly need to know who was going to be on the bill, when the tickets went on sale seats were purchased near the front and dad's Christmas/Birthday was dutifully sorted. The tickets were a small price to pay for the musical grounding I had been given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night was fantastic. From the first song, Kilgary Mountain, the audience were in fine voice, and the joy in the venue was almost tangible. The folk club ideal was upheld throughout the night, if you knew the words - sing along, if you picked up the chorus - sing along! The songs were punctuated with "terrible" jokes from Jacqui which the audience would either giggle at or greet with a well meant groan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone had a good time, whether they were on stage or in the audience. We were all a part of it and it was such an amazing thing of which to be a part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TVBuvB9dYiI/AAAAAAAABIw/Z0YTMvt_vQY/s1600/180788_491857499146_670439146_6164387_2437810_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TVBuvB9dYiI/AAAAAAAABIw/Z0YTMvt_vQY/s320/180788_491857499146_670439146_6164387_2437810_n.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's hard to pick out highlights when I enjoyed all it so very much. Perhaps the most enduring memory will be Jacqui almost crying with laughter at John Gorman's hilarious performance of Ten Whisky Bottles. Jacqui remained on stage for the entire duration of the concert either listening to or joining in with the acts as they came on stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening was to mark the end of the folk club, but Jacqui went to pains to point out that she herself was not retiring and would be still available should anyone want her to appear anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening ended with the assembled musicians and the audience singing The Leaving Of Liverpool, followed - after loud calls for more - by the lovely Wild Mountain Thyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honoured to be there, even more honoured to share it with very special people and still hold the joy of the evening in my heart when I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://issuu.com/liverpoolphilharmonic/docs/jacqui_bridies_folk_club"&gt;Link to an online version of the programme for the evening.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- for background information and details of performers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilgary Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ZQpZE8KrCI?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Leaving Of Liverpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/r9aF4RJRbDU?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C435F31361BB9CE1"&gt;Link to youtube playlist of videos from the evening&lt;/a&gt;

Sadly after bus and train trips from where I was staying all the way to Birmingham City Centre we got to the venue to be informed that the gig was off. The venue itself was only told a couple of hours previously. &amp;nbsp;I need to chase them up actually. We were told we'd get an email will details of a new date etc... I've heard nothing, not even a courtesy email explaining the situation, I don't think this is good enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-4888401877412997269?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/4888401877412997269/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2010/12/meeting-alan-white-and-not-seeing-asia.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4888401877412997269'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/4888401877412997269'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2010/12/meeting-alan-white-and-not-seeing-asia.html' title='Meeting Alan White and Not Seeing Asia'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pPW6U-alJxs/TQ_XmnDLEdI/AAAAAAAABGQ/_uHe3r7w--g/s72-c/alanw.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5302058935179340574.post-6078382337320732386</id><published>2010-11-24T16:04:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2010-11-24T16:04:17.467-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Wordle for this blog</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/2788370/www.sisterbluebird.co.uk" title="Wordle: www.sisterbluebird.co.uk"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wordle: www.sisterbluebird.co.uk" src="http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/2788370/www.sisterbluebird.co.uk" style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 4px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5302058935179340574-6078382337320732386?l=www.sisterbluebird.co.uk' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/feeds/6078382337320732386/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2010/11/wordle-for-this-blog.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/6078382337320732386'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5302058935179340574/posts/default/6078382337320732386'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sisterbluebird.co.uk/2010/11/wordle-for-this-blog.html' title='Wordle for this blog'/><author><name>Anne-Marie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11753722214319134282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
