<description><![CDATA[
<p>Pigs are considered to be intermediate hosts and "mixing vessels," facilitating the genesis of pandemic influenza viruses, as demonstrated by the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pdm/09) virus. The prevalence and repeated introduction of the pdm/09 virus into pigs raises the possibility of generating novel swine influenza viruses with the potential to infect humans. To address this, an active influenza surveillance program was conducted with slaughtered pigs in abattoirs in southern China. Over 50% of the pigs tested were found to be seropositive for one or more H1 influenza viruses, most commonly pdm/09-like viruses. Out of 36 virus isolates detected, one group of novel reassortants had Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 surface genes and pdm/09 internal genes. Animal experiments showed that this virus transmitted effectively from pig to pig and from pig to ferret, and it could also replicate in <I>ex vivo</I> human lung tissue. Immunization against the 2009 pandemic virus gave only partial protection to ferrets. The continuing prevalence of the pdm/09 virus in pigs could lead to the genesis of novel swine reassortant viruses with the potential to infect humans.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Expressing Tumor Suppressor p53 Is a Highly Attenuated, Potent Oncolytic Agent [Gene Delivery]]]></title>
<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10440?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative-strand RNA rhabdovirus, preferentially replicates in and eradicates transformed versus nontransformed cells and is thus being considered for use as a potential anticancer treatment. The genetic malleability of VSV also affords an opportunity to develop more potent agents that exhibit increased therapeutic activity. The tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to exert potent antitumor properties, which may in part involve stimulating host innate immune responses to malignancies. To evaluate whether VSV expressing p53 exhibited enhanced oncolytic action, the murine p53 (mp53) gene was incorporated into recombinant VSVs with or without a functional viral M gene-encoded protein that could either block (VSV-mp53) or enable [VSV-M(mut)-mp53] host mRNA export following infection of susceptible cells. Our results indicated that VSV-mp53 and VSV-M(mut)-mp53 expressed high levels of functional p53 and retained the ability to lyse transformed versus normal cells. In addition, we observed that VSV-M-mp53 was extremely attenuated <I>in vivo</I> due to p53 activating innate immune genes, such as type I interferon (IFN). Significantly, immunocompetent animals with metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma exhibited increased survival following treatment with a single inoculation of VSV-M-mp53, the mechanisms of which involved enhanced CD49b<sup>+</sup> NK and tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Our data indicate that VSV incorporating p53 could provide a safe, effective strategy for the design of VSV oncolytic therapeutics and VSV-based vaccines.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Mapping a Region of Hepatitis C Virus E2 That Is Responsible for Escape from Neutralizing Antibodies and a Core CD81-Binding Region That Does Not Tolerate Neutralization Escape Mutations [Pathogenesis and Immunity]]]></title>
<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10451?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Understanding the interaction between broadly neutralizing antibodies and their epitopes provides a basis for the rational design of a preventive hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine. CBH-2, HC-11, and HC-1 are representatives of antibodies to overlapping epitopes on E2 that mediate neutralization by blocking virus binding to CD81. To obtain insights into escape mechanisms, infectious cell culture virus, 2a HCVcc, was propagated under increasing concentrations of a neutralizing antibody to isolate escape mutants. Three escape patterns were observed with these antibodies. First, CBH-2 escape mutants that contained mutations at D431G or A439E, which did not compromise viral fitness, were isolated. Second, under the selective pressure of HC-11, escape mutations progressed from a single L438F substitution at a low antibody concentration to double substitutions, L438F and N434D or L438F and T435A, at higher antibody concentrations. Escape from HC-11 was associated with a loss of viral fitness. An HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) containing the L438F mutation bound to CD81 half as efficiently as did wild-type (wt) HCVpp. Third, for HC-1, the antibody at a critical concentration completely suppressed viral replication and generated no escape mutants. Epitope mapping revealed contact residues for CBH-2 and HC-11 in two regions of the E2 glycoprotein, amino acids (aa) 425 to 443 and aa 529 to 535. Interestingly, contact residues for HC-1 were identified only in the region encompassing aa 529 to 535 and not in aa 425 to 443. Taken together, these findings point to a region of variability, aa 425 to 443, that is responsible primarily for viral escape from neutralization, with or without compromising viral fitness. Moreover, the region aa 529 to 535 is a core CD81 binding region that does not tolerate neutralization escape mutations.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10464?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and life threatening disease, with a fatality rate of almost 10%. The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), with animal reservoirs found in bats and other wild animals and thus the possibility of reemergence. In this study, we first investigated at 6 years postinfection whether SARS-specific memory T cells persist in SARS-recovered individuals, demonstrating that these subjects still possess polyfunctional SARS-specific memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. A dominant memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response against SARS-CoV nucleocaspid protein (NP; amino acids 216 to 225) was then defined in SARS-recovered individuals carrying HLA-B*40:01, a HLA-B molecule present in approximately one-quarter of subjects of Asian ethnicities. To reconstitute such a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, we isolated the alpha and beta T cell receptors of the HLA-B*40:01-restricted SARS-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using T cell receptor gene transfer, we generated SARS-specific redirected T cells from the lymphocytes of normal individuals. These engineered CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed avidity and functionality similar to that of natural SARS-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. They were able to degranulate and produce gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1&alpha; and 1&beta; after antigenic stimulation. Since there is no effective treatment against SARS, these transduced T cells specific for an immunodominant SARS epitope may provide a new avenue for treatment during a SARS outbreak.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Attempts to develop a vaccine to prevent genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) disease have been only marginally successful, suggesting that novel strategies are needed. Immunization with HSV-2 glycoprotein C (gC-2) and gD-2 was evaluated in mice and guinea pigs to determine whether adding gC-2 to a gD-2 subunit vaccine would improve protection by producing antibodies that block gC-2 immune evasion from complement. Antibodies produced by gC-2 immunization blocked the interaction between gC-2 and complement C3b, and passive transfer of gC-2 antibody protected complement-intact mice but not C3 knockout mice against HSV-2 challenge, indicating that gC-2 antibody is effective, at least in part, because it prevents HSV-2 evasion from complement. Immunization with gC-2 also produced neutralizing antibodies that were active in the absence of complement; however, the neutralizing titers were higher when complement was present, with the highest titers in animals immunized with both antigens. Animals immunized with the gC-2-plus-gD-2 combination had robust CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to each immunogen. Multiple disease parameters were evaluated in mice and guinea pigs immunized with gC-2 alone, gD-2 alone, or both antigens. In general, gD-2 outperformed gC-2; however, the gC-2-plus-gD-2 combination outperformed gD-2 alone, particularly in protecting dorsal root ganglia in mice and reducing recurrent vaginal shedding of HSV-2 DNA in guinea pigs. Therefore, the gC-2 subunit antigen enhances a gD-2 subunit vaccine by stimulating a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response, by producing neutralizing antibodies that are effective in the absence and presence of complement, and by blocking immune evasion domains that inhibit complement activation.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Targeting the Human Papillomavirus E6 and E7 Oncogenes through Expression of the Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 E2 Protein Stimulates Cellular Motility [Transformation and Oncogenesis]]]></title>
<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10487?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Expression of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncogenes is essential for the initiation and maintenance of cervical cancer. The repression of both was previously shown to result in activation of their respective tumor suppressor targets, p53 and pRb, and subsequent senescence induction in cervical cancer cells. Consequently, viral oncogene suppression is a promising approach for the treatment of HPV-positive tumors. One well-established method of E6/E7 repression involves the reexpression of the viral E2 protein which is usually deleted in HPV-positive cancer cells. Here, we show that, surprisingly, bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) E2 but not RNA interference-mediated E6/E7 repression in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells stimulates cellular motility and invasion. Migration correlated with the dynamic formation of cellular protrusions and was dependent upon cell-to-cell contact. While E2-expressing migratory cells were senescent, migration was not a general feature of cellular senescence or cell cycle arrest and was specifically observed in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. Interestingly, E2-expressing cells not only were themselves motile but also conferred increased motility to admixed HeLa cervical cancer cells. Together, our data suggest that repression of the viral oncogenes by E2 stimulates the motility of E6/E7-targeted cells as well as adjacent nontargeted cancer cells, thus raising the possibility that E2 expression may unfavorably increase the local invasiveness of HPV-positive tumors.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>HIV-1 and HIV-2 are derived from two distinct primate viruses and share only limited sequence identity. Despite this, HIV-1 and HIV-2 Gag polyproteins can coassemble into the same particle and their genomes can undergo recombination, albeit at an extremely low frequency, implying that HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA can be copackaged into the same particle. To determine the frequency of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA copackaging and to dissect the mechanisms that allow the heterologous RNA copackaging, we directly visualized the RNA content of each particle by using RNA-binding proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins to label the viral genomes. We found that when HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA are present in viral particles at similar ratios, ~10% of the viral particles encapsidate both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNAs. Furthermore, heterologous RNA copackaging can be promoted by mutating the 6-nucleotide (6-nt) dimer initiation signal (DIS) to discourage RNA homodimerization or to encourage RNA heterodimerization, indicating that HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA can heterodimerize prior to packaging using the DIS sequences. We also observed that the coassembly of HIV-1 and HIV-2 Gag proteins is not required for the heterologous RNA copackaging; HIV-1 Gag proteins are capable of mediating HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA copackaging. These results define the <I>cis-</I> and <I>trans</I>-acting elements required for and affecting the heterologous RNA copackaging, a prerequisite for the generation of chimeric viruses by recombination, and also shed light on the mechanisms of RNA-Gag recognition essential for RNA encapsidation.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Antibodies that neutralize rotavirus infection target outer coat proteins VP4 and VP7 and inhibit viral entry. The structure of a VP7-Fab complex (S. T. Aoki, et al., Science 324:1444-1447, 2009) led us to reclassify epitopes into two binding regions at inter- and intrasubunit boundaries of the calcium-dependent trimer. It further led us to show that antibodies binding at the intersubunit boundary inhibit uncoating of the virion outer layer. We have now tested representative antibodies for each of the defined structural epitope regions and find that antibodies recognizing epitopes in either binding region neutralize by cross-linking VP7 trimers. Antibodies that bind at the intersubunit junction neutralize as monovalent Fabs, while those that bind at the intrasubunit region require divalency. The VP7 structure has also allowed us to design a disulfide cross-linked VP7 mutant which recoats double-layered particles (DLPs) as efficiently as does wild-type VP7 but which yields particles defective in cell entry as determined both by lack of infectivity and by loss of &alpha;-sarcin toxicity in the presence of recoated particles. We conclude that dissociation of the VP7 trimer is an essential step in viral penetration into cells.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>HIV-1 often evades cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses by generating variants that are not recognized by CTLs. We used single-genome amplification and sequencing of complete HIV genomes to identify longitudinal changes in the transmitted/founder virus from the establishment of infection to the viral set point at 1 year after the infection. We found that the rate of viral escape from CTL responses in a given patient decreases dramatically from acute infection to the viral set point. Using a novel mathematical model that tracks the dynamics of viral escape at multiple epitopes, we show that a number of factors could potentially contribute to a slower escape in the chronic phase of infection, such as a decreased magnitude of epitope-specific CTL responses, an increased fitness cost of escape mutations, or an increased diversity of the CTL response. In the model, an increase in the number of epitope-specific CTL responses can reduce the rate of viral escape from a given epitope-specific CTL response, particularly if CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compete for killing of infected cells or control virus replication nonlytically. Our mathematical framework of viral escape from multiple CTL responses can be used to predict the breadth and magnitude of HIV-specific CTL responses that need to be induced by vaccination to reduce (or even prevent) viral escape following HIV infection.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is transmitted mainly through mucosal sites. Optimum strategies to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity are critical for the development of vaccines against HIV-1. We therefore sought to evaluate the induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses by the use of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a vaccine vector. We generated a recombinant NDV, designated rLaSota/gp160, expressing the gp160 envelope (Env) protein of HIV-1 from an added gene. The gp160 protein expressed by rLaSota/gp160 virus was detected on an infected cell surface and was incorporated into the NDV virion. Biochemical studies showed that gp160 present in infected cells and in the virion formed a higher-order oligomer that retained recognition by conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Expression of gp160 did not increase the virulence of recombinant NDV (rNDV) strain LaSota. Guinea pigs were administered rLaSota/gp160 via the intranasal (i.n.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route in different prime-boost combinations. Systemic and mucosal antibody responses specific to the HIV-1 envelope protein were assessed in serum and vaginal washes, respectively. Two or three immunizations via the i.n. or i.m. route induced a more potent systemic and mucosal immune response than a single immunization by either route. Priming by the i.n. route was more immunogenic than by the i.m. route, and the same was true for the boosts. Furthermore, immunization with rLaSota/gp160 by any route or combination of routes induced a Th1-type response, as reflected by the induction of stronger antigen-specific IgG2a than IgG1 antibody responses. Additionally, i.n. immunization elicited a stronger neutralizing serum antibody response to laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain MN.3. These data illustrate that it is feasible to use NDV as a vaccine vector to elicit potent humoral and mucosal responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV include vaccines that elicit durable, protective mucosal immune responses. A key to effective mucosal immunity is the capacity for antigens administered locally to cross epithelial barriers. Given the role of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in transferring IgG across polarized epithelial cells which line mucosal surfaces, FcRn might be useful for delivering HIV vaccine antigens across mucosal epithelial barriers to the underlying antigen-presenting cells. Chimeric proteins composed of HIV Gag (p24) fused to the Fc region of IgG (Gag-Fc) bind efficiently to airway mucosa and are transported across this epithelial surface. Mice immunized intranasally with Gag-Fc plus CpG adjuvant developed local and systemic immunity, including durable B and T cell memory. Gag-specific immunity was sufficiently potent to protect against an intravaginal challenge with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV Gag protein. Intranasal administration of a Gag-Fc/CpG vaccine protected at a distal mucosal site. Our data suggest that targeting of FcRn with chimeric immunogens may be an important strategy for mucosal immunization and should be considered a new approach for preventive HIV vaccines.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Bacteria have evolved diverse defense mechanisms that allow them to fight viral attacks. One such mechanism, the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, is an adaptive immune system consisting of genetic loci that can take up genetic material from invasive elements (viruses and plasmids) and later use them to reject the returning invaders. It remains an open question how, despite the ongoing evolution of attack and defense mechanisms, bacteria and viral phages manage to coexist. Using a simple mathematical model and a two-dimensional numerical simulation, we found that CRISPR adaptive immunity allows for robust phage-bacterium coexistence even when the number of virus species far exceeds the capacity of CRISPR-encoded genetic memory. Coexistence is predicted to be a consequence of the presence of many interdependent species that stress but do not overrun the bacterial defense system.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10561?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Autophagy has been shown to facilitate replication or production of hepatitis C virus (HCV); nevertheless, how HCV induces autophagy remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HCV nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) alone can induce autophagy signaling; amino acid residues 1 to 190 of NS4B are sufficient for this induction. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation levels of S6K and 4E-BP1 were not altered, suggesting that the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway and mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway did not contribute to NS4B- or HCV-induced autophagy. Inhibition of Rab5 function by silencing Rab5 or overexpressing dominant-negative Rab5 mutant (S34N) resulted in significant reduction of NS4B- or HCV-induced autophagic vesicle formation. Moreover, the autophagy induction was impaired by inhibition of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) Vps34 function. Finally, the coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that NS4B formed a complex with Rab5 and Vps34, supporting the notion that Rab5 and Vps34 are involved in NS4B-induced autophagy. Taken together, these results not only reveal a novel role of NS4B in autophagy but also offer a clue to the mechanism of HCV-induced autophagy.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies is effective in protecting rhesus macaques against simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge. In addition to neutralization, effector functions of the crystallizable fragment (Fc) of antibodies are involved in antibody-mediated protection against a number of viruses. We recently showed that interaction between the Fc fragment of the broadly neutralizing antibody IgG1 b12 and cellular Fc receptors (FcRs) plays an important role in protection against SHIV infection in rhesus macaques. The specific nature of this Fc-dependent protection is largely unknown. To investigate, we generated a panel of 11 IgG1 b12 antibody variants with selectively diminished or enhanced affinity for the two main activating FcRs, FcRIIa and FcRIIIa. All 11 antibody variants bind gp120 and neutralize virus as effectively as does wild-type b12. Binding studies using monomeric (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and surface plasmon resonance [SPR]) and cellularly expressed Fc receptors show decreased (up to 5-fold) and increased (up to 90-fold) binding to FcRIIa and FcRIIIa with this newly generated panel of antibodies. In addition, there was generally a good correlation between b12 variant affinity for Fc receptor and variant function in antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI), phagocytosis, NK cell activation assays, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. In future studies, these b12 variants will enable the investigation of the protective role of individual FcRs in HIV infection.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Public health measures successfully contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. However, the precursor of the SARS-CoV remains in its natural bat reservoir, and reemergence of a human-adapted SARS-like coronavirus remains a plausible public health concern. Vaccination is a major strategy for containing resurgence of SARS in humans, and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models. We previously reported that antibody elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant full-length Spike-protein trimers potentiated infection of human B cell lines despite eliciting <I>in vivo</I> a neutralizing and protective immune response in rodents. These observations prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection <I>in vitro</I>. We demonstrate here that anti-Spike immune serum, while inhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line, potentiated infection of immune cells by SARS-CoV Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, as well as replication-competent SARS coronavirus. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on Fc receptor II but did not use the endosomal/lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the accepted receptor for SARS-CoV. This suggests that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells. Different SARS vaccine candidates elicit sera that differ in their capacity to induce ADE in immune cells despite their comparable potency to neutralize infection in ACE2-bearing cells. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV can enter target cells and illustrate the potential pitfalls associated with immunization against it. These findings should prompt further investigations into SARS pathogenesis.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Although increasing data have become available that link human adaptation with specific molecular changes in nonhuman influenza viruses, the molecular changes of these viruses during a large highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) outbreak in poultry along with avian-to-human transmission have never been documented. By comprehensive virologic analysis of combined veterinary and human samples obtained during a large HPAI A (H7N7) outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003, we mapped the acquisition of human adaptation markers to identify the public health risk associated with an HPAI outbreak in poultry. Full-length hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and PB2 sequencing of A (H7N7) viruses obtained from 45 human cases showed amino acid variations at different codons in HA (<I>n</I>=20), NA (<I>n</I>=23), and PB2 (<I>n</I>=23). Identification of the avian sources of human virus infections based on 232 farm sequences demonstrated that for each gene about 50% of the variation was already present in poultry. Polygenic accumulation and farm-to-farm spread of known virulence and human adaptation markers in A (H7N7) virus-infected poultry occurred prior to farm-to-human transmission. These include the independent emergence of HA A143T mutants, accumulation of four NA mutations, and farm-to-farm spread of virus variants harboring mammalian host determinants D701N and S714I in PB2. This implies that HPAI viruses with pandemic potential can emerge directly from poultry. Since the public health risk of an avian influenza virus outbreak in poultry can rapidly change, we recommend virologic monitoring for human adaptation markers among poultry as well as among humans during the course of an outbreak in poultry.</p>

<p>The search for a safe and efficacious vaccine for Ebola virus continues, as no current vaccine candidate is nearing licensure. We have developed (i) replication-competent, (ii) replication-deficient, and (iii) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP) by a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine. ZEBOV GP is efficiently expressed by these vaccine candidates and is incorporated into virions. The vaccine candidates were avirulent after inoculation of adult mice, and viruses with a deletion in the RABV glycoprotein had greatly reduced neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation in suckling mice. Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. The bivalent RABV/ZEBOV vaccines described here have several distinct advantages that may speed the development of inactivated vaccines for use in humans and potentially live or inactivated vaccines for use in nonhuman primates at risk of EBOV infection in endemic areas.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Evolution of the <I>env</I> gene in transmitted R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains is the most widely accepted mechanism driving coreceptor switching. In some infected individuals, however, a shift in coreceptor utilization can occur as a result of the reemergence of a cotransmitted, but rapidly controlled, X4 virus. The latter possibility was studied by dually infecting rhesus macaques with X4 and R5 chimeric simian simian/human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) and monitoring the replication status of each virus using specific primer pairs. In one of the infected monkeys, both SHIVs were potently suppressed by week 12 postinoculation, but a burst of viremia at week 51 was accompanied by an unrelenting loss of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the development of clinical disease. PCR analyses of plasma viral RNA indicated an <I>env</I> gene segment containing the V3 region from the inoculated X4 SHIV had been transferred into the genetic background of the input R5 SHIV by intergenomic recombination, creating an X4 virus with novel replicative, serological, and pathogenic properties. These results indicate that the effects of retrovirus recombination <I>in vivo</I> can be functionally profound and may even occur when one of the recombination participants is undetectable in the circulation as cell-free virus.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10627?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The mammalian retromer is an evolutionally conserved protein complex composed of a vacuolar protein sorting trimer (Vps 26/29/35) that participates in cargo recognition and a sorting nexin (SNX) dimer that binds to endosomal membranes. The retromer plays an important role in efficient retrograde transport for endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), a receptor for lysosomal hydrolases, and other endosomal proteins. This ultimately contributes to the control of cell growth, cell adhesion, and cell migration. The herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (Tip), required for the immortalization of primary T lymphocytes, targets cellular signaling molecules, including Lck tyrosine kinases and the p80 endosomal trafficking protein. Despite the pronounced effects of HVS Tip on T cell signal transduction, the details of its activity on T cell immortalization remain elusive. Here, we report that the amino-terminal conserved, glutamate-rich sequence of Tip specifically interacts with the retromer subunit Vps35 and that this interaction not only causes the redistribution of Vps35 from the early endosome to the lysosome but also drastically inhibits retromer activity, as measured by decreased levels of CI-MPR and lower activities of cellular lysosomal hydrolases. Physiologically, the inhibition of intracellular retromer activity by Tip is ultimately linked to the downregulation of CD4 surface expression and to the efficient <I>in vitro</I> immortalization of primary human T cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2)-independent permanent growth. Therefore, HVS Tip uniquely targets the retromer complex to impair the intracellular trafficking functions of infected cells, ultimately contributing to efficient T cell transformation.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10639?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The influenza A virus NS1 protein contains a conserved 4-amino-acid-residue PDZ-ligand binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus that can function as a virulence determinant by targeting cellular PDZ proteins. The NS1 proteins from avian and human viral isolates have consensus PBM sequences ESEV and RSKV, respectively. Currently circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses contain the ESEV PBM which specifically associates with the PDZ proteins Scribble, Dlg1, MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3. In this study, we found NS1 proteins from viral isolates that contain the PBM sequence RSKV, KSEV, or EPEV are unable to associate with these PDZ proteins. Other results showed that the ESEV PBM mediates an indirect association with PDZ protein, Lin7C, via an interaction with Dlg1. Infection with a virus that expresses a NS1 protein with the ESEV PBM results in colocalization of NS1, Scribble, and Dlg1 within perinuclear puncta and mislocalization of plasma membrane-associated Lin7C to the cytoplasm. Infection of polarized MDCK cells with the ESEV virus additionally results in functional disruption of the tight junction (TJ) as measured by altered localization of TJ markers ZO-1 and Occludin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-inulin diffusion across the polarized cell monolayer. A similar effect on the TJ was observed in MDCK cells depleted for either Scribble or Dlg1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA). These findings indicate that ESEV PBM-mediated binding of NS1 to Scribble and Dlg1 functions to disrupt the cellular TJ and that this effect likely contributes to the severe disease associated with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10649?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Although members of a virus family produce similar gene products, those products may have quite different functions. Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LT), for example, targets p53 directly, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. SV40 small T antigen (SVST) has received considerable attention because of its ability to contribute to transformation of human cells. Here, we show that there are major differences between SVST and polyomavirus small T antigen (POLST) in their effects on differentiation, transformation, and cell survival. Both SVST and POLST induce cell cycle progression. However, POLST also inhibits differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and C2C12 myoblasts. Additionally, POLST induces apoptosis of mouse embryo fibroblasts. SVST reduces the proapoptotic transcriptional activity of FOXO1 through phosphorylation. On the other hand, SVST complements large T antigen and Ras for the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), but POLST does not. Mechanistically, the differences between SVST and POLST may lie in utilization of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). POLST binds both A&alpha; and A&beta; scaffolding subunits of PP2A while SVST binds only A&alpha;. Knockdown of A&beta; could mimic POLST-induced apoptosis. The two small T antigens can target different proteins for dephosphorylation. POLST binds and dephosphorylates substrates, such as lipins, that SVST does not.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10659?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The interferon-inducible antiviral factor BST-2 prevents several enveloped viruses, including HIV, from escaping infected cells. The HIV protein Vpu antagonizes this host defense. Little is known about the expression of BST-2 during HIV infection <I>in vivo</I> and whether it can be modulated to the host's advantage. We studied the expression of BST-2 on blood cells from HIV-infected patients during the acute and chronic phases of disease as well as after antiretroviral treatment (ART). The expression of BST-2 was increased on mononuclear leukocytes, including CD4-positive T lymphocytes from HIV-positive patients, compared to that on cells of uninfected controls. The expression of BST-2 was highest during acute infection and decreased to levels similar to those of uninfected individuals after ART. Treatment of primary blood mononuclear cells <I>in vitro</I> with alpha interferon or with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists increased the expression of BST-2 to levels similar to those found during infection <I>in vivo</I>. The interferon-induced levels were sufficient to overcome the Vpu protein <I>in vitro</I>, reducing the release of wild-type HIV. These data show that BST-2 is upregulated during HIV infection, consistent with its role as an interferon-stimulated gene. The data further suggest that this upregulation is sufficient to saturate the activity of Vpu and inhibit wild-type HIV.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The great majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains enter CD4<sup>+</sup> target cells by interacting with one of two coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. Here we describe a transmitted/founder (T/F) virus (ZP6248) that was profoundly impaired in its ability to utilize CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors on multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> cell lines as well as primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages <I>in vitro</I> yet replicated to very high titers (&gt;80 million RNA copies/ml) in an acutely infected individual. Interestingly, the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of this clade B virus had a rare GPEK sequence in the crown of its third variable loop (V3) rather than the consensus GPGR sequence. Extensive sequencing of sequential plasma samples showed that the GPEK sequence was present in virtually all Envs, including those from the earliest time points after infection. The molecularly cloned (single) T/F virus was able to replicate, albeit poorly, in cells obtained from <I>ccr5</I><I>32</I> homozygous donors. The ZP6248 T/F virus could also infect cell lines overexpressing the alternative coreceptors GPR15, APJ, and FPRL-1. A single mutation in the V3 crown sequence (GPEK-&gt;GPGK) of ZP6248 restored its infectivity in CCR5<sup>+</sup> cells but reduced its ability to replicate in GPR15<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that the V3 crown motif played an important role in usage of this alternative coreceptor. These results suggest that the ZP6248 T/F virus established an acute <I>in vivo</I> infection by using coreceptor(s) other than CCR5 or CXCR4 or that the CCR5 coreceptor existed in an unusual conformation in this individual.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10682?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus associated with sporadic outbreaks in human and equid populations in the Western Hemisphere. After the bite of an infected mosquito, the virus initiates a biphasic disease: a peripheral phase with viral replication in lymphoid and myeloid tissues, followed by a neurotropic phase with infection of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, causing neuropathology and in some cases fatal encephalitis. The mechanisms allowing VEE virus to enter the CNS are currently poorly understood. Previous data have shown that the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal mucosa of mice. However, at day 5 after inoculation, the infection of the brain is multifocal, indicating that virus particles are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To better understand the role of the BBB during VEE virus infection, we used a well-characterized mouse model system. Using VEE virus replicon particles (VRP), we modeled the early events of neuroinvasion, showing that the replication of VRP in the nasal mucosa induced the opening of the BBB, allowing peripherally administered VRP to invade the brain. Peripheral VEE virus infection was characterized by a biphasic opening of the BBB. Further, inhibition of BBB opening resulted in a delayed viral neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. Overall, these results suggest that VEE virus initially enters the CNS through the olfactory pathways and initiates viral replication in the brain, which induces the opening of the BBB, allowing a second wave of invading virus from the periphery to enter the brain.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10691?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of clade 2.2 spread from Southeast Asia to Europe. Intriguingly, in contrast to all common avian strains specifying glutamic acid at position 627 of the PB2 protein (PB2-627E), they carry a lysine at this position (PB2-627K), which is normally found only in human strains. To analyze the impact of this mutation on the host range of HPAIV H5N1, we altered PB2-627K to PB2-627E in the European isolate A/Swan/Germany/R65/2006 (R65). In contrast to the parental R65, multicycle growth and polymerase activity of the resulting mutant R65-PB2<SUB>K627E</SUB> were considerably impaired in mammalian but not in avian cells. Correspondingly, the 50% lethal dose (LD<SUB>50</SUB>) in mice was increased by three orders of magnitude, whereas virulence in chicken remained unchanged, resulting in 100% lethality, as was found for the parental R65. Strikingly, R65-PB2<SUB>K627E</SUB> reverted to PB2-627K after only one passage in mice but did not revert in chickens. To investigate whether additional R65 genes influence reversion, we passaged R65-PB2<SUB>K627E</SUB> reassortants containing genes from A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) (carrying PB2-627E), in avian and mammalian cells. Reversion to PB2-627K in mammalian cells required the presence of the R65 nucleoprotein (NP). This finding corresponds to results of others that during replication of avian strains in mammalian cells, PB2-627K restores an impaired PB2-NP association. Since this mutation is apparently not detrimental for virus prevalence in birds, it has not been eliminated. However, the prompt reversion to PB2-627K in MDCK cells and mice suggests that the clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAIV may have had a history of intermediate mammalian hosts.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10699?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Macrophage tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is distinct from coreceptor specificity of the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env), but the virus-cell interactions that contribute to efficient HIV-1 entry into macrophages, particularly via CXCR4, are not well understood. Here, we characterized a panel of HIV-1 Envs that use CCR5 (<I>n</I> = 14) or CXCR4 (<I>n</I> = 6) to enter monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) with various degrees of efficiency. Our results show that efficient CCR5-mediated MDM entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses is associated with increased tolerance of several mutations within the CCR5 N terminus. In contrast, efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry was associated with reduced tolerance of a large deletion within the CXCR4 N terminus. Env sequence analysis and structural modeling identified amino acid variants at positions 261 and 263 within the gp41-interactive region of gp120 and a variant at position 326 within the gp120 V3 loop that were associated with efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry. Mutagenesis studies showed that the gp41 interaction domain variants exert a significant but strain-specific influence on CXCR4-mediated MDM entry, suggesting that the structural integrity of the gp120-gp41 interface is important for efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry of certain HIV-1 strains. However, the presence of Ile326 in the gp120 V3 loop stem, which we show by molecular modeling is located at the gp120-coreceptor interface and predicted to interact with the CXCR4 N terminus, was found to be critical for efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry of divergent CXCR4-using Envs. Together, the results of our study provide novel insights into alternative mechanisms of Env-coreceptor engagement that are associated with efficient CCR5- and CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 entry into macrophages.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Proteolytic processing of viral membrane proteins is common among enveloped viruses and facilitates virus entry. The <I>Autographa californica</I> multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) occlusion-derived virus (ODV) protein P74 is part of a complex of essential peroral infectivity factors (PIFs). Here we report that P74 is efficiently cleaved into two fragments of about equal size by an occlusion body (OB) endogenous alkaline protease during ODV release when AcMNPV OBs are derived from larvae. The cleavage is specific for P74, since the other known peroral infectivity factors in the same complex (PIF1, PIF2, and PIF3) were not cleaved under the same conditions. P74 cleavage was not observed in OBs produced in three different insect cell lines, suggesting a larval host origin of the responsible protease. P74 in OBs produced in larvae of two different host species was cleaved into fragments with the same apparent molecular mass, indicating that the virus incorporates a similar alkaline protease from different hosts. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the two P74 subunit fragments remain associated with the recently discovered PIF complex. We propose that under <I>in vivo</I> ODV infection conditions, P74 undergoes two sequential cleavage events, the first one being performed by an ODV-associated host alkaline protease and the second carried out by trypsin in the host midgut.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10719?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of an aggressive malignancy of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. Since the viral transactivator Tax-1 is a major player in T-cell transformation, targeting Tax-1 protein is regarded as a possible strategy to arrest viral replication and to counteract neoplastic transformation. We demonstrate that CIITA, the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II gene transcription, inhibits HTLV-1 replication by blocking the transactivating function of Tax-1 both when exogenously transfected in 293T cells and when endogenously expressed by a subset of U937 promonocytic cells. Tax-1 and CIITA physically interact <I>in vivo</I> via the first 108 amino acids of Tax-1 and two CIITA adjacent regions (amino acids 1 to 252 and 253 to 410). Interestingly, only CIITA 1-252 mediated Tax-1 inhibition, in agreement with the fact that CIITA residues from positions 64 to 124 were required to block Tax-1 transactivation. CIITA inhibitory action on Tax-1 correlated with the nuclear localization of CIITA and was independent of the transcription factor NF-YB, previously involved in CIITA-mediated inhibition of Tax-2 of HTLV-2. Instead, CIITA severely impaired the physical and functional interaction of Tax-1 with the cellular coactivators p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), which are required for the optimal activation of HTLV-1 promoter. Accordingly, the overexpression of PCAF, CREB, and ATF1 restored Tax-1-dependent transactivation of the viral long-terminal-repeat promoter inhibited by CIITA. These findings strongly support our original observation that CIITA, beside increasing the antigen-presenting function for pathogen antigens, acts as an endogenous restriction factor against human retroviruses by blocking virus replication and spreading.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10730?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>A series of potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target quaternary epitopes on the native Env trimer have recently been described. A common feature shared by these antibodies is the critical involvement of sites in both the V2 and V3 variable domains in antibody recognition. In this study the gp120 variable-region determinants were mapped for eight rhesus macaque monoclonal antibodies (RhMAbs) possessing potently neutralizing activity specific for a quaternary target in SF162 Env and compared to those originally identified for human MAb 2909. These studies showed that determinants for the epitopes defined by the RhMAbs differed in both the V2 (positions 160, 167, and 169) and V3 (positions 313 and 315) regions from 2909, and in a number of cases, from each other. Attempts to reconstitute expression of these epitopes on the cell surface by cotransfecting Envs containing either the V2 or the V3 determinant of the epitope were not successful, suggesting that these epitopes were expressed on individual protomers in a trimer-dependent manner. Several of the V2 positions found to be critical for expression of these quaternary epitopes also significantly affected exposure and neutralization sensitivity of targets in the V3 and CD4-binding domains. These results demonstrated a considerable diversity in the fine structure of this class of epitopes and further suggested a potentially important relationship between the expression of such quaternary epitopes and V1/V2-mediated masking of immunodominant epitopes.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10741?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a <I>Picornaviridae</I> virus, has a wide host spectrum and can cause various diseases. EMCV virulence factors, however, are as yet ill defined. Here, we demonstrate that the EMCV 2A protein is essential for the pathogenesis of EMCV. Infection of mice with the B279/95 strain of EMCV resulted in acute fatal disease, while the clone C9, derived by serial <I>in vitro</I> passage of the B279/95 strain, was avirulent. C9 harbored a large deletion in the gene encoding the 2A protein. This deletion was incorporated into the cDNA of a pathogenic EMCV1.26 strain. The new virus, EMCV1.262A, was capable of replicating <I>in vitro</I>, albeit more slowly than EMCV1.26. Only mice inoculated with EMCV1.26 triggered death within a few days. Mice infected with EMCV1.262A did not exhibit clinical signs, and histopathological analyses showed no damage in the central nervous system, unlike EMCV1.26-infected mice. <I>In vitro</I>, EMCV1.262A presented a defect in viral particle release correlating with prolonged cell viability. Unlike EMCV1.26, which induced cytopathic cell death, EMCV1.262A induced apoptosis via caspase 3 activation. This strongly suggests that the 2A protein is required for inhibition of apoptosis during EMCV infection. All together, our data indicate that the EMCV 2A protein is important for the virus in counteracting host defenses, since 2A viruses were no longer pathogenic and were unable to inhibit apoptosis <I>in vitro</I>.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10755?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 is constantly changing, mainly as a result of human migratory flows and the high adaptive ability of the virus. In recent years, Spain has become one of Europe's main destinations for immigrants and one of the western European countries with the highest rates of HIV-positive patients. Using a phylogeographic approach, we have analyzed the relationship between HIV-1 variants detected in immigrant and native populations of the urban area of Madrid. Our project was based on two coincidental facts. First, resistance tests were extended to na&iuml;ve and newly diagnosed patients, and second, the Spanish government legislated the provision of legal status to many immigrants. This allowed us to obtain a large data set (<I>n</I> = 2,792) from 11 Madrid hospitals of viral <I>pol</I> sequences from the two populations, and with this unique material, we explored the impact of immigration in the epidemiological trends of HIV-1 variants circulating in the largest Spanish city. The prevalence of infections by non-B HIV-1 variants in the studied cohort was 9%, rising to 25% among native Spanish patients. Multiple transmission events involving different lineages and subsubtypes were observed in all the subtypes and recombinant forms studied. Our results also revealed strong social clustering among the most recent immigrant groups, such as Russians and Romanians, but not in those groups who have lived in Madrid for many years. Additionally, we document for the first time the presence of CRF47_BF and CRF38_BF in Europe, and a new BG recombinant form found in Spaniards and Africans is tentatively proposed. These results suggest that the HIV-1 epidemic will evolve toward a more complex epidemiological landscape.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10764?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Members of the <I>Enterovirus</I> genus of the <I>Picornaviridae</I> family are abundant, with common human pathogens that belong to the rhinovirus (HRV) and enterovirus (EV) species, including diverse echo-, coxsackie- and polioviruses. They cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe diseases with neurological and/or cardiac manifestations. Pandemic outbreaks of EVs may be accompanied by meningitis and/or paralysis and can be fatal. However, no effective prophylaxis or antiviral treatment against most EVs is available. The EV RNA genome directs the synthesis of a single polyprotein that is autocatalytically processed into mature proteins at GlnGly cleavage sites by the 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>), which has narrow, conserved substrate specificity. These cleavages are essential for virus replication, making 3C<sup>pro</sup> an excellent target for antivirus drug development. In this study, we report the first determination of the crystal structure of 3C<sup>pro</sup> from an enterovirus B, EV-93, a recently identified pathogen, alone and in complex with the anti-HRV molecules compound 1 (AG7404) and rupintrivir (AG7088) at resolutions of 1.9, 1.3, and 1.5 &Aring;, respectively. The EV-93 3C<sup>pro</sup> adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with a canonically configured oxyanion hole and a substrate binding pocket similar to that of rhino-, coxsackie- and poliovirus 3C proteases. We show that compound 1 and rupintrivir are both active against EV-93 in infected cells and inhibit the proteolytic activity of EV-93 3C<sup>pro</sup> <I>in vitro</I>. These results provide a framework for further structure-guided optimization of the tested compounds to produce antiviral drugs against a broad range of EV species.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Adenoviruses (AdVs) broadly infect vertebrate hosts, including a variety of nonhuman primates (NHPs). In the present study, we identified AdVs in NHPs living in their natural habitats, and through the combination of phylogenetic analyses and information on the habitats and epidemiological settings, we detected possible horizontal transmission events between NHPs and humans. Wild NHPs were analyzed with a pan-primate AdV-specific PCR using a degenerate nested primer set that targets the highly conserved adenovirus DNA polymerase gene. A plethora of novel AdV sequences were identified, representing at least 45 distinct AdVs. From the AdV-positive individuals, 29 nearly complete hexon genes were amplified and, based on phylogenetic analysis, tentatively allocated to all known human AdV species (<I>Human adenovirus A</I> to <I>Human adenovirus G</I> [HAdV-A to -G]) as well as to the only simian AdV species (<I>Simian adenovirus A</I> [SAdV-A]). Interestingly, five of the AdVs detected in great apes grouped into the HAdV-A, HAdV-D, HAdV-F, or SAdV-A clade. Furthermore, we report the first detection of AdVs in New World monkeys, clustering at the base of the primate AdV evolutionary tree. Most notably, six chimpanzee AdVs of species HAdV-A to HAdV-F revealed a remarkably close relationship to human AdVs, possibly indicating recent interspecies transmission events.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10785?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>HIV-1 entry into target cells requires the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. This process is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, and a first-generation fusion inhibitor, T20 (Enfuvirtide; Fuzeon), was approved for clinical use in 2003. Second-generation (T1249) and third-generation (T2635) fusion inhibitors with improved stability and potency were developed. Resistance to T20 and T1249 usually requires one or two amino acid changes within the binding site. We studied the <I>in vitro</I> evolution of resistance against T2635. After 6 months of culturing, a multitude of resistance mutations was identified in all gp41 subdomains, but no single mutation provided meaningful T2635 resistance. In contrast, multiple mutations within gp41 were required for resistance, and this was accompanied by a dramatic loss of viral infectivity. Because most of the escape mutations were situated outside the T2635 binding site, a decrease in drug target affinity cannot account for most of the resistance. T2635 resistance is likely to depend on altered kinetics of six-helix bundle formation, thus limiting the time window for T2635 to interfere with membrane fusion. Interestingly, the loss of virus infectivity caused by T2635 resistance mutations in gp41 was partially compensated for by a mutation at the base of the V3 domain in gp120. Thus, escape from the third-generation HIV-1 fusion inhibitor T2635 is mechanistically distinct from resistance against its predecessors T20 and T1249. It requires the accumulation of multiple mutations in gp41, is accompanied with a dramatic loss of gp41 function, and induces compensatory mutations in gp120.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>We estimate the time required for HIV to complete separate stages of its infection cycle in productively infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <I>in vivo</I> by comparing initial delays after administration of single antiretroviral drugs until HIV RNA reduction in peripheral blood. Data were obtained from monotherapy studies of eight antiretroviral drugs from all currently licensed HIV drug classes: CCR5 blockers (maraviroc), fusion inhibitors (enfuvirtide), nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, tenofovir, and rilpivirine), integrase inhibitors (raltegravir), and protease inhibitors (ritonavir and nelfinavir). We find that HIV requires an average of 52 h between export of virions in one generation to export in the next, with most of this (33 h) taken up by reverse transcription. Reverse transcription <I>in vivo</I> was three times longer than <I>in vitro</I> and began soon after virion fusion, as we determined no difference in mean times for commencement of reverse transcription and virion fusion as calculated by timing of the effects for tenofovir and maraviroc. Approximately 7 h is required between HIV integration and virion production. First-phase HIV RNA decay (half-life of 17 h over all drugs) seemed to slow as the stage being inhibited by the drug was further from viral production. The mean estimated half-life of plasma virions was 5 min, significantly shorter than previous estimates.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>In response to viral infection, reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate innate immune signaling or generate danger signals to activate immune cells. The mechanisms of virally induced ROS are poorly defined, however. We demonstrate that ROS are produced within minutes of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) infection of macrophages and that oxidative stress supports Ad5-induced cytokine secretion. We show that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of TLR9 has no effect on ROS production despite observed decreases in Ad-induced cytokine secretion. A major source of ROS in macrophages is NADPH oxidase. However, shRNA knockdown of the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX2 does not attenuate Ad-induced ROS. Induction of ROS is not observed in cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ad2, <I>ts</I>1, which is defective in endosomal membrane penetration during cell entry. Further, Ad5, but not <I>ts</I>1, induces the release of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytoplasm of infected cells. In agreement with this finding, we observe a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential upon Ad infection which requires Ad endosomal membrane penetration and cathepsin B activity. Overexpression of Bcl-2 attenuates Ad5-induced ROS, further supporting the role for mitochondrial membrane destabilization as the source of ROS in response to Ad5 infection. Together, these data suggest that ROS produced in response to Ad5 infection depends on the virally induced endosomal membrane rupture to release lysosomal cathepsins. Furthermore, the release of cathepsins leads to mitochondrial membrane disruption and thus the release of ROS from the mitochondria.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Myxoma virus is a rabbit poxvirus that belongs to the <I>Leporipoxvirus</I> genus. It causes a lethal disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits but cannot sustain any detectable infection in nonlagomorphs. Vaccinia virus is a prototypal orthopoxvirus that was used as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox. Myxoma virus is nonpathogenic in mice, whereas systemic infection with vaccinia virus can be lethal even in immunocompetent mice. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are potent type I interferon (IFN)-producing cells that play important roles in antiviral innate immunity. How poxviruses are sensed by pDCs to induce type I IFN production is not well understood. Here we report that infection of primary murine pDCs with myxoma virus, but not with vaccinia virus, induces IFN-&alpha;, IFN-&beta;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) production. Using pDCs derived from genetic knockout mice, we show that the myxoma virus-induced innate immune response requires the endosomal DNA sensor TLR9 and its adaptor MyD88, transcription factors IRF5 and IRF7, and the type I IFN positive-feedback loop mediated by IFNAR1. It is independent of the cytoplasmic RNA sensing pathway mediated by the mitochondrial adaptor molecule MAVS, the TLR3 adaptor TRIF, or the transcription factor IRF3. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that myxoma virus-induced type I IFN and IL-12p70 production in murine pDCs is also dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. Furthermore, our results reveal that the N-terminal Z-DNA/RNA binding domain of vaccinia virulence factor E3, which is missing in the orthologous M029 protein expressed by myxoma virus, plays an inhibitory role in poxvirus sensing and innate cytokine production by murine pDCs.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>While the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype has been associated with the rate of HIV disease progression in untreated patients, little is known regarding these relationships in patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The limited data reported to date identified few HLA-HIV disease associations in patients using HAART and even occasional associations that were opposite of those found in untreated patients. We conducted high-resolution HLA class I and II genotyping in a random sample (<I>n</I> = 860) of HIV-seropositive women enrolled in a long-term cohort initiated in 1994. HLA-HIV disease associations before and after initiation of HAART were examined using multivariate analyses. In untreated HIV-seropositive patients, we observed many of the predicted associations, consistent with prior studies. For example, HLA-B*57 (&beta; = &ndash;0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = &ndash;0.9 to &ndash;0.5; <I>P</I> = 5 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;11</sup>) and Bw4 (&beta; = &ndash;0.2; 95% CI = &ndash;0.4 to &ndash;0.1; <I>P</I> = 0.009) were inversely associated with baseline HIV viral load, and B*57 was associated with a low risk of rapid CD4<sup>+</sup> decline (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.6; <I>P</I> = 0.002). Conversely, in treated patients, the odds of a virological response to HAART were lower for B*57:01 (OR = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.0 to 0.9; <I>P</I> = 0.03), and Bw4 (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1 to 1.0; <I>P</I> = 0.04) was associated with low odds of an immunological response. The associations of HLA genotype with HIV disease are different and sometimes even opposite in treated and untreated patients.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Sexually transmitted pathogens activate HIV-1 replication and inflammatory gene expression in macrophages through engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ligand-activated nuclear receptor (NR) transcription factors, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR), and liver X receptor (LXR), are potent inhibitors of TLR-induced inflammatory gene expression. We therefore hypothesized that ligand-activated NRs repress both basal and pathogen-enhanced HIV-1 replication in macrophages by directly repressing HIV-1 transcription and by ameliorating the local proinflammatory response to pathogens. We show that the TLR2 ligand PAM3CSK4 activated virus transcription in macrophages and that NR signaling repressed both basal and TLR-induced HIV-1 transcription. NR ligand treatment repressed HIV-1 expression when added concurrently with TLR ligands and in the presence of cycloheximide, demonstrating that they act independently of new cellular gene expression. We found that treatment with NR ligands inhibited the association of AP-1 and NF-B subunits, as well as the coactivator CBP, with the long terminal repeat (LTR). We show for the first time that the nuclear corepressor NCoR is bound to HIV-1 LTR in unstimulated macrophages and is released from the LTR after TLR engagement. Treatment with PPAR and LXR ligands, but not GR ligands, prevented this TLR-induced clearance of NCoR from the LTR. Our data demonstrate that both classical and nonclassical <I>trans</I>-repression mechanisms account for NR-mediated HIV-1 repression. Finally, NR ligand treatment inhibited the potent proinflammatory response induced by PAM3CSK4 that would otherwise activate HIV-1 expression in infected cells. Our findings provide a rationale for studying ligand-activated NRs as modulators of basal and inflammation-induced HIV-1 replication.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The MA domain of the retroviral Gag protein mediates interactions with the plasma membrane, which is the site of productive virus release. HIV-1 MA has a phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<SUB>2</SUB>] binding pocket; depletion of this phospholipid from the plasma membrane compromises Gag membrane association and virus budding. We used multiple methods to examine the possible role of PI(4,5)P<SUB>2</SUB> in Gag-membrane interaction of the alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). In contrast to HIV-1, which was tested in parallel, neither membrane localization of RSV Gag-GFP nor release of virus-like particles was affected by phosphatase-mediated depletion of PI(4,5)P<SUB>2</SUB> in transfected avian cells. In liposome flotation experiments, RSV Gag required acidic lipids for binding but showed no specificity for PI(4,5)P<SUB>2</SUB>. Mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) species as well as high concentrations of phosphatidylserine (PS) supported similar levels of flotation. A mutation that increases the overall charge of RSV MA also enhanced Gag membrane binding. Contrary to previous reports, we found that high concentrations of PS, in the absence of PIPs, also strongly promoted HIV-1 Gag flotation. Taken together, we interpret these results to mean that RSV Gag membrane association is driven by electrostatic interactions and not by any specific association with PI(4,5)P<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10861?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are potent and commonly prescribed antiviral agents used in combination therapy (CART) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The development of drug resistance is a major limitation of CART. Reverse transcriptase (RT) genotypes with the NNRTI resistance mutations K101E+G190S are highly resistant to efavirenz (EFV) and can develop during failure of EFV-containing regimens in patients. We have previously shown that virus with K101E+G190S mutations can replicate more efficiently in the presence of EFV than in its absence. In this study, we evaluated the underlying mechanism for drug-dependent stimulation, using a single-cycle cell culture assay in which EFV was added either during the infection or the virus production step. We determined that EFV stimulates K101E+G190S virus during early infection and does not affect late steps of virus replication, such as increasing the amount of active RT incorporated into virions. Additionally, we showed that another NNRTI, nevirapine (NVP), stimulated K101E+G190S virus replication during the early steps of infection similar to EFV, but that the newest NNRTI, etravirine (ETR), did not. We also showed that EFV stimulates K101E+Y188L and K101E+V106I virus, but not K101E+L100I, K101E+K103N, K101E+Y181C, or K101E+G190A virus, suggesting that the stimulation is mutation specific. Real-time PCR of reverse transcription intermediates showed that although the drug did not stimulate minus-strand transfer, it did stimulate minus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis. Our results indicate that stimulation most likely occurs through a mechanism whereby NNRTIs stimulate priming or elongation of the tRNA.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) from the HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C species use encoded proteases, 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>, to process their polyproteins and shut off host cell activities detrimental to virus replication. Reactions attributed to 2A<sup>pro</sup> include cleavage of eIF4G-I and -II to inhibit cellular mRNA translation and cleavage of select nucleoporin proteins (Nups) within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to disrupt karyopherin-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and signaling. Sequence diversity among 2A<sup>pro</sup> proteases from different HRV clades, even within species, suggested individual viruses might carry out these processes with unique mechanistic signatures. Six different recombinant 2A<sup>pro</sup> proteases (A16, A89, B04, B14, Cw12, and Cw24) were compared for their relative substrate preferences and cleavage kinetics using eIF4G from cellular extracts and Nups presented in native (NPC) or recombinant formats. The enzyme panel attacked these substrates with different rates or processing profiles, mimicking the preferences observed during natural infection (A16 and B14). For eIF4G, all 2A<sup>pro</sup> proteases cleaved at similar sites, but the comparative rates were species specific (HRV-A &gt; HRV-C &gt;&gt; HRV-B). For Nup substrates, 5 of the 6 enzymes had unique product profiles (order of Nup selection) or reacted at different sites within Nup62, Nup98, and Nup153. Only A16 and A89 behaved similarly in most assays. Since each type of karyopherin receptor prefers particular Nups or uses a limited cohort of binding motifs within those Nups, the consequences of individual 2A<sup>pro</sup> avidities could profoundly affect relative viral replication levels, intracellular signaling, or extracellular signaling, all of which are underlying triggers for different host immune responses.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains the leading viral cause of birth defects and life-threatening disease in transplant recipients. All approved antiviral drugs target the viral DNA polymerase and are associated with severe toxicity issues and the emergence of drug resistance. Attempts to discover improved anti-HCMV drugs led to the identification of the small-molecular-weight compound AIC246 (Letermovir). AIC246 exhibits outstanding anti-HCMV activity <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> and currently is undergoing a clinical phase IIb trial. The initial mode-of-action studies suggested that the drug acts late in the HCMV replication cycle via a mechanism distinct from that of polymerase inhibitors. Here, we extend our mode-of-action analyses and report that AIC246 blocks viral replication without inhibiting the synthesis of progeny HCMV DNA or viral proteins. The genotyping of mutant viruses that escaped AIC246 inhibition uncovered distinct point mutations in the UL56 subunit of the viral terminase complex. Marker transfer analyses confirmed that these mutations were sufficient to mediate AIC246 resistance. The mapping of drug resistance to open reading frame UL56 suggests that viral DNA processing and/or packaging is targeted by AIC246. In line with this, we demonstrate that AIC246 affects the formation of proper unit-length genomes from viral DNA concatemers and interferes with virion maturation. However, since AIC246-resistant viruses do not exhibit cross-resistance to previously published terminase inhibitors, our data suggest that AIC246 interferes with HCMV DNA cleavage/packaging via a molecular mechanism that is distinct from that of other compound classes known to target the viral terminase.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Viruses commonly use host cell survival mechanisms to their own advantage. We show that Akt, an important signaling kinase involved in cell survival, phosphorylates the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from norovirus, the major cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. The Akt phosphorylation of RdRp appears to be a feature unique to the more prevalent norovirus genotypes such as GII.4 and GII.b. This phosphorylation event occurs at a residue (Thr33) located at the interface where the RdRp finger and thumb domains interact and decreases <I>de novo</I> activity of the polymerase. This finding provides fresh insights into virus-host cell interactions.</p>

<p>Virus infection triggers interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune defenses in part through viral nucleic acid interactions. However, the immune recognition mechanisms by which the host identifies incoming DNA viruses are still elusive. Here, we show that increased levels of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) persistency are observed in retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-deficient cells and that KSHV ORF64, a tegument protein with deubiqutinase (DUB) activity, suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling by reducing the ubiquitination of RIG-I, crucial for its activation. This study suggests that RIG-I plays a potential role in sensing KSHV infection and that KSHV ORF64 DUB counteracts RIG-I signaling.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The conserved influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain elicits cross-reactive antibodies, but epitopes in the globular head typically elicit strain-specific responses because of the hypervariability of this region. We isolated human monoclonal antibody 5J8, which neutralized a broad spectrum of 20th century H1N1 viruses and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Fine mapping of the interaction unexpectedly revealed a novel epitope between the receptor-binding pocket and the Ca<SUB>2</SUB> antigenic site on HA. This antibody exposes a new mechanism underlying broad immunity against H1N1 influenza viruses and identifies a conserved epitope that might be incorporated into engineered H1 virus vaccines.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV) has been amplified from human prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patient samples. Other studies failed to replicate these findings and suggested PCR contamination with a prostate cancer cell line, 22Rv1, as a likely source. MLV-like sequences have also been detected in CFS patients in longitudinal samples 15 years apart. Here, we tested whether sequence data from these samples are consistent with viral evolution. Our phylogenetic analyses strongly reject a model of within-patient evolution and demonstrate that the sequences from the first and second time points represent distinct endogenous murine retroviruses, suggesting contamination.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Hepatocyte transduction following intravenous administration of adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is mediated by interaction between coagulation factor X (FX) and the hexon. The FX serine protease (SP) domain tethers the Ad5/FX complex to hepatocytes through binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we identify the critical HSPG-interacting residues of FX. We generated an FX mutant by modifying seven residues in the SP domain. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that mutations did not affect binding to Ad5. FX-mediated, HSPG-associated cell binding and transduction were abolished. A cluster of basic amino acids in the SP domain therefore mediates surface interaction of the Ad/FX complex.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The mechanisms by which gammaherpesviruses maintain latency are unclear. Here we used a murine gammaherpesvirus model to show that previously uninfected B cells in immunocompetent mice can acquire virus during latency. <I>In vivo</I> depletion of T cells allowed viral reactivation, as measured by increased viral loads, but not enhanced transfer of virus to new cells. In the absence of both immune T cells and antibody following the transfer of latently infected cells into na&iuml;ve animals, there was robust infection of new B cells. These data confirm that both T cells and antibody contribute to the control of gammaherpesvirus latency, reactivation, and spread.</p>

<link>http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/short/85/20/10926?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>We previously found that enveloped virus binding and penetration are necessary to initiate an interferon-independent, IRF3-mediated antiviral response. To investigate whether membrane perturbations that accompany membrane fusion-dependent enveloped-virus entry are necessary and sufficient for antiviral-state induction, we utilized a reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein. Membrane disturbances during FAST protein-mediated fusion, in the absence of additional innate immune response triggers, are sufficient to elicit interferon-stimulated gene induction and establishment of an antiviral state. Using sensors of membrane disruption to activate an IRF3-dependent, interferon-independent antiviral state may provide cells with a rapid, broad-spectrum innate immune response to enveloped-virus infections.</p>
