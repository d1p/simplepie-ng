          Had a little trip up to the Peak District this week. The weather was pretty bad till the last day so didn't get the camera out as much as I wanted to, but managed to grab a few decent scenic shots on a walk just before we came home. Not easy hill walking with a baby on my back and carrying camera gear though!<br/><br/>See the full set at:<br/><br/>www.jimmydickinson.co.uk/peak_district

          Went for a quick trip to Bristol Aquarium to see the sea life. Very challenging conditions to shoot in with the extreme lighting conditions and those fish just don't stay still!

          I was getting an itchy trigger finger having not been out with the camera for a while so just rattled off a few more shots of Mia having fun with her toys.

      <title>Big Stopper Test</title>

          I have wanted to try my hand at long exposure shots for some time now so took the plunge and invested in a 'Big Stopper' 10 stop ND filter last week. Need to get to the coast to be able to really test it out and my ability to use it, but had a very quick go at a lake near me over the weekend.<br/><br/>The pictures don't have the drama of silky smooth waves crashing on to rocks (which I will get as soon as possible), but they do show the potential for this strength of ND filter. The water on the lake looks so glossy and the clouds have a nice motion trail even though there was hardly any wind.<br/><br/>Can't wait to cut my teeth properly with a good subject now!
