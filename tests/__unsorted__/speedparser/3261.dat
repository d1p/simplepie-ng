The disc is 1/4&amp;quot; wide and the band is about 1.23 mm wide. This ring stacks beautifully but has enough of its own presence to stand alone. Still dainty, just a little bit more &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;. Compare it with my original initial ring that&amp;#39;s a bit tinier: http://www.etsy.com/listing/61460247/sterling-silver-stacking-ring-with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ring is made to order just for you, so each one will have slight differences inherent to the handmade process.

        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img0.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.187618588.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$110.00&lt;br /&gt;Personalized Wedding Ring. This duck band ring makes a Special gift from the bride to the groom! This amazing and unique handmade rustic sterling ring is 14mm wide and stamped like the bands that naturalists and biologists use to &amp;quot;band&amp;quot; wild birds for research. Born out of a customer&amp;#39;s special request for a unique wedding band, this ring says &amp;quot;Banded by Susan, Emmitsville MD, 091606&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customize your ring with the name of your spouse, the place you were &amp;quot;banded&amp;quot;, and the date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike actual bird bands that are open in the back, this unique band is forged in the traditional way for humans. :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All rings are made to order in your size. For your own benefit, please be sure of your ring size when ordering. Give me your normal ring size and I will add in the appropriate amount of ease for a wide ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a special box for gift giving?

        <title>Mens Ring Rustic Distressed Sterling Band</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img1.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.256088549.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$56.00&lt;br /&gt;Mens Ring. This is my unique rustic distressed design in a heavier gauge and slightly narrower width. The marks of the hammer make a beautiful design on the ring, which is oxidized darkly and swiped with a bit of steel wool to give it even more character. The oxidation on this ring will fade over time, revealing even more of the inherent beauty of the ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a unique wedding band - and at 1mm thick is durable enough to stand the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can make this ring in any size for you including 1/4 and 1/2 sizes. Please be sure of your ring size when ordering, since your ring is made to order and one of a kind, there is a fee to resize it.

Looking for a unique bridesmaid gift or special mothers ring? This is my recycled sterling silver ring - it is an original design!

This ring looks like antique gold, with dark oxidation giving way to golden highlights that make a wonderful dimensional quality. This would make a unique but affordable wedding ring for the couple on a budget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your oxidized renaissance ring is about 4mm wide by 1.1mm thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure of your ring size when ordering - made to order rings carry a fee for resizing.

        <title>Mens ring black ring silver</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://img2.etsystatic.com/il_155x125.260173702.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$27.00&lt;br /&gt;Mens ring. This cool little rustic sterling silver band is all nicked up and hammered like a men&amp;#39;s ring for a distressed look, then deep oxidized and rubbed with steel wool to bring out the dimensional qualities. Many have purchased to use for a unique wedding band (though if you&amp;#39;re tough on your hands, try this one instead: http://www.etsy.com/listing/77483239/unique-rustic-distressed-sterling-band)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&amp;#39;s lightweight, comfortable, and casual enough to wear anytime for a man or woman. Great for jewelry lovers on a budget! I cut this ring by hand from 22-gauge sterling silver, which is .6mm thick and 1/4&amp;quot; wide. If you are looking for a heavier ring, I suggest this one: http://www.etsy.com/listing/77483239/mens-ring-rustic-distressed-sterling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made to order in your size - specify size when ordering in the &amp;quot;message to seller&amp;quot; at checkout.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look at the rest of my shop and be sure to read my shop announcement for current production times and other important info: http://tinahdee.etsy.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Oxidation eventually wears off, giving your jewelry item even more character**** To make your oxidation last longer, take your ring off at night and when bathing, washing hands, or working strenuously with your hands. Certain chemicals or environmental conditions can strip the oxidation, and other chemicals can make it darker.</description>        <pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2011 13:57:55 -0400</pubDate>
