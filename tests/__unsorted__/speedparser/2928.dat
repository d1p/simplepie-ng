But a look at American’s financials begs the question, will the airline be in business long enough to enjoy its fancy new toys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare half-year performance of American and American Eagle parent AMR with another US airline industry behemoth, the newly-merged United-Continental is about half again bigger – January to June revenue came in at $18 billion, compared with American’s short $12 billion – but as the chart below shows, what American lacks in raw heft it makes up for in loss-making prowess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net debt now stands at $11.9 billion – $900 million more than a year ago and roughly equal to its losses during the past decade. Shares have been falling for months, leaving market capitalisation below $1.4 billion. As a percentage of revenue, both carriers are on a par for most expenses – except wages, which consume nearly 10% more at American. That difference, as American itself has noted, stems from the fact that unlike rivals including United, it didn’t go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and renegotiate such deals during the post-9/11 downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New aircraft will fail to turn American around, according to a research note by JPMorgan equity analysts: "We cannot reconcile spending incremental capital while failing to earn returns on its existing capital base. "When enterprises lose money by such a wide margin relative to peers, one would normally expect a material cost-reduction programme and/or aggressive top-line strategy in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We see neither in the case of AMR."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aircraft finance consultant agrees. The new aircraft may be more fuel-efficient on paper, but on the feeder routes American runs in North America, relatively heavy A320s and 737s may prove a poor choice compared with smaller regional jets that could replace the MD-80s. Add in the cost of financing a new fleet and American may be worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he adds, Airbus and Boeing almost certainly signed the deals for far less than the $42 million or so each aircraft is worth on the market. So expect American, which has put no money down yet, to rapidly start selling bonds to pension plans and other institutional investors for the full value and pocketing the cash to keep flying, albeit at a loss. Unreceived aircraft will be the collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What’s happening here on the finance side is not sustainable,&amp;quot; he says. Or, less charitably: &amp;quot;It becomes a Ponzi scheme.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="user/01318910197434156165/source/com.google/link"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/01318910197434156165/source/com.google/link</id><title type="html">www.flightglobal.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/american-keeps-dreaming--360191/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1316213406743"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/777c0bd3bf7f65c4</id><title type="html">The Lulls In Traffic - The Rope To Pull Yourself Together on Vimeo</title><published>2011-09-16T22:50:06Z</published><updated>2011-09-16T22:50:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://vimeo.com/22927813#" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://vimeo.com/" title="vimeo.com"/><content xml:base="http://vimeo.com/22927813#" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Shared by  Henry

&lt;p&gt;If you can get people talking about your products, services, and ideas — and, more importantly, referring potential customers to you — then you can grow your bottom line at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be saying, “Alright, I get it. Referrals are important for my business. But how do I get more of them? How do I get people sending me customers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some proven and powerful methods you can start using today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partners matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to gain more referrals, then having the right business partners is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people think that you need to become a well–respected and established presence in the marketplace before people start talking about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree. You don’t need to become an influencer, you just need to connect with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating more referrals starts with building relationships and finding relevant business partners for your work. This means &lt;a title="networking" href="http://passivepanda.com/networking"&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="self promotion tips" href="http://passivepanda.com/self-promotion-tips"&gt;self–promotion&lt;/a&gt; are critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a small example that could apply to every business imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you run a freelance dog walking business. Now, you could try to become known as the best dog walker in your community and go door–to–door and get to know everyone in your neighborhood with a dog. It might take months, but if you’re really good, then it could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, you could save time and money, and reach out to the local pet store owner. Get to know them. Drop off a free gift to them. Take them out to lunch once or twice. Then, ask if they are willing to refer your services to people who come into the pet store. Maybe they will even let you put up a flyer or business cards at the checkout counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which option sounds more effective and efficient? Connect with one pet store owner or connect with hundreds of dog owners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same principle applies to any business. If you want more referrals, then you need to connect with the right partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will come back to this example later because there is a powerful technique you can use to build partnerships like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, I want you to think about the following: Someone already has access to the people you want to reach. How can you connect with that influencer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pay for customers, not referrals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic referral strategy is simply to ask for someone to send you a lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you know anyone else who might be interested in my services?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with leads is that they aren’t paying customers, they are potential customers. That means sometimes they buy and sometimes they don’t buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some businesses try to increase referrals by paying for leads. Instead, I suggest that you pay for customers. Allow me to explain…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customer Lifetime Value is where the money is at&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you need to do to increase referrals — and your bottom line — is to discover the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value"&gt;Customer Lifetime Value&lt;/a&gt; of your typical customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer Lifetime Value is simply what a new customer is usually worth to your business in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know this amount, then you’ll know what you can pay for a new customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you an example from the online world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a popular dating advice marketer named David DeAngelo. (You may know him by his real name, Eben Pagan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David offers 200% commission on his entry level dating ebook. In other words, you can be an affiliate for his product, sell the ebook to a new customer for $20, and then you will get a $40 check in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, that kind of business move seems crazy. Why would he pay out $2 for every $1 he gets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because he understands Customer Lifetime Value. If he gets a new customer that buys his ebook, then that customer usually ends up buying much, much more from him in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he is happy to pay $40 for a new customer because that customer will typically pay him far more than that over time. Remember, we are talking about what you will pay for a new customer, not a new lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand this principle and have data to back it up, you can grow at an unbelievable rate. In fact, click the play button below and listen to personal development master Tony Robbins and marketing guru Jay Abraham tell a quick 4–minute story about Icy Hot’s incredible growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://passivepanda.com/audio/robbins-abraham-icy-hot.mp3"&gt;Download: right click this link and choose “Save As” or “Save Link As”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the Customer Lifetime Value strategy that Jay describes in the interview above is the best way to grow your referral business. People and businesses are happy to refer related products when they are paid to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other ways to gain referrals as well, so let’s look at those…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Law of Reciprocity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of Reciprocity says that we respond to positive actions with positive actions and negative actions with negative actions. To say it another way, we love paying people back for what they do to us — good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this law holds true in business as well as in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to generating more referrals, you can use this principle to create business partnerships that are mutually beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told you we would return to the dog walking example, so let’s do that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a dog walker and you want to put your business cards at the checkout counter of the local pet store, then the Law of Reciprocity might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could tell the pet store owner that you love referring your customers to their brand of dog food. Perhaps the two of you could set up a mutual referral system. You keep sending customers back to them for dog food, they keep telling dog owners to use you as a pet sitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this principle can work for any business. How can you work with the other party so that you both can benefit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a phrase that heard from seasoned marketer, John Jantsch, that makes this entire process very easy. That phrase is, “What is the best way for me to introduce you to my audience?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of saying this would be, “What is the best way to tell my customers about you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know any business that wouldn’t be interested in telling potential customers about their work? Once this conversation gets started, it’s only natural to tell your potential partner what you do and ask if it’s a good fit to share your products/services/ideas with their customers as well. Frame it as a mutually beneficial partnership and the Law of Reciprocity will usually do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, make sure to do your homework beforehand. You can’t dish this phrase out to everyone in your industry. Besides, your goal is only to connect with a few influencers anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this principle can work in small teams as well as between two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve heard of web designers linking up with three or four other digital professionals and then referring clients among the group. One person might be an expert in design, another in web-based applications, another in mobile applications, and so on. When a client mentions a need for one of the services, the other group members point them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asking for referrals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous strategies in this article will allow you to build a system that continually generates referrals, but it can still be worth your time to ask for them on your own. After all, if you’re talking to someone who could send you potential customers, then you might as well take advantage of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things you need to focus on when asking for referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Law of Reciprocity? Well, people are much more likely to send referrals your way if you have recently created value for them. The time to ask for referrals is right after people are feeling great about you and your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you design websites and a client loves the project you just finished for them, then that would be the perfect time to ask for a referral. Or if you just referred two new customers to a referral partner, then that would be a great time to ask them if they have any new leads for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Wording&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words you use to describe your work matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key that most people forget is that you need to state things in your customer’s terms. I call this addressing buying symptoms. In other words, what are the symptoms the people display and the phrases that people use before they buy from you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a chiropractor, for example, it might be phrases like, “My back hurts” or “I have lower back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing these phrases will help you ask for referrals in a more effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re a web designer. Your usual approach might be to ask previous clients, “Do you know anyone who needs a website designed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that potential customers rarely use that phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you could say, “Most of the people I work with say things like, “I wish we could add ____ to our website.” Or, “I’m not really happy with how our site looks.” If you hear someone say that, will you give them my card?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, you need to target your referral requests to the needs of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A quick tip for those who are just getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting a business, then it might be worth your time to actually work for referrals instead of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this isn’t something you can do all of the time, but if there is a client that can get you access to some big fish in your industry, then it could very well be worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just make sure that there is a clear understanding of the expectations from the beginning. Your client should know that you’re expecting them to put you in touch with potential clients for the work you are doing. (This referral tip, and some other good ones, are shared in this story about a &lt;a title="marketing consultant" href="http://passivepanda.com/marketing-consultant"&gt;marketing consultant&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The true secret behind word–of–mouth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the strategies you use to get more referrals, the real secret behind generating more buzz about your work is the following: Do the best work possible and find the best partners you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t easy, but it is simple. Build the best product you can. Offer the best service in the industry. And then tell the right people about it. In fact, that’s the idea behind another &lt;a title="sales techniques" href="http://passivepanda.com/sales-techniques"&gt;brilliant sales technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, the best way to get people talking is to build a business worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

This is his story:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my more “avgeeky” hobbies is looking at the Form 41 data; specifically &lt;a href="http://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=311&amp;amp;DB_Short_Name=Air%20Carriers"&gt;the T100&lt;/a&gt;. The T100D Segment, which I’m going to be looking at today, gives us data about every domestic flight operated by all carriers, both US owned, and international.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the T100 database at the DOT goes back to 1990, so I decided to take a look at how a specific route looked like in 1990, and then in 2009 (the second to last full year of data available). After a few moments of debate, I decided on New York La Guardia to Washington Reagan – one component of the venerable Northeast Shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The La Guardia to Reagan route is still one of the most traversed air routes in North America, comprising 423,483 passengers last year. There are only two airlines on the route; US Airways, and Delta. In 1990, it was the legendary Pan Am who flew the route in lieu of Delta. That being said, here are some of the stats I found most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Capacity on the route fell by 49% and passengers dropped 50%. So in 19 years, the airlines have halved their capacity on the route, and half as many passengers are flying the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Despite the precipitous drop in capacity and demand, the average number of daily flights only dropped from 31 to 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* This corresponds with the average aircraft size falling from 159 seats in 1990, to 103 seats in 2009. Of course this probably has a lot to do with the fact that Delta is running E175s every hour, but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Delta had a load factor of 40% last year. I hope they have lots of high yielding passengers, because they sure as heck aren’t filling many seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following chart shows how the capacity and passengers carried stacked up for each airline:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/graph1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="graph1" src="http://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/graph1.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two charts show the corresponding market shares of the different airlines. Isn’t it surprising that Delta (who replaced Pan Am on the route in 1991) lost so much market share?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/graphb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="graphb" src="http://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/graphb-640x213.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="213"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the passenger numbers dropping so much? In a word: time. The time it takes to fly between New York and DC has grown so much, that flying has become far less attractive, especially when compared to other options like the Acela Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still skeptical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take our average businessman, and say that he lives 20 minutes away from both Penn Station and La Guardia (I’m not sure there is such a point, but work with me here). So we start with that. Then, the &lt;a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Route_C&amp;amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;amp;cid=1241245664867"&gt;Acela Express&lt;/a&gt; takes an average of 3 hours to reach its destination, and bam, you’re in downtown DC at Union Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight on the other hand is much more complex. After arriving at the airport, you usually have to budget time for security. I’d estimate it to be 15 minutes at the Marine Air Terminal (Delta Shuttle) during peak times, and 40 minutes at US Airways’ terminal during the same time period. So let’s assume that it takes around 30 minutes for security. Then, you want to be at the gate around 25 minutes before your flight; which brings you to a total of 75 minutes before you even board the flights. Now, the average ramp to ramp time, which is how long it takes for the plane to go from gate to gate was 73 minutes last year. Once you arrive at the airport, we can figure around 10 minutes for disembarking and going to the taxi stand/limo pickup. From Reagan National, it usually takes around 25 minutes to get to downtown DC by car. So let’s tally up the total travel time for each method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Acela Express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Drive to Penn Station- 20 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Train Travel Time- 180 minutes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Total Travel Time- 200 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;US Airways and Delta Shuttles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Drive to La Guardia- 20 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Security at Airport- 30 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Time at Gate Prior to Departure- 25 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Plane Travel Time- 73 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Time to Get out of Reagan Airport- 10 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Drive to Downtown DC- 25 minutes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Total Travel Time- 183 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the service on the Acela Express is much better. Acela Express- Spacious seats, in-seat power, WiFi, a newspaper, and gourmet meals. US Airways/Delta Shuttle- Cramped cabin, snack boxes, free drinks, and a newspaper. You decide….. Which one would/do you choose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some media outlets are reporting that the &lt;a href="http://www.airlinereporter.com/2011/08/faa-partial-shutdown-not-close-to-over-many-will-suffer/"&gt;FAA partial shutdown&lt;/a&gt; could affect the certification of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the 747-8 Freighter and 747-8 Intercontinental. According to Boeing, as of now, the partial shut down will not affect the certification of the aircraft, but could affect airports looking to be certified to operate the new 747-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FAA says airplane certification activities will continue– so we don’t expect any impact there,” Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder Jr explained to &lt;a href="http://www.airlinereporter.com"&gt;AirlineReporter.com&lt;/a&gt;. “As for airport certification, if furloughed FAA personnel don’t return to work in time to finish the remaining airport approvals for the 747-8, customers wouldn’t be able to fly the airplane into certain airports until that work is complete (SFO, Newark, O’Hare and Houston are the major ones).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just another reason to be angry at the partial FAA shutdown.

" width="300" height="199"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lufthansa is using this Airbus A321 (D-AIDG) to operate their first scheduled flight using biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines and airline manufactures have been experimenting with biofuels for quite sometime. It has been successfully shown that airliners are able to fly on biofuel and companies around the globe are working to make sure it is economically feasible and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Lufthansa Airlines started flying an Airbus A321 (D-AIDG) on scheduled service from Hamburg to Frankfurt using a 50/50 mix of regular and biofuel on one of its engines and standard jet fuel in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The main focus of this test is to examine the effects of biofuel on the lifecycle of the engines and other operational issues,” Martin Riecken, Director Corporate Communications, The Americas explained to AirlineReporter.com. “Two of the main roadblocks are availability of biofuel on a larger scale and the price point. Right now, biofuel is about 60-70 percent more expensive than regular jetfuel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aircraft will operate on the biofuel for a test period of six months. The biofuel is similar enough to jet fuel, that the aircraft needs no additional modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christoph Franz, Chairman and CEO of the Lufthansa Group, said via a press release: “Lufthansa is the first airline worldwide to use biofuel in scheduled daily flight operations. We are thus continuing to steadily implement our proven and successful strategy for sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuel used on the Lufthansa A321 is developed from pure biomass and consists of jatropha, camelina and animal fats. The airline requires that the original product originates from a sustainable supply and is not in direct competition with food production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if Lufthansa plans to continue to fly with the biofuel Riecken replied, “There are no current plans to continue biofuel operations after the completion of the six-month test phase, but we will continue to support further research efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing new technologies, Lufthansa has improved their fuel efficiency by over 30 percent since 1991 and on average, their fleet has a fuel consumption of 56 MPG per passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The score is tied up. Only a second is left on the clock. A state championship is on the line. You step up to the foul line, dribble the ball a few times, take a deep breath, and then–swish–sink the foul shot that wins the game. &lt;em&gt;That’s clutch. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your co-worker has been preparing a pitch presentation for a potentially huge client for months. On the day of the presentation, he gets food poisoning and can’t do it. Your boss asks you to step in and give the presentation instead. You only have a few hours to immerse yourself in the materials. But come presentation time, you knock the socks off the client and get the deal. &lt;em&gt;That’s clutch too. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that separates great men from the mediocre is their ability to thrive in high-pressure situations. Instead of cracking under the stress, they become stronger. By stepping up and performing when when the chips are down, these men engender the confidence and trust of others, achieve and accomplish great feats, and &lt;a title="The 5 Switches of Manliness: Legacy" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/06/13/the-5-switches-of-manliness-legacy/"&gt;build their legacy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may never lead troops through a decisive battle or kick a game winning field goal, our ability to thrive under pressure is essential to our success as men. It’s usually those clutch moments when everything is on the line, that make or break a man’s progress. Will he rise to the next level or languish in obscurity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in school, it doesn’t matter how well you do on your homework; if you can’t perform come exam time, you’re sunk. When a promotion evaluation comes your way, what do you think your boss will remember the most? All the times you’ve been reliable when the pressure was off, or the moments you crumbled when it really mattered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people think that being clutch in high-pressure situations is some sort of innate talent that some people have and others don’t. Or that when someone pulls off an unlikely save, it simply came down to luck. The reality is that with a little work and discipline, anybody can become clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactics you use to prevent choking under pressure vary depending on the mission you’re trying to accomplish and the particular mental faculties the task requires. The majority of situations can be broken into two categories: ones that primarily call upon your &lt;em&gt;working memory&lt;/em&gt;, and those that primarily call upon your &lt;em&gt;procedural memory&lt;/em&gt;. In this two-part series, we’ll explore both of these situations, the specific tactics needed to be clutch in each, as well as strategies for dealing with both kinds of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll begin by discussing how to be clutch when faced with a task that calls upon your working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Is Working Memory?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we perform tasks that require reasoning, comprehension, and learning, we use our working memory. Our working memory allows us to hold relevant information in our brain while we do something else at the same time. Think of it as your flexible mental scratch pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re trying to turn in a memo at the last minute. You did your research and found some great information you’d like to include in a section that drives home the main point. However, you’re not quite ready to write about that yet, so you hold that section in your mind while you continue writing. That’s an example of your working memory in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your working memory can really be put to the test in high-pressure situations. You might be trying to solve one client’s last minute problem, while remembering the things you’re going to say in a meeting with another client that afternoon. You might be juggling a bunch of different facts and arguments in your mind as you prepare a legal brief that’s due the next day. Or you might be chatting with a potential business partner as you try to &lt;a title="How to Remember a Person’s Name (And What to Do When You Can’t)" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/06/15/how-to-remember-a-persons-name-and-what-to-do-when-you-cant/"&gt;remember his name.&lt;/a&gt; And of course pretty much any test or exam calls upon your working memory in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why We Choke Doing Tasks That Call Upon Our Working Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things that you can do to strengthen your working memory, but at any given time, it is a limited resource. When we start to worry, our negative internal monologue uses up our supply of working memory. Instead of using the fuel of our working memory to help us accomplish the task, it’s burned away with anxious hand-wringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Be Clutch in High Pressure Situations&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; That Utilize Your Working Memory&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If worry is the kryptonite to our working memory-clutchness, then the key to thriving in high pressure situations that require this ability is to chill the heck out. Here’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down and take a step back. &lt;/strong&gt;In high pressure situations, our natural reaction is to freak out and work as fast as we can. However, that’s just a recipe for choking big time. Studies show that when dealing with problems that require working memory, slowing down and taking your time leads to clutch performances. Slowing down and taking a step back from a problem will help prevent your working memory from being taxed by stress and worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s, psychologist Micki Chi did an experiment to see what caused individuals to succeed or fail with difficult problem-solving in high pressure situations. She gave a set of basic physics problems to a group of physics professors, physics Ph.D. students, and undergrad students. The undergrad students had only completed one semester of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the professors and Ph.D students did better than the undergrads, but what was somewhat unexpected was the fact that the professors and Ph.D students didn’t necessarily finish the problems faster than the undergrads. &lt;em&gt;Chi observed that the professors and Ph.D. students took &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;longer&lt;/span&gt; to get started solving the problem than the undergrads did. &lt;/em&gt;Before putting pencil to paper, the profs and Ph.Ds paused to think about the problem and the underlying principles. Once they had a grasp of the problem, the professors and Ph.D. students were able to solve the problem quickly and correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undergrad students, on the other hand, jumped right into the problem without mulling it over. This would often cause them to get distracted and stressed with irrelevant details which would result in an incorrect answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: If you’re taking a big test, instead of frantically rushing right into solving the problem or writing the essay, spend some time thinking it over and making an outline. If you’re faced with an unforeseen problem at work, take a 5 minute &lt;a title="The 5 Switches of Manliness: Nature" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/06/26/the-5-switches-of-manliness-nature/"&gt;walk outside&lt;/a&gt; so you can mull the situation over in a less stressful environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditate. &lt;/strong&gt;Studies show that individuals who practice meditation can clear distracting thoughts (like worry) from their mind more quickly than individuals who don’t meditate. That sort of ability comes in handy in high pressure situations when you want to clear your working memory of anxiety, so you can stay focused on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So prepare for moments when you need to be clutch by spending 20 minutes a day meditating. You don’t have to do anything elaborate. Sit in a quiet place and focus on your breath going in your nose and out your mouth. Whenever a distracting thought pops up, don’t get flustered. Just name the thought, let it go, and focus back on your breath. If you’re like me, you’ll find that when you first start meditating, you get easily distracted by your thoughts. Don’t get discouraged; with time your mind will quiet down, and your ability to dismiss unwanted thoughts will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a nap.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/02/07/unleash-the-power-of-the-nap/www"&gt;One of the myriad of benefits that naps offer &lt;/a&gt;is a recharge of your working memory. If you have the time, take a 20 minute power nap and then get back to tackling the problem. You’ll likely get more done in the 40 minutes afterwards, then you would trying to power through 60 minutes of ineffective slogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down your worries. &lt;/strong&gt;Writing down what’s stressing you out about a problem can help free up your working memory for the task at hand. When you’re starting to feel like you’re buckling under pressure, pull out your journal or &lt;a title="The Pocket Notebooks of 20 Famous Men" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/09/13/the-pocket-notebooks-of-20-famous-men/"&gt;pocket notebook&lt;/a&gt; and write down every worry you have until your mind is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, write down everything. &lt;/strong&gt;Remember, your working memory is a limited resource. To ensure that you think clearly and calmly and that you don’t forget anything when solving a problem, write down everything that comes to your mind. Don’t trust that your working memory will remember everything. Offload it by working problems out on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next time: How to be clutch in situations that involve your procedural memory, as well as tactics to thrive in high pressure situations that call upon either type of memory. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Demosthenes practicing his delivery by the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/tag/rhetoric/"&gt;series on Classical Rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;. Today we’re continuing our five-part segment on the Five Canons of Rhetoric. So far we’ve covered the canons of &lt;a title="Classical Rhetoric 101: The Five Canons of Rhetoric – Invention" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/01/26/classical-rhetoric-101-the-five-canons-of-rhetoric-invention/"&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Classical Rhetoric 101: The Five Canons of Rhetoric- Arrangement" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/02/26/classical-rhetoric-101-the-five-canons-of-rhetoric-arrangement/"&gt;arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/16/classical-rhetoric-101-the-five-canons-of-rhetoric-style/"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title="Classical Rhetoric 101: The Five Canons of Rhetoric- Memory" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/04/15/classical-rhetoric-101-the-five-canons-of-rhetoric-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. Today we’ll be covering the last canon: delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Delivery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the canon of style, the canon of delivery is concerned with &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;something is said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the canon of style focuses primarily on what sort of language you use, delivery focuses on the mechanics of how you impart your message. For ancient orators, delivery meant how a speaker used his body language and hand gestures and how he changed his tone of voice during his oration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastering the canon of delivery can help a speaker establish ethos with his audience. Admit it. You’ve probably written off plenty of speakers when you saw that they mumbled through their speech and gestured like the robot on &lt;em&gt;Lost in Space&lt;/em&gt;. I know I have. The speaker could have been making valid and groundbreaking points, but the message got lost in the delivery. Delivery can also help an orator use pathos, or emotion, to persuade. A well placed pause or a slammed fist can elicit a desired emotion from your audience in order to make your point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Greeks held the canon of delivery in very high regard. They believed that an orator who could eloquently deliver a speech was in fact a virtuous person. The thinking being that the gift to deliver a powerful speech could only reside in a virtuous man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of the famous Greek orator Demosthenes demonstrates the lengths ancient rhetoricians would take in order to master the canon of delivery. To improve his diction, Demosthenes would practice his speeches with pebbles in his mouth and even recite speeches while he ran. To strengthen his voice so he could be heard clearly in the Greek Assembly, he’d stand on the seashore and deliver his speech over the roar of the waves. All this work paid off, as Demosthenes went down in history as one of the greatest orators of ancient Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Greeks admired men as virtuous for being able to deliver a speech eloquently, modern audiences have a tendency to be suspicious of a speaker that appears &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;well-polished. A charismatic speaker who can deliver a rousing speech is often seen as a silver-tongued deceiver with ulterior motives, someone who is masking his true intent with a flashy presentation. This suspicion was born in the aftermath of WWII; people felt ashamed that they had fallen under the spell of dictators who were great orators but had malicious agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Americans, our wariness of smooth speakers goes back quite a ways more and can be traced to the cultural turn against the “&lt;a title="3 Archetypes of American Manliness-Part I: The Genteel Patriarch" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/22/3-archetypes-of-american-manliness-part-i-the-genteel-patriarch/"&gt;genteel patriarch archetype&lt;/a&gt;” after the Revolutionary War and the election of Andrew Jackson as the country’s first “populist president.” Since that time, Americans have craved “authenticity” and often preferred a speaker with a bit of rough, folksy charm over one more refined and sophisticated. We saw this play out in the 2004 U.S. presidential election between John Kerry and George Bush. Many political commentators agreed the John Kerry had a hard time connecting with voters because he came off as too polished, stiff, and cerebral in debates and speeches. Bush, on the other hand, despite his occasional speaking gaffes, or perhaps because of them, was often seen as more down-to-earth–the kind of guy you’d go have a beer with–because his delivery was more rough and unpolished. He seemed authentic and approachable, and thus trustworthy. Some cultural commentators saw the election of Obama in 2008 as a victory over this suspicion for “elitism” and charismatic orators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Tailoring Your Delivery to Your Audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style="width:400px"&gt;
	&lt;img title="fdr" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/05/fdr.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="297"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;FDR knew how to match his style of delivery to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;How you approach your delivery will need to be determined during the &lt;a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/01/26/classical-rhetoric-101-the-five-canons-of-rhetoric-invention/"&gt;invention stage&lt;/a&gt; of your speech. Find out to the best of your ability the overall demographics and cultural background of your audience. What does your audience fear? What are their desires? What are their needs? This information will help you decide if you should use a more sophisticated and polished delivery or if you should go with a more informal approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a master of understanding the importance of tailoring your delivery according to time, place, and audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When FDR took office during the Great Depression, he instituted regular “Fireside Chats,” where he would address the country on the radio to discuss what the government was doing and why. If you listen to him, say, explain the &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrfirstfiresidechat.html"&gt;need to close banks for a banking holiday&lt;/a&gt;, you can hear how his delivery sounds much like a kindly grandfather patiently explaining a complicated issue in a very simple and easy to understand manner. His delivery conveys warmth, comfort, and confidence. It is easy to understand how, in a time where there was “nothing to fear but fear itself,” many Americans, in a practice foreign to most of us today, had a picture of FDR hanging in their home as if he were part of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you listen to &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrpearlharbor.htm"&gt;FDR’s speech after the bombing at Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, you can hear a much different, but still very effective kind of delivery. The nation was reeling with shock, worry, and anger, and FDR, now speaking with great force, manages to convey righteous indignation and supreme confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:337px"&gt;
	&lt;img title="challenger" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/05/challenger1.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="354"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Like FDR, Reagan knew how to effectively vary his delivery. He could often be humorous and folksy but knew how to convey sincerity and solemnity when the situation called for it, such as after the Challenger exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing the Canon of Delivery in Oratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the art of delivery in writing could be its own post, we have chosen to concentrate on how it applies to spoken rhetoric. Here are a few key tips for increasing the effectiveness of your oratorical delivery.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master the pause. &lt;/strong&gt;Most people are so nervous when they get up to speak that they rush through the whole thing like the Micro Machines guy. But they’re losing out on employing one of the most powerful oratorical techniques–the pause. A pause can add a bit of dramatic flair to a statement or it can help the audience really drink up an idea. The key with a pause is timing. Use it only in spots where it will be effective–places where you really want to highlight what comes after the pause. “Hello (pause) my (pause) name is (pause),” would not be such a time. Practice inserting pauses in your speech to find what works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch your body language. &lt;/strong&gt;When you’re speaking, your voice isn’t the only thing talking. Your body is also communicating. Your posture, head tilt, and the way you walk on stage all convey a message. Some occasions may require that you carry yourself in a more formal and stiff manner, while other occasions will require a more laid-back approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vary your tone. &lt;/strong&gt;Nothing will put your audience to sleep faster than a visit from android man from the year 2050. Short-circuit the flat, monotonous robot voice and keep things interesting by adding vocal inflections as you speak. Use inflections to reveal that you’re asking a question, being sarcastic, or conveying excitement. You might even exaggerate your inflections when delivering a public speech as many people have a tendency to get timid in front of an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let gestures flow naturally.&lt;/strong&gt; If used effectively, hand gestures can give added emphasis to your words. If used incorrectly, you’ll end up looking like an octopus having a seizure. Don’t over think hand gestures; just let them flow naturally. You might want to have someone watch you practice the speech to make sure your gesticulations aren’t distracting. If they are, adjust accordingly, but don’t obsess about it; they’re part of what makes you unique as a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:298px"&gt;
	&lt;img title="bull" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/05/bull.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="343"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Nothing stops a Bull Moose&amp;#39;s hand gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Match your speed with your emotion. &lt;/strong&gt;How fast or slow you speak can affect the emotion you’re trying to convey. In &lt;em&gt;A Natural System of Elocution and Oratory&lt;/em&gt;, the author gives six different speech speeds and the corresponding emotions they’re meant to elicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid:&lt;/strong&gt; haste, alarm, confusion, anger, vexation, fear, revenge, and extreme terror.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Quick or brisk:&lt;/strong&gt; joy, hope, playfulness, and humor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Moderate:&lt;/strong&gt; good for narration, descriptions, and teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow:&lt;/strong&gt; gloom, sorrow, melancholy, grief, pity, admiration, reverence, dignity, authority, awe, power, and majesty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very slow:&lt;/strong&gt; used to express the strongest and deepest emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vary the force of your voice. &lt;/strong&gt;Force is the strength and weakness of voice. Varying the force of your voice can help express different emotions. Anger, ferocity, and seriousness can be conveyed with a strong, loud voice. This doesn’t mean you need to shout. You just need to put a little more&lt;em&gt; oomph&lt;/em&gt; in your voice. A softer voice can convey reverence, meekness, and humility. Varying the force of your voice can also help draw listeners into your speech. For example, by speaking softly, your audience has to work a bit more to hear you. It’s almost like you’re telling a secret to your audience which is a great way to emphasis a point you’re making and to connect with your listeners. Like all tactics, this must be used sparingly…don’t make the audience strain to hear your whole speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enunciate. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s easy to trip over your tongue and slur words together when you’re speaking in public. But really focus on enunciating your words as this will make you easier to understand. I have a tendency to mumble and slur words together. A trick that has helped me overcome this is practicing speaking while holding a pencil underneath my tongue. It forces your tongue to work harder as it restricts tongue movement. When you remove the pencil from underneath your tongue, you’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to enunciate without the obstruction. I’ll often do this exercise right before I do a podcast or give a presentation. Tongue twisters help with enunciation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look your audience in the eye. &lt;/strong&gt;When you look people in the eye, you make a connection. But how can you look an entire audience in the eye? Well, if there are hundreds of people in your audience, you can’t. But you can at least make eye contact with a couple of them. As you go through your speech, work your way across the room making eye contact with several different people in the audience. You’ll get a strong connection with those people you look in the eye, but you’ll also give everyone else a chance to look you in the face which can help build a connection. Maintain contact for a few seconds. If it’s too short, you’ll seem nervous and shifty. If you look too long, you’ll start creeping people out.&lt;/p&gt;

much of a pain flying can be, but you can ease your pain by avoiding the airlines more likely to delay your flights. Weblog Digital Inspiration shows us how to find the worst offenders with Wolfram Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is head to Wolfram Alpha and type in the name of two or more airlines. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 Delta Airlines vs United Airlines
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will give you a few different tables comparing the two, one of which includes average delay time, causes of delays, and the percentage of flights cancelled. Man, what &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; Wolfram Alpha do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you also &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!378205/get-flight-delay-predictions-at-delaycast"&gt;check out flight delay predictions for your specific flight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!336561/check-your-airports-delay-record-before-you-travel"&gt;check your airport's delay record&lt;/a&gt;, too. And, if all else fails, make sure you know how to &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!350654/get-a-new-flight-when-stranded-at-the-airport-with-rule-240"&gt;invoke Rule 240 to get a new flight out&lt;/a&gt; when you're stranded at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up and smell the biscuits Apple fans – the iPhone is DEAD. That might be a slightly overly-hysterical opening line, but what used to be known as the ‘Jesus Phone’ is no longer in the nation’s list of five favourite handsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new report from &lt;a href="http://www.uswitch.com/"&gt;uSwitch,&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone4 is down to number six in the handset chart, with HTC taking the top three spots. In these trying economic times, it seems that consumers are more interested in getting a free or cheaper handset than forking out for the iPhone, a handset that was once regarded as a ‘premium’ piece of kit but is now just another smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s that top ten in full…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. HTC Desire&lt;br&gt;
2. HTC Desire HD.&lt;br&gt;
3. HTC Wildfire.&lt;br&gt;
4. Blackberry Curve 8520.&lt;br&gt;
5. Samsung Galaxy S.&lt;br&gt;
6. Apple iPhone 4 (16Gb).&lt;br&gt;
7. Motorola DEFY.&lt;br&gt;
8. Sony Ericsson S500i.&lt;br&gt;
9. Samsung G800.&lt;br&gt;
10. Samsung i600.&lt;/p&gt;

The main lesson is the video above and the text below is for reference. Most of what you're going to learn here is best demonstrated in the video, so watching it is the best way to learn. In this lesson we're going to be covering three things: color correction, photo retouching, and photo enhancing. We're going to look at basic ways to perform these tasks and nothing too complex, but you'll find that these simple methods are very powerful and can handle the majority of what you'll want to do with your photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Color Correction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color correction is a lot easier than you think. You just need to know which colors are complimentary (meaning on the opposite end of the color wheel) and you can use those to cancel out too much of another color. (If you need a refresher on color, check out our &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5620138/how-to-get-the-best-color-out-of-your-photos"&gt;color guide&lt;/a&gt;.) You also need to be able to spot where colors are the most prominent. This means being able to tell, for example, when red is dominating the light areas of the photo and blue is dominating the dark areas. If you simple applied a blue filter to the entire photo, you&amp;#39;d end up with more neutral highlights—which you want—but a photo that looks too cool because the shadows are overly saturated with blue color. To recap, you need to pay attention to two major things when color correcting: which colors are dominating the photograph and which colors aren&amp;#39;t, and also &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt;, tonally, those dominating colors exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_histogram.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;This is something you can generally do just by eying the photo, but the proper method is to consult the histogram. You can bring this up by going into the Window menu and choosing Histogram. The left side represents the shadows, the right side the highlights, leaving the middle for the midtones. If a particular color is dominating the photo in any area, you'll see it dominating that space on the histogram. This can be a handy guide for spotting necessary corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you've got a basic idea of what we're going to be targeting, let's take a look at some of the best color balancing tools Photoshop has to offer. You can find all the adjustments we'll be discussing in the following places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find standard adjustments that apply to a single layer by going to the Image menu, choosing Adjustments, then choosing the adjustment you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to create an adjustment layer that can apply to multiple layers and be adjusted after the first application you can create an adjustment layer. You can either do this by going into the Layers menu, choosing Adjustment Layer, and then selecting the adjustment you want, or just selecting the adjustment you want from the Adjustments palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Color Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-color-balance.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;Color Balance is not a very flexible tool, but sometimes you just need minor adjustments to color and you can use Color Balance to apply them quickly. If the brightest parts of your photo are just a little bit too red—something that&amp;#39;s common with photos taken in low light—you can just select the Highlights radio button and then move the sliders towards cyan and blue a bit until you start to see the colors look a bit more balanced and neutral. You can also use Color Balance to create some interesting color effects by emphasizing different colors in the shadows, midtones, and highlights. Play around with it and get a feel for what it can do. It&amp;#39;s not a tool you want to use most of the time, since Curves will generally help you do everything better and with more flexibility, but for quick changes Color Balance can definitely be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-levels.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;Levels is like Curves (which we&amp;#39;ll discuss next) with training wheels. You have three main sliders. On the left, you have the shadows slider. Moving it to the right will increase the intensity of the shadows. On the right, you have the highlights slider. Moving it to the left will increase the intensity of the highlights of your photo. In the middle, you have the midtones slider. Moving it to the left will brighten up your photo and moving it to the right will make it darker. These sliders mainly affect contrast. The sliders under Output Levels affect brightness. Moving the black slider towards the white one will brighten things up. Moving the white slider toward the black one will darken them. By default, Levels applies any of these changes to the entire photo, but you can select a specific color channel and alter it all by itself. There&amp;#39;s a little drop-down menu at the top of the Levels panel that lets you select from all channels—I&amp;#39;m going to assume you&amp;#39;re in the RGB colorspace and it says RGB—or each individual channel (red, green, and blue). If you want to brighten or darken just the reds, select the red channel and make your adjustments. To see a full demonstration of how Levels works, watch the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-curves.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;Curves is definitely the best color correction tool you&amp;#39;ve got in Photoshop, but you might find it a little intimidating and shy away from it since Levels seems to work well enough. Trust me—curves is much better, so take the time to get to know it and learn how it works so you&amp;#39;re using it to do most of your adjustments. It&amp;#39;s powerful, versatile, and very easy to control once you get the hang of it. That said, it works a lot like levels only you set your own points. You can adjust the entire image or just specific channels, just like you can in levels. To make a point on the curve, you just click anywhere on the line and drag in a particular direction. If you pull towards the top left corner, you&amp;#39;ll brighten things up. If you pull down towards the bottom right corner, you&amp;#39;ll darken things. The middle of the line in curves represents the midtones. The bottom of the line, touching the bottom left corner, represents the shadows. That would leave the top, which represents the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of creating a simple curve: make a point at the midpoint of the line and then two more points that are each about one grid space away from the midpoint. Pull the bottom-most point down into the shadows a bit and the top-most point up into the highlights. This will create basic contrast and is the simplest adjustment you can make in curves. If you're having trouble understanding how this works, you can see an example in your Photoshop presets. At the top of the Curves window, you'll see a preset menu. Choose "Strong Contrast" and you'll get a curve that's similar to the one we just discussed. You should also check out the video at the top of this post to see a full demonstration of Curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Auto Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-auto-tone.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;Sometimes you can just let Photoshop do a lot of the work for you. While you don't want to rely on Photoshop's Auto Tone option, you can just chose it from the Image menu to let Photoshop make an educated guess about what your photo needs in terms tone and color adjustments. Sometimes you can save yourself a little time by just using Auto Tone, but definitely don't rely on it. Sometimes it just gets it right and it takes about two seconds to try it out and see if it works. If it doesn't work, undo it, and do the corrections yourself. If it does work, you just saved yourself some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Photo Retouching and Enhancing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic photo retouching and enhancing is very easy and very effective if done with the right level of subtlety. We&amp;#39;re going to take a look at some options for correcting problems in your photos—like cuts on a face, dry skin, dust from the lens, etc.—and also how to enhance a portrait to make it look especially nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touch Ups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the touch ups you&amp;#39;re going to want to perform can be accomplished with the healing brush or the cloning stamp. If you&amp;#39;re trying to just make a person look their best—which is all you really ought to be doing with a portrait—you can do most of what you want to do with the healing brush and clone stamp—two tools wel discussed in a reasonable amount of detail in &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5753459/learn-the-basics-of-photoshop-in-under-25-minutes"&gt;lesson one&lt;/a&gt;. We'll also take a brief look at some of your other options as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Healing Brush Revisited&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_07-healing-brush_01.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already discussed the healing brush quite a bit so we&amp;#39;re not going to go over it in great detail here. Basically it works by selecting a source point (which you do by option-clicking an area of the photo) and painting over the area you want to &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; with image data from the source point. The healing brush then uses its magic to blend in the painted source material with the stuff surrounding it. Generally this results in a more realistic result than you&amp;#39;d get with the Clone Stamp, but not always. The Clone Stamp works in the exact same fashion as the Healing Brush, but the Clone Stamp doesn&amp;#39;t do any healing. All it does is replace the target area with whatever you selected as a source point. While you&amp;#39;re technically cloning another part of the photo and this may seem like it&amp;#39;s going to look redundant, when you&amp;#39;re correcting small areas it can sometimes look better than what the Healing Brush will give you—especially when you&amp;#39;re near hard edges and areas of contrast. Both tools are best demonstrated visually, so be sure to watch the video if you&amp;#39;re having trouble understanding how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-other-healing-tools.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;In addition to the Healing Brush and Clone Stamp, there are a few other ways to make corrections. If you're looking to reduce redness in certain parts of the skin, often times you can accomplish this by simply desaturating the red area a little bit. The Sponge Tool can help you easily desaturate a particular area. (If you've forgotten what the Sponge Tool is, refer back to &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5753459/learn-the-basics-of-photoshop-in-under-25-minutes"&gt;lesson one&lt;/a&gt;.) If you're removing blemishes and want some alternatives, the Spot Healing Brush can sometimes be a little easier to use than the regular Healing Brush (you can find it by clicking and holding down the Healing Brush in the tool bar). It doesn't require you to set a source point. One last option is using Content-Aware Fill, which is a new feature in Photoshop CS5. To use it, what you want to remove needs to be in the background layer. Select the part you want to remove with a Marquee or Lasso tool and press delete. You should be presented with a dialogue box asking you what you want to do. If "Use:" isn't set to Content-Aware, change that and then press OK. Once you do, Photoshop will try to figure out what your photo should look like without that element. The more precise your selection is, the more successful Photoshop will be in replacing it. If you select something outside of the area you want to remove, it's possible that this will confuse Photoshop and you'll end up with unsatisfactory results. Generally you'll want to reserve Content-Aware Fill for removing items more prominent than blemishes, as the healing brush tools tend to do a better job at that, but it can do the job as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancing a Portrait&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a couple of minor enhancements, you can make a portrait look significantly better than the original photograph. Everything we're going to discuss here is designed to bring out the best in the image of the person you're working on and not necessarily look better than they actually do. Photos tend to pick up more detail than we'd normally notice and people generally don't have pimples, cuts, or other blemishes on their faces all the time. The idea is to bring out the best in the subject and not perform anything that's untrue to their appearance or is just downright unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Channeling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_ps2-channels.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt; One of the best and easiest tricks to enhancing a portrait is making use if your color channels. You can find your color channels in the Channels palette on the right side of your screen. Assuming you're in the RGB color space, you'll see four options: RGB, red, green, and blue. RGB is the color image as you know it. The others are the respective channels. Click each of these and note their differences. You'll find that red has the most light, blue has the most detail, and green is kind of a combination of them both. When you're dealing with people, detail in skin is generally something you want to avoid and that's exactly what the red channel can help you do. Sometimes it's a near-perfect black and white photo all by itself, but if we're working with color it's still very useful. To make a nice adjustment, select the red channel, then select all (Command+A on a Mac, Control+A on a PC) and copy the image. Now switch back to the RGB combine channel, go back to your Layers palette, and paste the red channel. This will create a new layer on top of your background and you'll see only the red channel on your canvas. From the Layers palette, select a blending mode of Overlay for your red channel layer and reduce its opacity to somewhere between 20 and 30 percent. As you're making this adjustment you'll see what a nice effect it can have (or you can just see this effect by watching the video associated with this lesson). This is one of the easiest adjustments to make and it's incredibly useful. It removes unwanted detail in the skin, adds contrast right where you want it, and often improves your photo's color as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Burning and Dodging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_burn-and-dodge.jpg" width="158" alt="Basics of Photoshop: Color Correction, Touch Ups, and Enhancements"&gt;Burning and dodging can also be extremely useful when applying "virtual makeup" to your subject. This is something you'll want to do for men as well as women, because we're going to be very subtle and make it look as natural as possible. The idea is to place added contrast in the features of the face we want to emphasize: the eyes, nose, and mouth. You can use the burn tool to burn the midtones and shadows of the eyelashes and eyebrows, the curve of the nose, and the inner edges of the lips. You can use the dodge tool to brighten up the midtones of the colored and white parts of the eye and the inside of the lips. For a full demonstration, check out the video associated with this lesson. If you've forgotten how to use the burn and dodge tools, you'll see a proper demonstration in the video as well but you can also refer back to &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5753459/learn-the-basics-of-photoshop-in-under-25-minutes"&gt;lesson one&lt;/a&gt; for additional reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these enhancements are pretty minor, they make a significant difference in the overall look of the photo. While it might seem minor while you're making them, go into your History panel to see what the photo looked like in the beginning after you're done. Once you see the difference, you'll believe how these subtle little tricks can go a very long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

If you've wanted to start using Photoshop but didn't know where to start, we'll be teaching you the basics all week long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video above is your lesson. It's short considering how much it covers and long considering it's on the internet. In the video, we take a look at every tool in the toolbar, your palettes on the right side of the screen, and what you'll find in the menus. Below you'll find a reference for this lesson. Once the lessons are over, we'll provide everything all in one place and a downloadable PDF file containing references for each lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait! I don't have Photoshop!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_no-photoshop.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;Are you not currently a Photoshop user? Adobe offers a &lt;a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop&amp;amp;promoid=GYSGB"&gt;Photoshop 30-day trial&lt;/a&gt; that you can download right now and it will provide you with plenty of time to learn how it works. If you don't want to eventually purchase Photoshop because it's too expensive, much of what we're going to discuss in these lessons will apply to not just to Photoshop but pretty much most of the standard photo-editing and design tools you'll find (&lt;a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/"&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; is a great $30 alternative on the Mac, and &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; is a free, open-source cross-platform option). We've chosen Photoshop because it's the most commonly used, but you're welcome to follow along using other software as well. Today's lesson is pretty Photoshop-specific, but as we move along you should be able to use other software to do most of what we discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready? Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Toolbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not going to take a look at every single tool but we are going to look at almost every one of them. While this overview will give you an idea of what each tool does, go &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/by-2.0/"&gt;find yourself a photo&lt;/a&gt; and start playing around with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_01-move-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Move Tool (Keyboard: V)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move tool simply lets you move objects in a given layer around the Photoshop canvas. To use it, click anywhere on the canvas and drag. As you drag, the Photoshop layer will move with your mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_02-selection-tools.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marquee (Keyboard: M)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marquee lets you select part of the canvas in a specific shape. By default you get a rectangular (or perfect square if you hold down shift while selecting), but you can also select in the shape of an ellipse (or a perfect circle if you hold down shift while selecting).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_03-lasso.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lasso (Keyboard: L)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lasso is a free-form selection tool that lets you drag around the canvas and select anything the lasso'd area covers. Within this tool you also have access to the polygonal lasso, which lets you create a selection by clicking around on the canvas and creating points, and the magnetic lasso, which works the same as the regular lasso but attempts to detect edges for you and automatically snap to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_04-magic-wand.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Magic Wand (Keyboard: W)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking an area with the magic wand will tell Photoshop to select the spot you clicked on and anything around it that's similar. This tool can be used as a crude way to remove backgrounds from photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_05-crop-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crop Tool (Keyboard: C)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crop tool is used to (surprise!) crop your pictures. You can specify the exact size and constrain the crop tool to those proportions, or you can just crop to any size you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_06-eyedropper-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eyedropper (Keyboard: I)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyedropper tool lets you click on any part of the canvas and sample the color at that exact point. The eyedropper will change your foreground color to whatever color it sampled from the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_07-healing-brush.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Healing Brush (Keyboard: J)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing brush lets you sample part of the photograph and use it to paint over another part. Once you're finished, Photoshop will examine surrounding areas and try to blend what you painted in with the rest of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_08-paintrbrush-and-pencil.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paintbrush and Pencil (Keyboard: B)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paintbrush is a tool that emulates a paintbrush and the pencil is a tool that emulates a pencil. The paintbrush, however, can be set to many different kinds of brushes. You can paint with standard paintbrush and airbrush styles, or even paint with leaves and other shapes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_09-clone-stamp.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clone Stamp (Keyboard: S)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the healing brush, the clone stamp lets you sample part of the photograph and use it to paint over another part. With the clone stamp, however, that's it. Photoshop doesn't do anything beyond painting one area over a new area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_10-history-brush.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History Brush (Keyboard: Y)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history brush lets you paint back in time. Photoshop keeps track of all the moves you make (well, 50 by default) and the history brush lets you paint the past back into the current photo. Say you brightened up the entire photo but you wanted to make a certain area look like it did before you brightened it, you can take the history brush and paint that area to bring back the previous darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_11-eraser.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eraser Tool (Keyboard: E)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erase tool is almost identical to the paintbrush, except it erases instead of paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_12-paintcan.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paint Can and Gradient Tools (Keyboard: G)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paint can tool lets you fill in a specific area with the current foreground color. The gradient tool will, by default, create a gradient that blends the foreground and background tool (though you can load and create preset gradients as well, some of which use than two colors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_13-blur_-sharpen_-and-smudge.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge Tools (Keyboard: None)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of these tools act like paintbrushes, but each has a different impact on your picture. The blur tool will blur the area where you paint, the sharpen tool will sharpen it, and the smudge tool will smudge the area all around the canvas. The smudge tool is very useful in drawing for creating nicely blended colors or for creating wisps and smoke that you can add to your photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_14-burn_-dodge_-and-sponge.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Burn, Dodge, and Sponge Tools (Keyboard: O)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burn, dodge, and sponge tools are paintbrush-like tools that manipulate light and color intensity. The burn tool can make areas in your photo darker. The dodge tool can make them lighter. The sponge tool can saturate or desaturate color in the area you paint with it. These are all very useful tools for photo touch ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_15-pen.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pen Tool (Keyboard: P)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pen tool is used for drawing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics"&gt;vector graphics&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to create paths that can be used for various things that we'll discuss in a later lesson (although if you watch the video you can see a type path being created).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_16-type.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Type Tool (Keyboard: T)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type tool lets you type horizontally. Tools hidden beneath the horizontal type tool will let you type vertically and also create horizontal and vertical text &lt;a href="http://www.digitalscrapbookplace.com/university/tutorials/ps_layermasks.shtml"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_17-path-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Path Tool (Keyboard: A)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path tool lets you move any created paths around. It's like the move tool, but for paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_18-shape-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shape Tool (Keyboard: U)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape tool lets you create vector rectangles, rounded rectangles, circles, polygons, lines, and custom shapes. These tools are very useful when designing or when creating shape masks for photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_19-3d-tools.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3D Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the 3D tools. We're not going to be dealing with 3D stuff in these lessons so all you really need to know is that these exist. If you're curious, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOVl1ONPte8"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; will give you an idea of what these tools can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_20-hand-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hand Tool (Keyboard: H)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand tool allows you to click and drag around the Photoshop canvas. If the entire canvas currently fits on the screen, this tool won't do anything. This tool is for easily navigating around when you're zoomed in, or a picture is simple too big to fit on the screen at 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_21-zoom-tool.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zoom Tool (Keyboard: Z)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zoom tool lets you zoom in and out of the Photoshop canvas by clicking on a given area. By default, the zoom tool only zooms in. To zoom out, hold down the option key and use the zoom tool as you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_22-color-selection-tools.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Selection Tools (Keyboard: D for defaults, X to switch foreground and background colors)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools let you manage the colors you're using. The color on top is the foreground color and the color in back is the background color. The foreground color is what your brushes will use. The background color is what will be used if you delete something from the background or extend it (although now, Photoshop CS5 will give you the option for using your foreground color instead in some circumstances). The two smaller icons up top are shortcut functions. The left one, showing a black square on a white square, will set your foreground and background colors to the defaults (Keyboard: D). The double-headed curved arrow will swap your foreground and background color (Keyboard: X). Clicking on either the foreground or background color will bring up a color picker so you can set them to precisely the color you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Palettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palettes are the things that you see sitting over on the right side of your screen. They make it easy for you to navigate through your document, add adjustments, switch modes, and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p01-layers_01.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layers palette lets you see all the layers in your document. As you start getting to know Photoshop, you'll find yourself in this palette more than any other. It'll let you organize and arrange your layers, set &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes"&gt;blending modes&lt;/a&gt;, set visibility and opacity of layers, group and merge layers, and a bunch of other neat things we'll learn about in future lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p02-adjustments.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your adjustments panel is where you can easily create and edit adjustment layers. Adjustment layers are non-destructive image alterations that affect all the layers below them and can easily be turned on and off. Their most common use is for color correction (namely the &lt;i&gt;Levels&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Curves&lt;/i&gt; adjustments, but there are many different kinds of adjustments you can perform that can dramatically alter the look of your image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p03-color-channels.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Channels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color channels palette will let you look at the specific colors that make up your picture. If you're in RGB mode you'll get red, green, and blue. These color channels will differ if you're in a different color space (such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmyk"&gt;CMYK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color"&gt;LAB&lt;/a&gt;). When you choose a specific color, you'll notice you'll be shown your image in different versions of black and white. This is because each color channel is simply a monochromatic images representing the light in each channel (e.g. the red channel is just a look at the red light in your photo). Switching between these different channels is useful for making color channel-specific touch ups, overall contrast enhancements, and also for converting your photo to black and white in a compelling way. This will be discussed in greater detail in a later lesson about color correction and photo enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p04-color-picker_02.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Picker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This palette will let you easily alter your foreground and background colors using sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p05-color-swatches.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Swatches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color swatches palette is a set of pre-defined colors you can quickly choose from. You can load in several other pre-made swatch collections or create your own, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p06-history.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history palette lets you go back in time to undo any previous alterations. The standard undo command (in the edit menu) will simply toggle between undoing and redoing the latest action performed on your image. The history panel is where you can go back much further (50 actions by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_p07-text.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text palette, and the paragraph palette below it, let you make all sorts of adjustments to any text you create with the type tool. These options are very similar to what you'll find in a word processing, but you can also specify things like character width and spacing which are more useful in design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/02/thumb160x_menus.jpg" width="158" alt="Learn the Basics of Photoshop in Under 25 Minutes"&gt;Most of what you'll find in Photoshop's menus can be found using the previously discussed tools. Nonetheless, we're going to take a quick look at some notable items in each of the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File, as usual, handles opening, saving, and closing operations. Towards the end of these lessons we'll be taking a look at your different saving options (namely &lt;i&gt;Save for Web&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Edit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit, as usual, brings you copy, cut, and paste. In Photoshop, it's also where you transform layers and set your color spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image brings you canvas and image adjustments, including destructive effects that you'll also find in your adjustments palette. Options in this menu are designed to affect the image as a whole, although many adjustments are applied to only a single layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layer lets you do all of the things you can do in the layer palette with a few more options. This menu also lets you create adjustment layers and smart objects (a group of layers treated as a single object).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Select&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the marquee and lasso tools will be your main means of selecting things, the select menu can help you refine that selection or create entirely new selections based on certain criteria (such as color range and luminosity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter brings you a wealth of built-in (and, if installed, third-party) Photoshop filters that can blur, sharpen, distort, and alter your image (or layers of the image) in many different and unique ways. The best way to get acquainted with these filters is to try them all. That can take a little time, but it's fun to play around with them and see what they do. We'll be getting into the specifics in subsequent lessons, but only looking at a few commonly useful filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis provides you with measurement tools. There will be times when you need them to make accurate alterations to your images. We will not be covering anything in this menu in these basic lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3D&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, we're not covering 3D. If you decide to learn more about 3D later, you may want to explore this menu on your own at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View provides you with various view options, lets you hide and show line guides you've created (see video for an example), and make Photoshop snap (or not snap) to corners, edges, and to the grid on the canvas. Viewing of this invisible grid can also be turned on and off in the View menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Window&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window lets you hide and show certain windows and palettes. You can also arrange your Photoshop windows and palettes however you want and save them as a window preset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
That's all for today! In the next lesson we'll be learning about color correction, touch-ups, and photo enhancement.&lt;br&gt;

Why not let your computer do some of that work for you? That's where text expansion comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;What Is Text Expansion?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/340x_nrudzmtlls0_02.jpg" width="340" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Text expansion utilities monitor your typing and trigger rules when you type a predefined phrase or key combination. When you type one of those pre-defined phrases, your text expansion utility removes your short version and replaces it with a longer phrase without requiring you to type the entire thing—saving you loads of keystrokes and time. Watch the video above for a few examples of text replacement in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you could create a text expansion rule that triggers anytime you type &lt;em&gt;sig&lt;/em&gt; and hit the space bar, and fills in your entire email signature line—or you could set a trigger to fill in a canned email response, or just a common word or phrase that would take a long time to type manually. It&amp;#39;s all about saving time and keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;Setting Up Text Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to text expansion tools, you've got lots of choices depending on the platform you're running. Here's a couple of tools that we've used, and some basic instructions on getting them running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using PhraseExpress in Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There's a number of choices for text expansion in Windows, but &lt;a href="http://www.phraseexpress.com/"&gt;PhraseExpress&lt;/a&gt; is the only one I've tried that's very powerful, free for personal use, and also works in Windows 7. The standard edition is free for personal use, but it has an internal word list that will nag you if you try and use rules containing phrases like "your order".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New rules in PhraseExpress are called &amp;quot;Phrases&amp;quot;, and can be triggered with an &amp;quot;Autotext&amp;quot;, or a hotkey. The &amp;quot;Postfix&amp;quot; drop-down lets you choose what key will trigger the rule—for example, if you have it set to Tab, then in the example below you&amp;#39;d have to type &amp;quot;hre&amp;quot; and hit the Tab key to trigger the phrase content for replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/sshot-2010-08-12-1-10-28-35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_sshot-2010-08-12-1-10-28-35.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhraseExpress has a lot of other features, like a popup menu that will allow you to choose between different phrases before they are entered, libraries of common typos that you can download and use, and a whole lot of other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Once you've installed PhraseExpress, you'll probably want to delete the rules folder called "Websites", since it's got a bunch of affiliate link rules in there that automatically replace certain websites with affiliate links when you're typing them into your browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Texter in Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/sshot-2010-08-12-10-47-23.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_sshot-2010-08-12-10-47-23.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're not on Windows 7 yet, you can use &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php"&gt;Lifehacker's own Texter utility&lt;/a&gt; for text replacement. It's open source, free, and has some very powerful scripting support included, but unfortunately it has a few frustrating bugs in Windows 7. (If you're interested in helping Texter work better in Windows 7, we'd love to let anyone contribute &lt;a href="http://github.com/adampash/texter"&gt;to the source&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a new rule in Texter is very easy—just use the tray icon to create a new hotstring (or press Ctrl+Shift+H), add the short string you&amp;#39;d like to use in the Hotstring box, put in the full replacement text, and then choose whether you want it activated immediately or after you press Enter, Tab, or Space. Here&amp;#39;s a short video that shows Texter in action:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/340x_xtxzqsr1m2a_02.jpg" width="340" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AutoHotkey Hotstrings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're the more adventurous type who doesn't mind writing scripts, you can hack together your own text expansion with AutoHotkey's &lt;a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm"&gt;Hotstrings&lt;/a&gt; syntax—it&amp;#39;s the way that Adam showed us how to &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/keyboard-shortcuts/hack-attack-knock-down-repetitive-email-with-autohotkey-159785.php"&gt;knock down repetitive email with AutoHotkey&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago, and it works well if you're already using AutoHotkey and only have a few text expansion rules that you'd like to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to create a new AutoHotkey script, and paste in a new line with this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:oc:TRIGGERTEXT::REPLACETEXT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you wanted to setup a rule so that every time you type |e and hit Space that it will fill in your email address, you can use a rule like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:oc:|e::geek@howtogeek.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "o" in the beginning of the string says to don't actually add the Space or Tab key when doing the replacement, the "c" makes the rule case sensitive, and if you were to add a "*" character where the "oc" is, it would make the rule happen immediately rather than waiting until you hit a special character like Space, Tab, or Enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can actually use any AutoHotkey code for the REPLACETEXT in the example, as long as you end it with a Return-so if you wanted to trigger a more indepth script to figure out a timestamp or do something else, it would be fairly easy. See the &lt;a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm"&gt;Hotstrings documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Autokey in Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're a Linux user, you can use the &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5310976/autokey-does-customized-text-replacement-for-linux"&gt;AutoKey application&lt;/a&gt; to create powerful text expansion rules—and if you&amp;#39;re familiar with Python, the sky&amp;#39;s the limit for what you can accomplish with this application, since the rules can also contain Python code that can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create a new rule that is triggered with a hotkey or a text phrase, and you can even choose them from the tray menu or a popup menu if you prefer. It's simple and easy to get started with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_autokey.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Textexpander for Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re a Mac user, TextExpander is the way to go—it&amp;#39;s not free, but it&amp;#39;s got every feature that you might want, and there&amp;#39;s a free trial version that you can use to see if you like it. (In some Lifehacker writer&amp;#39;s experience, you can use the trial indefinitely—if you can put up with the nags.) They&amp;#39;ve also got built-in snippet groups for HTML, CSS, common misspellings, and accented words that are a pain to type normally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_sshot-2010-08-12-1-10-38-54.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Use Text Expansion to Save Yourself Hours of Typing Every Week"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;What Types of Text Expansion Rules Should I Use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you're going to need to figure out what rules are best for you-take a look at your normal workflow and figure out exactly what you're wasting the most time typing repeatedly, and add some text expansion rules to fix the worst offenders. Over time, you'll get used to how it works, and add more rules. That said, here's a few ideas on how text expansion can help you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Signatures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Text expansion can help you solve the problem of needing multiple different signatures for your email—all you need to do is create a set of text expansion strings tied to something like &lt;em&gt;sig1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sig2&lt;/em&gt;, and so on, with the different signatures for each one. You could use one for work related email and one for personal, or different signatures based on the contract you&amp;#39;re working on—it&amp;#39;s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canned Email Responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Answering email can be an enormous time suck, and if you analyze your email habits you&amp;#39;ll probably find that there are certain responses that you write over and over, which would make them a perfect candidate for text expansion. You can assign separate responses for each type of response—I like to use :can as the prefix to my responses, so my normal thank you response might be :canthx, or the &amp;quot;Thanks for the update, we&amp;#39;ll look into that!&amp;quot; might be assigned to :canup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently Used Bits of Text&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While we&amp;#39;re on the subject of email, there are often pieces of emails that are so frequently used that they could also be considered for text expansion—for example, if you often ended your emails by saying something like &amp;quot;We should discuss this next week&amp;quot;, you could assign that string to a shortcut of :nw and easily save yourself 29 keystrokes every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also create a text expansion string for your full contact information, if you find yourself frequently using it in an email but don't want to have it in your normal email signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify Writing for the Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you do a lot of writing for the web you'll probably need to deal with HTML at some point, especially if you're working with a system that doesn't have a decent editor. You can save yourself an enormous amount of time by setting up text expansion snippets for HTML links and other common elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of HTML elements are more complicated than a simple expansion, you can use the more advanced features of your text expansion application to paste from the clipboard, and then put the cursor in the right place so you can continue typing. For example, here's the rule that I use in PhraseExpress for creating an HTML link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{#insertclipboard}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{#cursor}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now whenever I type "hre" and hit the Tab key, PhraseExpress will paste that string in, replacing the {&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/insertclipboard/"&gt;#insertclipboard&lt;/a&gt;} section with the URL that I already pasted on my clipboard, and it will position the mouse cursor where the {&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/cursor/"&gt;#cursor&lt;/a&gt;} part of the string is, so I can type the name of the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Code Snippets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're a programmer, you can save yourself a ton of time by adding your boilerplate code to your text expansion tool, or even adding lines of code that you find yourself typing all the time. If you dig into the options in your IDE, you'll probably find that you already have a lot of these features built in, but if you're the type that uses a text editor to write code, this would be a great way to save some time. (The video above demonstrates how to use Texter for this very purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Address and Phone Number&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How often do you type out your own email address and phone number? You can save an enormous amount of time by simply assigning a really short string to output your email address, phone number, or other similar data like this. What I do is assign :e to fill out my email address, and :n to output my phone number—this saves time when filling out forms, or just typing your email address into a login box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address for Order Forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Typing your address into an online order form can be a pain, but text expansion can make it a lot easier. You can assign a short code like :addr to expand out your address, but you can take it a step further if you want—if you use the special keys insertion of your text expansion application you can add a Tab key press to your string, which will actually tab to the next field on the form. For example, if you&amp;#39;re using PhraseExpress you can use a string like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;123 Geeky Way{#TAB}{#TAB}Vienna{#TAB}vv{#TAB}90210&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice that the string for the State section uses the &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; key twice—since I live in Virginia, I have to hit that key twice to switch the normal State dropdown box to Virginia. The same thing works for text expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing Common Typos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;#39;t even count the number of times I&amp;#39;ve gone to type something like &amp;quot;hehe&amp;quot; into my IM client and ended up with &amp;quot;heeh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hee&amp;quot; instead. You can use text expansion to automatically replace your worst typos with the correct thing—for best results, you should set the rule to immediately do the replacement without requiring another key to be pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inserting Special Characters and Symbols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pulling out the Character Map utility every time you want to insert a copyright symbol, or some other special character, can be a bit of a pain. If you have to use special characters all the time, you should simply assign some rules to them instead-for example, :copy could be assigned to ©. Depending on the tool you&amp;#39;re using, you can probably assign a single hotkey to some of them—I have Ctrl+—assigned to insert an em-dash, since the WordPress quick editor doesn&amp;#39;t have a button for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date and Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just about any text expansion utility will let you easily insert the date and time—you can assign something like :date and :time to insert one or the other, or you could make it shorter if you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Folders for Windows Dialogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Browsing your Windows filesystem in the file open and save dialogs can be a waste of time, and just plain annoying. You can save yourself a lot of time by assigning a string to automatically fill in your most common paths—and it works even better if you use the special characters feature of your text expansion application to add an Enter key press to the end of it, which will force the dialog to switch to that folder. For example, I have :db assigned to this string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Geek\My Dropbox\{#ENTER}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This automatically switches me into the Dropbox folder by simply typing the :db string into the filename box in any open or save dialog.&lt;br&gt;
