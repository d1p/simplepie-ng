<p><strong>Biofeedback</strong> is not by any means a <strong>treatment</strong> for <em>asthma</em>, natural or other.  But <strong>biofeedback</strong> can be used in all aspects of our <strong>asthma</strong> plan and in a large number of other facets of our lives such as weight loss.  And to be honest we need to make biofeedback an integral part of our care strategy.  It is the way we can tell how well our bodies are functioning.</p>
<p>In the realm of <em>asthma treatments</em> it tells us if our current <strong>asthma </strong>plan is working and how well.  When we try a new <em>asthma treatment</em> it reveals whether our new strategy is working better than our old one.  When it comes to <strong>natural asthma treatments</strong> it lets us know if the plan we are using in conjunction with our regular asthma plan is giving us a benefit or not, and whether it is time to move onto something new.</p>
<p>Biofeedback for asthma can be as complex or as simple <span id="more-60"></span>as we choose it to be.  It can be as simple as maintaining a diary of when and how our attacks come about so we can avoid exposure to the same potential triggers, such as emotions or <strong>allergens</strong> in the future.  It can come in the form of a <em>peak flow meter</em> that measures how strong our lungs are working. Or an <em>oximeter</em>, which lets us know the oxygen saturation rate of our blood.</p>
<p>Weight loss biofeedback can come from bathroom scales that tell body fat percentages and hydration levels to something as simple as keeping a calorie diary.  Or a diary of how often we exercise and how that affects our bodies.</p>
<p>Biofeedback is something we use during all of our days.  Such as taking note that when you slip off a curb that it hurts your ankle.  And reminding yourself on occasion to be more careful.  Haha. As you have hopefully guessed by now, biofeedback is just a high brow term for the things we do everyday that help to look after us and keep us in good shape.</p>
<p>When it comes to <strong>natural asthma treatment</strong> biofeedback becomes all the more important to us.  It can help us identify new and better treatments.  But, and this is the most important part, it can also help us to know when treatments are not working.  Or when it is time to get yourself to the doctor.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about my experiences with asthmatic <strong>biofeedback</strong> methods stayed tuned over to <em>naturalasthma-treatment.com</em> where you can read all about my attempts to unravel the mysteries of <em>asthma</em>.</p>
<p>Good health to us all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may have seen this before, but, as it was a very popular article I thought I should put it up again.  I received expert author status from Ezine articles for this one.  Yes, I am quite proud of that.  Here ya go.</p>
<p>Of Eskimos, acids and oils.</p>
<p>First things first.  It’s a simple premise.  If you want to figure out how to do something right, find someone who does it well and follow their example.  This is true for all things, including <em>natural asthma treatments</em>.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Inuit population of Alaska.  They exercise regularly as part of their daily lives and have a diet that is high in cold saltwater fish.  Why is this important? One look at these people and you will realise why.  Heart disease, <strong>asthma</strong>, alzheimers.  These diseases have a very low occurrence in the Inuit population.  And recently the rest of the world has begun to understand why.</p>
<p><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> are an <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> and they also play an important part in human physiology.  The long chain <em>fatty acids</em> known as <em>DHA</em> and <em>EPA</em> (please don’t ask me to write their full names) are used inside the cell wall membranes of the cells in your body.  They are used to create and repair the cell walls.</p>
<p>They help repair cells in hair, eyes, heart, lungs, even in your brain.  <strong>Omega-3</strong>’s have been touted as a panacea (cure all) of late and when you begin to understand how the body uses them you start to see why.  So lets look a little more closely at them.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the human body uses long chain <em>EPA and DHA</em> in it’s cells.  The richest source of these fatty acids can be found in fish oil.  Primarily these come from deep cold water marine fish.  In Australia we are lucky as one of the richest and cleanest fish to get them from, “Hoki”, <span id="more-42"></span>is found in the oceans just off New Zealand.  The Hoki is known to have far lower concentrations of heavy metals than other fish which is great if you live in the Oceania region of the world.  But there are other alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Fish oil capsules</strong>.  Great for those not in a good region for getting their fill of saltwater fish.  Or if you don’t like fish and not to forget that some people also may have fish allergies.  The best and cleanest fish oil is made using a process called molecular distillation.  This keeps the fatty acids in tact and also removes the allergens and other nasties.  If you are uncomfortable with Capsules you can also get your <em>fish oil</em> in orange flavoured squeeze packets.  How cool is that!</p>
<p>If you are not happy with fish oil you still can get what you need from other sources.  <strong>Flax seed oil</strong> for example also contains <strong>omega-3</strong> <em>fatty acids</em>.  Albeit in the <em>ALA</em> short chain form.  The difference being that the body first needs to convert the short chain acids into long chain <strong>DHA and EPA</strong> before it can use them.  As you may have guessed the conversion rate can be low, as low as 20-30% in some cases. So you will need a lot more Flax seed oil than fish oil.  Just another thing to take into account when deciding which <strong>natural asthma treatment</strong> to try.</p>
<p>The other option is Omega-3’s derived from algae.  There are not a lot of these on the market as yet but the number is growing, pardon the pun.  All the long chain Omega-3’s with none of the allergens or contaminants.  As with most things in life you must weigh the pro’s against the con’s to decide which course you take.I, myself have started a course of <em>fish oil capsules</em> (I finally bought the cheap ones) as this appears to be the strongest and most convenient way to get “the good oil”.  I will be posting more information on a myriad of natural asthma treatments on <strong>naturalasthma-treatment.com</strong> in the coming months to demonstrate the large number of possible treatments for asthma that are out there.  Stay tuned to see what impact this has on my personal condition.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Buteyko </strong>is a breathing method, named after Dr. Konstantin Pavlovich <em>Buteyko</em>, a Russian doctor. It is the most effective approach for the management of <strong>asthma</strong> and other breathing-related problems. It can be practiced by both <em>adults and children</em>, and gives quick and consistent results. <em>Buteyko Breathing Method</em> is a series of breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, retraining and reducing the breath to normal levels, diaphragmatic breathing, and relaxation.<br />
It can be easily incorporated into the daily life of any person. It does not require interruption of your everyday activities to perform any sophisticated procedures. Concept of the method can be used at any time in any situation. So use this breathing method as a major tool to regulate your breathing, reclaim control, and begin to restore yourself to good health.<br />
Trials undertaken in Brisbane, Australia, showed people taught the <strong>Buteyko Method</strong> were able to reduce Bronchodilator usage (symptom related reliever medications) by 90% within six weeks, along with a marked improvement in quality of life (they felt much better). So it must provide consistent and long term results for those who learn, and maintain, this method.</p>
<p>How to do the Buteyko method?</p>
<p>First, practice shallow breathing, in which your nose only breath in and out, with your mouth closed. Then, breathe only with your diaphragm, never your chest, and sit in front of the mirror and place your hand on your belly and inhale. Remember, only your stomach moves, and not your chest. And lastly, Place your finger under your nose. <span id="more-34"></span>Your breathing should be so shallow that you barely feel any air moving.</p>
<p>What is the role of <strong>Buteyko </strong>as a <strong>natural Asthma treatment</strong>?</p>
<p>This scientific truth explains the staggering success of <em>Buteyko</em> and why asthma and other symptoms just disappear. Buteyko breathing works as an asthma prevention or asthma cure. Gradually extending breath-holding exercises increases carbon dioxide levels in the blood so you can&#8217;t get asthma or, if you&#8217;re already having an asthma attack, the build-up of carbon dioxide from breathing Buteyko acts as nature&#8217;s own <em>bronchodilator</em>, rapidly clearing <em>asthma</em> constricted airways</p>
<p>Asthma is the body&#8217;s natural defense against the loss of carbon dioxide. Asthma attacks restrict breathing to stop carbon dioxide levels from falling further because, when carbon dioxide levels drop too low, the body and brain become oxygen starved. An <strong>asthma attack</strong>, however serious and dangerous it may appear, is not representative of the body&#8217;s intention to imperil life &#8211; it is in fact nature&#8217;s way of preserving it.  The method requires perseverance and discipline, the more effort you put into it the more you get out of it. We found that sometimes people with chronic asthma are even more determined and often achieve better results than mild asthmatics.</p>
<p>Good health to us all</p>

<p>Well if you&#8217;re anything like me, you may be getting the sneaking suspicion that <em>orthodox medicine</em> may not be the right way to deal with your <strong>asthma</strong>.  With up to 150,000,000 sufferers of <em>asthma</em> around the world and the numbers continually climbing, <em>western medicine</em> doesn&#8217;t seem to be making any headway on curing this <strong>ailment</strong>.  So bearing in mind that approximately 180,000 people die from our shared condition every year maybe, just maybe, it&#8217;s time to look elsewhere for our solutions.</p>
<p>I have started this website to allow sufferers of <em>asthma</em> and their families to learn of the alternatives to orthodox treatments, to share their stories and to follow my own personal journey into the realm of <em>natural asthma treatment</em>.  So if you&#8217;re looking for a new way of coping <span id="more-18"></span>with your <strong>asthma</strong> without the drugs and their side effects this is the place for you.  I will be updating you on my own <em>treatment</em> as we go so you can follow along and I will also be offering articles, links and reviews of <em>alternative</em> methods for combating this affliction.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute ideas, advice, stories or moral support during my upcoming attempts to heal myself feel free to click on the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; link and drop me a line.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you and welcome aboard.</p>
<p>David</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome and Apologies</p>
<p>Welcome to all the new readers.  Thank you for stopping in at <strong>naturalasthma-treatment.com</strong>. Wonderful to see some new faces along with my regular readers.</p>
<p>Apologies to all for not having more on the site.  More will be coming soon.  Promise.  As some of you know I&#8217;m fairly new to all this internet stuff and as a consequence of changing to a cheaper hosting account, I was unable to save all of the content from the original site.  That being said I did save some and will be reposting it shortly.</p>
<p>As with all changes, they are defined as good or bad depending on how you approach them.  <span id="more-5"></span>I will be looking at this change as a change for the better.  <strong>Naturalasthma-treatment</strong> 2.0, if you will.  A chance to make things better.  I hope you all like it and you&#8217;re more than welcome to come along for the ride.</p>
<p>Oh. And don&#8217;t forget if you like what you find here, click the RSS button to subscribe to the site and you will autromatically be kept up to date with all the new content.  You also have the option of letting others know about the site with the Share/Save button below the posts.  Dunno about this social bookmarking stuff but it seems to be popular.  Don&#8217;t forget if you have any ideas, question or comments, we&#8217;d love to hear from you.  We have put in a &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; button at the top of the page just for the purpose.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard and <em>Good Health </em>to us all.</p>
<p>David</p>
