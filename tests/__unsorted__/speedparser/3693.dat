I only count the experiences that actually have students using the scientific method as labs, and I give students a good long while to write the reports.  This year, I have moved to a format where students are publishing their lab reports online, which has eliminated the need for me to actually collect physical documents.  I’ve also been able to eliminate the need to deal with the grading process (which is rubric driven) in any physical space.  Here’s a brief description of how things go down:&lt;/p&gt;
     
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g51ymc6ig_b47zPi9ZUMELAYjA6TbVylZ8D8OGpVww4/edit?hl=en_US"&gt;given a document&lt;/a&gt; explaining the expectations for lab write-ups and the rubric by which they will be graded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the completion of the experiment in class, we decide as a group what an acceptable due date for the write up is (I usually shoot for ~3 weeks from the end of the experiment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students must create the lab in Google Docs (or they could write it in another word processor and then convert it to a GDoc if they want to go through and deal with the inevitable formatting issues).  I’m a bit torn on requiring students to use a specific program, but GDocs has a few features that are very useful for what’s to follow (and it’s FREE!).  Plus it provides students in the same group an easy way to share protocol, data, and any graphs they may decide to create together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the lab is created, students do two things.  They give me editor access to the lab, and they make the lab publicly viewable.  Students link to the publicly viewable version of their lab in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bioblog.mrknuffke.net/2011/09/lab-report-1-magnet-post-brine-shrimp-hatching-rate-inquiry/"&gt;the comments of a magnet post&lt;/a&gt; that I put on the course blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once that’s done, I can go into the lab, leave comments about it, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I grade the lab according to the rubric on a google spreadsheet that I have made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the grade is determined, I use GDocs email function to email the grade to the student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it.  Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy.  The first batch of lab submissions in this new model are coming in right now (the deadline is midnight tonight), and I am impressed with how students are adapting to the new model.  I’ve decided that any student who submits the lab early will be given the chance to revise according to the comments that I leave, which only seems fair, since there always seems to be some areas of the labs that could be a bit better-developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if the process of requiring students to publish their lab reports will lead to the generation of a higher quality of report.  I’m hopeful that it will.  At the very least, it will provide students with examples from their peers, and that has to be a good thing, no?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10938733590</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10938733590</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2011 12:41:00 -0400</pubDate><category>education</category><category>science</category><category>students</category><category>teaching</category><category>technology</category><category>xl</category></item><item><title>One of my HChem kids sent me a link to a bunch of chemistry...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsau2bIf3Y1qb6fhfo1_400.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my HChem kids sent me a link to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/9uMJgD/geeks.thedailywh.at/2011/07/26/chemistry-cat-of-the-day"&gt;a bunch of chemistry puns&lt;/a&gt;.  The one that you see above is by far the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10855226033</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10855226033</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2011 15:06:06 -0400</pubDate><category>science</category><category>students</category><category>teaching</category><category>education</category><category>silliness</category></item><item><title>As a reminder, Zwiebel is not the only cat that lives around...</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="304"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kCYlb2MQ2zQ&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kCYlb2MQ2zQ&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="304" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, Zwiebel is not the only cat that lives around here.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;Prezi has a comment thread for public presentations, and the thread on mine gets one or two a day.  Most of them are very nice, but a few are clearly the work of trolls, creationists, or just odd folks.  None of that is particularly bothersome, though it does make for some fun times.  I have enjoyed moderating the thread, and I have tried my darnedest to try to leave up the critical notes, along with the laudatory ones.  I’ve even allowed creationists to have their say (the working rule is you get one comment, I get a reply, and then you can go to whatever crazy place on the Internet you get our nutty thinking from and leave the rest of us alone).   Really, there aren’t that many nuts, though I did get an email (on my work address) telling me how “neat” my presentation was before throwing up a couple of common canards and encouraging me to go “learn” from a fundamentalist Christian website.  The author did not enjoy my reply, in which I tried as hard as possible to be politely firm in my opposition to his viewpoint (though I did classify his critique as “&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1&amp;nord=1#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;nord=1&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=define%3Atwaddle&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=&amp;aq=&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;qscrl=1&amp;fp=7d2586df601d763f&amp;ion=1&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=7d2586df601d763f&amp;biw=1405&amp;bih=783&amp;ion=1"&gt;twaddle&lt;/a&gt;”, which seemed to be the particular bug in his bonnet).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really very happy that folks like the work I’m doing for my class, but I don’t agree with the notion that there is anything particularly special about what I’m doing.  The prezi format allows for conceptual design that seems well past anything that can be done in a traditional slideware format.  All you need is a schema for your topic, and you can probably evoke it at a level that is surprisingly representative.  Also, the work that I do just takes other folk’s created images and puts a text narrative underneath.  Occasionally, I create a diagram in Prezi, proper, but since the good people at Pearson have given me permission to use the digital media that accompanies &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.campbellbiology.com/"&gt;Campbell’s Biology&lt;/a&gt; (9th edition), there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, those are my thoughts after racking up more views than I know what to do with on something that I originally thought would only be seen by the kids who came through my classroom (and the legion of colleagues who have to deal with me on the list serve).  There are other, more technical points that I could make about what I think is the best way to create presentations on the Prezi platform, but that’s not really the point of this note.  I just thought it was a good time to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10561987016</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10561987016</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 14:00:05 -0400</pubDate><category>prezi</category><category>technology</category><category>personal</category><category>education</category></item><item><title>Inside and Outside Are Required</title><description>&lt;!-- .prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; } --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, what works for me may very well not work for you.  I tried having students blog before.  A few years back, I gave every AP Biology student an &lt;a href="http://www.edublogs.org" target="_blank"&gt;edublog&lt;/a&gt; and made them use it for a while, but it fast got too cumbersome.  The major issue was that having 20+ students with 20+ webspaces just seemed too inefficient for the purpose of actually interfacing with the students.  I was the only visitor to their blogs, and they never really interacted with each other.  Each student blog was an electronic island floating on the inter-sea.  Not great.  So, I silently killed the idea and went back to the old way of doing things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure exactly when the inspiration came along this past spring, but I suddenly realized that the reason that my blogging experiment had not worked was because I was doing it wrong:  Rather than having students run their own, individual blogs, the best way to do this thing was to put all students into the same space and make them all contributors to the same blog.  One place, with 18 smiling contributors, and 1 master-editor administrator with his hand on the tiller.  So it was that in early June, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bioblog.mrknuffke.net"&gt;Bioblog&lt;/a&gt; was born (an aside—the modern &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; back-end is a well-oiled and super user-friendly machine for folks of even a remotely web-literate constitution).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that if I had to pick a great idea for this year, I would have to put my &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pseudopodia.org/post/10244516924/my-sbg"&gt;SBG grading scheme&lt;/a&gt; for Honors Chemistry in the octagon with Bioblog, and let them fight it out.  Frankly, I don’t know who would win.  The greatest thing about Bioblog is the fact that it provides students a super clean, completely modern web magazine format for them to use to publish their work for the entire internet to view.  I don’t suggest that my web-design skills are incredible, but I do think they are functional.  Things look pretty good to me when I click on the site.  Someone on twitter quoted &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://novemberlearning.com/team/alan-november/"&gt;Alan November&lt;/a&gt; the other day in saying that if you want students to do authentic work, make them publish.  I think there’s tremendous virtue in that.  Knowing that the work they are doing is going wide really forces students to take a bit more pride in what they are turning in, to say nothing of the fact that it is training them for the modern life in a way that nothing else that I can do for them will.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to run a lot of projects in AP Bio.  Since moving to the blog, it has quickly become apparent that they are all going to live in this space.  I’m keeping a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1QVs34NebafuO7vZ8PP05h-wL3CbEVoQaMypzPZ-A20g"&gt;running list of assignments&lt;/a&gt; for students.  I love the fact that I can reward them for generating awesome work and communicating with their colleagues and the larger biology world.  All I had to do was frame it out and give a push and they do the rest.  This week, we figured out how to post their lab reports (create them in google docs, make them publicly viewable, post the link—and let’s not forget to give me editor access so I can comment and grade).    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a pretty tech-fluent guy, but I’ve always felt like the major aspect of my student-side tech was giving students an authentic place for them to create and share the work that they do.  That problem seems to be past now, and I can’t tell you how good it feels to be doing something so much fun with a group of students who seem eager to take it all in stride.  Stop over some time and tell them what a great job they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10485969739</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10485969739</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 14:10:05 -0400</pubDate><category>bioblog</category><category>education</category><category>students</category><category>teaching</category><category>technology</category><category>xl</category></item><item><title>Why You Need Stuff</title><description>&lt;!-- .prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; } --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“…something you realize you’re doing after you’ve attempted a lesson which from the outset looks like it should result in student learning, but upon further reflection, you realize that the very lesson itself was flawed and involved minimal learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the examples pointed to are very input-centric modes of instruction. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This has gotten me thinking about what such a process looks like, particularly in the biology classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most (all?) of the folks who have written on this topic teach a physical science or mathematics.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A lot of the folks who are writing on this topic use &lt;a href="http://modeling.asu.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;“modeling instruction”&lt;/a&gt; in their classes.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Without meaning to sound disrespectful, I do think that the folks who are talking about these things are probably, to some extent, biased by the subjects that they teach and the way that they teach them.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I think modeling instruction is a fascinating mode of teaching, but I have a hard time seeing how it could be used in a biology classroom (particularly at the AP level). &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take one example, the inimitable Mr. Noschese has a &lt;a href="http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/pt-pseudoteaching-mit-physics/" target="_blank"&gt;really good post&lt;/a&gt; about the structure of physics education at MIT.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I think he makes a lot of really good points, and I count myself among those who would not have done very well in the old system.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;But I just don’t see where in Biology we can move away from input to the same extent that folks can in physics or chemistry (the former being a subject that I never really loved as a student, the later being a subject that I spend most of my day teaching).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There just seems to be something about the nature of biological inquiry that requires a good bit more directed content acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I am not without my own biases on this subject.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I know that I am the sort of student who does very well in directed input when the lecturer is interesting and I am interested in the topic.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;For me, it has been that way since time immemorial.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Similarly, I have given a lot more consideration to the structure of my own input for my AP biology course over the last couple of years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;My students are expected to interface with the content of a particular class discussion prior to that discussion, and I will never spend more than half of my class time in AP Biology having that discussion with my students.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;And I try my damnedest to have a discussion them, not a lecture at them. But in looking at all of the formats that biology folks are currently developing to “flip” their classrooms or “individualize” instruction for their students, there remains a good bit of teacher-directed input in every scheme that I see.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;That input may take place in or out of the classroom (&lt;a href="http://www.bozemanscience.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Anderson&lt;/a&gt; would be the obvious example of moving the input out of the classroom), but it still takes place.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;And here’s the thing, in a biology course, that doesn’t play as “pseudoteaching” to me.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It plays as necessary.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m missing something?&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Maybe I’ve (inadvertently) misconstrued the position that I’ve described above?&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Or maybe there really is something a bit different about the appropriate instructional approach for Biology content, when we line it up against the other sciences (of which I’ll include mathematics)?&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10365191049</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10365191049</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 13:33:00 -0400</pubDate><category>education</category><category>input</category><category>pseudoteaching</category><category>teaching</category><category>xl</category></item><item><title>Pretty happy that I found a place in my Origin of Life...</title><description>&lt;object width="400" height="231"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1WvuJwMFPz4&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1WvuJwMFPz4&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="231" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty happy that I found a place in my Origin of Life presentation to stick this clip from &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/"&gt;“Tree of Life”&lt;/a&gt;.  I would have happily put the rest of the origin sequence in there, too, but it doesn’t seem to be living on youtube at current.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10323185379</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10323185379</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2011 14:12:19 -0400</pubDate><category>video</category><category>science</category><category>aweseome</category><category>teaching</category></item><item><title>What it means to have a spine</title><description>&lt;!-- .prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; } --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had mentioned in the last long-form post that I was going to delve more in to my shiny, new, Standards-Based Grading (SBG) policy in future postings, and it appears that time has come.  For this post, I’ll focus on what the actual policy looks like in terms of how student’s grades are determined.  We’ll be back here many times this year, so all the other things worth talking about will get discussed, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t hang on my every word (in other words, those of you who aren’t my parents), I have been successful in convincing the other two Honors Chemistry teachers that it might be a good use of our time this year to try an SBG model for at least part of the grade determinations of our students.  They seem to have enough faith in my good judgement to come along for the ride (suckers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who isn’t wonky on pedagogy should probably pause right now and go google themselves up some SBG background info.  &lt;a title="thinkthankthunk sbg" target="_blank" href="http://shawncornally.com/wordpress/?page_id=114"&gt;Try here&lt;/a&gt; for a relatively enjoyable introduction to the concept (a concept that is really nothing new).  If you want to skip all of that pesky educating yourself, feel free to just keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s our new Honors Chemistry policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% of a students quarterly average will be determined using an SBG approach.  This includes all work done in class that is not an exam (more on that bit later) or the Supernintendo-mandated 10% class participation grade.  All quizzes, classwork, projects, and labs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than grade the work, the work will be assessed according to how well students are demonstrating proficiency on a series of communally-established course standards (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XGKYjKLVfUppOxEQv19p4AsilpoAvpTFAeP_5iYhdok"&gt;viewable here as they evolve&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the magic of Google Docs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For most standards, the scale runs from 1-4, with 4 indicating advanced-level master, 3 indicating proficiency (what the competent Honors Chemistry student needs to be able to do), and 2, 1, and the sad, sad 0 moving further and further away from proficiency.  Some standards, including all lab standards are on a 1-3 scale, as we feel there is no major need to have an advanced standard for laboratory skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every Friday, students are assessed by us using a series of standards-aligned assessments in a “quiz” format.  This is the major mode of assessment for content that comes from instructors that is placed into the gradebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homework is never assessed for the purpose of grading, though it is reviewed with students in both whole-group and small-group settings, collected on certain days so as to offer feedback, and generally of a level of enough importance for student progress that it is almost always done by students even though it’s not “worth” anything to their grades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students are able to request reassessment for standards as they wish, though scores on reassessment are not guaranteed to be better, and most likely won’t be unless students put in some work on learning the things that they did not know the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All SBG scores are tallied in an &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.activegrade.com"&gt;online gradebook&lt;/a&gt; that students and their parents can access as per their desires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the quarter, students will conference with the instructor to review their progress towards proficiency on standards and determine what amount of the 50% of their quarter average determined through the SBG approach they should receive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exams comprise 40% of a students quarter grade, and consist of two summative exams given at mid- and end- quarter.  Exam performance is determined via traditional percentage calculation, and can not be reassessed in the fashion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where it’s at.  I don’t presume to suggest that it is a perfect system, or even a “great” system, but I do think it goes a lot farther to making students think about their progress, and how they are doing on specific chemistry learning objectives, than the old mode of rotely cranking out almost completely meaningless percentages and pulling numbers out of a teacher’s bag of tricks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that should be obvious is that our system is a hybrid system, with a lot more emphasis on summative, traditional exams, then many SBG proponents would probably dig.  I don’t really care about them.  What I do care about is developing a system that begins to move me away from grading practices that I think are stupid, and that obeys the command of Boss, who told me that I was welcome to move to an SBG system as long as I could get all three Honors Chem. teachers to come along for the ride using the same system (one of the unfortunate pleasures of teaching in the age of the new APPR-either we all do it, or no one does), and my colleagues are not necessarily as comfortable throwing all exams out the window as I might be if I was off in my own little world.  On another note, keeping exams in so big for at least this year provides a good comparison point to see just how congruent the new mode is with the old mode.  It’s a way to stay tethered to the past, while thinking about how to do things differently.  To use a piece of jargon, it gives me quasi-objective information for “data-driven instructional choices” (whatever the fuck that means).  And if I have learned one thing in this career, it’s the incredible power that comes from being able to take the language of the system that is so frequently used to destroy good teaching practice and turn it back on itself.  If you can do that effectively, you can do anything in your classroom that your heart desires, and no one will ever say beep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see where this road leads…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10244516924</link><guid>http://pseudopodia.org/post/10244516924</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2011 14:00:05 -0400</pubDate><category>education</category><category>teaching</category><category>Standards-Based Grading</category><category>grading</category></item><item><title>Having spent the better part of my non-instructional day...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrjgwpU3ML1qbr8m0o1_400.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent the better part of my non-instructional day providing feedback on homework and running extra help, I just really like this cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
