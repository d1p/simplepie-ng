For those who don't know me very well, Professor Layton and the Something-Something-Something is by far one of my favorite series of video games of all time.
<br />
<br />
I'm extremely excited to know that the fourth game hitting the States for the Nintendo DS will contain the supposed 100+ hour <b>London Life</b> RPG.  Thank you Nintendo!
<br />
<br />
Watch the trailer over at Joystiq, good sirs and madams.

So, ya. Don't feed your dogs grapes.  While the <em>actual</em> reactions differ from dog to dog, it is definitely something you should avoid doing.
<br />
<br />
For those who are wondering, Napoleon is doing well. We'll have a checkup later this week or so.

All joking aside, this is an amazing use of three different technologies (Kyle McDonald's ofxFacetracker + Jason Saragih's facetracker library + Kevin Atkinson's image clone code) to do real-time face substitution. Think about the fidelity of this kind of thing in five or so years.

Messed around with the games page over at <a href = "http://www.shengames.com" target = "new">Shen Games</a>.  I figure I'll be putting the <a href = "http://www.shengames.com" target = "new">Shen Games</a> URL and logo on all tabletop games I make so I should make the distinction now.
<br />
<br />
Nothing else really new.  Just ramping up for the big move! More details to follow.  I'm sure I could make a game about moving... I may think about it on the train today.

Now I'll have <em>three</em> (Uncharted 3, The Last Guardian and this) reasons to turn my Playstation 3 on in the near future!
<br />
<br />
I haven't had such an overwhelming feeling of being "glad" since they announced Yakuza 4 coming to the states (with hostess club mini-games intact)!  Man, that ex-Yakuza sure loved clapping to some awful Karaoke.

I'll have my <em>first ever</em> tabletop game for sale at <a href = "http://comic-con.org/ape/" target = "new">APE 2011</a> this year.  The game contains 12 game tiles, 2 dice, 3 character markers and 15 gems as well as an instructions booklet.  While the game isn't nearly as engaging as, let's say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=0&ref_=nb_sb_noss&y=0&field-keywords=arkham%20horror&url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&tag=retailotaku-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Arkham Horror</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=retailotaku-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, it's still a quick game that's simple, for one to three players and only $10.
<br />
<br />
I'm really putting the "handmade" into, well, "handmade tabletop games".
<br />
<br />
Look for it soon!]]></description><wfw:commentRss>http://www.alexandershen.com/blog/rss-comments-entry-12860001.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Review: Grand Prix Story</title><category>reviews</category><dc:creator>Alexander Shen</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2011 17:15:33 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.alexandershen.com/blog/2011/9/14/review-grand-prix-story.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">547432:6300571:12844068</guid><description><![CDATA[<br />

Before I begin I must say that this review is heavily biased because I have a strong affinity toward <a href = "http://kairopark.jp/iphone/en/" target = "new">Kairosoft/Kairo Park</a> games.  I think their brand of "stat building" games are so well executed that it would have to take an utter disaster to break me off the series.
<br />
<br />
<b>Gameplay:</b> The gameplay is very similar to the other games of the same genre. You have something(s) that require stats to be boosted and through a few keystrokes and "tests to see if the boosting happens", you'll see if your something(s) get better.  Then you take those something(s) as a whole and put them in a test to see if they beat other people's (computer controlled) something(s).  In this game it's race cars and you have to see if the parts you upgrade, research and implement create better race cars than your opponents.
<br />
<br />
<b>The Appeal:</b> Where the game strikes a chord with me is kind of like a "God sim" game where you essentially have the power to bestow upon your minions (race cars, in this case) powers and abilities and then place them in a test to see how they do.  It's like raising a virtual pet in a way.   You hope that all the gifts you have bestowed upon your people are not wasted and that they can achieve everything to their highest potential.  That's where the appeal lies.  I found myself clicking away, watching progress bars fill and stats increase for hours on end.  And all for what?  For the sake of seeing if they can get first place on a racetrack in some random country.
<br />
<br />
There's something very fulfilling seeing these race cars make their way to first place. It's even more fulfilling knowing that you <em>can't</em> directly control the race cars (which seems counterintuitive).  It's not up to how good you are a gamer per se, what with your fancy joysticks and inverted y-axis and finger dexterity.  It's about your planning!  Were your stats good enough?  If not, it's time to go back to the drawing board.  That in itself is what makes it so enjoyable.  You really do find yourself spending so much time without even knowing it.
<br />
<br />
<b>Compared to the Others:</b> Outside of <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fgame-dev-story%252Fid396085661%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Game Dev Story</a>, only because I'm a big gamer, I think this is my next favorite one. I think the main reason is that it was much easier to get into than <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpocket-academy%252Fid432080204%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Pocket Academy</a> and you felt like you made a lot more progress with fewer clicks than <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fmega-mall-story%252Fid454679700%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Mega Mall Story</a>.  And even though all of the games in the series utilize computer controlled something(s), this one made it feel like you actually had more control since you were actually tuning/editing the race cars themselves.  The games you made in <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fgame-dev-story%252Fid396085661%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Game Dev Story</a> were really at the mercy of your development team and you never could really control where the students or people were going in <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpocket-academy%252Fid432080204%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Pocket Academy</a> or <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=JTWMl8xi74k&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fmega-mall-story%252Fid454679700%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Mega Mall Story</a>. And while the race cars stats are still at the mercy of your mechanics, you still have options of swapping out parts (as said earlier) which can really affect the outcome of your next race.
<br />
<br />
It's also <b>25% off</b> right now for a limited time! That's $2.99 for those in the states.
<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b> Is this game worth brown bagging your lunch for one day instead of buying that Big Mac meal? You bet your greasy fingers it is. Go buy it and I'll see you on the racetrack. I'll be in the pink Prototype car, slamming wildly into tires on the side of the racetrack.
