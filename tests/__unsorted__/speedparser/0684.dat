Her writing style differs from what I'm used to. Her tone is clipped to such a degree that Tempe's internal voice sounds a lot more like a computer than a narrator, which is certainly in keeping with the Brennan character on <i>Bones.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>What's surprising is that the clipped, clinical narrator may be an even better choice for presenting the tragedies in <i>Fatal Voyage</i> and <i>Grave Secrets</i> than the narrator that we're used to. As much as I'd prefer to empathize, I don't think there's any way to emotionally connect with an events so terrible. The dispassionate narration is a more effective tool in this instance as it allows the reader to comprehend the tragedy rather than connect with it emotionally. In the age of murder and forensics TV shows like <i>CSI </i>and <i>Bones</i> itself, it's become increasingly rare for death - on any magnitude - to be as traumatic. Reichs gets through the desensitization by not trying to overwhelm you emotionally.</p><p>When it comes right down to it, I enjoyed the book. The mystery was a real mystery and it was very well-written.<br /></p><p><br /></p>]]>

It's even more rare that I give up after less than 50 pages, but that's exactly what happened with this one. At a guess, part of the problem is that I saw favourable remarks about Schroeder's books on io9 and since I really enjoy making a point of reading Canadian sci-fi, I had rather high hopes, perhaps even unreasonably so.<br /><br />My biggest issue in the 50 pages I did read is that Schroeder seems to suffer from a form of gadgetitis. Few things drive me quite as batty as gadgetitis. It's what drives me up the wall with authors like Dan Simmons and Chris Moriarty. In Schroeder's case, He has this really cool idea for a premise and seems to have written a book to explain it. Problem is, in that fifty pages, it doesn't appear that the premise is integral in any way to the plot. It doesn't even make a huge amount of sense.<br /><br />A giant ball containing vast quantities of smaller planetoids moving according to no particular order? I have to wonder why anyone would be a structure of that nature and not plan out the interior more carefully. The settlements are all made out of wood. Since sunlight is considered a valuable resource, I would expect wood to be in much shorter supply. And harnessing "suns"? No comment.<br /><br />I think I had to stop reading the book simply to avoid being disappointed by a book I wanted to like.<br /></div>]]>

        <![CDATA[I worry about the precedent <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/11/18/calgary-homework-school-students.html">this</a> sort of thing sets. While I realize that there are a variety of learning styles and the current education system (in Calgary, which I went through) caters to a rather small subset of them, I'm not sure that a no-homewok contract is really in the best interests of his children. I foresee a couple of problems here:<br /><br />1) Work Ethic<br />Face it, we're talking about kids. A large part of why we incorporate homework into the system is that we want to teach our children how to sit down at work at something. It's usually considered good preparation for a job in which you sit at a desk for eight hours a day and work. This type of setup completely misses that, and freed of the constraints of doing that homework (which was supposed to be helping them study the material they're supposed to know anyway), I'm not really sure a) how they're going to study and b) what's going to get them to actually work.<br /><br />2) Other skills<br />There are a number of skills we learn simply by doing rote work. One of the biggest is honing our ability to think analytically (a skill which many seem to lack). Sometimes, you just have to stare at and pound your head against a problem until the metaphorical light comes on. Another major skill this sidesteps is the ability to do simple calculations very quickly. One of the skills I've found the most useful in engineering is the ability to do simple arithmetic very quickly.<br /><br />The other skill I think this doesn't help is going to be their predictive capabilities. This is definitely subject for another post because I don't think schools in general do enough to teach this. By doing a variety of very similar problems we learn to recognize what the answers should be and to estimate those answers before calculating them. It allows us to recognize very quickly when we make errors and to find those errors in our calculations. But to do it, we have to know what kind of answers to expect.<br /><br />Benefits<br />Not this this plan isn't without certain advantages. I can't disagree that there is a thing as too much homework, especially in elementary and junior high. Kids really must have the time to develop their own interests and their own personalities. It's really hard to do that when you go home every day and spend the rest of the evening with your nose in a book.<br /><br />As with many things, I think this is a question of balance, and I don't think this particular plan is any more balanced than what they had before.<br /> ]]>

        <![CDATA[I've decided to ditch a class and just write for once. I'm in the middle of a destress period and so I'm not feeling terribly ambitious just at the moment.<br /><br />I spent a while yesterday looking up folk music on youtube. I'm the product of a rather odd family and it shows. I grew up on the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Woody Guthrie and this list goes on for a really long time. The radio was permanently tuned to the oldies station (until they changed it to the 24-hour news station). In any case, I've ended enjoying a lot of culture that isn't current. Most of it was produced long before I was born and nor small amount before my parents were even around.<br /><br />In all of this, I went to check up on a little bit of trivia I'd heard once: that the artist or group with the most Billboard top 10 hits wasn't Elvis or the Beatles, but the Andrews Sisters. 46 of their songs hit top 10, more than anyone else before or after. And for the most part, my generation has never heard of them. Terribly, terribly, disappointing.<br /><br />

Especially when the heroine has no real character flaws. She's freakishly like the Australian version of Honor Harrington. Not a good sign...</p><p>Speaking of Australia, while I understand the desire to culturally flavour a universe with one that's familiar to us in the present day, there are good ways of pulling it off and not so good ways. <i>The Outback Stars</i> seriously overdoes it. The Australian theme doesn't just flavour her universe, it completely overpowers it. When we start getting trips to the dreamworld to chat with aboriginal deities, I've got issues. And it's boring. I'm really not a fan of "trippy" sequences, especially when I'm reading, and the ones in here really ended up turning me off.</p><p>In fact, the only really interesting thing in the whole story is this interstellar transport system they stumble into, and I really, <i>really</i> hope it gets elaborated on in the next two books. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book. It's just nothing out of the ordinary, either.<br /></p></div>]]>

<font style="font-size: 0.9em;"><i>Ian C. Esslemont</i></font><br />
<br />
I do believe this is the first time I've read an entire novel that takes place in a single night. This is very definitely the prelude to the Malazan Book of the Fallen. I actually started reading Gardens of the Moon right after to see how it all ties together and it's downright beautiful. The first of Erickson's books starts in the same place off the same events, years later.<br />
<br />
For anyone unfamiliar, Esslemont and Erickson are old buds and their series take place in a shared world that developed out of their roleplaying gaming. Their world, Malaz, is incredibly rich and consequently <i>very</i> hard to follow sometimes. But then again, I'm sure I'd be complaining if it was simple and easy to follow. What's important is that I really enjoy being able to read excellent Canadian sci-fi and fantasy and this totally qualifies.<br />
<br />
The short timespan may actually be the book's greatest weakness. It creates some weird pacing that doesn't feel right. and there's a lot of detail in the book that really serves very little purpose but to pad. It even shows up in the formatting: the margins are huge and even the font size is overly large. It's like a 300 page book that the editor decided absolutely had to take up 500 pages. Well, I <i>like</i> shorter novels. Brevity is always appreciated (as much difficulty as I tend to have acheiving it).<br />
<br />
Where this book has a leg up on Erickson's material is in its simplicity. There are two main characters and a limited cast of supporting characters, most of whom don't show up in the later books in the series. That makes is a lot easier to follow and also means it's an easier introduction to the main series.<br />
<br />
It's definitely an action-packed book, though much of it is in one-on-one encounters and the single larger battle that gets Kellanved and Dancer into the Deadhouse. I did find the interactions with Edgewalker to be tiresome after a while. He's very smug and mysterious. I don't mind smug and mysterious when there's a payoff, but there's really no payoff in this one.<br />
What I really want to see (since I've only read the first four books of the main series) is a way more material on Dassem Ultor and Temper.</div>]]>

Microsoft really is capable of getting things right.<br /><br />I'd been a little bit worried after reading some of the reviews that it was going to take me a fair while to get it installed. Beyond the irritating fact that there's no direct upgrade path from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Pro, it wasn't half bad. 45 minutes tops.

Banks</font></i><br /><br />What an incredible book. I know space opera is supposed to be full of epic battles and massive fleets. And under that definition, <i>Look to Windward</i> probably wouldn't qualify as true space opera. But it is, and it's simultaneously so much more.<br /><br />I think what fascinates me about Banks' books is the sheer scale. The Orbitals are Dyson rings containing 50 billion people. GSVs (General Systems Vehicles) are the largest Culture ships and home to millions of people and entire cities. Even time is taken on a scale that makes human lifetimes irrelevant.<br /><br />I rather doubt that spoilers are necessary since the book has virtually no conflict. That's not to say it doesn't have a plot - it most certainly does. But the only conflict occurs almost at the very end of the book and is essentially irrelevant to the book as a whole. I've learned to trust Banks in a number of ways, and this is probably the most important. The book will be good and I can just sit back, relax and enjoy the characters until he decides to get to the point. And a space opera without a clearly defined conflict is a novel thing indeed.<br /><br />And there's another of Banks' strengths: his ability to make us look at ourselves through the eyes of some very surprising others. The Culture itself is a society so advanced I have difficulty relating to most of its members. The biggest problem is that in a post-scarcity society with nearly godlike powers, what the hell is there to do? And yet, his SC agent characters always feel balanced, well-rounded and empathetic. Many of them are even likable.<br /><br />Most of the book is actually delivered from the point of view of an alien ambassador and his conversations with the rather irritable Chelgrian composer are both pointed and amusing. What's really neat is how he puts the Chelgrians in our place and shows the actions we might take on having our society interfered with by a more advanced one. Not only is this relevant in the case of potential contact with extraterrestrials in the future, but with our treatment of third world nations or simply other cultures we don't understand really well. Islam, anyone? Suddenly, terrorism doesn't seem quite so incomprehensible.<br /><br />By the way, <i>Experiencing a Signifcant Gravitas Shortfall </i>is quite possibly the best ship name ever.<br /><br /><br />]]>

        <![CDATA[Why am I terrible at blogging? I'm a perfectionist at heart. And not just any old perfectionist but a categorical perfectionist. I want to write reviews of the books I'm reading. And I've read at least six since reading <i>Federations,</i> but I haven't managed to write about any of them because I want what I write to be so much better than that one.<br /><br />You know how your parents told you "if you're going to do something, do it well"? This is probably symptomatic of taking that old adage in reverse. If you can't do it well, don't bother doing it at all.<br /><br />But blogging <i>should</i> be the opposite of that. At least for those of us who aren't doing it professionally. It's a way to get my thoughts down and record for posterity of just how bad I really am at writing.<br /><br />And with all that said, I feel better now.<br /> ]]>

Friedman</em><br /></font><br />I'd like to start by saying that I absolutely adored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756400430?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hilhom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0756400430"><em>In Conquest Born</em></a>. It was topsy and turvy and ever so twisty. It had characters who were deep and interesting and that behaved like real (albeit rather strange) people. <i>Black Sun Rising</i> didn't. That doesn't mean it didn't try hard. And I <i>wanted</i> to like it. I'm even somewhat ashamed to admit I couldn't finish it. That's not something that happens very often.<br /><br />Gerald Tarrant certainly has the potential to be an interesting character, but nothing comes of it in the first book. He's evil and we know it. And yet, he's evil for the best possible reasons. His evilness isn't pure, though his genius certainly continues throughout. The same thing happens with Damien Vryce, the priest and Ciani, the former adept. All of them are reduced to little more than their most particular obsessions throughout the book. There is certainly a reason for it in connection with the Fae on Erna, but I really and truly need more meat on my characters.<br /><br />The Fae are the other big problem with the book. In and of itself, I really like the concept. A natural force that responds to our most powerful psychic emanations and literally modifies the environment around it totally works. While the earth, tidal and solar fae are all fine, the dark fae don't fit in at all. According to the mythos in the book, the first three are neutral but the dark fae respond to our fears. The dark fae also seem to be much more pervasive than the other three types. If she'd just managed to keep the four types balanced, it really would have made the book work - at least long enough to ignore the lack of depth in the characters.<br /><br />The rakh were a different story altogether. A species whose evolution was caused by the Fae and preciptated by humanity's arrival on Erna becomes a fascinating foil. They hate us, and with excellent reason. This was one of those instances where the concept of the Fae actually works quite well. One of the other major uses of the Fae in this first book are within the Church and this is where it turns into a liability again. Using the belief of many of their believers, the Church on Erna is able to channel greater <strike>power</strike> amounts of Fae and create what are essentially holy weapons to use against the Hunter. After spending so much time in the book emphasizing that the Fae are <i>not</i> magical, she instantly relegates them to a magical purpose.<br /><br />It may be that all of this gets better as the series goes on, but I can't be bothered to expend the energy to find out. There's just nothing here to pull me in.<br /></div>]]>

I'm not normally one to pick up anthologies, but after such <a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=30214#30484">rave</a> <a href="http://io9.com/5321453/interstellar-fiction-with-a-human-perspective">reviews</a>, it's a little bit hard to argue.<br /><br />In short: I like. What really surprised me was that some of the authors
I would normally consider the strongest put some of the weakest stories
into this collection. While Anne McCaffrey's Helva story, <i>The Ship Who Returned</i> is true to the tradition of those awesome books, it does try pretty hard to tie up some of the loose ends from <i>The City Who Fought</i>. I also think she could have found a better backdrop for Helva's neurosis over Niall's death than a planet full of nuns.<br /><br />Continuing
in the tradition of neurotic heroes is Mazer Rackham who's on a light
speed round trip so that he'll still be alive to command Earth's forces
when they arrive at the Bugger worlds. Mazer has decided that he was
the victim of lucky timing and just stupid enough to ignore his orders.
For some strange reason he doesn't think those appropriate qualities in
a supreme commander. Gee, wonder why? The biggest problem is that it's
one of those single-character back-and-forth message affairs that tend
to get tiresome after a while.<br /><br />Also suffering from unexplained weakness were George R.R. Martin's <i>Warship</i> which was <i>way </i>too predictable and Robert Silverberg's <i>Symbiont</i>
which was simultaneously predictable (but in a good way) and not nearly
as exciting as it should have been. It may be worth noting that both of
those last were collaborations. <i>Life-Suspension</i> (L. E. Modesitt
Jr.) was weird and possibly pointless more than anything else. I hate a
story with an ending without resolution. I also hope that I never read
any of Harry Turtledove's "comedy" again. Maybe I'm just prejudiced
against rodent spaceship pilots, amphibians would have been much more
appropriate.<br /><br />Of course, some well-known authors are actually capable of good work (wow, that sounds snarky). Bujold's <i>Aftermaths</i>, which was included in <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/4882289/book/34343071"><i>Cordelia's Honor</i></a>
is just the right blend of sad and mildly creepy. And Kevin J. Anderson
who is normally far from one of my personal favourites put in a really
neat story called <i>Prisons</i>. That one was really more of the
perfect blend of violence, vengeance and sadness. And just in case I'm
starting to sound incredibly depressed, Alan Dean Foster's <i>Pardon Our Conquest</i> is the perfect twist of comedy.<br /><br />Any
addition to the Coyote universe by Allen Steele is always welcome.
Colonization has never been as interesting as he manages to make it
before. It's also very cute, which is occasionally difficult to manage
on an interstellar scale. One of the Canadian sci-fi authors that I
quite enjoy is James Alan Gardner, who pulls off interstellar cuteness
on a truly impressive scale.<br /><br />Where the real strength of <i>Federations</i>
lies is in the relatively unknown authors who manage to pull rabbits
out of their literary hats. John C. Wright brings new and very literal
meaning to the term "space opera" in <i>Twilight of the Gods</i>, a space-bound and STL (albeit truncated) version of Wagner's <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i>. I really, really hope he writes a series based on it. I wantssss....<br /><br /><i>Swanwatch</i>
also provides a lovely touch of the East that's both musical and
poetic, neither of which is a characteristic one would normally
associate with the black holes that are at the centre of the story. <i>Esakhara</i> by Trent Hergenrader and <i>The Culture Archivist</i> by Jeremiah Tolbert also have a major cultural and anthropological bent.<br /><br />And in the end comes the end. <i>Golubash, or Wine-Blood-War Elegy</i>
by Cathrynne Valente isn't really the best science-fiction, but it
makes for an awesome ending. It's robust and flavourful without being
overwhelming, and it brings the book to an awesome close.<br /></div>
