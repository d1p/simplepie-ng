			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most years trade deadline day never lives up to the hype. All it becomes is a busy day for trade machines and fans thinking more in terms of fantasy than reality. This year figured to be no different until the Melo trade happened. Domino effect from there and it went into overdrive nearing todays 3pm deadline. Trades were happening faster than my Tweetdeck was refreshing. All in all we ended up with what we see in the image below.<br />
<a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/crazyday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342" title="crazyday" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/crazyday.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="400" /></a>Looks crazy right. I am not going to break down each trade (there are enough sites where you can get that info). I just wanted to put this up to illustrate what a wild week it has been. For a complete list of players moved in the trades you can check nba.com&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nba.com/news/transactions/2011.trade.deadline.tracker/index.html">trade tracker</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dusting off the cobwebs on the blog to announce a pretty cool event for Toronto Raptors fans. As some of you know, I have been working with a group of fans this season (@<a href="http://twitter.com/rtzfans" target="_blank">RTZfans</a>) on a social media initiative that is aimed at creating conversation between fans of the team.</p>
<p>The goal at the start was to create a community and it grew organically. The Raptors gave RTZ (Raptors Tweet Zone) tickets to bring guests to take in the live game experience. While at the game, guests use the hashtag #rtz and fans from all over who are watching can join in the conversation. Tweets using the tag go into the raptors.com live chat on game nights and a top 20 tweets post is compiled post-game on the <a href="http://rtzfans.tumblr.com/http://">tumblr</a> giving fans a recap of the game while seeing if their tweet made it. This all became another way to recognize fans. After working with the team in making all this happen, the next logical step was to organize a night dedicated to fans who have been a part of this movement. Which brings me to RTZ Night&#8230;</p>
<p>RTZ night is more than a game. It is giving fans the chance to take in the game with people they have interacted with over the course of the season with some added bonuses that are listed below. We hope this is a success and we are able to keep bringing more events to a very rabid fanbase here in Toronto.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rtznight.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4334" title="rtznight" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rtznight.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mgd.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4315" title="mgd" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mgd.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="262" /></a> Earlier this season, Molson invited myself and a group of local Raptor bloggers to take in a game from their new MGD luxury box. What used to be 4 seats for the &#8220;Best Seats in the House&#8221; is now a full box for 12 guests with personal servers and a great selection of food and drinks. It was definitely an experience to take in a NBA game from there. The good folks at MGD have made the box available to me so I can extend this experience to readers of the blog.</p>
<p>Over the last 2 years, I have had the opportunity to meet some hardcore female fans through the blog and wanted to make this night about them. It&#8217;s rare that someone makes a promotion catered for us and this seemed like the perfect chance. So here is how it goes, I have 4 spots still available and if you are over the age of 19 and a female, you could be at the Raptors game on <strong>January 2nd vs. the Boston Celtics</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are a female Raptor fan &#8212; I want to hear from you! If you know someone who this is perfect for &#8212; pass on the info. If you don&#8217;t fit the criteria, its not all bad news. MGD has great contests to attend many sporting events, including Toronto Raptors games, so you should definitely follow them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MGDCanada" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to get in on that.</p>
<p><strong>How to be considered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MGDCanada" target="_blank">MGD</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HeelsBlogs" target="_blank">Heels on Hardwood</a> Pages a LIKE on Facebook</li>
<li>Leave a comment here about how you became a Raptors fan</li>
<li>Make sure you leave your proper e-mail so Molson and myself can contact you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You must be over the age of 19 and a female</li>
<li>You may be asked to participate in some kind of recap post game for the blog</li>
<li>All comments must be posted by Thursday Dec. 16th 2010</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Last week I ran a <a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/2010/11/raps-bobcats-tickets/" target="_blank">contest</a> on here to give away a pair of tickets to the Bobcats game. There were some amazing entries and I managed to secure tickets for the runner up as well. In return to attending the game, I asked the winner, <a href="http://twitter.com/YaRock" class="tweet-username">@YaRock</a> to write a recap of the game and his experience.<br />
</em><br />
<a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/yarock.jpg"><img src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/yarock.jpg" alt="" title="yarock" width="499" height="236" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4309" /></a></p>
<p>The game started off with the Raptors playing cool and collected ball, but DeMar DeRozan got into some quick foul trouble and was benched. DeMar earned a lot of my respect last night, you can tell how much he wants to play and he was visibly upset at getting benched, kicking at the towels and swearing. Linas Klezia had a big first quarter, getting hot for a few trips down the court and Bargnani surprised me by having a fairly decent game (23 points, 9 rebounds). I’d like to go on record and say that Reggie Evans may be, pound for pound, the worst basketball player I have ever seen. He looks huge up-close, but he lacks the interior presence that it takes to get the ball in the hoop. Jose Calderon is clearly this teams leader and is Triano’s go-to guy on the floor. I don’t think Jarret Jack sat down the entire game; even when he was on the bench he had a towel in his hand cheering the team and the fans along. Our boom sticks were deafening and I’d like to believe they were the cause of a turnover or two for the ‘Cats and contributed to Toronto’s 36 fast-break points and a few sick jams. There were some occasions where Toronto was simply caught sleeping, and the Raptors paid for it by giving up 21 points off 17 turnovers. We kept it close throughout the game, but a few late threes from Stephen Jackson, four clutch free throws by Tyrus Thomas and a boneheaded turnover by Il Mago in the last 5 seconds caused the Raptors to give this one away 101-96. Barbosa looked morose all game and you could tell that he wants to go out there and play, he was still in all the huddles and the odd time I looked over I saw him talking to P.J. Carlesimo. On an unrelated note, Jay Triano gives the most awkward ass-taps I’ve ever seen; he winds up for it like he’s Kenny Powers and then gently puts his whole palm on the backside so that it looks like more of a push than a tap.</p>
<p>The energy was unreal, the fans hung in there until the very end. The Young Guns section was crazy with most of them sporting Bosh jerseys with a duct-taped X across them. I was going to wear my Vince Carter jersey but I would’ve looked like a hipster because apparently it’s not cool to hate Vince anymore.  My favourite part of the game was at the end, when the players go to the change rooms through the tunnel. I managed to get a prime piece of real estate and got daps from all the players and coaches, including one from a very surprised Matt Carroll who seemed shocked that somebody knew who he was. I wish I got a chance to talk with Matt because I just traded for him on my 2K11 team and he’s tearing it up right now, so I’d like to know what he has to say about that.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Heels On The Hardwood for this, and I hope it’s the first of many instances.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t write about the Raptors while they were on the road but it wasn&#8217;t because I was mad. I really can&#8217;t hate on this team. Even though they returned with four losses, there were silver linings in each of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/demar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4278" title="demar" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/demar.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="140" /></a><strong>Raptors vs. Kings</strong>: Two young teams, only one with a bonafide star. The Raptors came out with a lot of energy but were not able to sustain it for a full 48 minutes. Jarrett Jack&#8217;s struggled but Calderon stepped up and reminded Raptor fans why he earned that payday a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>Silver lining</strong> &#8212; DeMar DeRozan had a breakout game and his aggressiveness was an absolute positive. 12 trips to the free throw line is just what this team needs. </p>
<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bargnani.jpg"><img src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bargnani.jpg" alt="" title="bargnani" width="150" height="140" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4283" /></a><strong>Raptors vs. Jazz</strong>: The Raptors dug themselves a hole early, for a team with not a lot of talent, this did not bode well. Jerry Sloan actually had a plan to make Reggie Evans ineffective on the glass. The Raptors managed to put together their best 3rd quarter in recent memory which got them back into the game but a few timely 3&#8242;s from the Jazz put an end to that comeback. </p>
<p><strong>Silver lining</strong> &#8212; The 3rd Quarter. Sonny Weems&#8217; career high 23pts. Bargnani grabbed a season high 9 rebounds. </p>
<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/amir.jpg"><img src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/amir.jpg" alt="" title="amir" width="150" height="140" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4288" /></a><strong>Raptors vs. Lakers</strong>: No one believed they had a shot against the reigning champs&#8230; except the 15 guys on the bench. The Raptors gave the Lakers everything they could handle but the lack of experience showed when it came to closing out the game. </p>
<p><strong>Silver lining</strong> &#8212; Heart + Hustle. The Raptors lack of talent may show on paper but they don&#8217;t hold back what they have. Amir Johnson got his groove back and DeMar held his own against Kobe. </p>
<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jack.jpg"><img src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jack.jpg" alt="" title="jack" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4291" /></a><strong>Raptors vs. Blazers</strong>: They managed just 34 points in the first half and no one was surprised. There are going to be many nights where this team can&#8217;t get the shot to go down and they need to do the little things. The Blazers let up a couple of times but never enough to give the Raptors a real chance to get back in it.</p>
<p><strong>Silver lining</strong> &#8212; The 3 point streak was in jeopardy but Jarrett Jack stepped up to keep it alive. It may be a stupid thing to hold on to but in a rough season, fans need something&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are like me, you are trying to watch as many games as possible but still feel a step slow on that TV remote. It&#8217;s almost overwhelming, but in a good way. Unlike the NFL, where parity reigns, it took almost 2 weeks for every team in the NBA to register atleast one win. Just two teams remain undefeated, one of them expected the other not so much. There have been some early surprises in terms of performance, but can you argue that this is shaping up to be the year of the point guards?</p>

<p><strong>The Night in Numbers</strong><br />
<em>Every night, I scour the box scores and pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the final scores.</em></p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia 76&#8242;ers 106 &#8211; New York Knicks 96</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">20</span></strong> Points on just 11 shots for Brand as he is starting to show signs of his old self.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">15%</span></strong> from 3pt land for the Knicks with Gallinari making 2 of the 3 they made as a team.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">26-15</span></strong> the Sixers won the 4th quarter, playing without Igoudala. 5 guys stepped up and scored in double digits. </p>
<p><strong>Phoenix Suns 118 – Atlanta Hawks 114</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">10</span></strong> Suns players saw the floor and all of them managed to score en route to handing ATL their first loss.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">2</span></strong> double dbl&#8217;s in this game. One for each team as Nash and Horford put up big numbers.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">27</span></strong> shots for Joe Johnson who scored 34 points. struggling early in the season, I guess he will try to shoot himself out of the slump.</p>
<p><strong>Golden State Warriors 97 – Detroit Pistons 102</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">15</span></strong> lead changes in this one but the Pistons found that last bit of something to close it out.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">48</span></strong> points from the back court of Hamilton and Stuckey. That kinda production will win you a few<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">26%</span></strong> from 3 were the Warriors. Curry struggled with his shot going just 3-12 from the field.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota Timberwolves 94 – Houston Rockets 120</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">24</span></strong> Points for Louis Scola as he led the Rockets to their first win of the season.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> Rebounds and 16 points for Kevin Love. Finally getting minutes, and making his coach look silly.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1st</span></strong> Career start for rookie Ish Smith as he stepped in for an injured Aaron Brooks (out 4-6 weeks).</p>
<p><strong>Boston Celtics 92 – Oklahoma City Thunder 83</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">21</span></strong> point half time lead for the Celtics. They executed perfectly on offense scoring 58pts in that time.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">10</span></strong> assists for Rondo feels little then you see the OKC stat, 17 assists as a team.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">2</span></strong> OKC players accounted for the teams total offensive output in the 3rd quarter &#8212; Durant &#038; Westbrook</p>
<p><strong><strong>Portland Trail Blazers</strong> 96 – Los Angeles Lakers 121</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">53</span></strong> minutes was all it took for Pau Gasol to record his 4th career triple double. (20pts, 14rbs, 10ast)<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">29</span></strong> Points was the largest lead for the Laker who remain one of only two unbeaten teams in the NBA.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">4</span></strong> Blazers scored in double figures &#8212; Brandon Roy was not one of them (8pts). On the other side 7 Lakers put up 10+ points.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After last weeks TNT games, all I was hoping for was 1 good one tonight. The Knicks had a ton of time off due to the whole asbestos thing and pounced on the Bulls early. Things were not looking too good until Derrick Rose exploded for a massive 2 handed slam. The dunk is already an early candidate for dunk of the year (video below) and everything that followed was gravy. The 2nd game on the schedule was a Western Conference duel and those rarely disappoint. The Thunder got in late to Portland but they had the extra pep in their step to play the extra frame. Back n forth to the end, games like this one remind me why this is the best league in the world.</p>

<p><strong>The Night in Numbers</strong><br />
<em>Every night, I scour the box scores and pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the final scores.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fantasy Freaks</strong><br />
PG: <strong>Derrick Rose</strong> — 24 PTS, 1 RB, 14 AST<br />
SG: <strong>Toney Douglas</strong> — 30 PTS, 1 RB, 4 AST, 4 STL<br />
SF: <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> — 28 PTS, 11 RBS, 2 AST, 4 BLK<br />
PF: <strong>Danilo Gallinari</strong> — 24 PTS, 6 RBS, 1 AST, 1 BLK, 2 STL<br />
C: <strong>Joakim Noah</strong> — 12 PTS, 13 RBS, 3 AST, 2 BLK, 2 STL</p>
<p><strong>New York Knicks 120 – Chicago Bulls 112</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">70</span></strong> 1st half points given up by the Bulls. Isn&#8217;t Tom Thibodeau supposed to be a defensive guru?<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>30</strong></span> points, a career high for Knicks rookie Toney Douglas. Gallinari added 24 points as well.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">67%</span></strong> from behind the arc. The Knicks were better from the outside hitting just 42% from 2.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">4th</span></strong> straight game that Joakim Noah put up a double-double. Bulls starters were benched for the final 9 minutes as the bench made a game of it. </p>
<p><strong>Oaklahoma City Thunder 107 – Portland Trail Blazers 106 (OT)</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">52:28</span></strong> minutes played by Durant who got his shot back after a rough game vs. the Clippers.<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>15</strong></span> offensive rebounds for the Thunder. Westbook had 6 of them, 11rbs in all and added 28 points.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">7-31</span></strong> from deep for the 2 teams combined. OKC you expect, the Blazers &#8212; not so much.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> FG in OT for the Blazers. They scored just 6 points in the extra frame<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">8</span></strong> man rotation for Nate McMillan who is running out of bodies. The team lost rookie guard E. Williams for the season and Oberto to <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2010/11/4/1794750/fabricio-oberto-retires" target="_blank">retirement </a>today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say records are meant to be broken right? Last Friday we had Rondo and his triple double with the 24 assists. This week, John Wall started it off by becoming the first player in NBA history to have a game with 29 points, 13 assists and 9 steals. He also joined Oscar Robertson in the record books as only the 2nd rookie to have at least 70 points and 30 assists through the first 3 games of his career. Tonight Kobe, Pierce and Rondo got in on the action. Be it a league record, team record or personal one, I never get tired of witnessing what these athletes accomplish playing the most beautiful game in the world.</p>

<em>Every night, I scour the box scores and pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the final scores.</em></p>
<p><strong>Detroit Pistons 85 – Atlanta Hawks 94</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">22</span></strong> points and 11 rebounds for the man allegedly on the trading block &#8212; Josh Smith.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">17</span></strong> lead changes in this one but the Hawks turned it up hitting 8-11 to end the game.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0-5</span></strong> start for the Pistons, they look to have completely tuned out their coach.</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Bobcats 85 – New Jersey Nets 83</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">11,778</span></strong> fans showed up at the Prudential Center to kick off <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2010/11/04/60-days-30-arenas-1-prudential-center/" target="_blank">Andrew Unterberger’s</a> tour.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">26%</span></strong> from 3 for the Bobcats. The Nets were not much better shooting just 29%<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">11</span></strong> FG attempts by G Wallace to score 20 points. He added 11 rebounds to give CHA their 1st win of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota Timberwolves 86 &#8211; Orlando Magic 128</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">78</span></strong> first half points allowed by the Wolves. They managed to put up just 45.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">7</span></strong> Magic players managed to score in double figures and none cracked the 30min mark.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">30</span></strong> minutes was a season high for Kevin Love, scoring 22 points but still in the coaches doghouse.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Pacers 75 – Philadelphia 76ers 101</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">26</span></strong> point halftime lead for the 76&#8242;ers as the Pacers shot just 29% in the first 24min.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">12</span></strong> rebounds and 25 points for Elton Brand. The first signs that he can still play!<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">2nd</span></strong> half, assistant coach Michael Curry take over for Doug Collins who is still dealing with Vertigo symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Milwaukee Bucks 102 – Boston Celtics 105 (1OT)</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">15</span></strong> assists for Rondo adding to his rapidly growing total. His 82 through 5 games is a record.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">19</span></strong> turnovers for the Bucks was the killer. They held their own in pretty much every other cat.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">12</span></strong> of Paul Pierce&#8217;s 28 points came in OT as he joined the 20,000 point club. He becomes only the 3rd Celtics player to reach the mark.</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans Hornets 107 – Houston Rockets 99</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">43</span></strong> Points combined for the back court of Chris Paul and Marco Belinelli.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> FT for the Rockets in the final frame. They jump shot themselves out of this one.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">4</span></strong> games in a row, the Rockets have led at the half and failed to win. This has gotta be a record right?</p>
<p><strong>Dallas Mavericks 102 – Denver Nuggets 101</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">46.7%</span></strong> from deep. Terry went 4-6 in the 3rd and Butler hit one late that gave the Mavs the lead for good.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">22</span></strong> Foot Buzzer beater missed by Carmelo Anthony that would have won the game for the Nuggets.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">12</span></strong> points for rookie Gary Forbes who was in the starting five for an inured Nene.</p>
<p><strong>Toronto Raptors 108 – Utah Jazz 125</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">27</span></strong> points for Al Jefferson (season high). Slowly finding his comfort zone, now just needs to stay healthy.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">30-16</span></strong> in the assist category, the Jazz shared the ball and had 6 players score in double digits.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">5</span></strong> shots from behind the arc for C.J Miles. His shot to end the 3rd completely deflated the Raptors.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">9</span></strong> rebounds for Bargnani was a season high. He added 26 points by scoring in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><strong>San Antonio Spurs 112 – Phoenix Suns 110</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">23</span></strong> turnovers for the Spurs did not hurt thanks to Tim Duncan&#8217;s monster night of 25pts and 17rbs.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> minutes and just 6 points for Hedo Turkoglu as he struggles to fit in with a new team. De Ja Vu?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> game winning 3 for Richard Jefferson. He was 4-5 on the night and put up 28 points.</p>
<p><strong>Memphis Grizzlies 109 &#8211; Golden State Warriors 115</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> rebound and 2 assists shy of a triple double. Monta Ellis continues to ball as he added 39 points.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">7-13</span></strong> three pointers made by the Warriors Dorell Wright to tally 25 points on the night.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">13</span></strong> assists to go with 18 points for newly PAID guard Mike Conley in 44 minutes of action.</p>
<p><strong>Oaklahoma City Thunder 92 &#8211; Los Angeles Clippers 107</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">2</span></strong> Eric&#8217;s in the Clippers starting backcourt. They combined for 44 points and 12 assists.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0-10</span></strong> from 3 point land for Durant. He jacked up 24 shots and only made 6 for 16 points.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">30th</span></strong> in the league in 3-point percentage, the Thunder went for 15% behind the arc&#8230; the Clippers hit 50%</p>
<p><strong>Los Angeles Lakers 112 – Sacramento Kings 100</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">17</span></strong> career triple doubles for Kobe. 20 points in the 1st half for the second straight game&#8230; what knee issues?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">20-8</span></strong> run late in the 2nd quarter put the Lakers on top and they never looked back.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">4</span></strong> fouls on Tyreke Evans in a span of 10 minutes. Each of them were drawn on Kobe.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">37</span></strong> minutes for Kobe Bryant to give him 37,528 in his regular-season career and pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#8217;s franchise record.</p>

<p><strong>The Night in Numbers</strong><br />

<p><strong>Portland Trail Blazers 98 – Chicago Bulls 110</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">40</span></strong> Point explosion from Luol Deng. He scored his career high in a variety of ways and did it efficiently (14-19)<br />

<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0-14</span></strong> from 3 for Portland. RudY Fernandez jacked up 6 of them. Rare from a team ranked high in made 3&#8242;s.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">60%</span></strong> the Blazers allowed the Bulls to shoot from the field. You can&#8217;t win giving up those kinda numbers&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Toronto Raptors 108 &#8211; Sacramento Kings 111</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">23</span></strong> Points for Tyreke Evans after he started out slow. He added 7rbs and 5 ast.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two games on the schedule and both were duds. The Wizards looked horrible and got doubled up in almost every major category by the Magic. In the late game, the Jazz looked to be a step slow for the 2nd game in a row. They even managed to make the Suns, who have issues of their own, look good. Basically, the best part of the night was the Inside the NBA crew on TNT.</p>
<p>Before getting to the numbers, I have something to rant about. Brian Windhorst of the Heat Index tweeted that Miami still has hundreds of tickets available for their home opener vs. the Magic on Friday Night. Where are all the Miami bandwagon fans?!? You have Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on your team and can&#8217;t sell out the arena? It is not just any game either &#8212; Its the home opener against one of the best teams in the East that happens to be in the same division. The Heat fired their sales team after landing the marquee free agents. Doesn&#8217;t look like a wise move right about now. It blows my mind that people talk of moving teams like Toronto. They are pegged to be a bottom dweller, yet the Raptors brought in 18,000+ through the gates for their first game. Something is seriously wrong with this picture.</p>

<strong>The Night in Numbers</strong><br />
<em>Every night, I scour the box scores and pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the final scores.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fantasy Freaks</strong><br />
PG: <strong>John Wall</strong> — 14 PTS (6-19), 2-3 (FT), 1 RBS, 9 AST, 3 STL, 3 TO<br />
SG: <strong>Vince Carter</strong> — 18 PTS (8-12), 2-5 (3PT), 0-1 (FT), 5 RBS, 2 AST<br />
SF: <strong>Hakim Warrick</strong> — 18 PTS (6-11), 6-7 (FT), 11 RBS, 1 AST, 1 ST<br />
PF: <strong>Paul Millsap</strong> — 19 PTS (9-13), 1-3 (FT), 13 RBS, 1 STL, 2 BLK, 1 TO<br />
C: <strong>Dwight Howard</strong> — 23 PTS (7-9), 9-19 (FT), 10 RBS, 1 AST, 1 STL, 3 BLK, 3 TO</p>
<p><strong>Orlando Magic 112 &#8211; Washington Wizards 83</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 1st</span></strong> two points of John Wall&#8217;s NBA career were scored on a goaltend by Dwight.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">56 </span></strong> Points in the paint for the Magic to the Wizards 28.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">-120 </span></strong> combined +/- for the Wizards starters. Blatche had just 6 points and needs to step up!<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 69%</span></strong> from the field for the Orlando starters. Dwight Howard had 23 points and Carter added in 18.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix Suns 110 &#8211; Utah Jazz 94</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 18</span></strong> Points for Hakim Warrick as he singlehandedly outscored the jazz bench.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">12 </span></strong>Rebounds for Grant Hill on a night when his shot was not falling. Suns still lost the battle on the glass.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 1</span></strong> monsterous dunk from Deron Williams but it wasn&#8217;t enough to spark the Jazz who that trailed all game long.</p>
<p>I suggest you forget these two games happened and just watch this video on loop!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sorry this recap is a little late but I had to catch up on 12 other games in the league before rehashing this one.</em></p>
<p>There was a different vibe going as I walked through Union Station yesterday. Marketing wise, the Raptors are doing everything to move on from Chris Bosh while convincing fans this is still a product they should spend their money on. I would be lying if I said it didn&#8217;t feel strange. I have attended the past 10 home openers and for the 1st time, I have absolutely no read on the team.</p>
<p><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/header-bostor.jpg"></a><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/raptorsknicks1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4103" title="raptorsknicks1" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/raptorsknicks1.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>The organization went with a go big or go home approach for the intro. Lights, drama and a soundtrack that was fitting. You even got to hear the words &#8220;From Georgia Tech&#8230;&#8221; as Jarrett Jack was the final player introduced. I&#8217;m sure that was a jolt for some people as that was the reserved for Bosh the past 7 years. The in arena atmosphere was better than I was expecting. They didn&#8217;t manage to sell out the game, but 18,000+ is not too shabby. Fans were given T-Shirts that said Red+Black Attack and even the <em>suits</em> at the ACC got in on the fun.</p>
<p>Getting to the game itself, the main story of the night was Amare&#8217;s regular season debut as a Knick. There was a lot of trash talk between him and Reggie Evans leading up to the game but in the end, Stoudemire got what he came in for. The Raptors started with good energy but soon found themselves down 16. Neither of the PG&#8217;s were able to get it going until Jack came in late in the 2nd quarter. The Raptors managed to cut into the Knicks lead by halftime led by Andrea Bargnani on offense. The teams went back n forth in the 2nd half until Wilson Chandler proved to be too much for the young Raptors wings. He had a team high 22 points and added 8 rebounds. While Amare was held in check for the most part, he did manage to impose his will when he was needed most. It came down to the Raptors needing a 3 and Barbosa threw up an airball. Game. Set. Match.</p>
<p><strong>Final Score: NYK 98 &#8211; TOR 93</strong></p>
<p>My sister <a href="http://twitter.com/nidserz">@nidserz</a> and her awesome camera were at the game today. A budding photographer, she managed to get some amazing action shots. Check out the complete set on<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raptors77/sets/72157625258105526/detail/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. You can also see a set of images there from the Sixers pre-season game. (If you use any images please credit this blog.</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I honestly could write a 1000 words on just Reggie Evans alone. He backed up the trash talk by getting under Amare&#8217;s skin all game long. There was even a point in the game when he was fronting Stoudemire but still had that mouth running. His gritty style of basketball is just what this team has been missing since the Oakley days. 0 points and 16 rebounds in 33 minutes! I will take that every night of the week from him.</li>
<li>Andrea Bargnani fans let out a sigh of relief as the big man was active on both ends of the floor. I think he could have gotten 10 rebounds if Reggie didn&#8217;t grab them away from him. Andrea had the task of speaking to the fans pre-game and held his own. No one expects this guy to be a leader but 20-10 each night would sure be nice.</li>
<li>The Raptors are not going to win too many games when they shoot as poorly as they did in this game. The 3 point streak stayed alive, just barely. Free throw shooting was a strength of this team last season but now it looks like they may sit at the bottom of the pack. I say lock these guys in a gym and make em hit 20 straight before they are allowed to leave each day.</li>
<li>Jay Triano is working with minimal talent and his coaching needs to help maximize their output. Not on this night. His playbook seems to be thinner than that of beloved sam Mitchell and it seemed he was overwhelmed when it came to making substitutions on the fly. I am sure with time the rotations will get better but this was not a good start.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Young Onez&#8221; had a rough night at the office. Amir Johnson pretty much breathes and he picks up a foul. DeMar was hesitating to do the one thing he is good at &#8212; slash to the hoop and Sonny Weems was forcing things all night. The three have so much energy they need to make sure they direct it in the right places. Wilson Chandler was the guy who got the best of them on this night. He pretty much got whatever he wanted.</li>
<li>Speaking of defense, the Raptors had impressed me with all the talking they did on the floor during pre-season. To my disappointment, they went on mute against the Knicks. Usual suspects Jack and Evans were even quiet. They need to make sure they stay talking because they gotta play this as a team to give themselves a chance each night.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 2 of the NBA season and we are treated to 13 games. Thanks commissioner Stern. I was in attendance for the Raptors/Knicks but all I could think of was getting home to catch up on the other 12 games. There were rookies in action, rebounding machines at work and dunks that got me out of seat. Yep, just another night for the best basketball league in the world. </p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Night in Numbers</span></strong><br />
<em>Quick refresher how this goes. Basically, I scour the box scores and pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games each night. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the outcome of the game.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fantasy Freaks</strong><br />
PG: <strong>Chris Paul</strong> &#8212; 17 PTS (6-11), 1-2 (3PT), 4-6 (FT), 4 RBS, 16 AST, 1 TO<br />
SG: <strong>Monta Ellis</strong> &#8212; 46 PTS (18-24), 1-2 (3PT), 9-12 (FT), 3 RBS, 2 AST, 2 STL, 1 TO<br />
SF: <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> &#8212; 30 PTS (9-24), 1-5 (3PT), 11-13 (FT), 7 RBS, 3 AST, 3 ST, 6 TO<br />
PF: <strong>Louis Scola</strong> &#8212; 36 PTS (14-24), 8-12 (FT) 16 RBS, 1 STL, 1 BLK<br />
C: <strong>Joakim Noah</strong> &#8212; 18 PTS (7-13), 4-6 (FT), 19 RBS, 2 AST, 2 STL, 2 BLK, 2 TO</p>
<p><strong>Boston Celtics 87 – Cleveland Cavaliers 95</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">20,562</span></strong> in attendance to kick of the Post-Lebron era in Cleveland<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">6</span></strong> Cavaliers players in double digits scoring, led by Hickson&#8217;s 21. Doubt that ever happened last season!<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0-5</span></strong> from long range for Ray Allen. Can&#8217;t remember the last time that happened either.</p>
<p><strong>Detroit Pistons 98 &#8211; New Jersey Nets 101</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">48</span></strong> Points in the paint for the Nets. Most of those thanks to Brook Lopez&#8217;s 25.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">10</span></strong> Rebounds to go along with 8 points in 20 minutes for rookie Favors. Impressive start to his career.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">11</span></strong> more wins and the Nets will surpass their total from last season. </p>
<p><strong>Miami Heat 97 &#8211; Philadelphia 76&#8242;ers 87</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">30</span></strong> Points for Wade after a bad shooting night against Boston. Jones added another 20 for the Heat<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">9</span></strong> Turnovers for Lebron James in this one. He has 17 in total through the 1st 2 games.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">30</span></strong> Minutes off the bench for rookie Evan Turner. Made the most of them with 16pts, 7rbs, 4ast<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0</span></strong> free throws taken between all 5 Philadelphia starters. WOW!</p>
<p><strong>New York Knicks 98 &#8211; Toronto Raptors 93</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">10</span></strong> Blocks for the Knicks as a team. They brought their hustle north of the border.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">7</span></strong> Knicks players scored in double digits. Led by Wilson Chandler&#8217;s 22. Rookie Fields went 3-6 from deep.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">9</span></strong> Turnovers for Amare, just avoiding the the &#8220;ugly&#8221; triple double with 19pts, 10rbs, 9TO&#8217;s<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> Rebounds for Reggie Evans. He did everything but score&#8230; just what the team needs.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">12</span></strong> ineffective minutes for Amir Johnson as he once again found himself in foul trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Miwaukee Bucks 91 &#8211; New Orleans Hornets 95</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">15</span></strong> rebounds, 15 points for Bogut as he made his return from that gruesome injury last season.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> assists to go along with 17 points for Chris Paul. He never ceases to amaze me&#8230;<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">18</span></strong> Lead changes in this one. Both teams shooting close to 43%<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">7</span></strong> new faces on the two teams combined. Belinelli and Gooden both major contributors</p>
<p><strong>Sacramento Kings 117 &#8211; Minnesota Timberwolves 116</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">2</span></strong> worst teams in the Western Conference from last season faced off.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">14</span></strong> Points for rookie DeMarcus Cousins to go along with 8rbs, 5ast. Impressive<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> Monsterous dunk in the 2nd quarter from rookie Wesley Johnson. He had 13pts and 4 rbs.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">20-2</span></strong> run by the Kings got them back in this one. They also had 47 FT attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Bulls 95 &#8211; Oklahoma City Thunder 106</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">31</span></strong> shots hoisted up by Derrick Rose to get his 28 points. EEEK<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> scary moment as Durant went down hard on an offensive foul. He did return and scored 30<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">14-2</span></strong> run by the Thunder in the 4th quarter sealed the deal.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">13</span></strong> FT&#8217;s attempted by Westbrook as he filled the stat sheet. 28pts, 10rbs, 6ast, 2stl, 1blk</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta Hawks 119 &#8211; Memphis Grizzlies 104</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">0</span></strong> points from 2nd year player Thabeet. Still shaking my head over that draft pick&#8230;<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">52%</span></strong> shooting from the field as a team, the Hawks also won the battle of the boards and dimes.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">50-28</span></strong> the Hawks bench outscored the Grizzlies who for the 10th year in a row lost game 1.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> shots taken by Joe Johnson and he only made 6. He ended the night with 22 points.</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Bobcats 86 &#8211; Dallas Mavericks 101</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">18</span></strong> Assists for Jason Kidd. 1 shy of the NBA record for most assists in a season opener.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">28</span></strong> Points for Dirk Nowitzki. He was the high man in the game and added 13 boards.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> unanswered points by the Mavs to start the game. They held Charlotte to 39% from the floor<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">38</span></strong> turnovers in this one. Ugly, but for the Mavs the W is what counts.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Pacers 109 &#8211; San Antonio Spurs 122</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">65</span></strong> Points for the Spurs big three combined. Duncan threw in 12 boards, Parker 9 assists.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">53%</span></strong> from the field were the Pacers but in return they allowed 122 points by the Spurs.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">32-17</span></strong> scoring edge for the Spurs bench who were led by Hill&#8217;s 16 points.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">9</span></strong> Rebounds to go with 28 points and 3 blocks for Pacers big man Roy Hibbert.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jazz 88 &#8211; Denver Nuggets 110</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">28</span></strong> Points, 7 rebounds in 36 minutes for the man of the hour, Carmelo Anthony.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">22</span></strong> Turnovers for the Jazz leading to 19 Denver points. Gotta clean that up<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> Rebounds for Sheldon Williams(!!) as he got the start at PF &#8212; thought I was seeing things.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">27</span></strong> Points was the biggest lead for the Nuggets as a happy George Karl looked on. Nice to have him back</p>
<p><strong>Houston Rockets 128 &#8211; Golden State Warriors 132</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">46</span></strong> Points for Monta Ellis, tying his career high and very efficiently too. 18-24 from the floor.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">16</span></strong> Rebounds for the 2nd night in a row for Scola. He also poured in 36 points.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">55%</span></strong> From the field, the Warriors were lights out getting 25pts from Curry and 17 from Lee.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">1</span></strong> best seat in the house for Yao Ming as he was held out on the 2nd game of a back to back.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Trail Blazers 98 &#8211; Los Angeles Clippers 88</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">38</span></strong> minutes was all it took for Blake Griffin to take the lead in the ROY race. 20pts, 14rbs, 4ast. WOW<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">15</span></strong> unanswered points for the Blazers in the 4th quarter finally put this one away.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">21</span></strong> Offensive rebounds for the Blazers, a night after they had 18 vs. the Suns.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">5</span></strong> Portland starters reached double figures in scoring. Led by Roy&#8217;s 18pts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new season is upon us and for Raptor fans it is a lot more than that. No more Chris Bosh. No defined face of the franchise. The youth movement is in full effect with growing pains to follow. This is a chance for one of these guys to step up and become the clean up hitter (blame the baseball reference on me being totally immersed in the playoffs.) Experts have the Raptors pegged at the bottom of the league. For the most part they are probably right. To counteract the win-loss expectations, the organization is trying to sell the fun aspect of the game to the fans. There is a new FANATICS section at home games, there is the <a href="http://www.youngonez.com" target="_blank">Young Onez </a>movement and even a Dynamic price on tickets (based on demand on a game per game basis). They stepped up their social media game and have the players reaching out in a variety of ways to get people hyped for the season.</p>

<p>The most anticipated NBA season in recent memory kicked off tonight and did not disappoint (Unless you are one of those bandwagon Heat fans).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Night in Numbers</span></strong><br />
<em>Quick refresher how this goes. Basically, I pick out some of the most telling numbers from the games each night. These numbers directly or indirectly have an impact on the outcome.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miami Heat 80 &#8211; Boston Celtics 88</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 500</span></strong> Credentialed media in attendance&#8230; are you kidding me?!?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 9</span></strong> Points is all the Heat managed to put up in the first quarter<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 14</span></strong> Turnovers between Lebron and Wade combined.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 4</span></strong> Celtics players scored in double digits to Miami&#8217;s 2.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 17</span></strong> Assists for Rondo, even though he was shooting blanks all night.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 18,624</span></strong> Gasps as Pierce left the floor with back spasms. He did return in typical Paul Pierce fashion though.</p>
<p><strong>Houston Rockets 110 &#8211; Los Angeles Lakers 112</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 60</span></strong> Championship rings given out. <a href="http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/nba/photogallery/bieber2.jpg" target="_blank">Biebster</a> got to rock Phil Jackson&#8217;s bling! (photo credit <a href="http://twitter.com/HPBasketball" class="tweet-username">@HPBasketball</a>)<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 11</span></strong> Point halftime deficit erased, largely thanks to the Laker bench.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 5</span></strong> Lakers scored in double digits. Let by Gasol with 29, Kobe had 27.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 24</span></strong> Minutes for Yao. That was the limit the Rockets had put&#8230; fitting he fouled out in his 24th<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 16</span></strong> Rebounds to go along with 18 points for Scola. He is balling since the World Championships.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 21</span></strong> Turnovers for the Rockets. They did win the battle of the boards and dimes.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix Suns 92 &#8211; Portland Trail Blazers 106</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 18</span></strong> Rebound differential as the Blazers dominated the glass. Get used to it Suns fans.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 27</span></strong> Minutes and just 6 points for Hedo Turkoglu. Raptors fans rejoice!<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 9</span></strong> Turnovers by Nash. He is going to have a lot more of those with this team.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 16-1</span></strong> run for the Blazers to end the game.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> 11</span></strong> Points of the final 18 were scored by Batum. Fanasty owners better run to the waiver wire!<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> +22</span></strong> For Wesley Matthews &#8212; already making good on that major pay raise.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man did it feel good to be back at the ACC. What made it even better&#8230; finally getting to watch some live basketball. Sadly, not too many others shared the sentiment. The Air Canada Center was empty. There were summer league games in Vegas that had more people than the Raptors game tonight. This is a young team that needs the fans to get behind them. I am hoping tonight was not an indication of how the city and its fans plans to treat them this season. Rain outside, sparse crowd inside &#8212; There was a basketball game to be played.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Banner-raps76ers.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4026 aligncenter" title="Banner-raps76ers" src="http://heelsonhardwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Banner-raps76ers.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Jay Triano shuffled the starting lineup for the 4th time in as many games but this one seemed more probable than the one in Chicago. With both teams playing the back end of a back to back, a sluggish start was expected. The Raptors came out with some energy but started to fall behind 15 minutes into the game. The Sixers went into the locker room with a 50-48 lead. It wasn&#8217;t much but there were times it felt like the Raptors were setting up for a repeat of the night before &#8212; a embarrassing loss to the Bulls. The 2nd half was more of the same, back n forth where neither team seemed to be able to find that next gear to put it away. After what felt like the longest game ever, the Raptors held on to get the win in double overtime. Final score: 119-116</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The team was actually talking on defense. Andrea calling screens, Jack directing from the sidelines and Barbosa spreading the love. From my vantage point, last season the Raptors were probably the quietest team in the league. The more they talk the better the help defense gets&#8230; and boy do they need to get better. This was probably the best thing I saw all game.</li>
<li>Andrea Bargnani has the fans worried. Rightfully so. Even though these games don&#8217;t matter, fans want to see if he can be the man to lead this team. Realistically, it is going to take a while for him to get used to the double teams and even then, his rebounding woes and lack of alertness away from the ball will hinder him. There were flashes today where I can see him take it to the next level but they were playing a smaller team and his height was a clear advantage. I am still not buying into this but seems he has the golden ticket on the team so we shall sit through 82 games for him to figure it all out.</li>
<li>Rebounding has always been the achilles heel of this team. Losing Chris Bosh just made it worse. Amir can rebound but can&#8217;t stay on the floor due to foul trouble. Reggie can rebound but is a liability on offense. Andrea&#8230; well, he&#8217;s Andrea. It is going to be the guards that will have to pick up the slack on the boards. This team wants to run so they need to rebound by committee and leak out. Barbosa, Jack and DeRozan did well in the area tonight and will need to continue that if the team wants to give themselves a chance each night.</li>
<li>Another year, another question mark about who is the #1 PG on this team. Jose and Jarrett are actually a good tandem but I am still not a fan of them on the floor together. Adding Barbosa in the mix has helped. He plays well alongside both of them. He is ready to hit the jumper when Jack is driving and has the ability to penetrate and kick out when Jose is spotted up. Seeing them play today, I definitely think we are going to see a lot of small ball. DeMar at the 3 spot and hopefully the quickness of these guys can make up for the lack of height.</li>
<li>Finally, this team looked like they were having fun out there tonight. They may not win too many games but it won&#8217;t be for the lack of trying. I want to go on record and say they have the ability to be a 32 win team. Anything less would be disappointing, anything more is just gravy.</li>
</ul>
<p>My sister (<a href="http://twitter.com/nidserz" class="tweet-username">@nidserz</a>) and her awesome camera were at the game today. A budding photographer, she managed to get some amazing action shots. I took some shots as well so check the Flickr album and if you plan to use the photos please credit her and/or this blog. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raptors77/sets/72157625036137225/" target="_blank">Flickr Album</a> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just over a month away from NBA season &#8212; It&#8217;s time to get geared up. My Raptors schedule wallpapers last season were downloaded 3000+ times (thank you) and will be making a return this year. This season I decided to geek out and create a few phone backgrounds as well. With cellphones being a staple accessory these days, I figured what better way to show off your support for the team. The 3 backgrounds below are set to 480&#215;320 and will work best with the Blackberry Bold, Curve and Tour. I got iPhone users covered as well, those backgrounds will be up tomorrow. If you like these, become a fan of my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Heelsblogs" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> for more backgrounds during the season. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em><strong>Coaches who can outline plays on a black board are a dime a dozen. The coaches who win are the ones who can motivate their players &#8212; Vince Lombardi</strong></em></p>
<p>We may be a month away from NBA action but basketball fans are getting a bonus this year. Across the pond, the FIBA World Championships are underway in Turkey bringing together basketball talent from around the globe. While teams like USA have left some of their star power at home, most participating countries have come fully loaded.</p>
<p>The Canadian team with a fresh new sponsorship deal thanks to Bell Canada made their first appearance in 8 years under coach Leo Rautins. They played well leading up to the tournament and went in with hopes to at the least get through the preliminary round. Those hopes were squashed in a hurry as the team blew leads in the first 3 games and then completely deflated to end 0-5. They could have easily won the first 3, they should have. Instead, they are packing their bags and heading home.</p>
<p>What went wrong though? Who is to blame for this embarrassment?</p>
<p>The first mistake was when Basketball Canada severed ties with former coach Jay Triano and brought on ex-player Leo Rautins to try his hand at coaching. While Leo may have been a good player in his time, he has never coached at any level. There is more to coaching than knowing the game. A coach needs to be able to motivate his players, connect with them and have a plan. Rautins didn&#8217;t display any of these attributes in the 5 games I watched, and even though he was working with marginal talents, it seems they were playing on their own. The substitutions were horrible, play calling that resembled that of a high school team and no sign of coach in the final minutes of the game when the team really needed him the most.</p>
<p>Michael Grange of the National Post doesn&#8217;t think all the blame should go on the inexperienced coach (<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/is-it-all-his-fault/article1693280/" target="_blank">link</a>). I agree with some of his arguments but the guys in red and while played their hearts out without having a real coach to steer them in a winning direction. Its a shame that while Leo was strutting the sidelines for Canada the best Canadian coach, Jay Triano, is calling plays for basketball superpower Team USA &#8212; blame it on the politics.</p>
<p>Coach Rautins began this coaching stint a couple of years back and very quickly lost one of Canada&#8217;s better players, Samuel Dalambert. The two butted heads which led to Dalambert leaving the National team with no intent to return if Leo was on the sidelines. Coach also tried to woo Steve Nash to play for the National team but his allegiance lies with Jay Triano and Nash was not too happy when Basketball Canada made the coaching change. Before the tournament, Matt Bonner had applied for expedited Canadian status but was rejected. All that left Leo with Joel Anthony as his best NBA player along with his son Andy who got injured and was unable to contribute.</p>
<p>All is not lost though, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel &#8212; call it, THE FUTURE. With names like Myck Kabongo, Cory Joseph, Tristan Thompson coming up, there is hope again that the next crop will take Canada Basketball to the next level&#8230; hopefully under a new coach!</p>
