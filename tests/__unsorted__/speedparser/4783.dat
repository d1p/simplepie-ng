			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10405" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="23804-TV and Satellite Dish" src="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/23804-TV-and-Satellite-Dish.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="221" /></p>
<p>As culture becomes increasingly digitized— from downloading and streaming videos and music to digital film production and cloud computing— arguments for the “dematerialization” of media are becoming commonplace. However, media have always been, and remain, embedded in and structured by material objects, networks, and practices that delimit their uses and meanings. Any cultural artifact bears traces and consequences of the material conditions of its production, distribution, and reception, whether the size and weight of the camera that shot a film’s images, the geography of the shipping or cable network through which a program was transported or transmitted, or the spaces occupied by physical record or DVD collections. Even ostensibly “dematerialized” digital media find material existence in hard disks, server farms, and wires— as well as in the proliferation of new media devices, from smart phones to iPads.</p>
<p>We should take this perception of the diminished materiality of media as an opportunity to reconsider and reaffirm the material dimensions of media, both in terms of the present moment and from an historical perspective. Considering the materiality of media means paying attention to the mutual relationship between technology and culture as shaping influences on each other. Media are, after all, to paraphrase Raymond Williams, <em>both </em>technology and cultural form. Media are not, of course, reducible to their technological or material dimensions, but these remain inescapable factors in what media mean in all manner of contexts. Scholars like Vicki Mayer, Lisa Parks, and Barbara Klinger have led the way in approaches to the production, distribution, and reception of media as inextricably material. In emerging concerns with media infrastructures and cultural geography, growing interest in the nine lives of VHS and cassette tapes, and calls like Max Dawson’s to “put the TV back in television studies,” we can see materiality coming into play in media studies more and more.</p>
<div>
<p>Engaging with media as material objects, processes, and experiences opens up a wide variety of topics for exploration. Not only are the physical formats of media important for how they shape the content they hold, but media commodities are themselves aesthetic objects that deserve study. Technological and other material factors have effects on textual production, craft practices, and style. Changing screen technologies and interfaces on exhibition devices old and new change the way we see media. Understanding the logics and operations of physical networks of media distribution and transmission is important to understanding the circulation of media texts. From labor conditions to e-waste, the manufacture and disposal of media objects and devices brings up many important political economic issues. The materiality of media objects, collections, and archives is central to historiography, fandom, memory, nostalgia, cultural capital, and taste.</p>
<p>These are the issues the editors of <em>The Velvet Light Trap</em> are interested in exploring in its latest issue. If you are also interested in the materiality of media, from film stock to network servers to TV screensand everywhere in between, we encourage you to submit a paper. We are accepting anonymous electronic submissions between 6,000 and 7,500 words in MLA style until October 15, 2011.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-7051" href="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2010/10/27/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-net-neutrality/lentz2/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7051" title="lentz2" src="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lentz2-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>It’s been one year now since the FCC opened up the official policymaking process for net neutrality regulations on internet access.  A lot has changed with the issue since then, but perhaps the biggest is what &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; actually means to many of those who talk about it.  Despite its reputation as a wonky and bewildering issue, net neutrality actually boils down to a pretty simple principle with wide support: the internet should remain open, allowing universal and equal access to whatever on the network users want.  It’s important to point out, then, that a lot of those who are talking about “net neutrality” these days aren’t actually talking about this.</p>
<p>A few major events have dominated the net neutrality front in the last several months.  The FCC&#8217;s policy proposal process was interrupted in April when the <em><a href="http://bit.ly/dli8zW" target="_blank">Comcast v. FCC</a> </em>case put the commission’s legal authority to regulate internet access at all highly in doubt (the legacy of Bush-era reregulation).  Over the summer, then, the FCC held meetings to negotiate a compromise on net neutrality regulations— <a href="http://huff.to/dmeZt0" target="_blank">meetings held behind closed doors</a> with only representatives of the cable and telecom industries and internet content and service companies at the table.  Then, in August, Verizon and Google reached an agreement and announced their plan for how to enact net neutrality policy, as covered <a href="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2010/09/08/business-as-usual/" target="_blank">here</a> on Antenna by Mark Hayward and <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2010/08/25/access-evil-google-verizon-and-future-net-neutrality" target="_blank">here</a> by Jennifer Holt.</p>
<p>Net neutrality as a term, while it has been translated different ways, ultimately has been articulated to a particular principle of openness and nondiscrimination— like common carriage, the public obligations of private infrastructure owners.  The concept of net neutrality is constructed discursively: while the term has absorbed different values and interests from various stakeholders, a common sense of its meaning has coalesced and it has become relatively stable as a discursive formation.  The term started its life as a technical principle, <a href="http://timwu.org/network_neutrality.html" target="_blank">coined by Tim Wu</a> to describe the most efficient network design to encourage innovation.  It has also been taken up by internet content and service companies like Google (<a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/01/hey-fcc-keep-internet-open-and-awesome.html" target="_blank">pre-Googizon era</a>) and Skype, mostly as an economic principle describing the most fair marketplace for their content and services to compete.  Public interest organizations like <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/" target="_blank">Free Press</a> have used it to describe a civic principle of freedom of expression and democratic participation.  Despite the differing interests of these groups, they formed a sort of alliance that came together in support of a few basic tenets: infrastructure control should be kept separate from content control, so that internet access providers should not interfere with or give preferential treatment to any particular content, service, application, or device based on who owns it.</p>
<p>Now that one of its biggest “supporters” is Verizon and Google, once the loudest pro-neutrality voice, has committed itself to a very compromised position, what net neutrality actually means is changing very quickly.  This is evident especially in the recent <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/09/waxmans-net-neutrality-compromise-solution-or-last-gasp.ars" target="_blank">(eventually shelved) net neutrality bill</a> introduced into the US House by Rep. Henry Waxman and its resemblance to the Verizon/Google vision of net neutrality.  Judging from this, “net neutrality” means something very different now.  First, openness rules apply to the “public internet,” but there are no such requirements on “differentiated services,” which means that this “private internet” would become a de facto fast lane for only the content and services owned by cable and telecom companies (hello Comcast-NBCU) or those who can afford to cut deals with them (goodbye Antenna).   Further, there are no nondiscrimination rules at all for wireless internet access, which is especially troubling since it&#8217;s easy to see that mobile devices will very soon be the dominant way to access the internet.  Finally, the FCC is left to investigate bad actors only on a case-by-case basis and has no rulemaking authority over internet access, which is clearly an indication of how corporations like Verizon and Google can cut regulators out of the policymaking process altogether and just do it themselves.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, there is a difference between the principles behind net neutrality and the way it is now talked about&#8211; especially in the policy sphere where discourse has the power to shape the technical structures in question.  One undeniable reason for the progress that had been made toward enforceable net neutrality was the support of big internet corporations&#8211; especially Google.  However, the alliance that came together around the issue is beginning to splinter, as shown by Google moving away from the overlapping interests that once brought this alliance together and toward new interests, especially their relationship with Verizon in the mobile device market.  The compromise reached between “both sides,” then, is between two competing sets of corporate interests and the definition of the net neutrality situation is left up to those with the biggest profits to gain.  Like Bill Kirkpatrick detailed <a href="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2010/10/21/the-acta-retreat-their-ignorance-and-ours/" target="_blank">here</a> on Antenna recently in regard to ACTA, this is yet another way of confusing the powers at play in making policy: when the party at the negotiating table in these policymaking issues that comes the closest to representing the public interest is just another big corporation and the public interest and the corporate interest inevitably split, then we’re all left out of the process.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Some good news came from the battlefield that is media and technology policy recently: some important fair use rulings that help to hold off the ever expanding clutches of copyright.  ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.dom4j.org/photos/dmca.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="230" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some good news came from the battlefield that is media and technology policy recently: some important fair use rulings that help to hold off the ever expanding clutches of copyright.  Through a nice (if small) corrective built into the generally heinous <a href="http://bit.ly/cvr6a9" target="_blank">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>, every three years the <a href="http://bit.ly/clKoHE">Library of Congress rules</a> on exemptions to the anti-circumvention clause that makes it illegal to break technological protections on copyrighted material.  Here are the <a href="http://bit.ly/anze01" target="_blank">new exemptions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ripping clips of DVDs for educational purposes and use in documentary and noncommercial works is now allowed under the law.  This extends the previous exemption enjoyed only by lucky film and media studies instructors and their classroom uses to recognize more instructors, non-classroom uses, and students.  Make sure to check out Jason Mittell’s posts <a href="http://bit.ly/9hb8ds" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/bt6iGh" target="_blank">here</a> for details and what this means for academics.  Beyond that, this ruling is also a big victory for those documentary filmmakers and remix video artists who have to crack encryptions on the existing material they transform for criticism and commentary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s also now legal to jailbreak your phone, opening up its operating system for other mobile networks and applications.  This ruling is most specifically about unlocking the iPhone for use with carriers other than AT&amp;T and to run apps other than those available on Apple’s tightly controlled iTunes App Store, which is an important limitation on the power that device producers like Apple can have over users.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Users also now have the right to crack digital rights management in order to run screen-readers on ebooks.  Many publishers technologically restrict the use of text-to-speech functions on computers and devices like the Kindle, so allowing for getting around this is especially key for promoting accessibility for people with print and visual disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ruling also allows for academic security research on video game DRM, in response to concerns over some specific security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legal recognition of these fair uses is a very encouraging development— the result of a lot of great work by organizations like the <a href="http://bit.ly/9bPwLa" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, American University’s <a href="http://bit.ly/cfXCLB" target="_blank">Center for Social Media</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/cMb3qz" target="_blank">Organization for Transformative Works</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/aPdNPG" target="_blank">Society for Cinema &amp; Media Studies</a>, and others.  As Jonathan Zittrain and others point out, though, there are still a number of <a href="http://bit.ly/9fKYuQ" target="_blank">technological and legal hurdles</a> that remain in the way of these uses— not least, of course, are the technical skills necessary to pick the locks in the first place.  And this is all only good for another two years, when these exemptions will have to be defended at the next review.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress’s ruling is even more encouraging, though, when taken along with two other recent court decisions on copyright.  The first case made some headlines: in June, a federal court <a href="http://nyti.ms/aDwX7K">threw out</a> Viacom’s $1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit against YouTube.  The summary judgment ruling took a good strong reading of the “safe harbor” provision of the DMCA, finding that Google only hosts others’ content on YouTube and therefore can’t be held liable for the actions of its users.  The second case went relatively unnoticed: the day after the LOC announced its exemptions, a federal appeals court <a href="http://bit.ly/bqyips" target="_blank">ruled</a> that breaking DRM just to access a piece of software isn’t illegal under the DMCA’s anti-circumvention rules.  While a rather abstruse case involving medical system software and dongles (yes, dongles), the decision sets a pretty clear and substantial <a href="http://bit.ly/9Fdsz8" target="_blank">fair use precedent</a>: breaking technological protections on a work is legal as long as the use you make of it is legal.  These cases, though, are likely far from over— expect to see appeals to the Supreme Court in both.  Nonetheless, in the fight for a more balanced approach to copyright regulation (and especially in light of <a href="http://bit.ly/9sER2o" target="_blank">some really scary stuff on the horizon</a>), it’s nice to have some victories to celebrate.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite all the other Buzz around Google lately, its other announcement last week is the real big deal: Google's plan to build an experimental 1 Gbps, fiber-to-the-home broadband network will have a big impact on net neutrality and broadband stimulus policies.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="_mcePaste"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1865" href="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2010/02/16/what-googles-experimental-fiber-network-means-for-broadband/fiber_house/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1865 alignleft" title="fiber_house" src="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/fiber_house.gif" alt="" width="281" height="167" /></a></div>
<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/introducing-google-buzz.html">Buzz</a> about what Google&#8217;s been up to in the last week or so.  But as significant as Google&#8217;s move into social networking is, a less talked-about announcement the company made last week is the real big deal: <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/think-big-with-gig-our-experimental.html">Google&#8217;s plan</a> to build an experimental 1 Gbps, fiber-to-the-home broadband network is likely to have a big impact on Internet policy in the US, especially net neutrality and broadband stimulus.</p>
<div>The plan is to build an open-access network, with speeds about 100 times faster than those available in most areas of the US, in one city or possibly a few, likely serving between 50,000 and 500,000 homes in total. Spokespeople for the company are quick to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/02/10/google-doesnt-want-to-be-an-isp-it-wants-to-be-a-rabble-rouser/?">say</a> that this shouldn&#8217;t be seen as a full-on dive into the Internet service provision market.  Rather, the network is being billed as a test-bed to explore the capabilities that ultra-high-speed networks could afford, encouraging the development of bandwidth intensive services like streaming HD video, real-time multimedia collaboration, and lots of other stuff that we probably can&#8217;t even imagine yet.</div>
<p>Google&#8217;s plan has been interpreted a number of <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/After-Facebook-Google-Looks-to-Eat-Comcasts-Lunch-2494">different ways</a> but it seems pretty clear that this is really about more than just giving developers a nice sandbox to play in and some lucky folks freaking fast Internet access. Google is very active in the goings-on at the FCC right now, including leading the advocacy for putting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">net neutrality</a> principles into binding regulations for ISPs and pushing for open access standards and faster speeds to be part of the <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/index.html">National Broadband Plan</a>.  By building this network, then, Google wants to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/189024/">show off</a> to the FCC and ISPs just what an <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/2896">open, neutral, and really really fast </a>network looks like.  This move is consistent with the company&#8217;s propensity toward big symbolic gestures that can be influential whether or not the stated intentions actually get followed through on: its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/04/google-reveals-spectrum-auction-strategy/">bid on wireless spectrum</a> in 2007 was really a stunt to encourage open access and the <a href="http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2010/01/13/google-leaving-china/">threats to pull out of China</a> (detailed here on Antenna by Liz Ellcessor) have not yet been acted on.  This announcement alone has drummed up the kind of excitement that could work to raise the bar for the broadband deployment plan, which is especially crucial for bridging the digital divide with more than just access, but access that is open, neutral, and as fast as anyone in the world.</p>
<div>Clearly, then, Internet users have a lot to gain from what Google is pushing for here.  But Google certainly does, too: we now depend on Google for more and more of what we do in our online lives (not just Googling, but Gmailing, YouTubing, Mapping, Talking, Reading, Book Searching, Doc&#8217;ing, Calendaring, Blogging, and now Buzzing…), so faster access means more using Google services and, don&#8217;t forget, more of that contextual advertising from which it makes its revenue.  As <a href="http://www.googlizationofeverything.com/">Siva Vaidhyanathan</a> has put it, what&#8217;s good for the Internet is good for Google.  Not a bad deal for us &#8211; as long as we&#8217;re okay counting on Google to &#8220;not be evil&#8221; and take good care of all of us Internet users.  Sure, we have a dictator of our online world, but at least right now it&#8217;s a benevolent dictator.</div>
