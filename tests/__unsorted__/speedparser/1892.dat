			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year about this time, when the pride in the bleachers as pungent as the hot dogs, peanuts and cold beer, we always have a large number of orders for our <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Sports_Walking_Canes.html">baseball walking canes</a>. Perhaps it&#8217;s the nostalgia, or maybe the baseball season simply reminds people that such a walking aid exists, whatever the case may be, we always sell out of these products, especially the iconic Louisville Slugger Cane, before the World Series of Baseball completes. </p>
<p>One of our merchandisers saw a replica of one of our pieces in a specialty shop in South Florida this past weekend, and it is amazing what someone will charge for such a lower-quality product. Our Louisville Slugger Cane features a sturdy, ash wood construction as well as a stitched leather handle that is perfect for a hot summer day at the ball park. We even offer different sizes of this cane, and even a classic &#8220;smuggler&#8221; version, for if you want to sneak a stiff sip of your favorite vintage into the stands. </p>
<p>In any case, no matter if you are a Milwaukee fan, St Louis, Boston or anywhere that hosts one of our great baseball teams, everyone loves to celebrate our national pastime. We like to celebrate it with our selection of <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Sports_Walking_Canes.html">baseball walking canes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rheumatoid arthritis, along with other ailments like multiple sclerosis, often leaves the sufferer in need of a walking cane. In this short piece, we&#8217;ll cover some of the elements an RA patient should consider when choosing a walking cane.</p>
<p>No matter what you read online, though, it is absolutely imperative that you <strong>speak with your doctor</strong> before making your final decision. No information you find online, not here or anywhere else, can replace or override the advice of a trained medical professional who is familiar with your needs and condition.</p>
<p>First, when looking at a walking cane for rheumatoid arthritis, you should consider how much weight you need to support. Some</p>
<p>sources claim that a simple, straight-shafted walking cane should only be used to support one quarter (25%) of your body weight or less. We tend to agree, and you should never take chances when using a mobility aid. If you need more support than that, consider</p>
<p>using a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Quad_Canes.html">quad cane</a>, or even look into a walker or forearm crutches if they are more comfortable options for you.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 190px"><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Palm_Grip_Orhtopedic_Walking_Canes.html"><img src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/3069.jpg" alt="easy grip handle canes" width="180" height="218" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Palm-grip handles are specially made to match the contours of your palm</p></div>
<p>Second, the grip of your walking cane is imperative to your condition. As your ailment continues to change, whether it progresses or regresses, the needs of your handle and grip might change. Dont be afraid to question whether your current cane handle is the right one for</p>
<p>you, and always be prepared to try something new. We have a short <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/blog/2011/07/a-guide-to-walking-cane-handles/">guide to cane handles</a> in a previous blog post, you may want to start there to see some examples and again, ask your doctor what he/she thinks about the different styles.</p>
<p>The tip, or ferrule of a walking cane is an extremely important part of your decision. We prefer <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Walking_Cane_Tips.html">rubber cane tips</a> because of their ability to grip pavement and stay stable on turf, but you may want to look for what is best for your situation. Perhaps you would like the added stability of a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Large_Cane_Tips.html">extra large cane tip</a>, and we&#8217;ve even seen those who prefer a specialized one made with a felt tip. Felt provides less traction, so is less stable, but it is an option. Again, ask your doctor. You should also be prepared for inclimate weather. Perhaps <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Ice_Attachment.html">specialized snow gear</a> is something you should have if you live where snow and ice are an issue in the winters.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware of the height of your cane. Although it may seem tempting to stop at a thrift store and pick up an old, weathered one sitting in an umbrella stand near the door, you would be best off with a new piece that is cut to fit your height. Our site has a guide on <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/canes/Cane_Info.html#fit">sizing your walking cane</a>, but as a general rule, the top of your cane should come up to the bend in your wrist when you are standing as straight as possible and your arms are resting comfortably at your side. An improperly sized walking cane can cause you to slouch (if it is too short) or lean to one side (if your cane is too tall) and distribute your weight in an odd pattern across your knees, waist, back and shoulders. All patients of rheumatoid arthritis should understand the terrible consequences that could have on your condition.</p>
<p>Above all else, as we have reiterated again and again, you should never do anything that is contrary to the advice of your doctor, physical therapist or other medical professional. It could have severe consequences on your health, and potentially ruin any progress you and your doctors have made. In the end, the choice is up to you and your doctors.</p>
<p>Walk on!</p>
<p>Is there something else that should be added to this list? Are you, or do you know an RA patient who walks with a cane? Share it with us on our Facebook page!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The choice of cane handle is an important one for many reasons, ranging from stylistic choices to ease of grip and the level of support they provide to the user.</p>
<p>As many people begin shopping for their new cane, hiking stick or other walking aid, are unsure which of the many types of cane handles they should chose. From the classic tourist canes to the more modern ergonomically designed palm-grip handles, there is a veritable array of options to choose from. But with a little guidance, anyone shopping for a walking aid can find the perfect handle design to fit their needs. Read on to help you decide which you would like to add to your collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Tourist_Handle_Crook_Handle_Canes.html">Tourist Canes</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Tourist_Handle_Crook_Handle_Canes.html"><img class="alignleft" title="Tourist Handle Canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/90725.jpg" alt="Tourist j-handle Canes" width="180" height="218" /></a></p>
<ul>Also known as a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Tourist_Handle_Crook_Handle_Canes.html">Crook-Handle Cane</a> or a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Tourist_Handle_Crook_Handle_Canes.html">J-Handle Cane</a>, these  canes offer the classic look of a Bishop&#8217;s crook. Although other canes offer stronger support for your wrist, many people enjoy the Tourist Cane for its classic elegance and the convenience with which it hooks over the forearm or a coat hook.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Fritz_Handle_Walking_Canes.html">The Fritz Handle Cane</a><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Fritz_Handle_Walking_Canes.html"><img class="alignright" title="Fritz Arthritic Walking Cane" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/80800.jpg" alt="Fritz Handle Walking Cane" width="180" height="218" /></a></li>
<p>The Fritz-Handle Cane features an open-ended handle that is designed specifically for an easy grip. Its wide girth makes it so that even cramped fingers can easily grasp the handle and use this type of cane. The Fritz handle is a favorite among arthritic sufferers who want an elegant look.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Fashion_Adjustable_Walking_Canes.html">Offset Handle Canes</a></li>
<p>Ever since aluminum and carbon-fiber canes have<a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Fashion_Adjustable_Walking_Canes.html"><img class="alignright" title="Offset Handle Canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/10925.jpg" alt="Offset Handle Canes" width="180" height="218" /></a> become popular for their lightweight and durable construction, padded, offset handles have also become a staple in cane design. A small, gentle crook or bend in the shaft allows the soft, padded handle to sit exactly above the shaft, ensuring the even distribution of weight, while the padded foam handle offers an easy grip, which is often a must-have.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Palm_Grip_Orhtopedic_Walking_Canes.html">Palm-Grip Handle Canes</a></li>
<p>These canes are specially designed to be held in a certain way, with the palm of the hand bearing the majority of <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Palm_Grip_Orhtopedic_Walking_Canes.html"><img class="alignleft" title="Palm-Hand Grip Walking Canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/3068.jpg" alt="Arthritic Handle Walking Canes" width="180" height="218" /></a>the weight of the body. Turning the palm to fit this handle allows so that very little finger strength is needed to grasp it, which makes it perfect for arthritic customers who often suffer. Be careful, though, since the right- and left-hand models are exact opposites, they must be ordered specifically for your cane-using arm.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Derby_Deluxe_Walking_Canes.html">Classic Derby Handle Canes</a></li>
<p>The classic derby handle is perhaps one of the most popular. It is a simple design, and allows for some wrist support in the small bend, around which you can wrap your <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Derby_Deluxe_Walking_Canes.html"><img class="alignright" title="Derby Handle Walking Canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/80907.jpg" alt="Derby Handle Walking Canes" width="180" height="218" /></a>thumb. The crook on the &#8220;pinky&#8221; side allows it to be hung over an arm or on the edge of a table much like a tourist cane, but the relatively perpendicular handle offers the ease of grip much like a fritz handle. For a more elaborate spin on the derby-style handle, check out the <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Anatomically_Correct.html">ergonomic derby handles</a> offered in may of our designs.</p>
<p><strong>Always Check with Your Doctor</strong><br />
If any of these models of walking cane appeals to you, make sure to run it past your doctor, physical therapist or other medical professional before making your purchase. Most likely, they are well-versed in the styles of cane handle, and can help you make the selection that best suits your needs.</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[FashionableCanes.com offers a full line of Shillelaghs and Irish Walking Sticks]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Irish-style shillelaghs are a very popular part of our selection, probably because of their legendary status as a durable, reliable hiking stick or walking cane. To help our customers learn more about this beautiful piece of craftsmanship, we would like to lay out the qualities of a genuine shillelagh, and make sure everyone understands the differences between a piece crafted by the masters on the British Isles and those imitations which can be found anywhere, at any retailer.</p>
<h2>Why Irish Blackthorn Is So Popular</h2>
<p>The material of choice for hundreds of years at this point, it is clear that the master craftsman who practice this trade prefer blackthorn. It is in very high-demand, and not at all easy to come by in the density and quality required to craft a walking cane, which of course raises its value to the collector.  It coarse-grained, and very hard, making it a great material for walking canes. Also, it holds its dark luster very well and id naturally resistant to discoloration, warping and other kinds of wear.</p>
<h2>Often Imitated &#8211; Never Duplicated</h2>
<p>We guarantee all of our shillelaghs and Irish blackthorn walking sticks to be crafted of true, genuine Irish blackthorn. most often, when they are imitation, fake shillelaghs are made of Hawthorne, or some other related thorny bushes and trees, and finished in a dark stain to be passed off as a true shillelagh. Hawthorn is not as consistent of a wood, and not nearly as hard. It is common for hawthorne to also develop irregularities in its grain pattern as it grows, making it less likely to accept an even stain or finish, and more likely to have strong and weak spots in the material, a quality that is unacceptable for a mobility aid since it makes it prone to cracking and splitting under vertical stress (as when a user is leaning on the shaft of a cane).</p>
<h2>How to Identify a Genuine Blackthorn Irish Cane</h2>
<p>This can be tricky. First, it is not necessary that the craftsmanship or the cultivation of the plant actually occur in Ireland. There are several high-quality master craftsmen in England, mainland Europe and even in the United States (although the woods are generally imported). So in this sense, an &#8220;Irish Cane&#8221; is truly just a style being acheived, not necessarily the place of origin for the piece being sold.</p>
<p>Identifying the quality and type of wood might be nearly impossible for the untrained eye, but here are four things to look out <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Irish_Shillelagh_Blackthorn.html"><img class="alignleft" title="Irish Blackthorn Shillelagh" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/5095.jpg" alt="Irish Blackthorn Shillelagh" width="180" height="218" /></a>for when purchasing a shillelagh:</p>
<ul>
<li>There should be marks, either protrusions and lumps from when the thorns were sanded down, or dimples from when the thorns and spines were removed, which will be fairly evenly distributed around the shaft.</li>
<li>The cane, if crafted properly, should taper to a fine point, although it is often cut with a flat end to make it usable for a rubber ferrule or cane tip.</li>
<li>Blackthorn is naturally dark, and often stained to an even darker hue, but the bark, if you are able to see any, is often a reddish-brown hue.</li>
<li>The grain pattern is coarse, with thick grains that are fairly regular and consistent throughout the cane, with the exception of the frequent knots which mark where new branches or thick spines would have grown before the shaft was cut.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, these pieces are favorites for both collectors and every-day cane users for their beauty, quality and their whimsical</p>
<p>nature that has been beloved by cane users for centuries.</p>
<h2>Buyer Beware</h2>
<p>Even if you dont purchase your cane from us, please be careful where you get your shillelagh from. It is definitely a tough</p>
<p>market, and there are several retailers who would not hesitate to charge full price for an imitation. No matter what you purchase, though, we wish you the best with your new shillelagh!</p>

<p>We have a few patriotic pieces, and this time of year, they always sell out. For instance, look into our line of <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/walking-canes/?query=patriotic">patriotic canes</a> for a few examples.</p>
<p>By far the most popular is our <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/80612.html">Eagle-Head Red White and Blue Cane</a>, which, as you can see in this image, is an amazing piece of hand-carved, woodwork. The beautiful, vibrant red, white and blue colors are set into a classic, rich ovangkol wood shaft, with a stunning eagle-head handle.

<p>For most people, summer is the time when we make plans to go visit family, friends, or just take a trip out to rest, relax, and enjoy what our world has to offer.</p>
<p>Whether you would like to visit warmer climes, see a natural wonder or simply enjoy some time out away from it all, needing a mobility aid can sometimes get in the way. Under no circumstances does this need to put a damper on your travel plans. Below we&#8217;ve listed just a few examples of situations where a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Folding_Adjustable.html">travel cane</a> or another style could help you get the most out of your vacation time.</p>
<h2>Flying with Your Canes</h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s modern world, flying anywhere has become complicated. What can you take, what must you leave behind? Who has 3oz bottles of shampoo, anyway? Your cane is certain to have some special rules surrounding it as well. Ultimately, you need to find the answer from the airline you are using, and in some cases, they might provide you with a temporary replacement that has been approved by the airline. In most situations, though, you should be alright.</p>
<p>However, the time may come when you need to check your cane with your luggage, or your cane might need to fit inside your carry-on bag while you are seated. In this case, we suggest a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Folding_Adjustable.html">folding cane</a> that will easily compact itself into a small, portable form that easily stores in any piece of luggage. Some of our canes, specifically the <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/walking-canes/?query=mini+compact+canes">mini-compact canes</a> line of walking sticks, come with a handy carrying case, offering more protection for your merchandise while you are traveling.</p>
<p>We would also like to take the time to warn against using a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Weapon_Sword_Canes.html">sword cane</a>, for obvious reasons, or a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/flask-canes.html">smuggler&#8217;s cane</a> which would raise suspicions with security because of its hidden compartments. If one of these styles is what you normally use, you may want to order a new cane to avoid frustrating delays and possible confiscation of your mobility aid.</p>
<h2>Nature Walks</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Seat_Cane.html"><img class="alignleft" title="folding seat canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/seat-cane.jpg" alt="Folding Seat Canes" width="144" height="150" /></a>Have you always wanted to see the Grand Canyon? Or perhaps you are going on a camping trip or hike with your family? Are you worried that perhaps you will need a handy way to take a break in the middle? Or maybe you are a bird-watcher or photographer, and would like a comfortable place to stop and enjoy your hobby?</p>
<p>There is nothing for this type of travel that we suggest more than one of our popular <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Seat_Cane.html">seat canes</a>. They come in a variety of styles, sizes and types of seat, and each provides not only a sturdy walking aid but also a comfortable, handy alternative to carrying around a folding chair or lawn chair during your travels.</p>
<h2>Camping, and Using a Cane in the Great Outdoors<a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Pathlighter_Walking_Canes.html"><img class="alignright" title="flashlight canes" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/5716.jpg" alt="Walking Canes with Flashlight" width="180" height="218" /></a></h2>
<p>The above advisement for a seat cane applies just as much if you are camping as well, but if you would like other, handy options, consider a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Pathlighter_Walking_Canes.html">flashlight cane</a> for a convenient, dual-purpose option, or an <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Umbrella_Walking_Canes.html">umbrella cane</a> to be ready if you are caught out in the rain. When braving the great outdoors, it is always wise to follow the Boy Scout Motto: Be Prepared.</p>
<h2>A Walking Cane for That Long Drive</h2>
<p>Finally, we will point your attention yet again to a <a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/Folding_Adjustable.html">folding cane</a>. If your idea of a vacation is driving across country or simply a long trip to visit family, you might like to have the convenience of something that can fold up into a glove-box, or even under your seat or in the compartments in your door.</p>
<p>No matter what you are looking to do this summer, be sure that your use of a walking cane will in no way impede the fun and relaxing vacation you can have.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course, we here at FashionableCanes.com are avid fans of the TV show House, M.D. in part, to be perfectly honest, because of his<a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/1103.html"><img class="alignright" title="House's Red Cane" src="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/1103.jpg" alt="Dr House Red Cane" width="180" height="218" /></a> excellent choice in walking canes, but also because of the way the show&#8217;s writers are able to combine comedy and drama together into every episode.</p>
<p>For those of you who watch the Superbowl every year for the commercials, you may have noticed the parody of Mean Joe Green&#8217;s Coca Cola commercial (the iconic image of him tossing his jersey to his adoring fan after the young lad offered him a Coke).  In this parody, the writers of Fox&#8217;s hit TV show had Dr House (Hugh Laurie) playing the part of the sports star, with his adoring fan again being a young boy.</p>
<p>Click on the video below to see for yourself how funny the drama can be:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="350" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RErDtU3fzPs&amp;feature" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RErDtU3fzPs&amp;feature"></embed></object></p>
<p>Did we ever think that we&#8217;d see our own products in the Superbowl? Of course we are surprised. Even as we&#8217;ve watched our products appear on popular television shows like House, Glee and others, appear in magazines and even in movies, the Packers v Steelers Superbowl of 2011 was the most watched television event to date, and there we were, among the highest-priced commercial advertisements in history! Surprised? Absolutely. But of all of the canes that could have made it to the Superbowl, it is no surprise that it was one of such high quality.</p>
<p>The red tourist can is Dr House&#8217;s latest addition to his collection, one of our best hardwood tourist canes, meticulously crafted and built to last.<a href="http://www.fashionablecanes.com/1103.html"> House&#8217;s red cane</a> is a fresh look on one of his originals, the classic tourist with a rich rosewood finish.</p>
<p>Yet again, the writers of House, M.D. showed us how they could take the dramatic situations of the medical-centered show and add a touch of humor that they know we will love.</p>
<p>What did you think of this commercial for House, M.D.?</p>
