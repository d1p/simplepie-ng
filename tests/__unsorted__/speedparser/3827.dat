<p>I recently watched a great <a title="Optimizing Your Website for Maximum Lead Flow" href="http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-webinar/optimizing-your-website-for-maximum-lead-flow/" target="_blank">Hubspot webinar by Tim Ash and Mike Volpe</a> on website design and lead generation. The webinar made some great points on how small changes can lead to significantly more leads.</p>
<p>Many of the concepts covered in the webinar can be applied to improve lead generation in your channel marketing program. If you are a vendor <a title="SharedVue Platform Overview" href="http://sharedvue.com/products/content-syndication-capabilities/" target="_blank">using the SharedVue platform</a>, you have control over these factors and can take action to<strong> improve your lead gen capabilities for all your syndicating partners</strong> at once. If you are not using a content syndication platform, your channel partners can still implement these steps on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Here are three steps to help you generate more leads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make Call-to-Actions More Prominent</li>
<li>Re-evaluate Your Lead Gen Forms</li>
<li>Be Concise with Your Product Content</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">1. Make Your Call-to-Action Clear and Prominent</span></h2>
<p>Your call-to-action is text, a button or graphic that drives customers to your lead generation forms. Whether you are offering a free trial, case study, or whitepaper, it&#8217;s important that the call-to-action is clear about what the reader is getting and what you want them to do. Here is an example of a clear call-to-action in one of SharedVue&#8217;s content syndication programs:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-24-at-2.07.09-PM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915" title="Cisco Call-to-Action Example" src="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-24-at-2.07.09-PM.jpg" alt="Example of a free download from Cisco" width="595" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>You also want to ensure your call-to-action is optimally positioned and prominent across your content. Customers should be able to easily identify your call-to-actions as they navigate through your site. [Boagworld has good post on <a title="10 Techniques For An Effective ‘Call To Action’" href="http://boagworld.com/design/10-techniques-for-an-effective-call-to-action/" target="_blank">effective call-to-actions</a>, here is an example from their post.]</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Call-to-Action Carson Workshops" src="http://boagworld.com/blogImages/carson-20090122-133740.jpg" alt="Lead generation" width="584" height="414" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">2. Re-evaluate Your Lead Gen Forms</span></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve optimized your call-to-actions, you will have more customers reaching your lead capture forms but that doesn&#8217;t mean they will be converted to a lead. Too often, these forms ask for too much information in relation to the value being offered to the customer. This results in the customer leaving the page without entering his or her information.</p>
<p>Take a look across your call-to-actions and <em>match the length of your lead-gen forms and the value they are offering accordingly</em><strong>.</strong> If you feel you are offering a lot of value for your customers&#8217; information, then they may be more lenient in filling out a longer form, thus disclosing more personal contact information. However, if what you are offering is not of significant value, don&#8217;t expect your customer to take the time to fill out a form at all. <strong>Maybe you should offer this download for free.</strong></p>
<p>Another way you can squeeze more leads out of your downloadable assets and call-to-actions is by <em>reducing your forms to the bare minimum information you need right now</em><strong>.</strong> Do you need to know your customer&#8217;s industry or title right now? Or can you follow up with an email or call and gather more information then?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">3. Be Concise with Your Product Content</span></h2>
<p>You obviously want to offer a lot information on your site about your company and products, but don&#8217;t get carried away with writing too much. Provide customers the basics of what they need to know, and structure your content in a way that is easy to scan through using headings, bullet lists and hyperlinks.</p>
<p>If you are concise and provide your customers with <strong>clear, prominent call-to-actions</strong> and contact buttons, customers will be able to reach out to you for more specific questions, which can help generate more qualified leads.</p>

<h2>But What is Content Marketing?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p><a title="Junta42" href="http://www.junta42.com/resources/what-is-content-marketing.aspx" target="_blank">According to Junta42.com</a>, content marketing &#8220;a marketing technique of creating and distributing relevant and valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined and understood target audience &#8211; with the objective of driving profitable customer action.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Content marketing can be any form of <strong>online media content</strong> used to educate and point a customer to your products. This can be in the form of eBooks, podcasts, blogs, or other media outlets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>Content marketing is important for three main reasons:</h5>
</div>
<p><strong>1. Improves search engine rankings</strong><br />
Maintaining a regular blog on your website can <strong>improve your search engine rankings and boost traffic to your site</strong>. Writing quality content relevant to your industry can help attract new site visitors and customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Helps generate leads</strong><br />
If you regularly post quality content you have an opportunity to <strong>capture more leads from your site&#8217;s increased traffic</strong>. Including calls-to-action at the end of your blog posts and throughout your website can make the lead generation process more effective and efficient.</p>
<p><strong>3. Establishes you as a thought leader</strong><br />
In addition to SEO and lead generation benefits, publishing quality blog posts, whitepapers, and ebooks can establish you as a thought leader in your industry. As thought leader you may benefit from <strong>increased inbound links and referrals</strong> from those who see your company as an expert in your field.</p>
<h2>Content Marketing for Channel Partners</h2>
<div>
<p>So how does this all fit into the sales channel? Well most vendors don&#8217;t have problems creating content through social media, blogs, and whitepapers because they have the resources to do so. Partners, on the other hand, are usually smaller operations and struggle to regularly develop fresh content.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><a title="Content Syndication - Syndic8" href="http://sharedvue.com/products/syndic8.asp" target="_blank">Content syndication</a> already helps partners with product and service information as well as leads, but it could also be taken to the next level by automating blog or article publishing or even <a href="http://wp.me/pRzB5-9g">social media syndication</a>. Most vendors have a lot of resources that can be reworked for this type of syndication, so initially you would not have to come up with content from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Pushing content with relevant best practices or how-to information to partner websites can enable you AND your partners to reap the benefits of content marketing. Your partners benefit from increased, relevant content that can <strong>drive traffic to their sites</strong>. You benefit from establishing or maintaining your thought leadership position by syndicating valuable content to hundreds or thousands of channel partners&#8217; websites.</p>

<p>Dan Zarella, Social Media Scientist at Hubspot, put together a very informative webinar called <a title="The Science of Timing Webinar - Hubspot" href="http://www.hubspot.com/the-science-of-timing/" target="_blank">The Science of Timing</a>. In this webinar, Zarella presents extensive research regarding the <strong>best times to reach people through email</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways regarding email timing that you can apply to optimize communication efforts with your channel partners:</p>
<h2>What Time Should You Email Your Channel Partners?</h2>
<p>Zarella&#8217;s research shows that <strong>more people read emails in the morning than at night</strong>, with open rates particularly higher early in the morning between 6:00 A.M. and 7:00 A.M.</p>
<p>If you are not in the office that early, you or your <strong>channel managers</strong> can schedule your partner communications for delivery during one of those times.<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/delay-or-schedule-sending-e-mail-messages-HP001232817.aspx" target="_blank"> </a>It is pretty easy to <a title="Schedule Sending E-mail Messages with Outlook" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/delay-or-schedule-sending-e-mail-messages-HP001232817.aspx" target="_blank">schedule emails with Outlook</a>, and you can find add-on extensions for most other email clients.</p>
<h2>What Day Should You Email Your Channel Partners?</h2>
<p>Zarella&#8217;s research also shows that <strong>open rates are higher on weekends than on weekdays</strong>. This may not be too surprising since people are usually not as busy on weekends and may have more time to go through all their emails. However, it&#8217;s important to note that <strong>spam reporting is also higher on the weekends</strong>.</p>
<p>Before you start blasting weekend emails to your channel partners, consider the subject of your email and whether or not your partners would be more receptive to reading it during the week.</p>
<p>Put yourself in their shoes. When would you be most receptive to the email you&#8217;re sending? Is the content heavy and work related? Or is it just informative and easy to relay?</p>
<h2>How Often Should You Email Your Channel Partners?</h2>
<p>The research data shows <strong>unsubscribe rates are not significantly affected</strong> once you get past sending 4-5 emails per month. Surprisingly, there was no substantial difference in unsubscribe rates between companies that sent 4 emails a month to companies that sent 33 emails a month.</p>
<p>A possible reason for this is that most subscribers who are not interested in your content will unsubscribe after the first few emails. Once this initial group unsubscribes, you have a qualified base of subscribers who are interested in your content and are less likely to unsubscribe from your mailing list.</p>
<p>Your channel <strong>partners are already a qualified list</strong> since they have opted into a partnership. While you don&#8217;t have to worry about unsubscribe rates, this data is useful in getting an idea of an acceptable amount of emails that won&#8217;t annoy or push your partners away.</p>
<p>While 33 emails a month does seem excessive, the takeaway here is that <strong>most companies are not even close to sending too many emails</strong>. So unless you&#8217;re already sending out a daily email, consider <strong>increasing the frequency of your emailing efforts.</strong></p>
<h2>Understand Your Partner Base and Find YOUR Optimum Timing</h2>
<p>While these are all great starting points, the research data is based on a large aggregate pool. Habits and reading tendencies are likely to differ across different audiences. Use these takeaways as starting points and experiment with sending more emails during different days and times to <strong>find the optimum time to reach your partners</strong>.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-712" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2011/03/promoting-marketing-tools-to-channel-partners-with-social-media/partner-recruitment-social-media/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-712" title="partner-recruitment-social-media" src="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/partner-recruitment-social-media-300x172.png" alt="Recruiting Channel Partners to Enablement Programs with Social Media" width="300" height="172" /></a>In a previous blog post, I mentioned how important it is to <a title="Understand the Social Media Landscape" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2010/08/4-reasons-why-channel-vendor-social-media-programs-fail/" target="_blank">do a situation analysis</a> and understand how people in your circle are using social media. Different audiences use different platforms (Twitter, blogs, etc) for different purposes. Should you <a title="Increase Partner Syndication Rates" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2011/03/3-steps-to-help-you-increase-your-partner-syndication-rates/" target="_blank">promote enablement programs to your partners</a> with social media? If you move forward with <strong>promoting marketing tools to your partners </strong>with Twitter, Facebook and the like, you&#8217;ll need a firm grasp on how your partners are communicating and socializing on those platforms. This will allow you to<em> fit in and see big results</em>.</p>
<p>There is a methodology for developing any social media campaign — P.O.S.T.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong>eople you&#8217;re trying to reach</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>bjectives you want to accomplish</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>trategies to reach those objectives</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>echnology/social media platform</li>
</ul>
<p>When SharedVue was charged with <strong>onboarding partners</strong> for one of our client&#8217;s syndication programs, we used the above methodology to develop a campaign. We wanted existing channel partners (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>P</strong></span>) to become aware of and register for the SharedVue syndication program (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>O</strong></span>). We found that most of our client&#8217;s partners were using social media personally, not corporately, so it was necessary to push out content relevant to their needs (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>), not their companies&#8217;. Since we had a large database of partner contact information, we used Twitter&#8217;s (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>T</strong></span>) built in address book search to find 200 partners. There, we conversed with partners about relevant industry topics, subtly creating demand for our syndication tool.</p>
<p>As a call-to-action, we would post benefits of using the SharedVue program with a link to register. After the program matured, we converted the Twitter account into a program update and partner support tool. Now, this is <strong>SharedVue&#8217;s most widely adopted syndication program</strong> with over <strong>3,500 registered partners</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though Twitter was a big win in this instance, it won&#8217;t be a cookie-cutter approach for every channel vendor. Likewise, it isn&#8217;t a good idea to only use one method of communication to drive partners to action. Social media is merely a category of tools vendors can use. In the case above, SharedVue also used traditional methods of getting partners to register, such as email and call campaigns and <a title="Increase Partner Syndication Rates with Incentives" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2010/07/a-case-study-partner-incentives-increase-program-adoption/" target="_blank">registration incentives</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help promoting your syndication program to partners, Sharedvue has a comprehensive list of <a title="Case Study: Motivating Partners, Surpassing Goals" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/49723998/Syndication-Onboarding-Strategies-Case-Study" target="_blank">integrated communications strategies</a> we can use to help increase adoption.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-647" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2011/03/you%e2%80%99ve-got-marketing-automation-now-what/marketing-automation/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-647" title="marketing-automation" src="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/marketing-automation.png" alt="Marketing Automation Improves the Lead Pipeline" width="674" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>A big trend for 2011 has been the shift toward <strong>marketing automation</strong>. This is largely due to a rise in social media, SEO/SEM and inbound marketing. These nuances have allowed marketers to do more customer touches with less internal resources. However, marketers are now faced with new challenges as they find themselves completely rethinking their strategies.</p>
<p>So what do you do once you&#8217;ve started a marketing automation program? Mac McConnell, Managing Partner &amp; Founder at BlueBird Strateties, wrote a great article for <a title="MarketingAutomationSoftware.com" href="http://www.marketingautomationsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Marketing Automation Software Guide</a> touching on <a title="Original Article: You’ve Got Marketing Automation. Now What?" href="http://www.marketingautomationsoftware.com/blog/youve-got-marketing-automation-now-what/" target="_blank">the pain points marketers face after implementing an automation program</a>. Through his experiences, Mac has identified 3 areas marketers struggle with after implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lead Sources</li>
<li>Good Content</li>
<li>Lead Scoring</li>
</ol>
<h2>Content Syndication and Rockstar Content</h2>
<p>For channel marketers, implementing a marketing automation program such as <strong>content syndication</strong> can be great. But what if you don&#8217;t have a good source for content? In his article, Mac says that the biggest choke-point he sees organizations face is <strong>updating content, keeping it fresh and relevant</strong> for end users. Vendors running content syndication programs should plan ahead when creating content. Think about the different sources of content you have internally to create web content pushed to partner websites. Make sure those sources are able to update content often, perhaps quarterly or even monthly.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t always have to update all the content you&#8217;re syndicating. A quick win for vendors is to simply change out a few promotions each time they update partners&#8217; syndicated showcases.</p>
<p>In the article, Mac shows just how successful great content can be. The example below shows the results of three separate emails sends:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/content-comparison-chart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-641" title="content-comparison-chart" src="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/content-comparison-chart.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>The key here is writing fresh content that helps the buyer meet their goals, not your&#8217;s. The yield on any marketing initiative, be it automated or tradition, will ultimately increase with the right message.</p>
<h2>Beyond Content — Demand Generation</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve set the stage with rockstar content and guaranteed you have a fresh source for updates, you can then start worrying about pushing leads to partner websites. Mac says that it is hard to know the full lifecycle of a lead if you have multiple touch points (i.e. tradeshows, content syndication, email campaigns, list rental). Thus, the most important factor for nurturing leads for partners is message consistency.</p>
<p>For channel vendors to truly understand the lead-to-sale process for their solution providers, they must enable partners to function with limited to no marketing resources. Everything Channel released research late last year showing an astounding 63% of solution providers don&#8217;t have a dedicated marketing resource. So, to further support Mac&#8217;s point, setting up a marketing automation pipeline for partners is simply not enough. Vendors can also help partners run automation programs through managed services and virtual marketing manager programs.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t provide this type of help to your partners, it may be time to seek some additional help.</p>

<p><a href="http://wp.me/pRzB5-9I"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-608" title="partner-adoption-rates" src="http://blog.sharedvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/patner-chart.png" alt="Increase Parter Adoption of Channel Enablement Programs" width="300" height="264" /></a>One of the challenges you may be facing with your syndication program is your partner syndication percentage, which tells you how many of your registered partners are actually syndicating content. A few months ago, one of our clients approached us about designing and running a recruitment campaign aimed at <strong>increasing their partner syndication percentage</strong>. The campaign resulted in <strong>a 22% increase in the number of syndicating partners</strong> for the client&#8217;s U.S. market.</p>
<p>During this campaign, we identified <strong>3 crucial factors to running a successful recruitment campaign</strong>.</p>
<h2>Target ALL Your Registered, Non-Syndicating Partners</h2>
<p>This one may seem pretty obvious, but the important point here is that you don&#8217;t need to only target recently registered partners. You should be <strong>targeting all your registered partners</strong> who are not syndicating.</p>
<p>During the recruitment campaign, we began our calling efforts with the most recently registered partners and moved down the list toward older registrants. Our hunch was that newly registered partners would be more receptive to getting implemented than older partners who may have registered for the program a year ago and forgotten about it.</p>
<p>To our surprise we found that our <strong>rate of partner conversions stayed constant even as we began calling older registrants</strong>, even with those who had registered 6 months to over a year ago.</p>
<p>As we spoke to more partners, this trend became easier to understand. Throughout our efforts, we could tell that most partners were interested in the syndication program. Once partners understand the benefits of syndication, the main issue in getting them to implement is time. Usually, partners are understaffed and very busy, making implementation a bit of a hurdle for them. They want to start syndicating, but because of their demanding schedules they place implementation low on their priority list. As time passes, implementation becomes forgotten.</p>
<p>What partners need is a reminder of the syndication program and the benefits it will bring to them. Even if they registered a year ago, once they recall the program and what it can do for them, they are just as likely to implement as a recently registered partner.</p>
<h2>Be Persistent</h2>
<p>This is a key element of having a successful recruitment effort. As I mentioned above, most partners are very busy. Usually, <strong>partners fail to get implemented because they are lacking time</strong> or are swamped with other initiatives. They register but put off implementation and then forget about it as they focus on day to day tasks.</p>
<p>Being persistent with your communications can provide partners with the reminder they need to get implemented. <strong>Multi-touch emails in a relatively short-time frame can be very effective</strong> in pushing partners to make time to get implemented. While some partners will get implemented after a first contact, others will require a second or third touch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that you want to be tactful with your communications. <a title="Partner Incentives Increase Program Adoption" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2010/07/a-case-study-partner-incentives-increase-program-adoption/" target="_blank">Provide helpful information and incentives</a> rather than just telling partners to get implemented. Send 3 email messages over the course of 2-3 weeks with each message being different in what benefits syndication offers and what incentives partners have to get implemented. You want your messages to really outline the many benefits of syndication while communicating that it&#8217;s in the partner&#8217;s best interest to start syndicating.</p>
<p>Throughout any recruitment campaign there will be a number of partners who can&#8217;t implement because of site redesigns or other organizational functions that are currently in the way. Being persistent with multiple communications can increase your chances of reaching these partners once the right time is available.</p>
<h2>Be Personal</h2>
<p>Not only do <a title="Are your Channel Programs Engaging your Partners?" href="http://www.channelmavenconsulting.com/2011/01/are-your-channel-programs-engaging-your-partners/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+channelmaven+%28Channel+Maven+Consulting%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">your channel programs need to be engaging</a>, so do the communications about those programs. Whether this is done through phone calls or voice messages to each partner, this added touch creates a bit more pressure. Through this, partners know you personally noticed he/she registered but has not started syndicating yet. This also allows you to remove some of the roadblocks in the partner&#8217;s mind by answering questions and clarifying parts of the program the partner may not have understood before.</p>
<p>Also, we found that continuing to be persistent with a follow-up email can be very effective. Most partners probably won&#8217;t have the time to actually get implemented when you are speaking to them, but by personally following up through an email, you not only give them another reminder, you also provide them with an easy way to get back to you with any questions they might have about the implementation process.</p>
<h2>Tying It All Together</h2>
<p>Following these three guidelines in your recruitment efforts should go a long way in improving your partner syndication rates.

<p>A recent survey by <a title="Aberdeen" href="http://www.aberdeen.com/" target="_blank">Aberdeen Group</a> revealed that top <strong>IT companies have increased channel enablement spending by 4.7% this year</strong> and plan to increase it by 6.8% for the next year. In this increasingly competitive environment you may be considering increasing your marketing and channel enablement budget too, but you should also be considering how to maximize value from existing programs and resources. <strong>One area in which you can stretch your marketing dollar is in your <a title="Showing ROI for Your Social Media Activities" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2010/08/showing-roi-for-your-social-media-activities/" target="_blank">social media programs</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Leveraging Social Media Syndication</h2>
<p>Most leading technology firms today already utilize social media to promote their brands and encourage interactivity through corporate blogs and company pages on Facebook and Twitter. <a title="Newstex" href="http://newstex.com/" target="_blank">Newstex</a>, an e-content aggregator and <strong>syndication service provider</strong>, recently added Facebook to its platform that can <strong>pull content from social media sites</strong>, which already included Twitter and blog sites.</p>
<p>Newstex&#8217;s platform takes multimedia content from news sources, corporate blogs, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts, and can deliver it to <strong>content distributors such as SharedVue</strong> in a standardized form. In turn, these distributors provide relevant, targeted news and commentary to professional end-users in different industries.</p>
<h2>How Social Media Content Can Work in Syndication</h2>
<p>Newstex is in the business of selecting, enhancing, and providing relevant information to professional end-users. They collect content from authoritative sources, and standardize and enhance it by adding things like stock tickers to public companies’ names. Distributors like <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/" target="_blank">LexisNexis</a> and <a title="Thomson Reuters" href="http://thomsonreuters.com/" target="_blank">Thomson Reuters</a> are willing to pay Newstex for the content it aggregates, and Newstex in turn pays royalties to the content providers, which range from corporations and news sources to niche blog sites. This business model allows enterprises and companies to benefit from this service not only for free but while also generating some royalty revenue.</p>
<p>Not that the additional revenue is a primary incentive for enterprises.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Most corporate content providers are primarily interested in the additional exposure and publicity generated through syndication,&#8221;</em> said Aura Novembre, Newstex&#8217;s Director of Publisher Relations, <em>&#8220;In most cases, enterprises choose to either forgo their royalty payments or donate them to different charities.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>Improving Your Channel Partner Content</h2>
<p>Since most channel vendors already have social media programs in place, syndication can provide you with an opportunity to get more value from your already established efforts. Content from social media sites can complement your traditional <a title="A Vendor’s Guide to Managing a Syndication Program" href="http://blog.sharedvue.com/2010/09/managing-content-syndication-programs/" target="_blank">syndicated content</a>, and the interactive nature of it can provide valuable information about your products or services.</p>
<p>By syndicating your blog, Facebook, and Twitter content to channel partners, you can create a more complete and dynamic content set- which can translate into <strong>more effective communication and sales to your end-customers</strong>.</p>

<p>Many resellers, solution providers and partners were busy with face-to-face sales and did not have the time, ability or resources to focus on online marketing and lead generation.  Katie Spence, Director of US Partner Marketing, Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking at Hewlett-Packard, was receiving consistent feedback from partners needing help with all aspects of their online presence.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when HP turned to SharedVue and Everything Channel.

<p>Sometimes it is hard to discern the difference between true <strong>web content syndication</strong> and content distribution services. Below is a quick synopsis of the difference between the two and the ways they are best used for channel vendors to push content for and to their partners.</p>
<h2>Syndication</h2>
<p><strong>Web content syndication</strong> is an automated flow of content from one source to infinite locations that allows the initial content creator complete control over all versions. It allows a vendor to create a centralized hub or content repository where they can arrange marketing content about products, solutions and other promotions. The content is able to be automatically updated on partner websites without any action from the partner. Vendors can update the content through a centralized admin console where they also receive reports on page hits, link clicks or any other web metric.</p>

<p><em>Best Use: Creating product/solution showcases on </em><em>solution provider/partner websites <em>that</em></em><em> allows for  vendors to control updates, content messaging and ROI metrics.</em></p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Content distribution</strong> is a manual method of pushing out content from one initial source to an infinite number of locations but does not guarantee the initial source&#8217;s versioning is maintained. It takes content from either a vendor or solution provider and manually places it on different web properties, such as micro, press release, news or any other site. There is no way for the content creator (probably the vendor) to automatically update content in all of the locations. While there may be some sort of a content repository, there is no centralized metrics console or guaranteed control over content edits.</p>

<p><em>Best Use: For pushing out content to random or targeted sources about new products, company updates, press releases and other PR related content.</em></p>
