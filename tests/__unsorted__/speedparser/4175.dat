<blockquote><p>If you are offended by taxation, you&#8217;ll settle on a conception of liberty according to which taxation is a violation. If you think a relatively high level of taxation is necessary to give people what you think they ought to get, you&#8217;ll settle on a conception of liberty according to which taxation is not a violation, but not giving people what you think they ought to get is. That&#8217;s why abstract political philosophy is so often futile. It&#8217;s probably more useful to start out arguing over regime types in the first place, since mostly what we do is choose our favorite regime type and then reason backwards to conceptions of liberty, equality, and so forth that justify our pick.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve come to the view that behavioral economics solutions are often being used as a substitute for more fundamental efforts. British Prime Minister David Cameron is a big fan of behavioral economics and gave a talk in which he said, &#8220;The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending, to show them what their neighbors are spending, and then show them what an energy-conscious neighbor is spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>This idea plays on Bob Cialdini&#8217;s research documenting the impact of social norms on behavior. It&#8217;s a great idea, and leads to reductions in energy use of a few percent, <strong>but showing someone their neighbor&#8217;s bill is not the best way to get them to cut their own bill. The best way is to charge an amount that reflects the true cost of the electricity,</strong> including social costs from importing oil, pollution, climate change, and so on. Behavioral economics has a lot of great insights to contribute to public policy, but it will be unfortunate if it substitutes tried-and-true approaches involving taxes and regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Loewenstein loses some of the force from his point with his half-nonsense about the &#8220;true cost&#8221; of electricity. The larger point is that prices matter and money prices matter a great deal, even if all prices aren&#8217;t monetary. People generally prefer doing what everyone else is doing, so you can increase (or decrease!) the psychological price of energy use by showing someone they&#8217;re out of step with the Smiths, but you can increase the psychological price more and more surely by directly raising the monetary price of electricity.</p>
<p>The political thrust of this is what&#8217;s interesting. Behavioral econ offers policymakers an added dimension of evasion. A government can make a big hullabaloo of caring about energy consumption and climate change by sending folks mail detailing in vivid color their energy use relative to social norms instead of making themselves unpopular by making voters poorer. Not only is behavioral economics not some sort of master-key for effective policymaking, it gives politicians a fresh way to appear forward-thinking, activist policymakers while really doing nothing much at all.</p>
<p>Loewenstein <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/opinion/15loewenstein.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">has made this argument before</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[B]ehavioral economics is being used as a political expedient, allowing policymakers to avoid painful but more effective solutions rooted in traditional economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a sound observation and bears repeating, though I think it&#8217;s a bit late for the behavioralists to try to take it back like this. Perhaps they can make up for their earlier naiveté by making the psychology and incentives of politicians a focus of their research.</p>

<p>Do you miss this blog? Well, you&#8217;re in luck. Starting September 12th, I&#8217;ll be starting a blog that covers much the same eclectic ground as the Fly Bottle over at <a href="http://bigthink.com/">Big Think</a>. It&#8217;ll be called The Moral Sciences Club, which I will explain in my first post there. I&#8217;ve been missing blogging about the range of stuff I used to blog about, especially philosophy, and I&#8217;m thrilled to have a chance to get back to it without having to worry much about hurting my thin, wavering freelancer&#8217;s bottom line. What about my evanescent Forbes blog, you ask? Forbes didn&#8217;t turn out to feel like a good fit for me, is all. But I&#8217;m much psyched about Big Think because, for one thing, it&#8217;s called &#8220;Big Think.&#8221; So there&#8217;s that. And I&#8217;ve been a fan of the site since its inception. Also, <em>Time </em>just named Big Think <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2087815_2087913_2087914,00.html ">the top &#8220;News &amp; Info&#8221; site of 2011</a>, and here&#8217;s what they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thinking at <a href="http://bigthink.com/" target="_blank">Big Think</a> is big indeed. This blog and video site covers, well, the world: arts, business, science, history and much more. Resident big thinkers such as futurist Ray Kurzweil and distinguished guests tackle the topics seriously, and counterintuitive notions and outright heresy are welcome. (One post <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/39548" target="_blank">speculated that there&#8217;s a 20% chance that we&#8217;re all part of an elaborate computer simulation from the future.</a>) It&#8217;s a great place to go to challenge your preconceived notions and recharge your mental batteries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a great thing to be a part of, no?</p>
<p>This blog over the next few months will largely consist of posts pointing to my Big Think posts, the occasional sketch, and perhaps the odd, loose thought. And then we&#8217;ll see. Politics blogging at <em>The Economist</em> will proceed as usual.</p>

<p>The task of &#8220;showing your thanks for our military men and women who protect&#8221; our freedoms brought to mind &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/06/13/110613fi_fiction_saunders?currentPage=all">Home</a>,&#8221; a funny, heartbreaking, damning George Saunders story I read yesterday in <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8216;s June fiction issue.  Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve been away a long time,” I said.</p>
<p>“Welcome back,” the first kid said.</p>
<p>“Where were you?” the second one said.</p>
<p>“At the war,” I said, in the most insulting voice I could muster. “Maybe you’ve heard of it?”</p>
<p>“I have,” the first one said respectfully. “Thank you for your service.”</p>
<p>“Which one?” the second one said. “Aren’t there two?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t they just call one off?” the first one said.</p>
<p>“My cousin’s there,” the second said. “At one of them. At least I think he is. I know he was supposed to go. We were never that close.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, thanks,” the first one said, and put out his hand, and I shook it.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t for it,” the second one said. “But I know it wasn’t your deal.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said. “It kind of was.”</p>
<p>“You <em>weren’t</em> for it or <em>aren’t</em> for it?” the first said to the second.</p>
<p>“Both,” the second one said. “Although is it still going?”</p>
<p>“Which one?” the first one said.</p>
<p>“Is the one you were at still going?” the second one asked me.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“Better or worse, do you think?” the first one said. “Like, in your view, are we winning? Oh, what am I doing? I don’t actually care, that’s what’s so funny about it!”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” the second one said, and held out his hand, and I shook it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read it all the way to the end.</p>
<p>This morning, on the local news, I learned about <a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/07/03/officials-still-investigating-iowa-soldiers-death/">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Capt. Matthew Nielson, 27, of Jefferson died June 29, in Badrah, Iraq. He was killed by indirect fire attack while on duty in Iraq, Iowa National Guard officials said in a news release issued Sunday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nielson was UNI grad, like me. Like me, he worked in a grocery store as a high-school student. He died in the course of an unjust war that has nothing do with protecting our freedom. Had I been born a decade later, he could have been me. It makes me sick to think about. Would his life have been wasted like this if Americans did not so strenuously insist on lying to one another about what it is our military men and women really do? Who does it help to continue to so effusively thank Matthew Nielson&#8217;s luckier comrades for their service and our freedom? Our gratitude is a rain of grenades over the senior high. Bright-eyed American boys and girls stare smiling down the smoking barrel of our thanks, dying to please.</p>

</div></p>
<p>A short piece I wrote on Herman Cain&#8217;s visit to a small tea party event in my hometown Wednesday is now <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/06/herman-cain-in-iowa-an-all-business-tea-party-pitch/240983/">online at <em>The Atlantic</em></a>. This is my favorite part:</p>
<blockquote><p>At about noon, Cain alights from a sleek black sedan outside Legends, where he is greeted in the drizzle by a smattering of journalists. Before heading into the restaurant to address the expectant room, a Swiss television crew and a few reporters are ushered with Cain up the steps of an aging Holiday Rambler motor home parked nearby. The middle third of the &#8220;bus&#8221; is covered in a giant, jumbled, color decal that reads &#8220;Return to a Golden Foundation,&#8221; &#8220;Train the Tea Party,&#8221; and &#8220;www.teapartybustour.com&#8221; in big block letters above logos for the tour&#8217;s sponsors&#8211;Iowa Tea Party, Gold Standard 2012, Leadership Institute, Tea Party Review&#8211;all printed atop a misty image of Old Glory superimposed over a parchment Constitution turned at 45 degrees. &#8220;People&#8221; of &#8220;We the People&#8221; is divided by the support post of a retracted retractable awning. The Holiday Rambler is fired up and taken for a slow spin around the WalMart lot and its various frontage and access roads, presumably so Swiss TV viewers can see Cain fielding questions while something like scenery slides by in a blur behind him, as if chatting amiably with newsmen while crisscrossing Iowa in a used recreational vehicle is something Herman Cain actually does.</p></blockquote>

<li>Very generous pensions for ex-legislators</li>
<li>Prohibition on ex-legislators accepting compensated employment or even unpaid advisory positions within 10, 15, 20, or whatever years after retirement from congress</li>
<li>Prohibition on current or ex-legislators owning stocks, bonds, etc.</li>
<li>Extremely high-prestige automatic membership in posh post-legislative body, e.g., The American Academy of Exalted Deliberation in the Public Interest, the proceedings and findings of which are treated with the utmost interest and respect.</li>
<li>Nobel-like large cash prize and title awarded to one especially exceptional legislator upon retirement (conferred by the AAEDPI, say).</li>

It&#8217;s interesting to read. Of course, a lot of it is mostly irrelevant to me, and probably to Silberman, because of Silberman&#8217;s subject, neurodiversity. The uselessness of a lot of advice, or the neuro-relativity of usefulness, seems to me a pretty straightforward implication of the plurality of attentional, creative, and cognitive styles, and I found it interesting that someone writing specifically about diverse kinds of minds didn&#8217;t note this in presenting a bunch of advice about how to do something as neurologically demanding as book-writing. There&#8217;s an obvious selection-effect problem here. Most book-writing advice is going to comes from people who are able to successfully apply standard book-writing advice. But I don&#8217;t need book-writing advice from those people. I need to know what works for people with a mind like mine. Maybe nothing works. Maybe the best advice for people like me is: don&#8217;t try to write a book, you flake. Or: if you insist, you will suffer, and it may or may not be worth it.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>BLOGGERS OF THE YEAR</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>- In lively, exquisitely crafted prose, Will Wilkinson offered posts at <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica">Democracy In America</a> that managed a rare trifecta: they were provocative, logically sound, and infused with razor sharp wit.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/">Julian Sanchez</a>, <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/">Radley Balko</a> and <a href="http://prospect.org/csnc/blogs/adam_serwer">Adam Serwer</a> for their vital work on civil liberties.</p>
<p>- Joe Posnanski for his delightful <a href="http://joeposnanski.blogspot.com/">sports blog</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh. And I&#8217;m honored to be included among the likes of Greenwald, Serwer and my old liberty-loving friends, Sanchez and Balko. I just gave Joe Posnanki a look-see, and I find it&#8217;s mostly baseball, which brings to mind this exchange between Lewis &#8220;Teabag&#8221; Miner, the narrator, and Principal Fontana from Sam Lipsyte&#8217;s ridiculous novel <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312424183/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0312424183&amp;adid=0AXQ63TEEW1HWFNV53M9&amp;">Homeland</a></em>, which I recommend if you like drugs, jokes, self-abuse, feeling terrible about high school, <em>tour de force</em> ranting, and/or the sounds of words.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you followed baseball&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a load of pseudopoetic crap, boring as hell. It was invented so frustrated intellectuals could pine for their daddies without appearing too unmanly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like baseball,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just kidding, buddy. Of course I like baseball. But I like french fries dipped in melon juice and giving it to Loretta from behind more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should get going,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live, Miner. There&#8217;s nothing to it. It&#8217;s not original. Just necessary&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d had enough of Fontana, Catamounts. Sometimes the idea of a man is sufficient. Fontana was a fine enough notion for a man, but to see him here, sick eyes afire in hood shadow, to listen to his lectures on the art of living, it was more than I could stand.</p>
<p>I stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve got to do,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fontana gazed out in reverie upon his car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I don&#8217;t like baseball,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t decide.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide either. But I&#8217;m sure Conor is a prince among men. <a href="http://letterly.net/TheBestOfJournalism">Subscribe to his Best of Journalism email newsletter</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What America is, to me, is a guy doesn&#8217;t want to buy, you let him not buy, you respect his not buying. A guy has a crazy notion different from your crazy notion, you pat him on the back and say hey, pal, <a href='http://092.me'>nice</a> crazy notion, let&#8217;s go have a beer. America to me should be shouting all the time, a bunch of shouting voices, most of them wrong, some of them nuts, but, please, not just one droning glamorous reasonable voice.</p>
