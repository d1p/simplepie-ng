			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24700" title="chamoun dori" src="http://www.yalibnan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/chamoun-dori-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="138" />National Liberal Party leader MP Dori Chamoun told Al-Liwaa newspaper in remarks published on Monday that Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai’s statements on Syria and Hezbollah’s arms are “a fatal sin.”</p>
<p>“Rai has  abandoned  the Lebanese people’s principles… and the Syrian regime has abandoned the Christians,”<span id="more-29955"></span> Chamoun said. He added that he “was not convinced” by the patriarch’s clarification of his previous statements.</p>
<p>Chamoun commented on a Syrian delegation’s visit to Rai, saying, “The visit came after  Rai  gave them a present they have never dreamed of,” in reference to the patriarch’s pro-Syrian regime statements.</p>
<p>Rai came under fire earlier in September from the opposition March 14 parties but won praise from March 8 politicians for indirectly defending Hezbollah’s arms and linking the party’s arsenal to the termination of Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory and the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland . Even MP Walid Jumblatt who defected from March 14 alliance was very critical of Rai’s statements.</p>
<p>Rai emphasized during a trip to Paris that “only when the international community exerts pressure on Israel to vacate the occupied Lebanese territory ( the Shebaa Farms, Kfar Shouba hills and the Lebanese part of the disputed border village of Ghajar ) and Israel allows Palestinians in Lebanon to return to their homes, can Hezbollah be asked to hand over its arms because they will no longer be needed.”</p>
<p>Rai added that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is “open-minded” and should be given more chances to implement the reforms he already announced.</p>
<p>The patriarch claimed after returning to Lebanon that the remarks he made while in Paris “were taken out of context and have nothing to do” with his personal opinion.</p>
<p>Rai met on Wednesday with a delegation of Syrian religious figures headed by Damascus Mufti Adnan Afyouni.</p>
<p>Rai reiterated his controversial position on Syria and Hezbollah’s arms during a meeting Friday with President Michel Suleiman who is planning to renew his call for rival leaders to engage in national dialogue to end their deep political divisions, sources said.</p>
<p>Assad’s regime has cracked down on a string of unprecedented protests across his country, killing more than 2,700 civilian protesters since the uprising began in March, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p><strong>Aoun</strong><br />
Chamoun also slammed Free Patriotic Movement leader MP Michel Aoun and said that the latter contributed to “the country’s destruction,” adding that Aoun’s “dream is to become president.”</p>
<p><strong>Hezbollah</strong><br />
Asked about Hezbollah, Chamoun said that the Shiite group wants to change the demographics of the country by making it a Shiite one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian forces hunted for insurgents in the central region of Homs Monday to crush armed resistance that is emerging after six months of protests against President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s rule.<span id="more-29953"></span></p>
<p>The crackdown came a day after Syrian opposition groups meeting in Istanbul urged international action to stop what they called indiscriminate killings of civilians by the authorities.</p>
<p>Local activists said a military operation was now focused on Talbiseh near Homs, 94 miles north of Damascus, after security forces entered the nearby town of Rastan, which lies on the highway between the capital and the northern city of Aleppo.</p>
<p>For about a week, tank- and helicopter-backed troops had battled insurgents and army deserters in Rastan, in the most sustained fighting since Syria&#8217;s uprising began in March.</p>
<p>The official Syrian news agency said Saturday government forces had regained control of the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tank fire targeted Talbiseh this morning and communications remain cut. The town was key in supplying Rastan and now it is being punished for that,&#8221; one activist said. &#8220;House to house arrests are continuing in the area for the second day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armed insurgents, mostly in the central Homs region and the northwestern province of Idlib, have been so far outgunned.</p>
<p>While some Assad opponents have taken up arms, others are still staging demonstrations against his 11-year rule. Night protests erupted Sunday in several districts of Homs, where a crowd in the Khalidiya district shouted, &#8220;Homs is free.&#8221;</p>
<p>A surge in sectarian killings has cast a pall of fear over the city. The state news agency said &#8220;armed terrorist groups&#8221; killed five people there Monday. Residents said two bodies had turned up in the city&#8217;s Sunni Qarabid neighborhood.</p>
<p>Homs has a mixed population, with a few Alawite neighborhoods inhabited by members of Assad&#8217;s minority sect, alongside others populated by majority Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p>MUFTI&#8217;S SON ASSASSINATED</p>
<p>Underlining the turn toward violence, the authorities said Sariya Hassoun, the son of Mufti Ahmad Hassoun, Syria&#8217;s state-appointed top cleric, was assassinated in Idlib Sunday.</p>
<p>It was the first attack on the state-backed Sunni clergy who have backed Assad for decades, despite widespread Sunni resentment at Alawite dominance.</p>
<p>As Syria&#8217;s struggle has grown bloodier, claiming at least 2,700 lives so far, according to a U.N. count, demonstrators have begun to demand some form of international protection that stops short of Libya-style Western military intervention.</p>
<p>Assad, 46, who succeeded his father in 2000, blames the violence on foreign-backed armed gangs. His officials say 700 police and soldiers have died, as well as 700 &#8220;mutineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement issued in Istanbul Sunday by a newly formed opposition National Council rejected intervention that &#8220;compromises Syria&#8217;s sovereignty,&#8221; but said the outside world had a humanitarian obligation to protect the Syrian people.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Council demands that international governments and organizations meet their responsibility to support the Syrian people, protect them and stop the crimes and gross human rights violations being committed by the current illegitimate regime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The council said the uprising must remain peaceful but that military assaults, torture and mass arrests were driving Syria &#8220;to the edge of civil war and inviting foreign interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also said the Muslim Brotherhood, the Damascus Declaration &#8212; which groups established opposition figures &#8212; and grassroots activists had all joined the Council.</p>
<p>The Istanbul meeting was a show of unity from a Syrian opposition that has shown little cohesion in six months of mostly peaceful protests against 41 years of Assad family rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Islamists, secular figures and activists on the ground are now on one council is significant,&#8221; a diplomat in Damascus said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they still have to demonstrate they can be politically savvy and able to fill any political vacuum. They need a detailed action plan beyond the generalities of wanting a democratic Syria.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government has dismissed opposition gatherings outside Syria as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife.</p>
<p>The Istanbul declaration was read out by Burhan Ghalioun, a secular academic living in France. He was flanked by Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Riad al-Shaqfa as well as Christian and Kurdish politicians and several longstanding Assad critics.</p>
<p>France has publicly supported the National Council, but it has not yet won endorsement from the United States or from Syria&#8217;s powerful neighbor Turkey, which has been enraged by what it describes as brutal killings of Syrian civilians.</p>
<p>Assad has relied on Russia and China, which have major oil concessions in Syria and do not want to see Western influence in the Middle East spread, to block any U.N. sanctions on Damascus.</p>
<p>European members of the U.N. Security Council are trying to persuade Russia to accept a watered-down resolution that would threaten &#8220;targeted measures&#8221; against Damascus if it fails to end its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, without explicitly threatening U.N. sanctions, Council diplomats said.</p>

Free Patriotic Movement MP Ibrahim Kanaan told former US Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman on December 6, 2006 that FPM leader MP Michel Aoun is “the last person in Lebanon who wants to see Hezbollah’s militia keep its arms,” according to a US diplomatic cable leaked by WikiLeaks.<span id="more-29950"></span></p>
<p>According to the cable, Kanaan said he “understood US skepticism over the FPM&#8217;s relationship with Hezbollah, but declared that Aoun is the last person in Lebanon who wants to see Hezbollah’s militia keep its arms.”</p>
<p>The cable added that Kanaan “asked [the US] to remember where Aoun came from – as former commander of the LAF – and that he [Aoun] more than anyone wants to see the LAF regain its constitutional primacy as the nation&#8217;s sole protector and guarantor of sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Aoun formed an alliance with the Shiite militant group Hezbollah in February 2006 and became March 14’s fierce political rival after boycotting former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora’s government that year.<br />
 Now Lebanon</p>

<p>The Telecommunications Ministry said in September that the decree to lower Internet prices and increase download speeds will become effective as of October 2011.</p>
<p>Sehnaoui will blame Ogero  for  Lebanon’s inability to get higher speed internet , an unnamed source told the daily. </p>

<p>He will request the PM to intervene and resolve the issue with Ogero Director General Abdel Monem Youssef.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.yalibnan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/palestinian-state-194-300x169.jpg" alt="" title="palestinian state 194" width="300" height="169" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29943" />U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Sunday that Israel is becoming increasingly isolated in the Middle East, and said Israeli leaders must restart negotiations with the Palestinians and work to restore relations with Egypt and Turkey.<span id="more-29942"></span></p>
<p>In a blunt assessment made as he was traveling to Israel, Panetta said the ongoing upheaval in the Middle East makes it critical for the Israelis to find ways to communicate with other nations in the region in order to have stability.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much question in my mind that they maintain that (military) edge,&#8221; Panetta told reporters traveling with him. &#8220;But the question you have to ask: Is it enough to maintain a military edge if you&#8217;re isolating yourself in the diplomatic arena? Real security can only be achieved by both a strong diplomatic effort as well as a strong effort to project your military strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panetta is scheduled to meet this week with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and then travel to a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. His visit comes as Mideast negotiators push for a peace deal by the end of next year, amping up pressure for the resumption of long-stalled talks.</p>
<p>The Pentagon chief said Israel risks eroding its own security if it does not reach out to its neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear that at this dramatic time in the Middle East, when there have been so many changes, that it is not a good situation for Israel to become increasingly isolated. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Panetta said the most important thing now is for Israel and its neighbors &#8220;to try to develop better relationships so in the very least they can communicate with each other rather than taking these issues to the streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>His visit comes at a particularly critical and fragile time.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has asked the U.N. Security Council to recognize an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The United States opposed the U.N. bid, saying there is no substitute for direct peace negotiations. But with Israel continuing to build settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, Abbas says there is no point in talking.</p>
<p>Some 500,000 Jewish settlers now live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain, France and other council members are likely to try to hold up consideration of the application while they press for a resumption of long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Negotiators, known as the Quartet, are asking both the Israelis and the Palestinians to produce comprehensive proposals on territory and security within three months.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have welcomed parts of the proposal, but have also expressed concerns about the timetable for some discussions. They also have refused to endorse the 1967 prewar borders as a basis for the future Palestinian state — something President Barack Obama has endorsed.</p>
<p>The Palestinians, meanwhile, have said they won&#8217;t return to talks unless Israel freezes settlement building and accepts the pre-1967 war frontier as a baseline for talks.</p>
<p>The Quartet — the U.S., European Union, United Nations and Russia — is urging both sides to avoid &#8220;provocative actions.&#8221; Just last week, Israel approved the construction of 1,100 new housing units in an area of Jerusalem built on land captured in 1967, a move that drew widespread international condemnation.</p>
<p>Panetta said he wants to stress to both sides that instead of setting conditions or pursuing other approaches, &#8220;the most important thing they can do is go to the negotiating table. That would be a tremendous signal to the world that both the Israelis and the Palestinians want to try to find a solution to these problems. I don&#8217;t think they really lose anything by getting into negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panetta is scheduled to meet with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.</p>
<p>His visit to Israel comes six months after his predecessor, Robert Gates, traveled to the region to meet with Israeli leaders and make the first journey to the West Bank to talk with Fayyad</p>
<p>The U.S. has said it would veto the Palestinians&#8217; U.N. request, despite the high political cost in the Arab world. However, Washington would not need to use its veto if the Palestinians fail to get the support of at least nine of 15 council members. Palestinian officials have said they believe they have eight yes votes, and are lobbying for more support. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.yalibnan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Syria’s-Grand-Mufti-Shiekh-Ahmad-Badreddin-Hassoun-son-Saria-300x183.jpg" alt="" title="Syria’s Grand Mufti Shiekh Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, son Saria" width="300" height="183" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29936" />A son of Syria&#8217;s Grand Mufti Shiekh Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun has been shot dead near Ibla University on Idleb-Aleppo highway, Syria&#8217;s official news agency SANA reported, as Syria.</p>
<p>Earlier, a relative of the grand mufti told Al Arabiya that Saria Hassoun, 22, received two bullets, one on his chest and another on his stomach, and that he was taken to Idleb National Hospital.<span id="more-29932"></span></p>
<p>Hassoun was shot outside the university while he was talking to a professor, who was also killed in the ambush, the relative said.</p>
<p>The official news agency confirmed that an “armed terrorist group killed Professor of History at Aleppo University Dr. Mohammad al-Omar while he was on his way to the university.”</p>
<p>“Dr. al-Omar was accompanied by Saria Hassoun,” the agency added.</p>
<p>SANA also reported that gunmen in Homs killed Chairman of Thoracic Surgery Department at Homs National Hospital Dr. Hassan Eid on Sept. 25th, Engineer Aws Abdel Karim Khalil, a nuclear engineering specialist and charge d&#8217;affaires at al-Baath University on Sept.28, and Deputy Dean of the Architecture Faculty Mohammad Ali Aqil on Sept.26th.</p>
<p>Armed dissidents have targeted a series of suspected regime informers in several cities in an outburst of violence characterized by sectarian vendettas.</p>
<p>After more than six months of peaceful demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria appeared to be going down the path of civil war.</p>
<p>Dozens of soldiers have deserted the military institution, accused of cooperating with the security forces in bloody crackdown against protesters. Deserters have regularly appeared on YouTube videos vowing to protect protesters against the Baathist regime’s brutal forces.</p>
<p>The city of Rastan has seen one of the toughest fights between government forces and armed dissidents. On Saturday, Syrian soldiers finally took control of the city from deserters and gunmen, according to activists.</p>
<p>Communication with the town of 40,000 people, 180 km (110 miles) north of Damascus, was difficult but Abdel-Rahman said a resident who managed to escape early on Saturday reported heavy gunfire throughout the night.</p>
<p>Syria says it is fighting terrorists there. The state news agency said on Friday seven soldiers and police were killed in the operation but had succeeded in inflicting “big losses on the armed terrorist groups.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ghassan Ghosn, President of the Lebanese General Workers Union (CGTL) , headed a delegation to Syria on Sunday and met with Arab Baath Party leader Oussama Odai,  National News Agency reported.<span id="more-29929"></span></p>
<p>Ghosn , a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime   voiced  support for Syrian the government of president Bashar al Assad against the political campaigns and economic pressures that the country is facing, according to the report</p>
<p>The delegation  also condemned the “distracting media campaign that aims to harm Syria and its stance supporting the Resistance,” the report said</p>
<p>The report added that the delegation voiced its confidence that “the Syrian people are able to overcome  the crisis and build a modern Syria.”</p>
<p>Their visit comes after Syria imposed a ban on Lebanese  exports of added value products  that are subject to tariffs of over 5 percent.</p>
<p>The ban  strikes a heavy blow against an already ailing Lebanese export market. The  Lebanese exports to Syria “will be affected in a very big way,” Economist Ghazi Wazneh said  Sunday.</p>
<p>Around 14,000 items will be affected by the ban, including cars, furniture, domestic appliances, clothes and some added value food ( processed ) products .</p>
<p>The processed foods industry in Lebanon will be one of the most hurt sectors, according to Wazneh.</p>
<p>Syria is the only country with which Lebanon shares an open border, making it the only gateway to major trade partners in the region, namely Jordan , Iraq,   Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf states</p>
<p>Wazneh expects industrialists to tackle the problem by seeking out new markets, especially Libya and Egypt, whose industries have declined significantly during the recent turmoil.</p>

<p>Zahle MPs also said that “this unilateral decision contradicts the Arab convention for facilitating trade exchange.”</p>
<p>The bloc called on the Lebanese government to “contact Syrian authorities and address the issue.”</p>
<p>Syria in late September began imposing new limitations on imports coming into the country in an effort to prop up its currency reserves and help domestic industries, according to local reports</p>

<p>“Sometimes  Hezbollah tries to assume  responsibility for protecting Lebanon’s oil wealth other times   it tries to pretend  that its weapons are aimed at protecting coexistence,” Makari said, adding, “Maybe Hezbollah thinks that the May 7 clashes served coexistence.”</p>
<p>He is referring to  May 7, 2008 when Hezbollah pointed its guns against the Lebanese citizens by occupying the mostly Sunni   part of Beirut and by trying to occupy the Druze stronghold of Mt Lebanon</p>
<p>He also  rejected in the interview that “the four people indicted by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) for killing former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri have nothing to do with Hezbollah.”</p>
<p>Makari also said  that “March 14 should   not have attended the parliamentary vote of confidence session  for the cabinet. </p>
<p>Mikati’s cabinet, which is dominated by the Hezbollah-led March 8 coalition, was formed in June and granted parliament&#8217;s vote of confidence on July 7.</p>
<p>Four Hezbollah members have been indicted by the UN-backed STL for the murder of Rafik Hariri. However, the Shiite group strongly denies the charges and refuses to cooperate with the court.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this interview the secretary-general of Syrian Salafist group Al-Muamineen al-Yousharikoun (The Believers Participate), insists that minorities having nothing to fear in a post-Assad Syria...all should be allowed to play a role.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.yalibnan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/christians-muslims.jpg" alt="" title="christians, muslims" width="259" height="194" class="alignright size-full wp-image-29920" />By: Nicholas Blanford </p>
<p>Six months into the uprising against the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the confrontation continues to be defined mainly as one pitting the country’s majority Sunni population against the minority Alawites – adherents of a Shiite offshoot who form the backbone of the regime.</p>
<p>The country’s other sects – the Christians, Druze, Ismaelis – generally have stayed on the sidelines, nervously pondering a future that some fear may echo the sectarian strife that plagued Iraq from 2003.</p>
<p>But Sheikh Louay al-Zouabi, the secretary-general of Syrian Salafist group Al-Muamineen al-Yousharikoun (The Believers Participate), insists that minorities having nothing to fear in a post-Assad Syria and that all should be allowed to play a role.</p>
<p>Still, as a veteran “Arab Afghan” who fought the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, lived in Sudan at the same time as former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, waged jihad in Bosnia in the mid 1990s, and spent six years in a Syrian jail, he has a tough sell ahead of him if he is to convince the skeptics.</p>
<p>The Monitor recently talked with Mr. Zouabi at a safe house in north Lebanon. </p>
<p><em>CSM: Many Syrians, especially those from minority communities, are scared that if the Assad regime falls, the country may slide into sectarian chaos similar to neighboring Iraq. They are worried that the majority Sunni community may not look after their interests once the Baath Party’s secular regime is removed.</em></p>
<p>ZOUABI: What I am trying to do is to stand up and talk to the entire world. Yes, I have been to Afghanistan and Bosnia and that means that I am accused of being a radical. The Assad regime is trying to scare the West [by saying] that we want to be the masters of Syria. This is not true. We are willing to share power with everyone – Druze, Alawite, Shia, Sunni, Kurds, Christians. It is not true what the regime is saying about us. Let the whole world know that Bashar al-Assad is lying. We are not hard-liners. </p>
<p><em>CSM: But you admit that you fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, where you knew many of Osama bin Laden’s key lieutenants, and that you fought in Bosnia in the mid 1990s. Surely you face a tough sell to persuade minority sects in Syria that you are not a militant Islamist.</em></p>
<p>ZOUABI: I am a salafist, but that is not the same as being Al Qaeda. My views as a salafist are not the same as those of Al Qaeda… I am [like] Al Qaeda except [the difference is] that I am willing to talk [to Christians] and I oppose the killing of innocents. I don’t want to attack any group, whether they are Islamic or not. </p>
<p><em>CSM: Where do you stand on the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and the resistance against coalition forces in Iraq?<br />
</em><br />
ZOUABI: I did not support the Sept. 11 attacks. We don’t want to kill any civilians. This was the difference between us and Al Qaeda. The Iraqi jihad was justified because it was [against] an occupation. I am willing to be friendly with every country, but not with an occupier. We supported the resistance in Iraq, but not the killing of civilians. I met with American officials and I told them that I could be their enemy in Iraq because of the occupation but I could be their friend in Syria when they come as visitors. </p>
<p><em>CSM: Salafism practices an austere version of Islam and traditionally views other sects, including Shiite Muslims as apostates. Why do you now say that you are not only willing to talk and cooperate with other sects but to treat them as brothers?</em></p>
<p>ZOUABI: Before one year ago I would have seen you and thought &#8220;infidel.&#8221; But in the past year, we have studied the Quran closely and reinterpreted some of the verses and have come up with new views. We believe that everyone is equal like brothers. The Christians especially are closest to Muslims.</p>
<p>CSM: The alliance between Syria and Iran, which includes groups like the militant Shiite Hezbollah of Lebanon and Palestinian Hamas, has endured for 30 years and has grown even stronger in the past decade. The removal of the Assad regime threatens to break that alliance, which will have major consequences on the dynamics of the Middle East, particularly in relation to the confrontation with Israel. Do you believe that a future post-Assad administration in Damascus will continue to observe that relationship with Tehran?</p>
<p>ZOUABI: There is no way that we can have a relationship with the current government in Iran. If there is a new regime in Tehran, then maybe. But with Hezbollah there is no chance [of a relationship]. Our No. 1 enemy is [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei [the supreme leader of Iran] and the Iranian regime. Not the Iranian people, just the regime. Our second enemy is Hezbollah. Our third enemy is the regime of Bashar al-Assad. </p>
<p><em>CSM: Bashar al-Assad is third? But your struggle is directly against the Assad regime, not Iran and Hezbollah.<br />
</em><br />
ZOUABI: Assad is third because it is natural for him to want to kill me because I am trying to overthrow him. But why do Iran and Hezbollah want me dead? What have I done to them? In 2006 [during the month-long war between Hezbollah and Israel], we welcomed the Hezbollah people [who fled to Syria from south Lebanon] and gave them food, blankets, shelter. We never did anything against them. We gave them everything they needed in 2006, but now they have turned against us. We consider the Iranians traitors because they have taken the side of Bashar al-Assad. </p>
<p><em>CSM: After six months of protests, Assad is still in power and it seems that the peaceful protest movement is not gaining sufficient traction to topple the regime. There are increasing reports of the opposition taking up weapons and fighting back and army deserters have formed the Free Syrian Army. Many analysts and diplomats predict that the confrontation against the Assad regime will soon become an armed struggle which could lead to civil war.</em></p>
<p>ZOUABI: Until now we have not issued a fatwa[religious ruling] allowing civilians to shoot, but we have issued a fatwa allowing soldiers [who have deserted] to use weapons to protect civilians. We are asking for the international community to intercede because we are dealing with a regime that shows no mercy, no religion, and no sympathy.</p>
<p>CSM: But the international community has all but ruled out a Libya-style intervention.</p>
<p>ZOUABI: A lack of an international intervention will cause a lot of bloodshed. There will be massacres in Syria.</p>
<p>CSM: That means there will be an armed confrontation.</p>
<p>ZOUABI: For sure. That is why we are working on receiving arms and we hope that international parties will get the message and start providing weapons for us soon. We will not fight as Islamists but as Syrians – Christians, Shiites, Sunnis – all together.</p>
