			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Jersey Devils have now wrapped up their preseason games and despite not neccessarily getting the preferred results, they are closer to having their roster set for Opening Night.  The first cuts came last week when they &#8220;cut&#8221; 19 players, sending five players to their junior team and 14 to their AHL affiliate in Albany.  None of the 19 can be considered the slightest surprise, even though a few of them like Brandon Burlon or Eric Gelinas may have a promising future ahead of them, it just won&#8217;t be this season, at least at the NHL level.</p>
<p>The more difficult cuts are coming shortly.  However, I think it&#8217;s becoming pretty clear which players are going to make it to the final roster of 23, so I will give a quick breakdown on whom I would keep on the final 23-man roster when it is completed in the next few days.  The original 41-man roster is found <a title="Training camp roster left at 41" href="http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/devils_send_14_to_albany_of_ahl_trim_roster_to_41/">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Goaltending</span>:  Barring an injury in the next few days, this is as easy as it gets.  The great Martin Brodeur will be the starter and Johan &#8220;Moose&#8221; Hedberg will be the backup.  Head coach Peter DeBoer will have to work on the breakout of starts between the two, which will obviously be impacted by how well they are playing and how healthy they both are, but my guess for now is Brodeur will get about 70% of the starts assuming he stays healthy.  Keith Kinkaid and Jeff Frazee are headed to Albany to work on their game.  <em>2 roster spots:  Brodeur, Hedberg</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Defense</span>:  Probably the most interesting battles in training camp have taken place on the blueline, where both vets and youngsters have been asked to fight for spots.  Coming into camp, the only givens were Anton Volchenkov, Andy Greene and Henrik Tallinder.  Bryce Salvador had the inside track on the fourth spot, but is coming off of missing an entire season recovering from a concussion.  The fifth spot seems <a title="Larsson likely to be on Devils roster" href="http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/deboer_talking_like_larsson_will_be_on_devils_nhl_roster/">ticketed for Adam Larsson</a>, the recent number one draft pick (#4 overall) of the Devils.  That leaves the sixth and seventh spots to be sorted out amongst the likes of Mark Fayne, Matt Taormina, Anton Stralman, Peter Harrold, Matthew Corrente, Mark Fraser, Alexander Urbom and Jay Leach.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easy to rule out Leach who is ticketed for Albany.  Taormina&#8217;s injury seems to have eliminated him from the Opening Day roster, and Peter Harrold doesn&#8217;t seem to be an NHL defenseman.  Alexander Urbom was originally all but ruled out, but his play in the past two preseason games definitely made Coach DeBoer take notice.  While I don&#8217;t see him making the team, I think he likely will be the candidate to get the first recall in the case of an injury, assuming his play is strong at Albany.</p>
<p>The last regular spot in the regular lineup is likely to be decided between Fayne and Stralman.  The seventh spot is likely to be decided between Stralman (if he loses out to Fayne), Corrente and Fraser.  I think the Devils will ultimately choose Fayne for the sixth spot and Fraser for the bench.  7 <em>roster spots:  Volchenkov, Greene,  Salvador, Tallinder, Larsson, Fayne, Fraser</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Forwards</span>:  While I don&#8217;t picture this group to be quite as competitive as the defense position, but there definitely were some spots to sort out.  The obvious candidates that will undoubtedly make the team include Zach Parise, Patrik Elias, Ilya Kovalchuk, Dainius Zubrus, Jacob Josefson, Mattias Tedenby, Nick Palmieri and David Clarkson.  Travis Zajac would be in this group, but he will be starting the season on injured reserve with a torn Achilles injury.  With Zajac out, that leaves room for six other forwards to fill out the initial 23-man roster.</p>
<p>Others like Matt Anderson, Stephen Gionta, Tim Sestito, Chad Wiseman and Steve Zalewiski are definitely ticketed for the AHL.  These guys will provide some depth for the organization but are the equivalent of a &#8220;4A&#8221; type of player in baseball, where you might produce in the minors, and even put up good statistics, but for whatever reason, it will never translate to success at the NHL level.</p>
<p>The remaining ten forwards fighting for those elusive six spots include tryouts like Steve Bernier, Brad Mills, Petr Sykora and Stephane Veilleux, free agent signings like Eric Boulton and Cam Janssen, a youngster like Adam Henrique and returning vets like Rod Pelley, David Steckel and Vladimir Zharkov.  Bernier is best known for being the draft pick preceding Zach Parise in the legendary <a title="2003 NHL Entry Draft" href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/draft/nhl2003e.html">2003 Entry Draft</a>.  While it may not be fair to compare him to Parise, Bernier does offer size and some skill, but ultimately, I don&#8217;t see him making the team out of camp.  I think either way he could be in a position to contribute at some point.</p>
<p>Stephane Veilleux is a player who also can add the dimension of more size, but I think ultimately he just doesn&#8217;t bring enough to the table that he will earn a roster spot.  Petr Sykora has been one of the stars in camp, starting with the intrasquad scrimmage hat trick.  His past chemistry with Patrik Elias seems to make him a sure bet to get signed to a contract. </p>
<p>Brad Mills is an interesting case, as he has brought a lot during training camp, bringing energy and an edge to his game.  I think Coach DeBoer wants to keep Mills, it&#8217;s just a matter of how the numbers play out. </p>
<p>Cam Janssen is also a likely candidate to be sent down to Albany due to his two-way contract.  He could easily see the roster at times throughout the year when the physical game is needed, but I can&#8217;t see him making the team to start.  Eric Boulton is signed to a one-way deal and can fill that role pretty well, so I think Boulton will see the roster Opening Night.</p>
<p>Adam Henrique is likely the player who received the biggest opportunity from Zajac&#8217;s injury and seems to be in the mix for Opening Night.  Henrique came into camp and has shown his ability to make plays, while also having the flexibility to play both center and wing, and is very responsible on the defensive side, making him a perfect candidate to be a Devil.  I don&#8217;t see him not making the roster but he will need to play at a high level to stay with the team all season.</p>
<p>Guys like David Steckel and Rod Pelley do not seem like they will lose their roster spots from last year, but will need to play at a high level to stay not only in the lineup, but on the roster. That leaves the last forward down to Vladmir Zharkov and Brad Mills.  I think I would keep Zharkov, but feel like the Devils want to keep Mills.  <em>15 roster spots:  Parise, Elias, Kovalchuk, Zubrus, Josefson, Tedenby, Palmieri, Clarkson, Sykora, Henrique, Boulton, Steckel, Pelley, Zharkov and Zajac (IR)</em></p>
<p>For Opening Night against the Flyers on October 8th, this is how I would assemble the team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Brodeur in net with Johan Hedberg backing him up</li>
<li>Defense:  Adam Larsson-Henrik Tallinder, Bryce Salvador-Mark Fayne, Andy Greene-Anton Volchenkov, Mark Fraser on bench</li>
<li>Forwards:  Zach Parise-Patrik Elias-Petr Sykora, Ilya Kovalchuk-Dainius Zubrus-Nick Palmieri, Adam Henrique-Jacob Josefson-Mattias Tedenby, Eric Boulton-David Steckel-David Clarkson, with Rod Pelley and Vladmir Zharkov on the bench</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d toy around with mixing and matching the following combinations of players (Zubrus/Josefson), (Henrique/Tedenby/Clarkson), (Zubrus/Sykora) to see what will garner chemistry, but that&#8217;s what I would start with.</p>
<p><em>(NOTE/UPDATE:  It came out earlier today that the Devils placed both Fraser and Zharkov on waivers, so while I was wrong, I still think in the case of Zharkov, I would&#8217;ve kept him over Mills and think Zharkov is definitely a candidate to be swooped up by another team during the waivers process).</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_39037" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 394px"><img class="size-full wp-image-39037  " src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gustavnyquist.jpg" alt=" Gustav Nyquist" width="384" height="288" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Wings rookie Gustav Nyquist (pictured as a member of the NCAA&#039;s Maine Black Bears) was one of the prospects that stood out this preseason.

<p>The Detroit Red Wings clinched a &#8220;hat trick&#8221; for Detroit sports on home ice this evening: The Lions came all the way back from a 27-3 deficit to beat the Cowboys in Dallas; the Tigers evened the ALDS series at one game each against the New York Yankees at the Bronx; and the Red Wings made it a sweep as they beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-2 at the Joe Louis Arena.</p>
<p>Detroit sports fans should thank rookie Gustav Nyquist for the win.  He scored two goals (including the deciding goal) and added an assist.  He was the best player on the ice tonight.  It&#8217;s more than certain that he will start the season in Grand Rapids to play with the Griffins.  He was very impressive in the preseason and if he plays like has has been the last two weeks, we&#8217;ll see him with the big club in the not too distant future. With his array of talent and his awareness on the ice, he&#8217;ll be a top 6 forward down the road.</p>
<p>Other contributors to tonight&#8217;s win were Johan Franzen (one goal, two assists), Todd Bertuzzi (two assists) and Jimmy Howard, who recorded the win as he made 25 saves.  Patrick Eaves didn&#8217;t return to the ice after he sustained a lower body injury in the first period when he blocked a Steve Sullivan shot with his right knee.  His status at this time is uncertain.</p>
<p>Because of a lack of open roster spots, Fabian Brunnstrom will be granted an NHL contract with the team and Cory Emmerton will likely stick with the Red Wings.  If Emmerton were to be sent down to Grand Rapids, he&#8217;ll be placed on waivers and another NHL team will very likely claim him and the Red Wings won&#8217;t receive any compensation.  It would be wise for the Red Wings to keep him on the roster.</p>
<p>The Red Wings finished the preseason with a 4-3-1 record and will start the regular season this Friday at the JLA as they host the Ottawa Senators. And they will see a familiar face behind the Sens&#8217; bench—former Red Wing assistant coach Paul MacLean left the team this summer to become the Senators head coach.  This is his first head-coaching job.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow!</p>
<p>That is all that you can say after Craig Smith displayed an amazing amount of grit and determination to score the OT winner for the Predators with 10.3 seconds remaining to give the Predators a 2-1 win over the visiting Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p>This was the final pre-season game for both teams, and the Predators showed a bit of the wear from playing the night before in Winnipeg, as the first period seemed a bit disjointed for the home team. The Predators also played this game without Shea Weber and Ryan Suter on the blue line, which affected chemistry a bit on the back end but gave some of the young guys plenty of ice time.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts after this contest tonight:</p>
<p>If you had to make a call between Ryan Ellis and Mattias Ekholm making the final roster, I would go with Ekholm. Both of these players have good presence on the ice and good hockey sense. I give the edge to Ekholm because of his physical prowess. He is a big body- 6&#8217;4&#8243; and 204 pounds- that handles the puck well and makes good decisions with the puck. He is not afraid to shoot as evidenced by his 9 SOG in the contest. I think that his ability to match up with bigger forwards is the deciding factor for the coaching staff.</p>
<p>Patric Hornqvist is his usual agitating self, flying around the crease and creating havoc. Hornqvist tallied the tying goal on the power play in the third period. Hornqvist takes a beating, but there is no quit in his game, and his net presence is going to be critical for the Predators.</p>
<p>The player that has stood out to me in this pre-season has been Jordin Tootoo. His puck handling ability has gotten better, but more importantly, he is making good decisions on the ice both with and without the puck. He still has his ability to hit- witness the obliteration of Jaarku Ruutu at the Canes blue line- but he is picking his spots to bring the physical presence. His confidence with the puck is noticeable and his ability to handle the puck in traffic is much needed by this team.</p>
<p>The injury to Blake Geoffrion set him back. I think he starts the season in Milwaukee in an effort to get his game back to where it needs to be. Tonight, he was a non-factor.</p>
<p>Back to Craig Smith. His ability to handle the puck and his willingness to shoot are assets this team needs. I think he makes the roster, especially with Mike Fisher still recovering from his shoulder injury. Smith has a jump to his game that  I like, and in the overtime, he showed that he can carry his line. The experience, or lack thereof, at the NHL level are going to be limiting factors, but he has tremendous upside.</p>
<p>I liked the game from Kevin Klein. He has been much maligned, but pairing him with Jonathan Blum is good for him, and I believe that they will be a solid tandem for the Predators. Klein was often victimized by his former defense partner&#8217;s mistakes ( I will leave it to the readers to guess who that was), and yes, he was not above making an egregious mistake at least once a game. I think this season will be a good one for Klein and Predator fans will see the emergence of a solid defenseman.</p>
<p>I liked the creativity of the forwards. Long time Predator fans can remember when we had a difficult time making a clean pass among the forwards. The group on the ice tonight made good passes and created chances and showed a good bit of creativity in the offensive zone. This will bring good results for this team if this continues throughout the season.</p>
<p>I like the game of Gabriel Bourque. He will start the year in Milwaukee, but this is a talented youngster that is strong on the puck and not afraid to be physical. Look for him to return to Nashville, especially if injuries mount during the season.</p>
<p>The final regular season roster will be set by the coaching staff this week. I think the forwards will be an easy decision for the coaching staff. The blue line will be interesting. Also worth watching is any moves that GM David Poile may make once the teams around the League trim their rosters.</p>
<p>The pre-season is the pre-season, and while it is nice to finish 7-1, the real work starts Thursday. The Predators are a team that can make some noise and are one that should be fun to watch.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>When you think of a Red Wing who had a three-point night, the typical names that come to mind would be Pavel Datsyuk or Henrik Zetterberg,  but neither were in the lineup tonight at the Air Canada Centre.</p>
<p>Members of the current version of  the &#8220;Grind Line,&#8221; Darren Helm and Patrick Eaves were the offensive catalysts tonight as they each had a goal and two assists as they led the Detroit Red Wings to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2.  Their linemates who split time on the third line with Helm and Eaves, Justin Abdelkader and Drew Miller, each contributed (Abdelkader – one goal; Miller – one assist).  Niklas Kronwall also helped the team&#8217;s cause with two assists in the win.</p>
<p>The Red Wings opened the scoring on the power play as Helm used his blazing speed to fend off Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski.  Helm&#8217;s shot from in close was stopped by Leafs goalie James Reimer—but, Abdelkader put home the rebound.  Helm extended the lead to 2-0 as he scored on a wrap-around, which was on another power play.</p>
<p>The Leafs got on the board as Grabovski won the ensuing face-off on the power play and got the puck to Nikolai Kumenin, who passed it over to newly acquired John-Michael Liles, who then ripped a shot past Red Wing goalie Ty Conklin to make it 2-1.  The Red Wings made it 3-1 as Patrick Eaves scored on a backhand. Joey Crabb scored the other goal for the Leafs, but that was all they could muster tonight.  The Red Wings closed the scoring at 4-2 as Tomas Tatar got the puck off of another save by Reimer, but Tatar got the rebound to put it in the back of the net.</p>
<p>Conklin stopped 20 shots for the win while Reimer stopped 22 shots in the loss.  Conklin perfomed very well tonight.  He was fundamentally sound against the Leafs and made the save of the game as he stopped Leafs center Phil Kessel on a breakaway.</p>
<p>The majority of the Red Wings lineup a combination of key depth players, top players of the Grand Rapids Griffins and the backup goalie.  They played like it was a regular season game and they played the typical puck possession game.  Several players from tonight&#8217;s lineup will be sent down to Grand Rapids but I&#8217;ve a feeling that Helm, Miller and Conklin will crack the regular season roster (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).</p>
<p>The Fabian Brunnstrom watch continued tonight, but he was less effective. The lowlight for him (and probably the entire preseason) was when he was called for tripping while the Red Wings were 31 seconds into their sixth power play.  He tripped the Leafs forward while the opposing player was in a one-on-three attack.  He played neither good nor bad, but it was a careless penalty and it wasn&#8217;t a good time to go the penalty box, especially if you&#8217;re playing for an NHL contract.</p>
<p>The Red Wings close out the exhibition season tomorrow night at the Joe Louis Arena as they host the Pittsburgh Penguins.  This is their final tune-up for the season opener next Friday as they host the Ottawa Senators.</p>

<p>Last night at the Joe Louis Arena,the Detroit Red Wings had the home ice advantage, but so did the Toronto Maple Leafs.  A large base of the Leaf Nation were on hand and they didn&#8217;t leave disappointed as Mike Komisarek scored 2:21 in the extra period as the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings 4-3 in overtime.  There were plenty of &#8220;Lets Go Red Wings&#8221; chants that were quickly echoed by &#8220;Go Leafs Go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Maple Leafs went ahead 2-0 early in the second period with goals by Jake Gardiner and Mike Brown.  It seemed to wake up the Red Wings as they fired on all cylinders.  They peppered Maple Leafs goalie Jonas Gustavsson with shots, but they finally got on the board with a power play goal by Todd Bertuzzi as Nicklas Lidstrom fired a shot at Gustavsson from the left face off circle and Bertuzzi scored on the rebound.  The Red Wings tied the game at 16:01 when rookie Gustav Nyquist scored as he got the puck out from the boards and skated way from Maple Leafs center Mikhail Grabovski, hitting a wrist shot for the 2-2 tie.</p>
<p>The Red Wings took that momentum to the third period and went ahead 3-2 as Henrik Zetterberg recovered the puck on a Komisarek turnover and tossed a no-look pass to Johan Franzen, who one-timed it for the lead that didn&#8217;t last long.  The Maple Leafs tied it 65 seconds later as Mike Brown scored his second goal of the game as he squeaked a shot throught Red Wing goalie Jimmy Howard&#8217;s arm for a 3-3 tie.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the third period, Maple Leaf forward Clark MacArthur delivered a hit to the head of  Red Wing forward Justin Abdelkader.  Both players did go to the penalty box.  MacArthur was suspended for the rest of the preseason and the first two games of the regular season.</p>
<p>In the extra period, an open Komisarek fired a wrist shot past Howard to end the game and send the Leaf Nation celebrating on Civic Center Drive and Jefferson Avenue.</p>
<p>It was an entertaining game for both fans of the Red Wings and Maple Leafs.  It&#8217;s not that often that the Maple Leafs come to the JLA, but it&#8217;s a big event whether it&#8217;s preseason or the regular season that these two teams meet.  The game-winning goal could have been prevented as Ian White and Justin Abdelkader missed their assignments.  Howard looked decent despite making 15 saves on 19 shots.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet heard of the name Gustav Nyquist, you&#8217;ll be hearing his name more often now.  I did mention in my last blog that he could be sent down to Grand Rapids for more seasoning, but he&#8217;s making that decision tough for Red Wing head coach Mike Babcock and the rest of the coaching staff.  Nyquist, Cory Emmerton, and Fabian Brunnstrom have been bright spots this preseason.  Emmerton did reflect a Mike Brown shot in the second period, but other than that he&#8217;s fared well the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a good Friday for defenseman Brendan Smith.  He was suspened for the rest of the preseason and the first five games of the regular season for his hit to Ben Smith this past Wedsnesday.  Smith was also sent down to Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>Both teams will take the Highway 401 to the Air Canada Centre as they will face off in the preseason rematch later tonight.  The next time the two Original Six teams play each other in the regular season will be January 7 in Toronto.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night, in the final Pre-Season game of 2011 at the TD Garden, the Boston Bruins fell to the visiting Ottawa Senators, 2-1.  It was the Bruins who would get on the board first, when Milan Lucic scored Boston&#8217;s 6th Power-Play goal in 4 games. Good puck possession, in the offensive zone from Boston&#8217;s 2nd line, of Rich Peverley, Patrice Bergeron, and Brad Marchand lead to the Senators&#8221; Zenon Konopka taking a hooking penalty.  Soon after, Boston&#8217;s top line was able to formulate some beautiful triangle offense, that was capped off by Lucic tapping home a feed from David Krecji.</p>
<p>The Bruins carried the play for most of the night, even out-shooting the Senators 40-20, over the course of three periods. For most of the night, it looked as if Ottawa was a tired team, and if the Bruins could manage to put a few more passed Ottawa goalie Craig Anderson, the Senators would simply cave. However, at 5:10 of the 3rd period, it was the long-time Senators&#8217; captain Daniel Alfredsson who tied the game, off of a nice feed from behind the net by former Cornell University star, Colin Greening. Unfortunately for the Bruins, in a game that had 11 penalties called, it was Boston who ended up with the last one, when Rich Peverley took a 4-minute double-minor for high-sticking at 15:02 of the 3rd period.  A mere :57 seconds into the extended Ottawa Power-Play, Senators&#8217; rookie defenseman David Rundblad blasted a slap-shot from the left point that deflected off the skate of  B&#8217;s defender Adam McQuaid, and past Tim Thomas, to put Ottawa ahead 2-1. Boston would go on to kill the 2nd half of Peverley&#8217;s penalty, but ultimately were not able to solve Senators&#8217; goaltender Craig Anderson for a 2nd time.</p>
<p>As is the case with all pre-season games, the result is not important. The Bruins very evidently out-played Ottawa for most of the night, but were simply stymied by goaltender Craig Anderson. Perhaps a bigger loss for the Bruins, on Thursday evening, was that of the injury suffered by young defenseman Steven Kampfer. Kampfer, who scored 5 goals, and added 5 assists in 38 games with the Bruins last season, went down in the 3rd period with an apparent leg injury after a collision with an Ottawa forward. After a Friday morning MRI, it was revealed that Kampfer has suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee. Lucky for Boston, the injury is only expected to keep Kampfer out of action for 2-4 weeks. That comes as fantastic news, as after watching the play, it appeared as if the injury had the potential to be much more serious. Unfortunately for Kampfer this is already the 3rd injury in his brief NHL career. On March 3, Kampfer suffered a mild concussion after taking a hit during the Bruins&#8217; 2-1 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. Then, on April 9, while playing for the AHL&#8217;s Providence Bruins, he suffered a minor injury to his right knee, which would keep him out for the entire 2011 playoffs. Hopefully for Kampfer, he is able to recover quickly and get back into the Bruins&#8217; line-up. In the meantime, it will be former Ohio State University defenseman Matt Bartkowski, who will fill in the 7th spot on Boston&#8217;s blue line. Bartkowski appeared in 6 NHL contests with the B&#8217;s last season, scoring 0 points, with 4 PIMs and a plus/minus of -1.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></em></p>
<p>In their final pre-season tune-up of the year, the Bruins will travel to Bridgeport, CT on Saturday night, to take on the New York Islanders at the Webster Bank Arena. Tomorrow night&#8217;s line-up has not yet been released, but with 28 players still in camp, at least a few more cuts should be expected, following the conclusion of the game. With the Bruins set to embark on their annual team-building trip early on Sunday morning, it seems as if the roster will be trimmed down to 23 or less, immediately after Saturday&#8217;s game. Currently, there are 18 forwards, 7 defensemen, and 3 goalies on the roster.<br />

<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8uDQSMPXeyw/ToVD9Jwqy8I/AAAAAAAABiQ/Qo1OMKbIc3k/s1600/doughty%2B-%2Bsurvived%2B550%2Bsized.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8uDQSMPXeyw/ToVD9Jwqy8I/AAAAAAAABiQ/Qo1OMKbIc3k/s1600/doughty%2B-%2Bsurvived%2B550%2Bsized.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>If the summer long drama between the Los Angeles Kings and defenseman <a href="http://kings.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8474563">Drew Doughty</a> has been resolved with an &#8216;all&#8217;s well that ends well&#8217; solution, we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>
<p>The primary fact at the moment though is that a contract has been agreed upon and he&#8217;ll be rejoining his teammates soon, as they prepare for what many expect to be a big year for the Kings.</p>
<p>Doughty is set to receive $7 million per season for the next years.  That&#8217;s slightly more than the $6.8 million <a href="http://kings.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8471685">Anze Kopitar</a> is under contract for and pushes Doughty&#8217;s potential free agent years out a bit.  Thus, it appears to be a win-win for both sides.</p>
<p>There are still many questions to be answered &#8211; like when will he practice, when will he play his first game, etc.?  Most importantly though, he&#8217;ll be in the line-up next Friday when the Kings open the season against the New York Rangers in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Doughty was originally selected by the Kings with the number two overall pick in the 2008 NHL Draft.  At the time, he was coming off of being named the Ontario Hockey League’s Defenseman of the Year.  He played for the Guelph Storm in the OHL, the same team as Kings&#8217; captain <a href="http://kings.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470606">Dustin Brown</a>&nbsp;(they missed each other by a few years there, with Doughty arriving two years after Brown had moved on).</p>
<p>He has since gone on to win a gold medal with Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics, was nominated for the Norris Trophy (best defeseman) the same year and was selected to the NHL’s All-Rookie Team at the conclusion of the 2008-09 season.</p>
<p>The 21-year old native of London, Ontario has also received several awards &#8211; including being named the Kings Outstanding Defenseman for three straight seasons (2011, 2010, and 2009) and he was voted as the Kings Best Newcomer (Mark Bavis Memorial Award) following his first year with the club (2009).</p>
<p>Last season he led the team in minutes played (25:38) and was tops among all Kings defensemen with 11 goals.</p>
<p>In 239 regular season games in his young NHL career, he&#8217;s recorded 126 points (33 goals, 93 assists).  He&#8217;s also recorded 11 points (5g, 6a) in post-season games with the Kings.</p>
<p>Will Doughty be making an appearance at Frozen Fury this weekend?</p>
<p>According to Helene Elliott of the LA Times, Doughty says he thinks he can play as soon as the team asks him to &#8211; including this weekend.  &#8220;I think I&#8217;m in great shape,&#8221; said Doughty.  From various reports, it appears he&#8217;ll be leaving for LA soon to complete a physical officially sign the deal.</p>
<p>Goalie Jonathan Quick wasted no time thumbing out the following tweet upon the news being released tonight &#8211; &#8216;Congrats to drew doughty on his new deal, who&#8217;s pickin the restaurant? #thanksdewey #surfnturf&#8217;</p>
<p>For the first time in months, Kings GM <a href="http://kings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=41315">Dean Lombardi</a> is probably going to sleep like a baby.  Mission accomplished &#8211; he now starts the year with the best Kings roster in team history.</p>
<p>More information will be posted on www.MayorsManor.com as it becomes available.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also have live reports and updates all weekend long from the Kings-Avalanche game in Las Vegas &#8211; follow along on twitter and facebook.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Bruins faced off against the rival Canadiens for the second straight night. This time, the game would be at Montreal&#8217;s home arena, the Bell Centre. Coming off a strong performance the night before, in a 7-3 victory against the Habs, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Bruins were looking for the 2-game sweep, as they took the ice on Monday.</p>
<p>In goal, it was a battle between Canadiens&#8217; star net-minder, Carey Price and Bruins&#8217; young back-up Tuukka Rask. The game started off slow for both teams, as good offensive scoring chances were hard to find, as the two squads played to a scoreless tie, after 20 minutes of action. Towards the end of the 2nd period, it was Montreal who would break through first, when Michael Cammalleri beat Rask off a beautiful feed from Habs&#8217; rookie Phil DeSimone.</p>
<p>Early in the 3rd, it was DeSimone who would go to the penalty box for holding, to put the B&#8217;s on their second power-play of the night. Shortly after DeSimone went to the box, Bruins&#8217; forward Tyler Seguin jammed home a rebound off a shot by rookie Jordan Caron, to tie the game at 1. This was Seguin&#8217;s 2nd goal of the 2011 pre-season. Quickly following this, Montreal Defenseman Jaroslav Spacek was sent to the penalty-box for high-sticking, at 11:12 of the 3rd.  The Habs were able to successfully kill off that Boston power-play, but a mere 3 seconds after Spacek was released from the box, Bruins&#8217; veteran Chris Clark knocked home his 1st goal of the pre-season, to put the B&#8217;s ahead, 2-1. At 18:01 of the third, Bruins&#8217; center Chris Kelly took a penalty for interference, which would put Boston on the Penalty-Kill for the remainder of regulation. Ultimately, the Bruins were able to hold on for the 2-1 victory, thanks to a strong 31-save performance from their young Finnish goaltender, Tuukka Rask. The victory improves Boston&#8217;s 2011 pre-season record to 3-0-1 , with 2 games left to play.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></em></p>
<p>The B&#8217;s will now return home for their final pre-season home game, against the visiting Ottawa Senators. The Senators (who defeated the Bruins 2-1 in OT, last Wednesday, up in Ottawa) appear to be bringing along a strong line-up tonight, reportedly  including former Hockey East stars, Stephane DaCosta (Merrimack) and Bobby Butler (University Of New Hampshire). Long-time Sens captain Daniel Alfredsson, former 90-point center Jason Spezza, and 2011 first round draft choice Mika Zibanejad are also rumored to be on the ice for Ottawa, this evening.  The most notable absence, from the Ottawa line-up is the team&#8217;s budding star on defense, Erik Karlsson.</p>
<p>According to this morning&#8217;s skate, at the TD Garden, tonight&#8217;s Bruins line-up appears like this:</p>
<p><strong>FORWARDS</strong></p>
<p>Lucic&#8211;Krecji&#8211;Horton</p>
<p>Marchand&#8211;Bergeron&#8211;Peverley</p>
<p>Pouliot&#8211;Kelly&#8211;Caron</p>
<p>Paille&#8211;Campbell&#8211;Clark</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSE</strong></p>
<p>Chara&#8211;Kampfer</p>
<p>Ference&#8211;Corvo</p>
<p>Bartkowski&#8211;McQuaid</p>
<p><strong>GOALTENDER</strong></p>
<p>Thomas</p>
<p>Rask</p>
<p>Noticeably absent from tonight&#8217;s line-up are defensemen Dennis Seidenberg and Johnny Boychuk, as well as young forward Tyler Seguin. Other scratches include forwards Max Sauve, Shawn Thornton and Lane MacDermid and goaltender Anton Khudobin. Tonight also marks the first time the Bruins&#8217; 2010-11 first line, of Krecji, Lucic &amp; Horton will be on the ice together, since Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. Tim Thomas and Craig Anderson are both expected to play the full 60 minutes, between the pipes tonight. Tonight will also be Paul MacLean&#8217;s Garden debut, as coach of the Ottawa Senators. The game can be heard on 98.5 The Sports Hub, the official radio home of the Boston Bruins. Also, tonight is the first locally televised game of the pre-season for Boston, as the game can be seen on NESN, beginning at 7 PM.</p>
<p>After tonight, the Bruins will travel to Bridgeport, CT for their final exhibition match of the 2011 Pre-season, to take on the New York Islanders.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Red Wing Marian Hossa scored the deciding goal at 8:58 of the third period on a 5 on 3 power play as the Chicago Blackhawks clip the Detroit Red Wings 4-3 in Chicago.  The two teams evened the preseason series one game each.  It doesn&#8217;t matter now, but it will starting next week as the regular season begins.</p>
<p>Tonight the Blackhawks played their top players Patrick Kane (1 goal, 1 assist), Jonathan Towes (2 assists) and Duncan Keith (3 assists), as well as Corey Crawford, who&#8217;s looking to avoid the sophomore jinx and made 17 saves for the win.  Ben Smith and Brent Seabrook also scored for the home team.</p>
<p>While Red Wing head coach Mike Babcock decided to hold out his top skaters, he penciled in the depth players and prospects.  He wanted to see what they could bring to the table.</p>
<p>Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard didn&#8217;t play for the second consecutive night as Ty Conklin played all 60 minutes and made 20 saves in the loss.</p>
<p>Fabian Brunnstrom, who is fighting for an NHL contract, is making his case as he scored two goals for the Red Wings.  Right now, he&#8217;s one of the leading candidates for one of the final open roster spots.  While Brunnstrom may have locked up his spot, others were pleading their cases.  Cory Emmerton had two assists and finished the night with a team best plus/minus of +2.  Brendan Smith also had two assists and drew a 5-minute match penalty.  Smith leveled Ben Smith (no relation) in the head with his shoulder and that led to the ensuing 5 on 3 power play, which Hossa scored. Gustav Nyquist, who is a dark horse on making the regular season roster,had one assist and a plus/minus of +1. He could benefit from a season in Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>The Red Wings next home preseason game is this Friday as they host the Toronto Maple Leafs. Yes, there will be &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Red Wings&#8221; chants, but the Leaf Nation will be coming from the opposite side of the border and respond with &#8220;Go Leafs Go.&#8221;  Even though it&#8217;s an exhibition match, every time the Maple Leafs come to town, there&#8217;s that special aura in the building.  As a fan (and I&#8217;m being selfish), it&#8217;s another reason for wanting the Red Wings in the Eastern Conference.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nashville Predators defeated the Washington Capitals by a 4-1 margin at the Bridgestone Arena in a pre-season contest that saw both teams field squads that had a lot of veterans on the ice. Both teams played without some key players, as the Predators did not dress Mike Fisher and the Capitals were without Alexander Ovechkin.</p>
<p>Some thoughts about the Predators after this contest:</p>
<p><strong>The young guys have some talent. </strong></p>
<p>I liked the way that Craig Smith, Gabriel Bourque, and Mattias Ekholm play and the way they skate. These young guys showed they have good compete levels and there is an abundance of raw talent. They will be solid contributors for the Predators. That being said&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The young guys need to season</strong> </p>
<p>Running into some top line defensemen showed that the young guys need to continue to develop their game and get a bit more stronger. What worked in juniors or at the collegiate level is not necessarily going to work at the NHL level. The potential is there; the game just has to mature.</p>
<p><strong>This is a squad that can do some damage</strong></p>
<p>The Predators skated well and showed that their team game can dominate another team. The success of the Predators will hinge on two factors: players that are expected to produce HAVE to produce; and they must stay healthy. Production has to come from Colin Wilson, Marty Erat, David Legwand, and the veterans that are expected to produce. Nick Spaling has to step his game to the next level. Niclas Bergfors will hopefully develop into this year&#8217;s Sergei Kostitsyn. And the aforementioned Kostitsyn has to take the next step in his game. If, and it is a big if, the guys can do this, the Predators will enjoy success.</p>
<p><strong>Pekka Rinne is Pekka Rinne</strong> </p>
<p>Rinne will once again be called upon to carry the team on his back. He showed tonight that he can do just that. What will be critical is that Anders Lindback can give the team some quality starts and give Rinne adequate rest. Lindback will need to give the team 10-15 quality games throughout the course of the season to give Rinne a break and keep him fresh.</p>
<p><strong>The young D will be OK</strong> </p>
<p>Remember back several years ago when there was concern about the young defense core? An unproven pair of defensemen- Shea Weber and Ryan Suter- were called upon to play some critical minutes and the concern was about their ability to handle the workload. Well, we all know how that turned out, don&#8217;t we? I think this young D corp will turn out to be just fine for the Predators. Will they make mistakes? Yes. But they will learn. Quickly. And they will be solid contributors.</p>
<p>As the pre-season winds down, it will be interesting to see how the battles for the final roster spots will play out. The competition for those spots will be fierce. And it will benefit the Predators. </p>
<p>Both in the pre-season and in the regular season.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not clear how many people in recent history have made the 4,250 mile journey from Augsburg, Germany to Pittsburgh.  In a few years, the Penguins are hoping a prospect who travelled that path will realize his NHL dream.  Right wing Tom Kuhnhackl, 19, a 6&#8217;2&#8243; 172 lb. native of Landshut, Germany, was drafted by Pittsburgh in the fourth round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, 110th overall.  Kuhnhackl played parts of three seasons with the Landshut German Junior team and the Landshut German Division 2 team before a four-game stint with the Augsburg Panther of the top-tier German Hockey League in 2009-10.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/PenguinsMarch"><img src="http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-a.png" alt="Follow PenguinsMarch on Twitter" />twitter.com/PenguinsMarch</a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/HockeyIndependentcom/127006180666794?v=app_7146470109"><img src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/facebook-logo-31.jpg" alt="Hockey Independent on Facebook" />Hockey Independent on Facebook</a></p>
<p>Last season, Kuhnhackl made his North American major junior debut with the Windsor Spitfires in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and he made a smooth transition, finishing fourth on his team with 68 points while leading the club in goals (39).  During the OHL playoffs, Kuhnhackl was even better, leading the team in goals (11), points (23), power play goals (4) and +/- (+11) and he finished as the third-best point scorer in the post-season among all OHL players.</p>
<p>In Game 7 of the first round, he scored a tiebreaking goal, his second of the contest, with under three minutes left in the third period to give Windsor the series over Erie.  While Windsor, shooting for its third straight Memorial Cup, eventually fell to the eventual OHL champions, Owen Sound in the Western Conference Final, Kuhnhackl scored 4 goals and 7 points in the five-game series loss.</p>
<p>For the second straight year, he earned an invitation to the Rookie Tournament held earlier in September in Oshawa, Ontario where prospects from the Penguins played one game each against teams of prospects from the Maple Leafs, Senators and Blackhawks.  A <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectdetail.htm?dpid=2429&amp;tab=scr" target="_blank">pre-draft scouting report described Kuhnhackl</a> as &#8220;a surprisingly mobile, good skater for a player of his size.  He has a very good understanding of the game and has good offensive instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the Rookie Tournament, Kuhnhackl also noted that he tries to &#8220;be an offensive player, a two-way player, trying to create scoring chances, bringing pucks to the net, using my legs and speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He admitted that he had some jitters last September.  &#8221;I played in the [Rookie] Tournament last year and I was really nervous.  I had no idea what everyone expected from me.  This year, I&#8217;m just trying to play my game to help the Penguins,&#8221; and pointed out that he gained valuable insight by skating on a line with two prospects who had already played in the NHL.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, with [Dustin] Jeffrey and [Eric] Tangradi &#8211; those are excellent players.   Both played a couple games for the Penguins so they know what they&#8217;re talking about.  They tell me what to do so I just listen to them because they know what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuhnhackl also credited a prospect with major junior and AHL experience with helping him along.  &#8221;Nick Petersen, he&#8217;s my roommate.   He was playing in the &#8216;A&#8217; last year so he&#8217;s been giving me advice, what the coaches expect from me and what I can do to help the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the Pens played Toronto in the Tournament, Kuhnhackl occasionally was assigned point duties on the power play, a role he tried last season.  &#8221;When I was playing in Windsor, I was playing on the point with [defenceman] Ryan Ellis for half the season, so I&#8217;m used to it now. [Penguins' coach John] Hynes asked me if I wanted to try it, so I said &#8216;Sure, why not?&#8217;&#8221;.  But Kuhnhackl, playing just his fifth game in a Penguins&#8217; sweater, quickly added, &#8220;Of course I was nervous!  The level here is way higher than in the OHL.   I&#8217;ll need a couple of games to get used to it but I liked playing on the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>He complimented his power play blue line partner Simon Despres, Pittsburgh&#8217;s first-round choice in 2009.  &#8221;Simon is a really skilled defenceman so it was really nice to play with him.  Before the game, we had a meeting with the coaches.   They told us which play we should run, what we should try.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_38976" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 488px"><img class="size-full wp-image-38976" src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_3720-Copy.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="358" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pittsburgh Penguin Tom Kuhnhackl (#14, second from right) warms up prior to a Rookie Tournament game against Toronto on September 11, 2011 in Oshawa, Ontario.</p></div>
<p>As for his former teammate <a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/penguinsmarch/38843/" target="_blank">Ellis, who was analyzed last week by </a><em><a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/penguinsmarch/38843/" target="_blank">Hockey Independent</a></em>, Kuhnhackl effusively praised the 2011 CHL Player of the Year.  &#8221;Ryan Ellis is <em>the</em> best defenceman in the OHL at his age.  I don&#8217;t know how to explain it.  He&#8217;s just the best.  If you play with him on the point, you have way more confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gives you the puck, I give him the puck,&#8221; Kuhnhackl excitedly explained, using his hands to diagram a typical game situation.  &#8221;He can run plays; he can play passes he never expected from someone.  He always helps you; he is a leader and he helped me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the subject of Germany&#8217;s continuing struggle to become a respectable global hockey nation was broached, Kuhnhackl turned more serious, nodding his head at the immense mountain his homeland still must climb.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the hockey in Germany, when you look at the first-league especially, every team has eleven imports &#8230; so what about the German hockey?&#8221; he asked rhetorically.  &#8221;Eleven imports &#8211; that&#8217;s like the first two and a half lines.  Then the third and fourth lines might be a couple of young German players that don&#8217;t see a lot of ice time and they sit in the stands.   Maybe we should reduce [the quota] to seven imports or six so that German hockey can improve and maybe we can beat Canada for once.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Kuhnhackl&#8217;s 2009-10 Augsburg club, the top eleven scorers were all either Canadian or American.</p>
<p>&#8220;I played a couple games [for Augsburg] but when you look at the level there &#8230; eleven imports,&#8221; he said, shaking his head, &#8221;it&#8217;s just &#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  If you want to improve German hockey, the German players need to get ice time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2010, <em>Hockey Independent</em> talked to German national team coach Uwe Krupp who played over 800 games in the NHL, about the state of hockey in his country.  Krupp was optimistic about the future after looking at the past and present.  &#8221;German hockey has a number of good players.  We haven&#8217;t created a Dirk Nowitzki like we have in basketball but we have Marco Sturm and Christian Ehrhoff &#8211; two guys who are representing German hockey at a very high level.  Jochan Hecht, Dennis Seidenberg, Olaf Kolzig &#8230; we&#8217;ve had some players who&#8217;ve had good careers in the NHL.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Kuhnhackl is a good young player that is as good as any player you&#8217;ll find in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia within those age groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuhnhackl was returned to Windsor last Thursday from the Penguins&#8217; pre-season training camp without appearing in any exhibition games. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.windsorspitfires.com/article/kuhnhackl-injury-update" target="_blank">he suffered a severe injury to the MCL of his right knee during Windsor&#8217;s 4-3 loss to the Kitchener Rangers</a> on Friday night that may require surgery meaning he will be out indefinitely.  The collision and the sight of a player falling on his knee was eerily reminiscent of the injury suffered by Pittsburgh centre Evgeni Malkin in February that ended the star centre&#8217;s season.</p>
<p>In time, Kuhnhackl will heal and the journey from Augsburg to Pittsburgh will continue.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Montreal Canadiens have announced earlier today they have signed blueliner Chris Campoli to a one-year $1.75 million contract. Campoli split last season between the Ottawa Senators and the Chicago Blackhawks, playing 77 games scoring 4 goals and adding 17 assists for 21 points. Campoli finished with an even plus/minus ratio of 0.</p>
<p>This move was made necessary following Andrei Markov&#8217;s slow progression back from a knee surgery. Markov has been skating solo in the past few weeks and doesn&#8217;t seem ready to comeback any time soon. The 27 year-old was without a contract after becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1st.</p>
<p><a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Chris-Campoli.jpg"><img src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Chris-Campoli.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="594" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38972" /></a>Campoli, who will join the Habs&#8217; training camp in Montreal tomorrow, can man the point on the second power play unit. He&#8217;ll sneak in for the back-door play and can make some decent passes. He has an accurate , but not overly powerful shot. He makes good outlet passes out of the defensive zone. Yet, in the defensive zone, he can get running around after big forwards as he has trouble pinning them and Campoli is not overly physical.</p>
<p>He will be a good 5-6th defensemen with the Canadiens.</p>
<p>Probable defensive pairings on opening day:<br />
<strong>Hall Gill-P.K. Subban<br />
Jaroslav Spacek-Josh Gorges<br />
Chris Campoli-Alexei Yemelin<br />
Spare: Yannick Weber<br />
Injured: Andrei Markov</strong></p>
<p><strong>Depth defensemen: Raphael Diaz, Jeff Woywitka and Mark Mitera</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know more as the team is slated to make its first round of cuts late tonight or tomorrow after a four-games in four nights weekend ending tonight at Bell Centre against the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>You can follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/FredPoulin98">Twitter</a> for more information and updates about the Habs and the NHL in general.</p>

<p>Last night, in B&#8217;s agitator Brad Marchand&#8217;s home province of Nova Scotia, CND, the Boston Bruins defeated the Montreal Canadiens 7-3. The game was held at the Halifax Metro Centre, home of the QMJHL&#8217;s Halifax Mooseheads. Against a less than stellar Canadiens lineup, it was 4 special teams goals that led Boston to the 7-3 victory. Two of those four were on the short-hand, and were scored by Daniel Paille, and B&#8217;s captain Zdeno Chara.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better sign for the Bruins, was the two goals scored on the power-play, during Sunday night&#8217;s contest. Joe Corvo, playing in his first game as a Bruin, was responsible for the first of those, off a nice feed from the returning Nathan Horton. The second was scored by Nova Scotia native Brad Marchand, when a rebound was kicked out to him, on the doorstep of the net. Coming off a season in which the Bruins were able to win the Stanley Cup, despite one of the league&#8217;s worst power-plays, one of the biggest goals during this pre-season and training camp, was to improve the team&#8217;s play with the man advantage. Becoming a better team, on the PP will be a very important factor for the Bruins in 2011-12. If they have plans of making a repeat run, deep into the playoffs, they will need much better performances  on special teams. Fresh off the team&#8217;s 6-3 home victory against the New York Islanders, on Friday night, in which they scored two goals with the man-advantage,  members of the Bruins had this to say, when asked about the improvement of the power-play:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Well looking at last year, we definitely want to improve, we&#8217;ve been practicing a little bit on the power-play,just try to get better,  just try to get pucks to the net, get more consistency out there&#8221;</em><strong>&#8211; Dennis Seidenberg</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I think maybe the power-play was in our minds a little bit last year, and I think every power-play in the league is good when they shoot the puck. If we continue to shoot the puck, you know, your never going to score nice pretty goals all the time, we&#8217;ve gotta wack a few in.&#8221;</em>&#8211; <strong>Rich Peverley</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Well, we got a couple goals tonight, on the power-play, the puck was moving fairly well. Overall I thought the power play did a pretty good job moving the puck, and were going to keep working on that. We will be a better team when we get the right guys in the right places. We have to improve on it.&#8221;</em>&#8211; <strong>Claude Julien</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight the Bruins will look to sweep the Canadiens, in this mini 2-game pre-season series, when they visit the Bell Centre, for a 7:30 PM puck-drop. As always, the game can be heard on the flagship radio station of the B&#8217;s, 98.5 The Sports Hub. Unfortunately for the fans in Boston, the game will not be televised locally. With 34 players still on the roster, look for the Bruins to make a few more cuts following tonight&#8217;s game. Indications are that tonight&#8217;s lineup looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>FORWARDS</strong></p>
<p>Lucic&#8211;Krecji&#8211;Seguin</p>
<p>Sauve&#8211;Peverley&#8211;Clark</p>
<p>Caron&#8211;Kelly&#8211;Arniel</p>
<p>MacDermid&#8211;Campbell&#8211;Thornton</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSE</strong></p>
<p>Seidenberg&#8211;Kampfer</p>
<p>Bartkowski&#8211;Boychuk</p>
<p>Ference&#8211;Cohen</p>
<p><strong>GOALTENDER</strong></p>
<p>Rask</p>
<p>Khudobin</p>
<p>As is the style of head coach Claude Julien, in playing his starting net-minder for all 60 minutes, in the pre-season, expect Tuukka Rask to go the distance, between the pipes for Boston tonight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></em></p>
<p>Following tonight&#8217;s contest, at the Bell Centre, the B&#8217;s will return home for their final home game of the pre-season, when they take on the Ottawa Senators, at TD Garden, on Thursday evening. From there, they head to Bridgeport, CT for an exhibition game against the New York Islanders. This will be their final tune-up , before opening up the regular season, on October 6, when they host the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I called the 2011 Winter Classic the worst-kept secret in hockey. I&#8217;d like to correct myself and say that the 2012 Winter Classic is the worst-kept secret in hockey.</p>
<p>Back in mid-May, the rumors were floating around that the Philadelphia Flyers will be hosting the New York Rangers on January 2nd at Citizens Bank Park. NHL.com itself posted a story about the reports back on May 13th, which seemed like an odd thing to do if it were merely a rumor.</p>
<p>Then the schedule came out, and there on it was a Flyers-Rangers game penciled in for 1pm on January 2nd in Philadelphia. But still, no acknowledgement that indeed it was the Winter Classic.</p>
<p>HBO production crews showed up at the Rangers&#8217; practice facility in the opening days of training camp to start collecting some footage. Still, nothing.</p>
<p>Well, the i&#8217;s have been dotted and the t&#8217;s have been crossed and <em>finally</em> the NHL held a press conference this afternoon to announce that, yes indeed, the Rangers and Flyers will be meeting up on January 2nd in Philadelphia for the 2012 Winter Classic. Among the Rangers&#8217; representatives at the announcement were General Manager Glen Sather, Coach John Tortorella, Captain Ryan Callahan, Alternate Brad Richards and Marian Gaborik.</p>
<p>This will be the Flyers&#8217; 2nd time in the NHL&#8217;s marquee event, and the Rangers&#8217; first.</p>
<p>Sure, there is the possibility that there may be snow, but odds are Citizens Bank Park will nthe &#8217;30sot be the living snow globe that Ralph Wilson Stadium was for the inaugural game in Buffalo where it was all about playing outdoors in the elements, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. It does not have the iconic nature that Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, both hosts of past Classics have, so this is not about the venue. There is no force-fed star &#8220;Sid vs. Ovi&#8221; rivalry that we had last year at a soggy Heinz Field. When the rumors of this matchup first came out, the Flyers had not yet been blown up and rebuilt. Brad Richards was not yet a Ranger. There are recognizable names on both teams, and yes, there&#8217;s the potential for the NHL to try and play up the &#8220;Jaromir Jagr playing his old team&#8221; factor, especially if he gets off to a good start. But this is not about star power. No, this one is about one thing &#8211; the pure sports rivalry between the 2 cities. Flyers fans in attendance booed a bit when the Rangers were introduced, and Glen Sather provided some entertaining smack talk about the Rangers winning the Stanley Cup and the Yankees defeating the Phillies in the World Series.</p>
<p>Returning this season will also be HBO&#8217;s 24/7: Road To The Winter Classic. It will premiere on December 14th and run 4 episodes, with the season finale on January 4th. That in and of itself should be worth the price of admission. From the Rangers&#8217; standpoint, John Tortorella should make for some great television, and very well could put Bruce Boudreau to shame if the Rangers are in a rough patch at the time of filming. The affable Martin Biron should make for some entertaining television as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_38956" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 145px"><a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110929_nyr_logo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-38956" src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110929_nyr_logo.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="138" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New York Rangers 2012 Winter Classic Logo (Courtesy New York Rangers)</p></div>
<p>Uniforms for the event were not yet revealed, but in the branding at the event, it looked like the Rangers&#8217; shield logo used evoked one that the team used from 1935-1948. With the team creating a &#8220;Heritage&#8221; 3rd jersey last year, it&#8217;s not far off the mark to think the retro shield will be incorporated into the uniform.</p>
<p>After tonight&#8217;s preseason game against the Flyers, the Rangers will head off for Europe, where they&#8217;ll play 4 preseason games in 4 different countries over 5 days before opening the season with 2 games in Stockholm  on October 7th and 8th. Then they get a brief respite with one  &#8220;home game&#8221; against the Islanders at the Nassau Coliseum before heading out on a 4-game Western Conference swing before coming back to New York to open the home schedule against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 27th. The Winter Classic is one more event in what will be a hectic season for the Rangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******************************</p>
<p>The Rangers&#8217; lineup for Monday night&#8217;s game in Philadelphia:</p>
<p>Goalies: Biron, Lundqvist</p>
<p>Defensemen:  Bickel, Del Zotto, Erixon, Girardi, McDonagh, Sauer</p>
<p>Forwards:  Anisimov, Avery, Bourque, Boyle, Christensen, Deveaux, Dubinsky,  Mitchell, Thuresson, Weise, Wolski,  Zuccarello</p>

		<title>Change of Draft Philosophy Key to Panthers&#8217; Future Success</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>      One of the biggest changes in the recent history of the Florida Panthers, specifically under Dale Tallon has been the change in the organization’s draft philosophy. Scott Luce, the Panthers Head Scout, is one of the best talent evaluators in the NHL, however the team philosophy in the past has made Luce’s job more difficult then need be. Players taken in previous drafts, such as Michael Frolik, and Rotislav Olesz, who both have been recently shipped on the fastest train, plane, or automobile out of town, would no longer fit the Panthers drafting system. When Michael Frolik was drafted he was considered the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the 2006 Entry Draft. Frolik was a strong choice at the time due to his high-ceiling, however the Panthers have long needed consistency out of their draft picks and in that sense the safer choice would perhaps have been the better choice. The same goes for 2004 Entry Draft selection, Rotislav Olesz, in which the Panthers took the unproven, inexperienced player with the 7<sup>th</sup> overall pick. This is a far cry from the last two drafts run by Tallon, in which the Panthers chose safer selections with their first round picks. This is seen in drafting solid and steady Eric Gudbranson, the beastly Nick Bjugstad, and perhaps the safest player in the 2010 draft in Quinton Howden.  Johnathan Huberdeau continued that draft mentality in the 2011 draft. The Panthers have maintained the high-risk, high-reward drafting mentality but have saved it for later rounds. And Tallon can now afford to take those sorts of risks because he has taken what was once an empty cupboard and stocked it with brimming young talent. This is something previous regimes have sorely lacked. Players like Johnathan McFarland, Rocco Grimaldi, and Kyle Rau can be taken, because there is such a significant amount of talent elsewhere in the organization, and their success isn’t as crucial to the team as Michael Frolik or Rusty Olesz’s was when they dawned a Panther uniform on draft day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, it was the Tigers, then the Lions and it was up to the Red Wings (Oh,My!) to preserve a sweep for Detroit&#8217;s sports teams.  Henrik Zetterberg made that happen as he scored the game-winning goal in the third round of the shootout as the Red Wings held on to beat the visiting Chicago Blackhawks 4-3.  Zetterberg also added a goal and an assist to help the Red Wings win their second game of the preseason.</p>
<p>The Red Wings opened the scoring at 7:35 of the first period thanks to Valtteri Filppula as he fired a wrist shot past Blackhawks goalie Alexander Salak for a 1-0 lead.  Filppula also added two assists in the game.  The lead was extended to 2-0 as Zetterberg hit a laser-shot with 47 seconds left in the opening period.</p>
<p>The visitors started the second period scoring as Brandon Pirri recovered the puck on a Red Wing turnover while they were on the power play.  Pirri skated up the ice and fired a slapshot past Red Wings goalie Ty Conklin for a 2-1 lead.  The Red Wings cushioned the lead to 3-1 on a Nicklas Lidstrom power play goal as he fired a slapshot from the point.  The Blackhawks cut the Red Wings&#8217; lead to 3-2 on a Jimmy Hayes backhand shot.</p>
<p>The only goal came in the third period as The Blackhawks tied the game at 3-3 thanks to a Brendan Smith turnover.  Smith couldn&#8217;t settle down the puck and the visitors took advantage of it as Pirri scored his second of the night as he got a pass from Hayes and put in a snap shot past Conklin.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t any scoring in the overtime, which led to the shootout. Pirri was a thorn in the Red Wings&#8217; side again as he scored in the first round.  Todd Bertuzzi tied it in the second round as he made a pass to himself and put it past Salak.  Zetterberg scored the game-clinching goal in the third round and Conklin sealed the win as he made a save on rookie Brandon Saad.</p>
<p>Yes, it was ugly but the Red Wings will take the victory even though it&#8217;s still the preseason.  The defense caused a couple of turnovers, which is concerning.  Jonathan Ericcson needs to push his weight around on a consistent basis. It&#8217;ll be nervewracking to see how Ericcson will play weeks after signing a new contract. Darren Smith is a rookie and he&#8217;ll learn with more seasoning.</p>
<p>If there is a forward that has &#8220;Breakout Season&#8221; written all over him, it is Valtteri Filppula.  He looks like he can dominate a game, but he hasn&#8217;t shot the puck as much as he should.  If he can do that, especially having Zetterberg and Johan Franzen as his linemates, he can take his game to the next level.</p>
<p>The Red Wings lost Jan Mursak to an unknown amount of time due to a fractured left ankle.  He was pushed onto the boards by Dylan Olsen and landed awkwardly against the boards.  Mursak is one of the hopefuls to make the team but it creates room for someone to step up and claim a spot to start the NHL regular season.  For those who want to be in the NHL full time, particularly Cory Emmerton, Tomas Tatar, Fabian Brunnstrom and Gustav Nyquist, this is their chance.  There&#8217;s only a week left in the preseason and the clock is ticking.</p>
<p>The Red Wings have a preseason rematch with the Blackhawks in Chicago this Wednesday with an 8:30 pm start.</p>

<p>Now back at 100% after an intensive summer of rehabbing and training, <strong>Pacioretty</strong> is ready to make an impact on the Canadiens first two lines. Entering his fourth NHL season, Pacioretty, who was drafted 22nd overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, will most likely play alongside Scott Gomez and Brian Gionta on Montreal&#8217;s second line.</p>
<p>The New Canaan, Connecticut native, had found his offensive touch, scoring 14 goals and 1o assists for 24 points in only 37 games, before going with his season-ending surgery. <strong>Pacioretty</strong> had started the 2010-11 season with the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL after a poor training camp. </p>
<p>In 27 games prior to his call-up, Max Pax notched 17 goals and 15 assists for 32 points clicking with linemate David Desharnais, who has since also made the jump with the Canadiens. </p>
<p><a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Max-Pacioretty.jpg"><img src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Max-Pacioretty.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="412" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38890" /></a>The 6&#8217;2&#8221;, 205 lb left wing possesses all the offensive tools to have success in the NHL. A great skater with quick feet, <strong>Pacioretty</strong> handles the puck very well and a great wrist shot with a lightning-fast release. He has improved his play around the offensive net and has learned how to use his size and speed to drive the net with efficiency.</p>
<p>Yesterday night, during the Habs 4-3 OT win against the Ottawa Senators, <strong>Pacioretty</strong> scored two power play goals to help the Canadiens rally from a 3-0 deficit. <strong>Pacioretty</strong> also scored in the shootout to help the Canadiens defeat the Senators. Pacioretty had an impressive nine shots on goal and he hit two posts on sizzling shots that goalie Craig Anderson didn&#8217;t even see in about 21 minutes of ice-time.</p>
<p>Playing on a line with Scott Gomez and prospect Brendan Gallagher, the trio combined for 19 shots and was the only that was able to create scoring chances on a regular basis during the game.</p>
<p>With Gomez playing a great game, his first of the pre-season, and ready to have a bounce-back season after a miserable 2010-11 campaign, the <strong>Gionta-Gomez-Pacioretty</strong> line should score on a regular basis this year for the Habs. They played together for a long stretch last season during which Pacioretty recorded 17 points in 19 games right before the &#8220;stanchion incident&#8221; &#8211; a 73-point pace over a full season. </p>
<p><strong>Pacioretty</strong> converted goals at a fairly good 12.5% rate last season, notching 14 goals on 112 shots (or about three shots per game). If <strong>Pacioretty</strong> plays 75 games this season and continues to have around three shots on goal per game and convert at a 12% rate, that would translate to 27 goals which is feasible considering all the playing time Pacioretty will get on the second line and the power play. Players like David Jones and Rene Bourque scored 27 goals last season, both players being power forwards just like Max. </p>
<p>Primarily a goal scorer, <strong>Pacioretty</strong> can also distribute the puck to his linemate as demonstrated by his 25 combined assists (AHL+NHL) in only 52 games during the last campaign. This total would prorate to almost 40 assists over a full season. Another aspect that should improve this season, is his plus/minus ratio of -1 last year which was negatively impacted by the misfortune of playing in front of a mediocre .898 save percentage goaltending. </p>
<p>Number 67 will also continue to be a major threat on the power play, finishing 55th last season on the man-advantage, scoring seven goals despite playing only 37 games with Montreal (prorated to 15 goals over a full season). Only six players scored more than 12 power play goals last season (D. Sedin, Stamkos, Selanne, Kesler, Perry and Iginla).</p>
<p><strong>Pacioretty</strong> certainly enters the season as a very valuable and underrated player both for the Canadiens and the fantasy GMs looking for a late-round gem. Yahoo has him ranked 284th in his draft overall rankings, which would see him getting drafted in the 23rd round of a 12 team fantasy league&#8230; Talk about flying under the radar!</p>
<p><strong>After the analysis above I would not be surprised to see Max Pacioretty score 30 goals and 27 assists for 57 points in 80 games to go along with a 12 power-play goals, 225 shots, 80 penalty minutes and a good +10 plus/minus ratio.</strong></p>
<p>As <strong>Pacioretty</strong> is ranked 58th among left wingers in standard Yahoo leagues, you can easily draft him in the middle rounds (10-15) without fear of losing him to another GM or wasting a pick on him, especially on a relatively thin left wing position.</p>
<p>Do you think <strong>Pacioretty</strong> is ready to breakout and score 30 goals for the Canadiens? If not, why?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who thought that Jaromir Jagr&#8217;s tank was on &#8216;E&#8217; after he left the KHL and signed with Philadelphia, think again.  The Flyers&#8217; right winger scored the go-ahead goal and added an assist as the visiting Philadelphia Flyers skated past the Red Wings 3-1 at the Joe Louis Arena.</p>
<p>The Red Wings scored first at 4:23 in the first period as Fabian Brunnstrom got a pass from Patrick Eaves and the puck past Flyers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky for a 1-0 lead.  That was the only time the home team found the net for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>The Flyers tied as James Van Riemskyk got the puck and put a wrist shot in for a 1-1 tie.  The visitors went ahead 52 seconds later as Jagr scored for a 2-1 lead.  Matt Read closed the scoring for the night at 10:41 of the second period.</p>
<p>Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard made 19 saves on 22 shots in the loss while on the other end, Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 22 of 23 shots.</p>
<p>It seemed that the tide turned for the Red Wings when they failed to score during a five minute power play.  Brunnstrom, who is competing for a spot on the Red Wings&#8217; roster, helped his own cause with the lone goal and was effective with and without the puck.  Red Wings center Cory Emmerton, who is also competing to stick with the big club, had an assist tonight.</p>
<p>Flyers forward Wayne Simmonds didn&#8217;t play in tonight&#8217;s game.  The big story was in last night&#8217;s game when Simmonds was facing Red Wings goalie Jordan Pearce in the shootout, a fan threw a banana peel on the ice.  It had drawn disgust within the entire hockey community. The authorities have not found the moron.</p>
<p>The youngsters on the Red Wings have played decently over the past couple of days, especially against two of the powerhouse teams in the Eastern Conference: Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.  Some of the Grand Rapids &#8216;Red Wings&#8217; such as Brendan Smith, Cory Emmerton, Tomas Tatar and Jan Mursak are getting more than a sample-size when they&#8217;re facing some of the elite.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Red Wings got a big dose of Evgeni Malkin and Marc-Andre Fleury while tonight it was the line of Jagr, Van Riemsdyk and Sean Couturier stood out.  Jagr must have found a time machine because he&#8217;s playing like it&#8217;s 1999. Van Riemsdyk is in line for a breakout season while Couturier is making lives tough for the Flyers coaching staff, as the 8th overall pick in this summer&#8217;s draft is playing like he doesn&#8217;t want to go back to the junior ranks.  Philly has another star in the making in Brayden Schenn.  He was acquired from the Los Angeles Kings in a blockbuster trade that sent Mike Richards (no, not Kramer) to Hollywood. He&#8217;s an early favorite for the Calder Trophy.</p>
<p>The Red Wings and Flyers battled it out in London, Ontario last night as the Red Wings beat the Flyers 4-3 in a shootout.  The next time these two teams will meet this season is February 12, 2012 at the Joe Louis Arena.</p>
<p>The Red Wings&#8217; next game is this Sunday at 5:00 pm as they host the Chicago Black Hawks at the JLA.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well folks, it’s been a long time since I have blogged but I’m looking forward to doing that for the upcoming season and really going to focus on what the Rangers plan to do as well as how they are doing during the season, from now until next summer. Please feel free to comment when entries are posted as I enjoy reading what people have to say about my writing.</p>
<p>Tough to gauge how a team will do in preseason, but this is great way to see who will make the team and who won’t since there are some spots available in the lineup. Once we get closer to the end of preseason, I will make my season predictions for them and will grade my effort during the year is it progresses.</p>
<p>The regular season gets underway in Europe very soon and its going to be the start of a good year I think.</p>
<p>Well until next time, your NYR blogger<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I&#8217;ve scraped the attempt at a live blog from tonight&#8217;s game, after many frivolous attempts to salvage it.  Anyways, the Boston Bruins were able to recover from a slow start in tonight&#8217;s contest, and come back to win 6-3 against the New York Islanders, in their first home pre-season game of the year.</p>
<p>In a game that saw the Islanders get out to a quick 2-0 lead in the first period, on the back of 2 slap-shot goals from young defenseman Dylan Reese, a strong effort from the B&#8217;s 2nd line proved to be the difference. Tonight&#8217;s 2nd line (and projected 2nd line for the regular season) featured Patrice Bergeron, between Rich Peverley and Brad Marchand. The trio combined for 3 goals, 8 points, and a combined plus-7 between them. While it is almost a given that Marchand will again be skating alongside Bergeron, as he did in 2010-11, the players in that Boston locker room know that the third spot on that line is up for grabs. It would be any one of a number of guys, including Peverley, Tyler Seguin, Jordan Caron, or Benoit Pouliot. With a 1 goal, and 3 point performance tonight, Peverley sure made his case, as to why he should be skating with Bergeron &amp; Marchand:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I just try to use my speed and shoot the puck and those guys are pretty creative, so for myself it&#8217;s feeding off of them, but they make great plays themselves going to the net a little bit too&#8221;</em> &#8212; Rich Peverley (When asked what he brings to the trio of himself, Patrice Bergeron, and Brad Marchand.</p>
<p>On another good note for the B&#8217;s, after coming up empty on their first two power-plays of the night, they managed to score twice on their final 3 trips to the man-advantage. Power-Play goals from David Krecji &amp; Dennis Seidenberg were a welcome sign for a Boston team that struggled mightily throughout last season, and into the playoffs, when it came to scoring with the man-advantage.</p>
<p>Also, not long after head coach Claude Julien&#8217;s post-game press conference, it was announced that the Bruins had released 14 players from their training camp roster, including 2011 Draft choices Dougie Hamilton &amp; Alexander Khokhlachev, as well as 2010 2nd round picks Jared Knight &amp; Ryan Spooner. While it is not surprising to see Hamilton &amp; Khokhlachev returned to junior so quickly, it comes as a shock to many that the B&#8217;s would send Spooner &amp; Knight back to the OHL, at such an early juncture of the pre-season. It was expected that at least one of the two former 2nd round picks would stick around and compete for a spot on the big club, and perhaps even earn a 9-game tryout, with the team. However, this will not be the case. The dispatching of Spooner and Knight, comes as a signal that the B&#8217;s brass must like what they&#8217;ve seen out of young Jordan Caron, and new-Bruin Benoit Pouliot.</p>
<p>Along with the assigning of those 4 players back to their junior teams, the Bruins also demoted 10 players to Providence. Those players are: Andrew Bodnarchuk, Ryan Button, Nathan McIver, Marc Cantin, Kevan Miller, Carter Camper, Craig Cunningham, Josh Hennessy, Kirk MacDonald, and Jamie Tardif.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming off a 2-1 loss to  Mika Zibanejad and the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday night, in Kanata, the Boston Bruins will look to get off on the right foot tonight, as they host the New York Islanders, in the first game at the TD Garden, since Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bruins were beaten in Overtime by the Senators, on a rocket one-timer shot by Senators’ 2011 first round draft choice, Mika Zibanejad. Throughout the game, the Bruins appeared to be a very fatigued bunch. Playing the Black &amp; White game the night before, in Providence, undoubtedly contributed to that. Credit should be given to goaltender Tuukka Rask, who performed extremely well,  stopping 34 of 36 Ottawa shots, and giving all he had, to keep his team in the game. It was a good start for Rask, who is coming off of off-season surgery, and is looking to win the starting job back, from defending Vezina trophy winner, Tim Thomas. The lone goal scored by the B’s, was off the stick of the upstart, grinding forward, Lane MacDermid. The line of MacDermid, Chris Kelly, and Shawn Thornton was perhaps the best line of the night for the B’s, culminating in the goal scored by MacDermid, on a long rebound of a Shawn Thornton wrist shot. MacDermid, (who also scored in the Bruins’ Black &amp; White game) is really opening some eyes at training camp.  Unfortunately for him, it looks as if he’ll be demoted to Providence in the near future, based purely on the lack of available roster spots, with the big club. However, MacDermid has proven himself as a viable replacement, in the event of an injury to one of Boston’s 3<sup>rd</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> line forwards.</p>
<p>Tonight, the B’s will play host to the Islanders tonight, in their pre-season home opener, at the Garden, beginning at 7 PM. It doesn’t appear to be an all too star-studded roster for the Isles tonight, as star center John Tavares, 2010-11 Rookie Of The Year candidate Michael Grabner, and newly-named captain Mark Streit are all reported to be out of the lineup, tonight. However, Islanders goaltender, and Winthrop, MA native Rick DiPietro appears to be the starter, for tonight’s contest.</p>
<p>The reported Bruins’ roster for tonight, features far more star power than did the squad that took the ice, Wednesday in Ottawa. The best news for the B&#8217;s is that Captain Zdeno Chara, and top-line playmaker David Krecji  will return to the lineup after each suffering minor lower body injuries. Head Coach Claude Julien has also announced, that tonight&#8217;s plans call for goaltender Tim Thomas to play the full 60 minutes, barring anything crazy. The roster and lines from this morning’s practice at the Garden, are as follows:</p>
<p><em><strong>FORWARDS</strong></em></p>
<p>Marchand—Bergeron—Peverley</p>
<p>MacDermid&#8211;Khokhlachev—Pouliot</p>
<p>Lucic—Krecji—Knight</p>
<p>Arniel—Hamill—Paille</p>
<p><em><strong>DEFENSEMEN</strong></em></p>
<p>Chara&#8211;Kampfer</p>
<p>McKelvie&#8211;Seidenberg</p>
<p>Boychuk&#8211;Bartkowski</p>
<p><em><strong>GOALTENDERS</strong></em></p>
<p>Thomas</p>
<p>Khudobin</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s game will be broadcast live on 98.5 The Sports Hub, the official radio home of the Bruins. There will also be live stream of it on BostonBruins.com. I will be updating a live blog, from the Garden, on here, beginning at 7 PM.</p>

<p>There have been a few incidents during the new preseason that unfortunately warranted Brendan Shanahan, the new NHL Disciplinarian to hand out a pair of suspensions. What was different with these cases, is that Brendan Shanahan took the opportunity to create a video, posted on NHL.com to show and explain what occurred, as well as review the rules, and his logic and reasoning for the suspension and its terms. This is a refreshing change from the past where Colin Campbell seemed to hand out suspensions and discipline in a questionable manner.</p>
<p>Campbell in the past nor Shanahan now have a job to be relished. It is not easy. But it seemed that Campbell was pleased to remain very &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; in his approach, and lacked either the will or desire to explain a clear cut method for his decisions. This new approach conducted by Shanahan affords the fan some insight into the decision-making process and why a suspension is warranted.</p>
<p>There is also a little more of the &#8220;humiliation&#8221; factor in these &#8220;penalty box chats&#8221; to echo FDRs old &#8220;Fireside Chats&#8221; from the 30s and 40s. By showing the fans in video review, mentioning the players name, it has to be a little mortifying to see yourself, and know everyone else is seeing you commit the &#8220;crime.&#8221; It has a courtroom feel to it, and I support it.</p>
<p>There must be justification for a suspension and seeing the incident happen in video, and explaining clearly and calmly the decision creates more communication and understand for the NHL to its fans. It also sends a very clear message to the players that they expect the players to do a better job at minding each others well-being on the ice while in the heat of a competition.</p>
<p>This is a physical game, and a fast game. There is no doubt that accidents happen, and people will get hurt. But the league should be open to all methods to police the game, and do what ever possible to protect its players.</p>
<p>This new method might be a result of the season most likely starting without one of its premier stars, Sidney Crosby. As an Islander fan, I am no fan of the Penguins, or even Crosby, but his skill and talent cannot be denied, and for those of us who long for better coverage of the game we have a passion for in the USA, having a player like Crosby on the shelf won&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>What ever the reason for the new video approach, I am sincerely hopeful that Mr. Shanahan continues his video presentation if/when any incident should occur. The fans deserve the respect of the explanation, and the game we love deserve the clear and concise approach taken by Shanahan.</p>
<p>You can view both videos at <a href="http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=60" target="_blank">NHL.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disgusting</strong></p>
<p>I was quite angered and saddened when I read about the incident that happened Thursday evening in London Ont. Afro Americans are key and important contributors to society at large — whether they play sports like Hockey, or are President of the United States. It is disgusting to see that there are people — too many people — still holding onto racist feelings and thoughts. It is horrible to think that society as a whole some how has breed this kind of mental moron. Hate begets hate, and when you hate, the only one that likely knows about it, is you. That is, unless your hatred manifests in something silly, stupid, violent or all of the above.</p>
<p>My heart and soul goes out to Wayne Simmonds for the atrocity he endured. There is no place for that kind of thinking in the NHL, anywhere else in hockey, or in this world. We are all human. We all bleed the same blood when we are cut, and it hurts just as much for any of us.</p>
<p>I hope that all NHL players, and those of us who cherish the game stand up to this kind of foul behavior. It has no place here.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a distinguished four-year major junior career in which he put his name in the conversation of all-time best Ontario Hockey League defenceman while earning just about every award imaginable, 20-year old blueliner Ryan Ellis only took a brief rest this past summer before resuming his training program.  This week, Ellis continues his journey to the NHL in the Nashville Predators&#8217; pre-season camp, with an outside shot at earning a roster spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a week and a bit off after playing in the &#8216;A&#8217; (AHL),&#8221; Ellis said this past May at the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Awards Ceremony. &#8220;Just kind of relaxed, went up to the cottage and I just started my training regimen in the summer and I&#8217;m looking forward to a little time off as well as off-season training.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/PenguinsMarch"><img src="http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-a.png" alt="Follow PenguinsMarch on Twitter" />twitter.com/PenguinsMarch</a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/HockeyIndependentcom/127006180666794?v=app_7146470109"><img src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/facebook-logo-31.jpg" alt="Hockey Independent on Facebook" />Hockey Independent on Facebook</a></p>
<p>The 2009 first-round draft choice reached new personal summits in 2010-11 with the Windsor Spitfires when he was named the OHL Mickey Renaud Captain&#8217;s Award winner, top defenceman in the OHL, CHL and World Junior Championship, player of the year in both the OHL and CHL, and an OHL and World Junior Championship All Star.  He finished with 313 career points, third highest among all OHL defencemen in history.  He also captained Team Canada at the World Junior Championship in Buffalo, winning a second consecutive silver medal to go with the gold he won in 2009.</p>
<p>Ellis paused to consider his accomplishments and place in major junior history.</p>
<p>&#8220;I talked to my old coach Bob Boughner yesterday.  I think it&#8217;s just icing on the cake.   We had a great season this year and we went a lot further than a lot of people expected.   I think, just personally for myself, after four years in the OHL with the Windsor Spitfires, these two awards are just something on the top and I&#8217;m very honoured to get them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was humbled to have his name etched on the CHL Defenceman of the Year Award noting &#8220;the pretty big names on that list. I think to be in the company of not just those defencemen but the other players that have won it in previous years is very exciting.   I think going on to pro hockey next year, it&#8217;s kind of, like I said, just icing on the cake to sum it all up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis gave credit to his first high school hockey coach, Paul Hanley, of the Waterdown District High School Warriors, for motivating him to always give his best effort.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38846" src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_3646.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="318" />&#8220;It&#8217;s to always care and to always have the drive to win.   Obviously high school hockey at the time was just kind of more fun for me than anything serious but he always promoted everyone coming with their &#8216;A&#8217; game and wanting to win, no matter if it was high school, house league, OHL, NHL.  I think that was the biggest thing &#8211; always wanting to win, just having that drive at every aspect of any level is key.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Windsor&#8217;s drive for three straight Memorial Cups ended in the third round of the OHL playoffs in late April, Ellis signed an amateur try-out contract with the Milwaukee Admirals, Nashville&#8217;s AHL affiliate.  In his first seven professional playoff games, Ellis scored a goal and an assist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great experience.  I had a lot of fun there and I did pretty well for myself.  It was a different experience.  I wasn&#8217;t used to joining a team at the end of a year.  It was definitely a big step there.   I think going there in the thick of the playoffs and getting used to playoff speed was a great start for me in pro hockey,&#8221; Ellis reflected, reviewing his cup of coffee in Milwaukee.  &#8221;Everyone treated me very well. I played a lot more than I expected to.   I played some key spots which I think was pretty exciting,&#8221; he continued, perhaps referring to his goal on the power play in Game 6 of the West Division Final against Houston.</p>
<p>Ellis stated that the biggest lesson he learned in Milwaukee was &#8220;just the fact that you must get bigger and stronger for the jump to the AHL or the NHL.&#8221;  Just 5&#8217;10&#8243; and 179 lbs., scouts have often been skeptical about his viability as an NHL-calibre defenceman.  He chuckled when the topic of his small size came up again.  &#8221;No, I think I&#8217;m over that.  I still get those questions once in a while but I&#8217;m so far past anything like that.  I&#8217;m more confident and things like that aren&#8217;t even in my rear view anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his third pre-season camp with Nashville, Ellis has hopes of joining Shea Weber and Ryan Suter on the Preds&#8217; blue line but remains even-keeled and would not view a return trip to Milwaukee as a disappointment.  &#8221;I think the AHL is a great way to earn your way to an NHL team. I think if that&#8217;s in the cards for me, then I&#8217;ll relish in that role and go there, try to do my best and hopefully work my way to pro hockey.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>     <a href="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bozak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38838" src="http://hockeyindependent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bozak.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="277" /></a>With the season only two weeks away, and Ron Wilson saying that he hopes to get a full lineup into a few preseason games, it’s only a matter of time until we finally see the opening roster for The Toronto Maple Leafs. With the top six, and goaltenders virtually set, it will be interesting to see how the 3<sup>rd</sup> line, 4<sup>th</sup> line, and defensive pairings work out.</p>
<p>     Last season Leaf fans saw multiple players have roles on the third line, at some point. This year, it may just be the same. Luckily, the skill level of the players that may play on the third line this season has increased, substantially. However it’s all but set for opening night. Kadri – Bozak – Armstrong is the expected third line to start the year. However, multiple questions are going to arise throughout the season. The status of Matthew Lombardi is only one of them. After missing all but two games last season because of post-concussion syndrome, the speedy centre is going to have to fight to earn his position on this team, when he is deemed ready to go. The question of whether or not he will be as productive as he was earlier in his career, before his concussion issue, is yet to be answered.</p>
<p>     Another likely candidate at some point during the season is Matt Frattin. The Hobey Baker finalist from just one year ago will most likely start with the Marlies this season, barring any injuries between now and opening night. However, Matt has prototypical grit, and brings a scoring punch, which is exactly what Brian Burke likes in a player. Unfortunately for him, he’s in tough, with former 7<sup>th</sup> overall pick Nazem Kadri looking better than ever at training camp. It is likely that the Leafs’ brass will decide that Matt Frattin is better off going down and playing top line minutes for the Marlies, while being taught by AHL head coach Dallas Eakins.</p>
<p>     With the fourth line, it’ll be interesting who gets the nod for centre. Darryl Boyce, and Phillipe Dupuis are in a dog fight, for this position. Both players served time in the National Hockey League last season, Boyce with the Leafs, Dupuis with the Colorado Avalanche. Both guys are tough, and gritty. Dupuis isn’t afraid to drop the gloves, and Boyce has had his nose taken off or broken about six hundred million and a half times.</p>
<p>     There is no question that Dion Phaneuf, Luke Schenn,and John Michael Liles are virtually set to play as many games as their bodies will let them this season. The interesting candidates are Keith Aulie, Carl Gunnarsson, Cody Franson, Mike Komisarek, and blue chip prospect Jake Gardiner. Aulie seems like he’ll be a lock after his steady and solid play when paired with Captain Dion Phaneuf last season. However the only thing against him is that he is isn’t eligible for waivers. If Jake Gardiner impresses the Leafs’ brass so much that they believe they absolutely need him in the NHL this season, Aulie may get shafted. However, it is unlikely that Wilson decides to force Gardiner into the lineup, especially if it meant having to send down the Captain’s partner. On the right side, the Leafs have Phaneuf, Schenn, Komisarek, and Cody Franson. On the left, the Leafs have Liles, Aulie, and Gunnarsson. So assuming the top four consists of Phaneuf, Schenn, Aulie, and Liles… Gunnarsson, Komisarek, and BC native Cody Franson will likely be battling it out. Not just at camp, but throughout the entire season.</p>
<p>     The goalies are obviously set in stone, unless injuries occur of course. James Reimer is the obvious number one guy, with Jonas Gustavsson backing him up. Ben Scrivens and Jussi Rynnas are likely to share time with the Marlies, and will battle with each other for the number one role there.</p>
<p>     Despite all the battles, a positive for the Leafs and their fans, is that it seems as if we finally have NHL calibre depth. If injuries or transactions occur, there are definitely options out there that can help the team get better. And really, that is the difference between this year’s team and last. If injuries occurred to guys last year, we would see AHL calibre players come up for sure. This year, if and when we need some, we&#8217;ll have strong candidates for the job.</p>
