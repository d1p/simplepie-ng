			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can tell the news isn&#8217;t bad; if it was, you would&#8217;ve heard about it.</p>
<p>Instead, the news seems to back what legal responsible gun advocates have been saying for years.</p>
<blockquote><p>Murder and violent crime rates were supposed to soar after the Supreme Court struck down gun control laws in Chicago and Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Politicians predicted disaster. &#8220;More handguns in the District of Columbia will only lead to more handgun violence,&#8221; Washington’s Mayor Adrian Fenty warned the day the court made its decision. </p>
<p>Chicago’s Mayor Daley predicted that we would &#8220;go back to the Old West, you have a gun and I have a gun and we&#8217;ll settle it in the streets . . . .&#8221; </p>
<p>The New York Times even editorialized this month about the Supreme Court&#8217;s &#8220;unwise&#8221; decision that there is a right for people &#8220;to keep guns in the home.&#8221; </p>
<p>But Armageddon never happened. Newly released data for Chicago shows that, as in Washington, murder and gun crime rates didn&#8217;t rise after the bans were eliminated &#8212; they plummeted. They have fallen much more than the national crime rate. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the national media have been completely silent about this news.</p>
<p>One can only imagine the coverage if crime rates had risen. In the first six months of this year, there were 14% fewer murders in Chicago compared to the first six months of last year – back when owning handguns was illegal. It was the largest drop in Chicago’s murder rate since the handgun ban went into effect in 1982. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other four most populous cities saw a total drop at the same time of only 6 percent. </p>
<p>Similarly, in the year after the 2008 &#8220;Heller&#8221; decision, the murder rate fell two-and-a-half times faster in Washington than in the rest of the country. </p>
<p>It also fell more than three as fast as in other cities that are close to Washington&#8217;s size. And murders in Washington have continued to fall. </p></blockquote>
<p>The article has the links and even more stats that are sure to drive a nail into the &#8220;more legal guns = more crime&#8221; lie that the media and their gun-grabbing allies in DC would love you to buy into.  It just isn&#8217;t true no matter how many times it&#8217;s repeated.</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Per the DOT press release, the federal government will recover all of the $51 million in New Starts money provided to New Jersey for the ARC Project, and those funds will be made available to other areas for transit projects. The other $44 million were provided to New Jersey via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and it will be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, New Jersey must spent around $128 million it has from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality project funds on transit-related projects that DOT approved and reviewed. I guess the remaining funds — approximately $48 million — will remain with the Garden State.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every time I hear someone say they want this man to run, I just laugh. </p>
<p>My question, of course, is that other $48m&#8230;  Isn&#8217;t that Federal money too?  Why doesn&#8217;t Christie have to hand that back, also?  If the Feds gave him the money to do the ARC tunnel and he didn&#8217;t do the ARC tunnel, why does he get to keep it?</p>

<p>Amen to that.  It&#8217;s about being able to point and mock.</p>

<blockquote><i>Maybe only a really, really rich guy can credibly make the case for why the wealthy should be asked to pay more in taxes.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>  Do you see the insidious lie? Do you see the one word intentionally&nbsp;used&nbsp;incorrectly as outright propaganda? Do you see the fraud?
<p>    Unfortunately, I believe very few see the lie. The lie has been so successfully ingrained in our psyche we believe it to be real. We accept every word in Dionne&#8217;s sentence without question.</p>
<p>    Joseph Goebbels&#8217; was absolutely correct. He said, &#8220;If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Do you see the one word lie in Dionne&#8217;s blithe deceit?</p>
<p>    <b>It is his use of the word &#8220;asked.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>    Dionne uses the word &#8220;asked&#8221; when he actually means &#8220;forced.&#8221; Dionne does not want to <i>ask</i> the rich to pay may taxes. He wants the rich to be <i>forced</i> to pay more taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.bluecarp.com/2011/09/blithe-deceit.html">bluecarp.com</a></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why they couch their &#8220;demands&#8221; in terms like &#8220;asking?&#8221;  Is it just because it polls better? </p>
<p>The government doesn&#8217;t &#8220;ask&#8221; for anything.  It points a gun at you and says &#8220;give me or I shoot.&#8221;  Everyone is so worried about the third world country we could become if we don&#8217;t hand everything over for the good of the nation, what about what happens when the government just demands it all? </p>
<p>Always remember this: It&#8217;s not &#8220;asking&#8221; if I can&#8217;t say no.  Asking implies that the answer is a choice I&#8217;m free to make.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the video description:  <em>I was born deaf and 8 weeks ago I received a hearing implant.

<p>When you see a video like this, doesn&#8217;t it make you feel a pang of sickness that there are &#8220;deaf advocates&#8221; who would deprive this woman of this wonderful technology that will undoubtedly change her life?  And if you don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re out there, just hit up Google and search for things like &#8220;anti-cochlear implant&#8221; and such.  I honestly don&#8217;t get it, and I have to wonder why you would want to preserve (what they call) &#8220;deaf culture.&#8221;  As if a culture based on a disability is some honorable thing?</p>
<p>Newsflash: There&#8217;s no honor in dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>This woman&#8217;s life has changed.  For the better.  It would be barbaric to not afford her that opportunity.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obama administration so wanted Solyndra to succeed that it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/chu-takes-responsibility-for-a-loan-deal-that-put-more-taxpayer-money-at-risk-in-solyndra/2011/09/29/gIQArdYQ8K_story.html?hpid=z1#">kept feeding it cash after it defaulted.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Energy Secretary Steven Chu acknowledged Thursday making the final decision to allow a struggling solar company to continue receiving taxpayer money after it had technically defaulted on a $535 million federal loan guaranteed by his agency.</p>
<p>Chu spokesman Damien La­Vera said in a statement that the secretary approved the restructuring agreement for Solyndra because it gave the company “the best possible chance to succeed in a very competitive marketplace and put the company in a better position to repay the loan.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what happens when the government picks winners and losers.</p>
<p>I wish that was the most obvious fabrication in the story, though.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also Thursday, a law enforcement official confirmed that the criminal probe of Solyndra is focused on whether the company and its officers misrepresented the firm’s finances to the government in seeking the loan or engaged in accounting fraud. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a clear lie.  Solyndra didn&#8217;t lie about its finances, as evidenced by the fact that the DOE said no to a loan under the Bush administration.  As soon as Obama rolled into town, that changed.  Nothing changed about Solyndra, just the desire of the person in the Oval Office to push through a nice loan for a guy who donated large amounts of money to his campaign, a coincidence, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Solyndra was the first company approved for a loan guarantee under the Obama administration; its application originated several years earlier during George W. Bush’s presidency. Early on, there were concerns about Solyndra’s finances, but the company was still endorsed by President Obama and received high-profile support from Chu. Both visited the firm at different press events. Chu flew to California to announce the loan approval at the groundbreaking for a $750 million factory that was built mostly with funds from the loan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, they keep pointing out that the loan was originated during the Bush administration as if that&#8217;s relevant.  The Bush administration <a href="http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2011/09/14/obama-admin-tries-to-pin-solyndra-on-bush/">rejected the loan</a>.  The Obama administration took the loan up and passed it shortly after he was inaugurated.  The repeated mentioning of George W. Bush and his administration in every story about Solyndra strikes me as nothing more than a petty attempt to tie him to the scandal in an effort to paint it as bipartisan and thus lower the damage done to The Great One<sup>tm</sup>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly not, no matter how much Obama&#8217;s guardians at the editorial desks would like it to be.</p>

<p>This teacher is an asshole.  Plain and simple. </p>
<p>When you start banning kids from performing a common courtesy of saying &#8220;bless you&#8221; when people sneeze, you&#8217;re an asshole, especially when you can bet that even the most douchey of parents have spent years trying to get kids to be polite and teach them to say things like &#8220;please, thank you, and bless you.&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is really awesome stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers at the Spanish Superior Scientific Research Council (CSIC) have successfully completed Phase I human clinical trials of a HIV vaccine that came out with top marks after 90% of volunteers developed an immunological response against the virus. The MVA-B vaccine draws on the natural capabilities of the human immune system and &#8220;has proven to be as powerful as any other vaccine currently being studied, or even more&#8221;, says Mariano Esteban, head researcher from CSIC&#8217;s National Biotech Centre.</p>
<p>The MVA-B vaccine first showed promising signs back in 2008 when clinical trials involving mice and macaque monkeys demonstrated a very high efficiency against Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The recent human trials involved 30 healthy volunteers, where 24 were treated with MVA-B, while the other 6 were treated with a placebo, carried out over a 48 week period.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, we&#8217;re probably far off from a workable human vaccine, but this is still really awesome news.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter; <a href="http://wlsam.com/Article.asp?id=2298499&#038;spid">Democrats won&#8217;t get the blame anyway</a> even though if they moved as one, this bill would pass.</p>
<blockquote><p>On Tuesday, President Barack Obama tried to keep the pressure on Congress to consider his nearly $450 billion jobs bill, saying it had been two weeks since he sent the bill to Capitol Hill &#8220;and now I want it back.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I want it back, passed, so I can sign this bill and start putting people back to work,&#8221; Obama said Tuesday.<br />
So why have Democrats delayed action in the U.S. Senate on President Obama’s stimulus bill?<br />
   <br />
WLS Radio’s Bill Cameron reports his own party has delayed action in the Senate and talked with Senator Dick Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate, about the reason why.</p>
<p>“The oil-producing state senators don’t like eliminating or reducing the subsidy for oil companies, “ Durbin tells WLS Radio, “There are some senators who are up for election who say I’m never gonna vote for a tax increase while I’m up for election, even on the wealthiest people. So, we’re not gonna have 100% Democratic senators. That’s why it needs to be bi-partisan and I hope we can find some Republicans who will join us to make it happen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are no oil subsidies.  That&#8217;s a flat out lie.  Also, if Durbin would like to end <strong>all</strong> energy subsidies, I say go for it.  The fact that the American people cut a check to every crap form of green energy out there means that every one of them would go under in no time.  If you want to make sure the &#8220;evil big oil companies&#8221; stop getting subsidies, end them.  End all of them.  For all energy companies.</p>
<p>Oil will still be standing.  As will coal.  Why?  Because they don&#8217;t need subsidies (probably the reason they don&#8217;t get  them).  Try and make that same case for &#8220;green energy.&#8221;  In fact, I dare &#8220;green energy&#8221; companies to live by the same &#8220;subsidies&#8221; (which are actually tax deductions that <strong>any</strong> company that makes <strong>any</strong> product can get) that &#8220;big oil&#8221; gets.  I dare you, greenies.  I double dog dare you.  Make it work.  Turn your check-taking asses into corporate tax adjustments and see how long you survive.</p>
<p>Durbin&#8217;s pinning this on &#8220;big oil&#8221; is just laughable.  The plan isn&#8217;t getting excitement from Democrats because even the biggest dopes in the Senate can see that the bill is not a job creator.  No one buys the crap coming out of the White House anymore.  In 2009, when we were told we had to pass the stimulus immediately, we were told 8% was outrageous and can&#8217;t be allowed to happen.  If the unemployment rate hit 8% tomorrow, every Democrat who said we have to pass the stimulus to keep the unemployment rate from getting there would be dancing in the streets touting the success of the stimulus.</p>
<p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Even Democrats are starting to see it.</p>
<p>And before you argue about subsidies, you need to educate yourself, and bear in mind <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121055427930584069.html">this was in 2008</a>, so the numbers are most likely more offensive now.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some clarity comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent federal agency that tried to quantify government spending on energy production in 2007. The agency reports that the total taxpayer bill was $16.6 billion in direct subsidies, tax breaks, loan guarantees and the like. That&#8217;s double in real dollars from eight years earlier, as you&#8217;d expect given all the money Congress is throwing at &#8220;renewables.&#8221; Even more subsidies are set to pass this year.</p>
<p>An even better way to tell the story is by how much taxpayer money is dispensed per unit of energy, so the costs are standardized. For electricity generation, the EIA concludes that solar energy is subsidized to the tune of $24.34 per megawatt hour, wind $23.37 and &#8220;clean coal&#8221; $29.81. By contrast, normal coal receives 44 cents, natural gas a mere quarter, hydroelectric about 67 cents and nuclear power $1.59.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like I said; stop handing over checks to all of them and let the &#8220;alternative energy&#8221; companies use deductions that the oil companies use.  That ought to make the situation nice and fair.</p>
<p>A wise man once said, &#8220;If it&#8217;s viable, it doesn&#8217;t need a subsidy.  If it needs a subsidy, it&#8217;s not viable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demias Jimerson of Malvern, Ark., is 11 years old — and he’s so good at football that “he’s going to score almost every time he touches the ball,” according to his intermediate school principal, Terri Bryant.</p>
<p>In other words, he’s so good he must be stopped. Because Jimerson runs circles around the other kids on the field, Bryant has decided he’s not allowed to score more than three touchdowns, provided his team has at least a 14-point lead.</p>
<p>In Malvern, they call that “the Madre Hill” rule, after Razorback great Madre Hill, who, like Jimerson, grew up in the tiny Arkansas town and breezed by his competitors at mind-boggling speed.</p>
<p>According to Bryant, she’s re-invoking the rule not to punish Jimerson but to provide his competitors with a chance to develop as players, too.</p>

<p>Sure, because as we all know, players develop best when their competition gets kneecapped by people off the field. </p>
<p>Yet again, we punish success and try to &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; (literally).  It&#8217;s as if when we have true talent, instead of being proud of it and developing it and letting it flourish and creating an environment where true talent can excel, we feel guilty about it and try to knock them down so the lesser folks among us can feel like they aren&#8217;t being beaten that badly. </p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t allow the other kids to develop.  What it teaches them is that when someone is better than you, you just wait for someone else to artificially level the playing field so that they can&#8217;t do more and fully realize their own greatness. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real shame.</p>
