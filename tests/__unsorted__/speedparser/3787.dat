			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first discovered the SkiNets.com group when I went to Alpe d&#8217;Huez last season. Its ADH website, <a href="http://www.alpedhueznet.com/" target="_blank">http://www.alpedhueznet.com/</a>, was by far the best and most informative resort site I could find, beating even the official one. I didn&#8217;t quite realise it initially, but the above site was part of a much larger group that covers resorts throughout France and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Better yet, each resort has its own individual App for iOS &#8211; a bonus given that I&#8217;m heading to Val Thorens this season. The Apps are, essentially, the website in an easier to digest form. The home page gives you a quick resort overview &#8211; the weather for the next 3 days, when the last snowfall was, the number of pistes open, and the avalanche hazard. There&#8217;s also a news section providing tips and warnings regarding the weather, heavy traffic, and other considerations required when adventuring abroad for alpine action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-3-skinets-com/image/' title='Resort Overview'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Resort Overview" title="Resort Overview" /></a>
<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-3-skinets-com/image-1/' title='News'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image-1-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="News" title="News" /></a>
<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-3-skinets-com/image-2/' title='image (2)'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image-2-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="image (2)" title="image (2)" /></a>

<p>The Forecast pane gives more detailed information, including the wind speed and direction, the wind chill factor (which is much more important in a ski resort than it is in everyday life), the min and max temps, and the outlook. What&#8217;s more, this data is provided by <a href="www.snow-forecast.com " target="_blank">www.snow-forecast.com </a>(the subject of my previous post), so it&#8217;s guaranteed to be the best available report.</p>
<p>The remaining pane, &#8220;More&#8221;, contains a variety of useful tools. There are maps for both the piste and the resort; personally, I&#8217;m a fan of the traditional paper fold-out variety, but it&#8217;s nice knowing I have an easily-accessible piste map should I lose it. There&#8217;s an emergency contacts section (a feature which, I hope, I never have to use) listing the numbers for the Tourist Office, Mountain Rescue, Doctor, Police and Fire/Rescue services.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the usual webcams section (providing the resort has them), which can be useful to determine whether it&#8217;s worth trekking to the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The main drawback of these Apps is that they&#8217;re resort-specific. I had to purchase the Alpe d&#8217;Huez App last season, and had to spend another £0.69 this year for the Val Thorens version &#8211; nothing bank-breaking, but it&#8217;s a slight annoyance.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not heading to any of the supported resorts (listed below), the above will be of no real use to you, but if you are I&#8217;d most definitely recommend grabbing the related App. They&#8217;re all available on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/valthonet/id352756861?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and you can follow them on Twitter here: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/skinets" target="_blank">@skinets</a></p>
<p>Supported Resorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpe d&#8217;Huez</li>
<li>Avoriaz</li>
<li>Chamonix</li>
<li>Courchevel</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m going to be talking about SnowForecast, available on the App Store. This is the iOS version of the immensely popular <a href="http://www.snow-forecast.com/">Snow Forecast</a> website that, really, needs no introduction.</p>
<p>So, what features does the mobile app offer over the website? First-off, there’s the ability to find resorts nearby. Sitting in London, UK, my nearest resort is Pen-y-Fan in Wales (wonderful&#8230;), but this feature becomes many more times useful when you’re up in the mountains. For instance, I’m heading to Val Thorens in January; I’ll be boarding from ValT to Courchevel and Meribel, and it’ll be good to check on the weather quickly without having to search for the resorts individually.</p>

<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-2-snow-forecast/mzl-grnznleq/' title='mzl.grnznleq'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.grnznleq-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="mzl.grnznleq" title="mzl.grnznleq" /></a>
<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-2-snow-forecast/mzl-qpqhoots/' title='mzl.qpqhoots'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.qpqhoots-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="mzl.qpqhoots" title="mzl.qpqhoots" /></a>
<a href='http://howardlloyd.co.uk/2011/09/friday-app-focus-2-snow-forecast/mzl-tkpjozaf/' title='mzl.tkpjozaf'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mzl.tkpjozaf-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="mzl.tkpjozaf" title="mzl.tkpjozaf" /></a>

<p>In addition, you’re able to tag resorts as a Favourite, and they appear in the easily-accessible Favourites list. Again, this provides quick access to the resorts you care for, and really speeds up moving between individual resorts.</p>
<p>On the resort details page, you’re able to view Webcams, the regional Google Map, view a 6-day Forecast, and received snow updates for a single resort &#8211; handy!</p>
<p>SnowForecast is available on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/snow-forecast/id418032026?mt=8">AppStore</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Friday, starting today, I’ll be recommending an App I typically use while on skiing/boarding trips. Where possible, I’ll supplement the post with screenshots from my own iPhone, but for some apps you’ll have to make do with regular screenshots.</p>
<p>So, first up is the wonderful Ski Tracks. Taking advantage of the iPhone’s GPS capabilities, Ski Tracks presents an easy, yet powerful way of tracking your distance covered, maximum speed, number of runs, and other various statistics. I have used Ski Tracks on a number of trips now, and it’s always interesting to see the raw data for your outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>Your runs are broken down into stages; it’ll stop tracking your speed when it detects you’re going uphill, ie. you’re on a chair or gondola. It’s possible to see what time you started and finished, your maximum and average speeds, the distance covered, the vertical descent, and the maximum slope angle.<br />
Another feature is the ability to see your run on a Google map of the area. It plots the various stages for you, and is a great way to see just which runs were getting most of your attention.</p>
<p>The final track review feature are two graphs (altitude and speed) plotted against time, so you can see how your day progressed.</p>
<p>The below is a screenshot of my penultimate day in Ischgl, Austria last season. I should point out that I was on skis, not boarding, hence the higher speed.</p>
<div id="attachment_745" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 352px"><a href="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/VteLe.jpeg" rel="lightbox[744]"><img class="size-full wp-image-745 " title="Ski Tracks Ischgl" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/VteLe.jpeg" alt="" width="342" height="512" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New Personal Skiing Speed Record in Ischgl, Austria. March 2011</p></div>
<p>I tend to start Ski Tracks in the morning, and either opt to let it run throughout the day, or I’ll pause it while on extended breaks (e.g. eating lunch). Having one track for a whole day makes the reviewing statistics process a lot easier.</p>
<p>Rather handily, you’re able to set a battery percentage level where it’ll stop both tracking and music playback, so you don’t have to worry about being without a phone in the evening.</p>
<p>I’d say Ski Tracks is one of my essential, must-have apps for when I’m snowboarding. It’s a great way to encourage healthy competition between you and your buddies (who can go the fastest/who covered the most distance, etc), and is a great way of reflecting on the day’s events.</p>
<p>There are other apps out there (including Powderful, which I quite liked) that do the same job, but I’ve found Ski Tracks to be the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Ski Tracks is available on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ski-tracks-gps-track-recorder/id365724094?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the 2011/12 Winter season fast approaching, many people begin to research trips, buy gear, check flights and prepare their legs and livers. Over the years, as my interest has switched from skiing to snowboarding, so, too, have the websites that I’ve traditionally used in the past. However, a ‘core’ set of sites remain, and I’ll be listing these below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Packages/Transport/Hotels<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"> </span></h4>
<p>My Dad, like many other Brits, has always used Inghams, Crystal, or Thomson Ski to research and book his skiing trips. However, I have long maintained that they don’t present good value for money. Therefore, I set my Dad a challenge: research and spec a trip to Val Thorens for 3 people, and see if he could beat a package I could put together. I can’t remember specifics, but I managed to find a better hotel, better flight times from a closer airport, with the luxury of our own rental car, for roughly £200 pounds cheaper.</p>
<p>So, the sites. I’m sure there are many other (good) alternative options, but I typically use the following:</p>
<p>Flights: <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">www.skyscanner.net</a></p>
<p>Hotels: <a href="http://www.hotels.com">www.hotels.com</a>, <a href="http://www.booking.com">www.booking.com</a>, Google for “accommodation in &lt;resort&gt;”</p>
<p>Packages: <a href="http://www.directski.com">www.directski.com</a> &#8211; these guys managed to find accommodation, flights and transfers to Mayrhofen for much less than I could spec together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Gear<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"> </span></h4>
<p>Living in the UK presents a problem: a lot of the big US snowboard companies don’t have established retail POS locations, and some (including Burton) don’t have an online store for anything but clothing and accessories. There are the traditional UK chains that do offer hardware, Snow&amp;Rock and Ellis Brigham being the obvious two, but I’ve found alternative options have always served me better.</p>
<p>Gear: <a href="http://www.blue-tomato.com">www.blue-tomato.com</a> &#8211; One of the first retailers in Europe to stock the new Burton stuff when it launched on Saturday 14th August, and as a result they got my money. Speedy shipping from Austria, too.</p>
<p>Ski wear: <a href="http://www.simplypiste.com">www.simplypiste.com</a> &#8211; These guys stock a large range of gear, and their customer service is fantastic. Recommended.</p>
<p>Goggles: <a href="http://www.rxsport.co.uk/">http://www.rxsport.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Burton-specific: <a href="http://www.weloveburtonsnowboards.com/">http://www.weloveburtonsnowboards.com/</a></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Information<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"> </span></h4>
<p>It’s sometimes difficult to find good, reliable information, but I’ve always sworn by the Where to Ski and Snowboard book. The website (<a href="http://www.wheretoskiandsnowboard.com/">http://www.wheretoskiandsnowboard.com/</a>), while good, is nowhere near as good as the book. It’s well regarded as one of the snow bibles &#8211; go buy it.</p>
<p>However, outside of this, I’ve always found good information from Snowboard Club UK (<a href="http://www.snowboardclub.co.uk">www.snowboardclub.co.uk</a>), Gone Boarding (<a href="http://www.goneboarding.co.uk">www.goneboarding.co.uk</a>) and Snowboarding Forum (<a href="http://www.snowboardingforum.com">www.snowboardingforum.com</a>)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This trip came as a surprise; both in terms of the opportunity and how quickly it materialised. I received a message from Dan on Monday afternoon wondering if I&#8217;d be interested in a quick trip to Laax. Once I learned of the details, and the price, I couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re flying out on a Thursday night just before Xmas, boarding for 3 days, and then flying home late Sunday evening. There&#8217;s minimal impact on work, and the price (roughly £300 for flights, accommodation and ski pass) is fantastic.</p>
<p>Season 11/12 is shaping up to be the best yet, with trips to Laax and Zermatt in Switzerland, Val Thorens in France and Mayrhofen in Austria. Bring it on!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a few weeks of research, and a manic few days of full-on site-scouring, my third trip of the season is confirmed. I&#8217;m going to be heading off to Mayrhofen, Austria for a week in January/February. It&#8217;s a resort I&#8217;ve always wanted to board, and now I&#8217;m finally going to get the chance. I&#8217;m heading there with the Alex, Andy, Ali and Olly (who accompanied me to Alpe d&#8217;Huez this year) and Dan, who I&#8217;ve been to pretty much everywhere with.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no other word in the dictionary that more accurately portrays the English summer than &#8216;fickle&#8217;. What can be a glorious day one moment can quickly (and often does) deteriorate into the drizzly normality we have come to expect. So you&#8217;ll forgive me, then, for thinking ahead to the winter snow season in mid-July.</p>
<p>Currently, I have two trips cemented in place, with a third in the early planning stages. First-up I have my annual family trip away with my Dad and Brother. In January 2012 we&#8217;ll be heading to Val Thorens, France. I&#8217;ve heard the powder is fantastic, so I&#8217;m itching to get back on my board and into the white stuff.</p>
<p>In March I&#8217;m heading back to Zermatt, Switzerland. It&#8217;s such a wonderful resort that I&#8217;m already excited at the prospect.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m looking to sort a trip in February with my Uni mates. I&#8217;m not sure on the destination yet, but it&#8217;ll be somewhere snow-sure with a good party vibe. Ischgl is a strong possibility.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big White will always have a special place in my heart. It&#8217;s the first ski resort I ever went to and, as a result, is the place I learned to ski. I&#8217;m pretty lucky in the sense that I learned in absolutely perfect conditions. Not only was the snow the best I&#8217;ve ever skied on, but I was the only person in my lesson group &#8211; essentially bagging me a heavily-discounted private lesson.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_713" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 522px"><a href="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0601.jpg" rel="lightbox[712]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-713  " title="IMG_0601" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0601.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Powder heaven. Big White, Feb. 2009</p></div>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>The snow is unbelievable. Big White&#8217;s tagline is, &#8216;It&#8217;s the snow&#8221;, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. There&#8217;s so much snow that the evergreen trees have been nicknamed <a href="http://www.erikhenne.com/images/Big%20White%20snow%20ghosts%20with%20sun%20tree%20covered%20in%20snow%202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="lightbox[712]">snow ghosts</a>.</li>
<li>The village has a real ski resort charm to it.</li>
<li>The scenery is fantastic.</li>
<li>The ski school is excellent and is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Lift system is speedy and copes with the crowds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resort is pretty small, both the village itself and the extent of the pistes.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a bit of a treck to get to. The nearest airport is Kelowna, and it&#8217;s about a 2hr drive from the airport to the resort. If you&#8217;re flying in from anywhere other than BC you&#8217;ll typically have to fly via Vancouver.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rating: 8/10. If you&#8217;re looking for a family-friendly, more intimate resort than Whistler/Blackcomb, you&#8217;d can do a lot worse than Big White. While there are some drawbacks, the snow quality more than makes up for it. I still have dreams about all that wonderful, wonderful powder&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Val d&#8217;Isere is undoubtedly one of my favourite European resorts. The combination of extensive pistes, guaranteed snow and village charm make an attractive package. With access to neighbouring Tignes, it&#8217;s possible to ski all day, every day and have little repition. The off piste action is also superb, with many spots serviced by drag lifts or similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 372px"><a href="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/29328_582173070350_200900291_34753187_6730753_n.jpg" rel="lightbox[694]"><img class=" " title="val" src="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/29328_582173070350_200900291_34753187_6730753_n.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="483" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Val d&#39;Isere village, March 2010</p></div>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snow snow snow. Even during years where the average snowfall across the Alps is less than stellar, Val d&#8217;Isere receives enough of the white stuff to allow for off piste powder forays.</li>
<li>Quality of restaurants is superb.</li>
<li>Location is great, with easy access to Tignes and other resorts such as Les Arcs a short trip away.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price. It is the main factor that prevents most people from staying in Val d&#8217;Isere itself. Lots opt to stay in the relatively cheaper (but uglier and quieter) Tignes.</li>
<li>Not the easiest resort to get to, with around a 2hr+ drive from Chambery airport and long, winding road with little overtaking opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rating: 10/10. There&#8217;s not many resorts that can compete with Val d&#8217;Isere for snow and piste extent (Zermatt being the main contender), and it&#8217;s a place that every keen skier or boarder should experience at least once in their life. It&#8217;s a wonderful resort.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obergurgl (and its neighbour, Hochgurgl) represent what Austria has to offer: reliable snow, charming villages and crazy aprés-ski. Obergurgl was the second resort in Europe I skied, and while I am unlikely to go back any time soon, I definitely recommend it, particularly for beginners.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 372px"><a href="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/obergurgl.jpg" rel="lightbox[675]"><img class=" " title="obergurgl" src="http://howardlloyd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/obergurgl.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="483" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taken from the top of Hochgurgl, Jan. 2010</p></div>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a high resort, so the snow is reliable. The Ötztal valley is known for its snow, and Obergurgl/Hochgurgl gets the best of it.</li>
<li>Aprés-ski is one of its strong points. The Nederhütte is famous (ranked 3rd best Aprés bar in Austria), and while the village is pretty quiet, there are some good spots (Josl Kellar being one)</li>
<li>Relatively quiet, so the pistes don&#8217;t get busy.</li>
<li>Great for beginners!</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will eventually end up doing the same runs day after day. Piste variety is not one of the strong points.</li>
<li>Relatively quiet village, despite the few places that are rocking.</li>
<li>Not so great for experts, though there is some wonderful off-piste action to be had.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rating: 7/10. The snow quality is what bumps up the score, as does the aprés, but aside from that I have no real desire to head back to Obergurgl any time soon.</p>
