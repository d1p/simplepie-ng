			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m just starting to have discussions with people on developing visualisations of scholarly digital footprints, and exploring the existing space to work with. Theres a huge range of systems and work in progress, and a lot of APIs to look at. This post is really just a collection of resources and ideas that could be important, categorised to make things a bit more coherent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Potential Ideas for Representations:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em><strong>Individual Network:</strong></em> </strong></span>A persons&#8217; individual network of followers and how they interact with it is a second topic that of particular interest. In this case, there are obvious aspects like the number of followers, followed, tweets made etc that can be analysed and represented. This can, in a very basic way, identify those who are more prolific digital scholars using one service or another. Content analysis similar to that done by <a href="http://tweetpsych.com/" target="_blank">tweetpsych</a>could provide more detail as to what purpose the persons&#8217; tweets have, while retweets or a proliferation of terms between a user and their followers could suggest forms of impact. Combining an individual perspective and that of a community (defined by shared followers, terms used in personal descriptions etc), it would be possible to present a person with a set of clusters representing the communities they appear to be a part of on Twitter or other services.<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Communities:</em></strong>It would be ideal to get an idea of what kinds of &#8216;communities&#8217; there are on digital networks, or what this concept might mean in terms of these systems. What has actually happened as I&#8217;ve considered this issue is that the question of what community is and why it matters has come to mind. A <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/community">dictionary definition</a> talks about locality, a group with a common interest or forming a sub-section of society, and finally, &#8220;sharing, participation, and fellowship&#8221;</p>
<p>It is possible to use followers, followed connections etc, and through this it would be possible to see the connections of two or more people, but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily identify a &#8216;community&#8217; in the normal sense of the word: I might follow someone on Twitter in a very passive way, or me and a colleague might both follow guardiantech, or Stephen Fry, but it might be that such a connection doesn&#8217;t really qualify as being part of a &#8216;community&#8217;. In terms of the above definition, you could argue that there is a shared common interest, but unless there is two-way interaction, it does not fit with the concepts of sharing, participation and fellowship. So two-way connections linking multiple people (being followed and following and sharing users in the same way) is probably a better approach to start distinguishing people who may form a shared community.</p>
<p>In terms of shared interests, it is also possible to search for a particular term, and see those who mention it, either in their tweets or in their biographical description. It could be assumed that people who mention the open university in their personal description have some relationship with it, but this could be anything from joining as a student, to watching a tv show, to being a visiting academic or an employee. Its a start towards getting a data set of an existing community though.</p>
<p>Beyond using Twitter as an example, it would be possible to compare activity with other systems, perhaps comparing it to something like <a href="http://www.yammer.com/" target="_blank">Yammer</a>, which works as a closed network for an organisation like the OU. Of course, the systems have different functionality and constraints, but some interesting patterns could emerge -using Yammer certainly feels closer to the ideal of a community, as there is a pre-existing bond and shared interests as members of the OU, plus in many cases a proximity.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Collection of Scholars&#8217; Accounts:</em></strong> There is no reason why it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to collect a set of scholars&#8217; accounts on services such as twitter, or use biographical information to identify them automatically. This could then be used for averaging or comparing tasks (e.g. as an individual scholar using Twitter, how do you compare or contrast to others or the average). It would be important to try and get a good range of scholars through some method, otherwise could just end up with scholars in our disciplines. Another issue is authentication, in some cases this gives us a great deal more data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Existing Inspirations and related Blogs:</strong></span></p>
<p>There is a mass of relevant systems and blog posts out there, including:</p>
<p><a href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> , <a href="http://tweetpsych.com/">TweetPsych</a> and this nice little <a href="http://www.neuroproductions.be/twitter_friends_network_browser/">Twitter Network Browser</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">Tony Hirsts&#8217; blog</a>, particularly posts such as <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2010/09/13/structural-differences-in-hashtag-communities-highly-interconnected-or-not/">this one on network analysis of hashtags in Twitter</a> and <a title="this one on Gephi visualisations and filters" href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2010/04/23/getting-started-with-gephi-network-visualisation-app-%E2%80%93-my-facebook-network-part-ii-basic-filters/" target="_blank">this one on Gephi visualisations and filters</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://diving-4-pearls.blogspot.com/">Rebecca Fergusons&#8217; blog</a> on learning analytics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Data Sources and APIs:</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/w/page/22554679/Twitter-API-Documentation" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.yammer.com/api_doc.html" target="_blank">Yammer</a> APIs</p>
<p><strong>Data Crunching and Visualisation Platforms:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html" target="_blank">Twitter4J</a> &#8211; A library for running twitter queries in java. Methods are in the <a href="http://twitter4j.org/en/javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">javadoc</a>. There are also <a href="http://twitter.pbworks.com/w/page/1779907/Scripts" target="_blank">libraries for PHP, Drupal etc.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/" target="_blank">Yahoo Pipes</a> is a consistent feature in a lot of work to use data collected from the various networks.</p>
<p><a href="http://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a> is an application for producing visualisations from data sets, particularly for network analysis. <a href="http://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/gdf-format/" target="_blank">Here is a useful page</a> about the GDF format Gephi uses for node and edge data. Looks fairly straightforward to produce these files from code (e.g. see link in comment from Tony Hirst below). Also, there is the <a href="http://gephi.org/toolkit/" target="_blank">Gephi toolkit</a>, a java library that could be used in combination with Twitter4j or other tools. <a href="http://jung.sourceforge.net/">The Java Universal Network / Graph Framework &#8211; JUNG -</a> looks like a useful tool for putting interactive visualisations in to web browsers through an applet or servlet.</p>
<p><a href="http://nodexl.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">NodeXL</a> is another system for this purpose that acts as a plug-in to MS Excel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst still continuing to develop the system, activities and conceptual understanding in the Out There and In Here (OTIH) project, I am about to begin a new role on a project to understand <a href="http://digschol.tumblr.com/">Digital Scholarship</a>. As a starting point, it makes sense to consider not just how this is a new direction, but how OTIH, this, and my work prior to that follow some patterns that might be interesting (and constitute a wider &#8216;direction&#8217; that my research is taking me in!)</p>
<p>One point of crossover that has been identified with colleagues is the potential to combine interactive visualisations of <em>data</em> with interactive visualisations of <em>concepts</em> as a tool for dialogue, reflection and the development of understanding.</p>
<p>In OTIH the data could be photos or measurements collected by those in the field. In the Digital Scholarship project, there is an interest in understanding a persons&#8217; digital <em>footprint</em>, a semi-automated analysis of their use of the web for content creation and social networking, the sites they use and how and when they use them.</p>
<p>In both cases this data is <em>located</em> in time and space, though in the case of the digital footprint, this is a virtual spatial location (e.g. located at a site such as WordPress or Flickr). People have a natural instinct to use spatial metaphors to understand the web, and this has resulted in some very nice visualisations such as <em><a href="http://map.web2summit.com/" target="_blank">Points of Control</a></em>.</p>
<p>In both cases, this data is used as an essential part of a wider process of analytical thinking. In the inquiry learning that occurs with OTIH this is conceptualised as hypothesis development or sensemaking. In the Digital Scholarship project, the visualisations of data are likely to be used as a discussion and reflection tool during interviews, and as a tool for researchers to analyse and reflect on questions such as &#8216;what is considered to be valuable to a digital scholar?&#8217;, &#8216;what characterises a good networker or content producer?&#8217; or &#8216;what are the common characteristics of scholars&#8217; attitudes towards distinguishing formal, work related online activities and recreational use outside of work?&#8217;.</p>
<p>In both cases, reflection on the data should lead to better understanding, novel ideas and the recognition of the &#8216;big picture&#8217;. These processes are essential to research and visualisations have been one of the areas where computing has been highly effective as a research tool.</p>
<p>A great deal of research and development has looked at visualising data in various ways (e.g. <a href="http://www.macrofocus.com/public/products/infoscope/">Infoscope</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/nodexl/">NodeXL,</a> or in a radically different form, AR platforms such as <a href="http://www.wikitude.org/en">Wikitude</a>)</p>
<p>Similarly, a large number of systems exist to support concept mapping, argumentation and idea representation (e.g. <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a> or my <a href="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~tc225/AS/" target="_blank">Associative Scrapbook</a>).</p>
<p>One question to investigate is therefore &#8211; since these two are so inherently linked in the process of scientific inquiry and even beyond that &#8211; what systems could build a bridge and bring together the visualisation of data and the analytical, conceptual development that builds on this?</p>
<p>In particular, such systems could aim to support planning, reflection and awareness in dialogues or collaborations, whether co-located or distanced. They could make explicit conceptual reasoning grounded by data, and connect a review of data to a wider understanding of its&#8217; context. By interacting with data and representing ideas and concepts based on this, users could develop knowledge artifacts. These could take many forms, but one inspiration could be thinking about this in terms of a collaborative interface for producing <em><a href="http://www.coolinfographics.com/" target="_blank">infographic</a></em> representations, that aim to <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/awesome-free-tools-infographics/" target="_blank">combine data and understanding</a> in a clear, concise form.</p>
