			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, he answered: “Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is going to be a long one. I&#8217;ve decided to lump parts 2 and 3 together. Fasten your seatbelt.</em></p>
<p>May 10th, 2000. This day will be forever scarred into my mind. 8 am on what I think was a Tuesday and the front door goes crazy. Someone is ringing the doorbell like a mad man and there is pounding like you don&#8217;t want to hear at 8am on a Tuesday. I figured that our prankster friends were coming over for breakfast. My mother is on the phone in a bathrobe and I&#8217;m playing with the cat before leaving for school. John is still asleep and my brother has already left for 5th grade.</p>
<p>My mom yells for me to answer quickly so not to wake up John, and I run to the front door. I open it to a full S.W.A.T team with guns drawn and battering ram staring me in the face. They immediately rush the house yelling &#8220;FBI, who&#8217;s in the house?&#8221; I was dragged outside and questioned by the local police while my mom had her phone slapped out of her hand and arm pinned behind her back. I guess they thought the phone she was holding was dangerous or something. John was contained upstairs in the bedroom and we couldn&#8217;t see him for a good half hour while they secured the house. For the next several hours, they searched and seized just about everything. The Corvette, jewelry, cash (lots of cash), computers, safes and lock boxes, file cabinets and dozens of floppy discs were loaded up and taken away to be thoroughly scrutinized. My mother and I were questioned but ultimately let go and asked to leave.</p>
<p>To this day I still have a bit of post traumatic stress about door bells and heavy knocking. My heart races and I get very agitated when this happens.</p>
<p>For the next year, things were quite a bit different (as if that was tough to figure out). They froze all of our assets. John&#8217;s security team ran sweeps of the house for bugs, and we didn&#8217;t actually move back in for a couple of weeks. I remember that in order to pay bills, my step sister and I would go from bank branch to bank branch withdrawing $9500 cash at each one because it was just under the minimum to declare why you were taking the money. I would be sitting shotgun with stacks of cash that would make any rapper blush.</p>
<p>A year or so went by and eventually John was arrested. He was taken to Seattle where he was held until trial. Oh I almost forgot… He was taken to Seattle and held until trial because the man fled the country to Costa Rica and thought he was going to convince my mom to bring all of us down there and we&#8217;d make a new life on the run from the law. No, I&#8217;m not kidding.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty for reasons unknown. I speculate that it&#8217;s because he was making a deal that would keep his family from facing any charges. During his sentence, he would write me letters quoting Bible verses and telling me how everything was going to be ok. Never once did he admit that anything he did was wrong.</p>
<p>About a year into it, my mom went up to visit him, where he proceeded to berate her for everything that had happened, blaming it all on her and accusing her of wasting thousands of dollars while he was in jail. The divorce was final a few months later. I still am in awe sometimes of how my mom handled the situation. If there ever needed to be a movie made about the strength and wisdom of a person under stress, give my momma call!</p>
<p>Throughout this entire escapade, my dad stayed calm and supportive of me and my family. I can only imagine the stuff that must have been going through his head about what his kids and first wife were going through. But he never condemned, never judged, never got angry. Again, if there ever needed to be a movie made about the patience and unconditional love of a person, give my pops a call!</p>
<p>By this time I was in high school and devastatingly ashamed of everything that had gone on in my life. It was years before I ever told the story of what had been happening to any of my friends. I was afraid that they&#8217;d judge me, make fun of me, want nothing to do with me, all of it. I learned to switch off and become cold to all emotions surrounding the events. It was a defense mechanism that helped me cope trough a lot of things I didn&#8217;t fully understand.</p>
<p>My mom is a hero to me. Plain and simple. I saw her go from years of not having a job to supporting me and my brother as a single mom for the first time in her life. She hustled. She worked crazy hours, sacrificed where ever she needed and made sure there was food on the table every night. I started working at an ice cream shop to earn some extra money when I was 14 or 15. One of my fondest memories was at Christmas one year when my mom decided not to buy a Christmas tree so she could spend that money on gifts for me and my brother. I got to go out and buy her one with my own money. I will never understand how people can disrespect money after being given the opportunity to do that for her. Was one of the best Christmases ever.</p>
<p>I made it through high school. I had the uncanny ability to never study for anything and ace all of my tests. I slacked off everywhere I could, and when college came I was unprepared to say the least. I moved out my senior year of high school with my best friend Steve and we got an apartment together. When you&#8217;re the only one of your friends who lives on their own, it&#8217;s pretty much assumed that they&#8217;re all going to hang out there. And that&#8217;s exactly what we did. That first summer I don&#8217;t think there was a single night we didn&#8217;t have at least one person over. We partied like we were kings, and somehow managed to escape without paying thousands of dollars for repairs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, college wasn&#8217;t for me. I was disenchanted with the entire concept of college. I felt like everyone around me was judgmental. This might have been me projecting my baggage on others or something, but I didn&#8217;t have any engaging experiences that I thought college should provide. I also had no idea how to study. Note taking was not in my bag of tricks to say the least. I changed majors a couple of times and was never satisfied with what I ended up picking. I started taking classes for one particular course, and would change directions and have to start over again. All of this while footing a bill of what at the time seemed like insane amounts of money. (I now realize that it was just a drop in the bucket of what people actually pay for their education, so I&#8217;m glad I got out early).</p>
<p>Instead I started working in customer service at a major internet firm. I still work there today and I love it! I&#8217;ve been opened up to a whole new world of entrepreneurial gloriousness (if that isn&#8217;t a word, it should be). This place was the school I was looking for all along. I moved around to a few different departments to spread my wings and ended up where I am now working with some of the best and brightest in the industry. I was afforded the ability to purchase my first home when I was 19, and jumped at the opportunity. This was major turning point #2 for my life.</p>
<p>I bought a house in Queen Creek in 2006. If you live in Arizona, you probably know that real estate purchases + Queen Creek + 2006 = a REALLY bad idea. The bubble burst, I took a pay cut, lived at least an hour away from all of my friends, and in general hated living there. To top it off, I was about to go through one of the largest personal struggles of my young life.</p>
<p>I took a trip with my church to Swaziland, Africa in 2007. To this day it was one of the single best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had and has shaped so much of what I value and respect that I recommend a trip like that to every single person in their 20s. I spent two weeks renovating abandoned houses for orphans to live in and visited schools. Swaziland holds the highest HIV infection rate in the world, with over 50% of the population infected. Research estimates that if radical measures aren&#8217;t taken immediately, the Swazi people will be extinct by 2025. It&#8217;s eliminating the working class so no one is able to keep the economy running and as a result, everyone is dying. We got the chance to travel to one of the villages and plant crops for people with no other way to support themselves, and no money to buy seed to plant food that will be their primary source of sustenance for the next coming season. It. Was. Amazing.</p>
<p>When I returned home my perspective on the American way of life shifted drastically. I despised wealth. Anyone who drove a luxury car or God forbid owned a boat was single-handedly contributing to the destruction of the African people in my eyes. I&#8217;ve since come to understand and accept that this isn&#8217;t the case (well, not all the time anyway <img src='http://kicklucky.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> ) and that putting that judgement on people is not the way I want to live. But after all I had been through with John and going from one end of the financial spectrum, I was a mess. I did well for myself considering that I had no formal education and was still too young to drink legally. I wrestled with my own financial position and fell into a deep depression that took me down a long lonely road. I began to self medicate and inflict harm to my body. I had a set of french doors that I took of the hinges and set up in my garage. I would get so angry that I would just lay into them until I couldn&#8217;t lift my arm anymore. I was isolated and had thoughts of suicide regularly.</p>
<p>A friend and co-worker took notice and probably did the most impactful thing that they could and it truly did set me on the path to recovery. To this day I don&#8217;t know if they really know what it meant, but if you&#8217;re reading this THANK YOU!. I came into work one day with my hands all swollen and bruised and cut all over my knuckles and they walked over to my desk, dropped the business card to a counselor on my keyboard and walked away without saying anything.</p>
<p>I called. I went. I spent two days a week working through junk that needed working through. It wasn&#8217;t easy. She challenged me on a lot of things that made me angry and exhausted. But it worked. I got my proverbial crap together and a year later left that office at peace.</p>
<p>Shortly after I left counseling, I sold my house in Queen Creek, met a girl, and started a new chapter in my life. I got involved with a church that has become an extension of my family and I an extension of theirs. They support me, challenge me, motivate me, and can put up with me and my antics. I love all of them to death and would do just about anything for them. When it didn&#8217;t work out with the girl, they stepped up and supported me 110% and walked with me through a lot of what was going on in my head.</p>
<p>So here I am today. I work in the internet industry and cannot get enough of it. I work in the loving people industry and cannot get enough of it. I work in the giving grace industry and CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF IT! I don&#8217;t know what lies ahead for me, but I know that I&#8217;ve got family and friends and a loving God who are in my corner making all things work together for my good. I try to travel to Haiti twice a year to continue working with orphans and it gets better every time. I&#8217;m developing relationships with people who I admire and love greatly through this type of work. I may go back to school, I may not. I now know that either way, I&#8217;ve got a mother and father who don&#8217;t think any less of me and support me completely. I have some of the greatest friends anyone can ask for. They know exactly when I need a break from the routine of day-to-day life and can cheer me up at a moments notice. They challenge me to grow and drop bombs of grace that make me proud. Oh yea, and they&#8217;re die-hard college football fans. GO BIG RED!</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading and may you find the things I&#8217;ve found and come to understand that grace is there whether you think you can handle it or not. I encourage you to grab ahold of it and run like the wind because no one ever lay on their death-bed and think to back on their life and say &#8220;You know what I wish I lived more cautiously. I wish I took less risks.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve tried writing this before. Several times, actually. I&#8217;ve yet to be satisfied with the way it turns out and scrap the idea that I can ever get it written in a blog friendly format. Well here I am again and this time I&#8217;m going to make it work whether or not it fits within the constraints of whats considered &#8220;blog format&#8221;. Maybe this won&#8217;t be an SEO superstar, but I never started this blog to get ranked on Google. This is my story. I&#8217;ve decided to break it up into different entries, so stay tuned for more. Here we go.</p>
<p>My name is Brett. I was born in Portland, Maine. My father worked for a fencing company and did well for himself 8 months out of the year when the ground wasn&#8217;t frozen so bad you&#8217;d never build a fence without first blasting the earth with dynamite. My mother was a full-time mom and part-time cheering coach. My younger brother Bryce was always outgoing and could capture an audience of relatives for hours.</p>
<p>Enter Amway. Yes Amway. The people who showed up at your door selling shampoo and all-purpose cleaner by the truckload. My parents got involved as a side business that would help out during the winter when work was slow. This is what lead me to Phoenix when I was 9 years old.</p>
<p>We relocated with business partners with the intentions of starting a network out here and running the Amway show. It was a pretty exciting prospect, especially if you listened to a certain person talk about (more on him later). Life was hectic for the next few years. My parents fell into some financial struggles that ultimately ended in bankruptcy and divorce. I love my parents wholeheartedly, and I believe that they&#8217;re significantly happier now than I ever remember, so I look back on these times as a learning experience, and have no regrets. I got a chance to see how strong my mother is, and how patient my father is and those are two of the biggest qualities that I admire about them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my mom remarried to a man named John. he was the &#8220;certain person&#8221; from a few moments ago. John was a public speaker and serial networker. His role in Amway consisted of seminars and workshops that would motivate existing Amway members and recruit new ones. And he was good at it. But by the time he came into my life, Amway was behind all of us. He wanted more. He was a workaholic that didn&#8217;t have much growing up so now was the opportunity to make up for lost time. There were years ahead of excess and taking what many consider as the American dream and laughing at how small-minded it was. Be ready, because I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m afraid that what will follow in the next few paragraphs will sound negative or scathing, so bear with me because it comes full circle in the end, I promise.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things started out slow for us. I don&#8217;t care what kind of business you work in, if you plan to start it from scratch it&#8217;s going to take time. There were a couple of rough years where we skated by on just enough to make ends meet. Enter J.W. This was John&#8217;s new business partner and the man who set us on a course that would forever change my life and the lives of my family forever.</p>
<p>John and J.W. started a series of multi level marketing investment pools that made us instant millionaires. They seemed quite harmless to us, the uneducated, but anyone who&#8217;s read a newspaper in the last 10 years and knows the name Bernie Madoff knows that &#8220;investment pools&#8221; are many times masquerades for Ponzi Schemes, or Pyramid Schemes. These were exactly that.</p>
<p>Over the course of 4 years or so, John and J.W. defrauded roughly 74 million dollars from people. We&#8217;re not talking about criminals and shady bankers either. We stole from old ladies retirement funds and single mom&#8217;s hoping to earn a couple extra bucks on the side in order to buy their kid new clothes for the coming school year. We involved relatives and neighbors. There wasn&#8217;t anyone to whom we wouldn&#8217;t pitch the idea.</p>
<p>John bought everything. EVERYTHING. If there was a toy out there, we had it. Dirt bikes, 4 wheelers, cars, tools, campers, guns, jewelry, surround sound stereos and giant TVs. I remember them saying we spent almost $100,000 on the landscaping for our house (which by the way attracted a lot of negative attention from our neighbors). We had 500 acres of land up in the painted desert. John had an obsession with office supplies and we&#8217;d go to Staples and spend in one day what a family of four could eat on in a few months. Gaudy Rolex watches and giant diamond tennis bracelets were common.</p>
<p>In addition to material possessions, we also bought into a healthy dose of paranoia. It was about 1997 at this point, and John was convinced that the work was going to end. He believed in Y2K and thought that NATO and the World Bank were going to set off the end times as described in the Bible. We had storage units filled with canned food along with hundreds of pounds of ammunition and rows upon rows of office supplies. (I always imagined someone walking by as we were organizing it&#8211;which was a monthly routine&#8211; and bursting into laughter at the ridiculous combination of army surplus ammo containers next to piles of green beans and sticky notes). We also hired a team of ex-special forces to accompany my mom and step father to speaking engagements and conferences all over the world. I remember they used to go by their code names like Bam Bam, AK, and a few others that I can&#8217;t spell because they were in different languages. Eevaz I think. Anyway, it was intense. They even wore the little ear pieces like you see in the movies.</p>
<p>At one point, John tried convincing my mom that they should get divorced on paper and live married under common law because it had something to do with &#8220;entities&#8221; and other big vague words sound really important. She wasn&#8217;t having it. He was even convinced that we could buy the deed for the land our house was built on from the railroad (because the railroad owns all the land) and it would set up as a sovereign state where he could shoot law enforcement on site if they came onto his property. Very scary stuff.</p>
<p>When Y2K did hit, we would never have known about it. We moved up to that land in the painted desert and lived there for a few weeks while everything blew over. They were even building a bomb shelter. If you&#8217;ve seen Terminator 2 and remember the weapons cache that was hidden underground in Mexico… that was on the list to be built as well.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s recap here for a minute. Millions of dollars in laundered money in offshore bank accounts. A storehouse of supplies that cult leaders and office supply chains would covet, and a giant cache of weapons by the time I was 14. I look back and wonder how we didn&#8217;t come up on someone&#8217;s radar much earlier. But soon enough, we would.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned for part two, coming to a theater near you soon&#8230; probably tomorrow since I already wrote it.</em></p>
