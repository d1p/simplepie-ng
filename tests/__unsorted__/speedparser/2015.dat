This morning, the State Department notified   U.K. national Kerim Yildiz, the executive director of the Kurdish Human Rights   Project, that it   would issue him a visa to travel to the U.S.  We’re hoping that the visa will be   issued quickly so that Mr. Yildiz will be able to collect the &lt;a href="http://www.gruberprizes.org/GruberPrizes/Justice_LaureateOverview.php?awardid=66"&gt;Gruber   Justice Prize&lt;/a&gt; later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/ideological-exclusion-again"&gt;blogged   about Yildiz's problem getting a visa&lt;/a&gt; on last month; the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/us/kurdish-advocates-visa-delay-prompts-push-for-answers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New   York Times&lt;/em&gt; ran a story about Yildiz on   Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re very pleased that the State   Department is taking this step,” said Jameel Jaffer, Deputy Legal Director of   the ACLU.  “Mr. Yildiz is a respected human rights advocate and the   United   States should be supporting his work, not   inhibiting it.”&lt;/p&gt;

The rally, which took place on 1 October was one of the few gay rights events which had been approved by authorities. Participants in the rally found themselves faced with protesters, some of whom threw tomatoes at them. Authorities are trying to work out how many of those arrested were involved in the rally, and how many were trying to stop it. Attempts to hold gay pride marches in Russian cities in the past have been &lt;a title="Index on Censorship - MOSCOW GAY PRIDE ORGANISERS COMPLAIN ABOUT BAN TO EUROPEAN COURT" href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2010/02/moscow-gay-pride-russi/"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; by police, church activists and football fans.

	&lt;p&gt;To further extend our reach and impact, at home and abroad, Index on Censorship launched a world-wide regional editors programme last year.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Four programmes each year for three years will begin in different priority regions for freedom of expression, each one led by regional experts with local contacts, expertise and language skills. These part-time positions are offered on a 12-month basis, with the intention that editors will continue to contribute to Index at the end of this period.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These roles are intended to be in-country however with the exception of Tunisia they will cover wider issues in the region. Russia will cover the Former Soviet bloc and Thailand will examine South East Asia&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The editor-advocates will play an essential role in Index’s plans for website expansion, bringing in a wider group of contributors and bloggers for the website. They will be talent scouts – advising us on emerging artists, musicians, free speech advocates, lawyers and writers directly engaging with challenging political issues or censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The local editors’ role is to help the website ­– which is currently undergoing a redesign – to become the portal for discussing free speech in the UK and beyond, to develop new content and new audiences, to break free expression news and publish insightful analysis of censorship issues, to provide opinion, analysis, comment and reportage from sources all over the world and to promote content and share ideas through social media.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Editors will also be invited to contribute to Index’s quarterly award-winning magazine, suggest contributors, and help research and commission. They must have proven writing experience – ideally in journalism – and be able to contribute blogs and longer pieces to Index’s website at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The experts will closely coordinate with Index on Censorship’s London editorial desk, under the direction of editor Jo Glanville and online editor Emily Butselaar.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;They will work to a discrete programme of activities in each region, to enhance and extend Index on Censorship’s publishing activities, advocacy initiatives and arts programming, including a special focus on free expression in the world of literature.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Their work will be incorporated into all areas of our organisation, creating a central resource for the magazine and through its programme of partnership activities, a resource in the literature sector by unearthing new writers, especially in translation, and leading them to publishing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Applicants should have proven expertise in the field of free expression, earned through legal or advocacy experience or journalism and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in applying for one of these positions please write to Emily Butselaar via jobs[at]indexoncensorship.org

He spoke to Shahira Amin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s Maikel Nabil Sanad’s 26th birthday but he is in no celebratory mood. When I arrive at El Marg prison north of Cairo during visiting hours on Saturday 1 October, I can barely hide my shock at seeing his bony physique. Maikel is wearing a wrinkled blue track suit and on his head is a baseball cap worn backwards in a sign of rebellion. It is clear that Maikel is in extremely frail health. He attempts to stand up to greet me but almost immediately falls back into his chair in sheer exhaustion. That’s because today, Maikel tells me, is also the 40 day of his hunger strike — one that he had hoped would draw public attention to his plight and force the ruling military council to reconsider what he describes as the military’s “discriminatory “policies.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I have been tried in a military court and sentenced to &lt;a title="Pen International - Blogger Michael Nabil Sanad sentenced to three years in prison" href="http://www.internationalpen.org.uk/go/news/egypt-blogger-michael-nabil-sanad-sentenced-to-three-years-in-prison"&gt;three years in prison&lt;/a&gt; on charges of spreading rumours about the armed forces and criticising the ruling military council, SCAF in my blogpost. Other high profile figures have simply been summoned by the military prosecutor for questioning for similar charges. They have had their sentences revoked,” he explains. His voice is weak and I have to lean over to hear him clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maikel, who now weighs 48kgs after shedding 12kgs  as a result of his &lt;a title="AINA - Coptic blogger jailed for criticizing Egyptian military goes on hunger strike" href="http://www.aina.org/news/20110824191419.htm"&gt;food abstinence&lt;/a&gt; — has languished behind bars since the 28 March 2011 when he was detained for accusing the military of having conducted virginity tests on female protesters earlier that month — a charge that a senior military general later admitted was true. He had also written on his blog that “The army and the people are not one” — a view that ran counter to the one expressed by tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists in Tahrir Square during the mass uprisings earlier this year. Chants of “The army and people are one” had echoed through Tahrir Square after it became clear that the military had chosen to side with the opposition activists –possibly even defying orders to shoot them.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maikel is post-revolutionary Egypt’s first prisoner of conscience. He was handed the harsh jail sentence after being tried in a martial court where, according to his younger brother Mark, “eyewitnesses were barred from testifying in the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After spending a fortnight in the notorious state security prison at the Hikestep, Maikel was moved to the civilian prison at el Marg where he has since languished in near solitary confinement.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Other prisoners have been warned against talking to me. The prison guards have also been spreading rumours to turn fellow prisoners against me. They tell them I have called on Israel to prolong its occupation of Palestinian land or that I support gay rights,” he says, his voice now a soft whisper.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a conservative predominantly Muslim society, Maikel’s unconventional religious and political views have at best, raised eyebrows or been dismissed as the hallucinations of a madman. At worst, they have earned him the ire — even hatred — of some of his fellow countrymen and provoked the wrath of the ruling military council, for Maikel is a self proclaimed atheist and liberal who supports normalisation of relations with Israel and who has called for military service to be non-compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Many intellectuals whom I have associated with share my views but do not dare voice them publicly,” he says, shaking his head.” I do not like hypocrisy so I have openly shared my views knowing they may ruffle some feathers.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But that is an understatement. Maikel’s refusal to go along with the flow has come at a terribly high price: not only is he serving prison time and losing his health and vitality, but he also risks death, according to a warning from doctors who believe few can survive more than forty days without food. “I’d rather die than live as a slave without dignity under an oppressive regime,” is Maikel’s explanation for refusing to end his hunger strike. He has survived on nothing more than water and a few sips of fruit juice since starting his food abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I offer Maikel a can of orange juice and urge him to take a sip. He reluctantly accepts it and I notice that his hands are as cold as ice as his fingers accidentally brush my hand. Four of his friends have joined me on the visit to lend their support and try and coax Maikell into ending his hunger strike. Like him, they are all ardent activists and revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;” You have already made a statement. Enough Maikel. We need people like you to continue to push for change,” argues Sahar Maher, a mass communication student.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“If I die, scores of Maikels will emerge after me,” is Maikel’s stubborn response.” I have already succeeded in winning many converts. Many of my friends, my brother and my father have all become politicised.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But his father is quick to point out that while he shares many of Maikel’s political stances, he vehemently rejects Maikel’s religious views. “We are a pious Coptic family. Maikel became an atheist when he started associating with the wrong crowd at university and this is where it has led him.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While his religious views are not the cause of his imprisonment, they are partly responsible for the little sympathy afforded Maikel by fellow Egyptians — which is not surprising in a society where religion plays a significant role in shaping people’s lives. Maikel is disappointed by the almost complete lack of local media support which he also blames on what many in Egypt perceive as his pro-Israeli stances. He has expressed his admiration for “Israel’s democratic values and freedom of expression” — an opinion that has shocked the Egyptian public angered by Israel’s aggressive policies towards the Palestinians and the recent killing of a number of Egyptian security guards by Israeli forces near the border with Israel. In recent weeks, anti Israeli protesters have called for the dismissal of the Israeli ambassador from Egypt and an annulment of the Camp David peace accords with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Lack of local support for Maikel in his native Egypt is however compensated for by the strong show of solidarity for him by the international community. A “free Maikel Nabil page” on FaceBook currently has more than 61,400 fans from around the world and the number is steadily on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As his friends sing Happy birthday and Maikel blows out the candle on the small cake they’ve brought with them, he says that his birthday wish is for more Egyptians to read his blogs. He also yearns for his freedom “so that I can receive medical care in a proper hospital,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maikel cites a long list of ailments including a tooth infection, scabies , low blood pressure and low sugar level. He says he is being denied the blood tests and treatment he badly needs to recover. The on-duty prison inspector Sameh Labib denies this. He insists that Maikel, like all other prisoners is getting the attention he requires at the prison hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But whether or not Maikel will be released soon will be decided on the 4th of October when his appeal is scheduled. That day will also mark Maikel’s 43rd day of hunger strike. As we head out of the prison compound, Mark says “We can only hope for the best. There cannot be another Khaled Saeed. Our revolution was sparked by Saeed’s brutal killing by police officers. There cannot be others losing their lives in similar fashion in post revolutionary Egypt.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maikel’s lawyer Negad el Borei says he does not have high expectations from the appeal. He adds that Maikell’s imprisonment is “another black spot for the image of the SCAF.” EL Borei also regrets the lack of media attention to Maikel’s case adding that this is because of new restrictions imposed on the media by the ruling military government which are greater today than those imposed by the former regime. “The media in post revolutionary Egypt has gone as far as condoning torture which never happened under Mubarak,” he laments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Step Forward: NYPD Orders Officers to Stop Unlawful Marijuana Arrests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In an exciting step forward for justice and common sense, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly has &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/big-step-forward-nypd-orders-officers-stop-unlawful-marijuana-arrests"&gt;issued a directive ordering officers&lt;/a&gt; to stop arresting people for misdemeanor marijuana possession when the pot only becomes &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; because an officer has searched a person or directed the person to empty his or her pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SHOC-king Disregard for the Constitution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A public school in &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/religion-belief/shoc-king-disregard-constitution"&gt;South Carolina flagrantly violated the Constitution recently&lt;/a&gt; by holding a Christian rap concert for students on school property during school hours. While most people would go to great lengths to avoid being caught breaking the law, footage of the event, believed to be taken by the event's organizers, was posted online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYCLU on the Scene at Wall Street Protests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A group of a few hundred protesters have occupied a park right off of Wall Street for two weeks now, seeking attention for what they call a greedy and unjust financial system. The staff of the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) has been on the scene &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/nyclu-scene-wall-street-protests"&gt;talking to protesters, learning about their experiences with police and passing out Know Your Rights guides&lt;/a&gt; on protesting in New York City and on surviving police encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending Banned Books...Again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
September 24 – October 1 is Banned Books Week, and new this year was Banned Sites Day on September 28.

In &amp;quot;Advocate’s Visa Delay Stirs  Questions,&amp;quot; Kirk Semple writes of the case of Kerim Yildiz, who we &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/ideological-exclusion-again"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semple writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kerim Yildiz,  a leading human rights advocate for the Kurdish people, was for two decades a  frequent visitor to the United    States. A British citizen living in London, he regularly lectured at American universities,  caucused with other human rights advocates and briefed government officials in Washington.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But something changed. Where before he was admitted to the country without a  problem, he has now waited nearly a year for the Obama administration to  approve a visa. Officials have not explained the delay to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/letter-secretaries-clinton-and-napolitano-kermin-yildiz-visa"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; we sent last month to the Departments of State and Homeland Security asking  them to grant Yildiz a visa, we note the government practice known as &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/exclusion"&gt;ideological exclusion&lt;/a&gt;, in which  foreign nationals are denied entry to the United States because our  government does not agree with their political views.  Ideological exclusion violates  Americans&amp;#39; First Amendment right to hear constitutionally protected speech by  denying foreign scholars, artists, politicians and others entry to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

Protesters may no longer be standing vigil and the story may  no longer be making front-page headlines. But one thing is certain: millions of  Americans&amp;#39; eyes have been opened to the injustice of the death penalty system  in this country — and we aren&amp;#39;t going to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis was  executed last week in Georgia, &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/2008/10/06/troy-davis-case-proves-death-penalty-is-fatally-flawed"&gt;despite  serious concerns&lt;/a&gt; that he was wrongly convicted in 1989 of killing of a  police officer. His story garnered international media attention. The world  watched until the final moments when the U.S. Supreme Court &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/troy-davis-executed-stay-denied-supreme-court/story?id=14571862"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; his last-minute stay of execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have responded to Davis' execution by taking action this week,  calling on our leaders to abolish the death penalty once and for all. Observers  speculate that the Davis  case will &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/28/opinion/main20112664.shtml"&gt;reignite  the movement&lt;/a&gt; to abolish the death penalty — a silver lining in what is  otherwise a tragic example of a failing justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress took action last week, too, by &lt;a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-3051"&gt;introducing  a bill&lt;/a&gt; to abolish the death penalty under federal law. This bill would  prevent federal courts from sentencing anyone to death and though it does not  officially impact state courts, it may influence them. Currently, there are &lt;a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/federal-death-row-prisoners"&gt;58 people&lt;/a&gt; on federal death row who have been convicted and sentenced in federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our justice system is broken and has previously sentenced &lt;a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row"&gt;138  wrongfully convicted people&lt;/a&gt; to die. We know we will never have a perfect  system, and we can't accept a process that allows for the execution of an  innocent person.&lt;/p&gt;
