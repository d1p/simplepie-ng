<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! Welcome to the fifth annual&nbsp;liveblog of the September issue of <em>Vogue</em>. Five years!&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe width="560" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/J40aKHIhvU0" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The rules: I have not opened this issue, nor have I read any blog posts/articles/embittered rants about its content. I will, however, admit to watching Racked try to <a href="http://bit.ly/n2hz0t" target="_self">smash snack foods</a> with this sucker. It's heavy! The liveblog goes in chronological order; refresh the page to see the latest updates.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. As I mentioned in the video,&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/glossedover" target="_self">I will be tweeting</a> during the day using the hashtag <strong>#vogueliveblog</strong>, and I would love for you to use that hashtag too! <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">As a small token of my gratitude for all of you out there reading along with me, I'll be giving&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_September_Issue" target="_self">The September Issue</a> </em>on DVD to three randomly selected people who tweet a link to this site and the hashtag between 10 a.m. today and 5 p.m. Eastern on Friday. (This is not a sponsored giveaway, just me spending my own money to send three lucky people a movie. US and Canada only, sorry.) Remember, your tweet must include both a link--you can use&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/vogueliveblog11" target="_self">http://bit.ly/vogueliveblog11</a>--and the hashtag <strong>#vogueliveblog </strong>to be eligible to win. </span>&nbsp;[Contest now closed, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/glossedover/status/107841278884065281" target="_self">winners declared</a>.]&nbsp;Thanks for being here!</p>
<p>Now let's get going.</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae90bc8970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae90bc8970d" title="Vogue_KateMoss_Sept11" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae90bc8970d-500wi" alt="Vogue_KateMoss_Sept11" /></a> </p>
<p><strong>10:03 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Kate Moss on the cover--she looks lovely, but that's to be expected, isn't it? Not so fond of using <em>Vogue</em> as a wedding album, but I'll reserve judgment until I see the actual photos.</p>
<p><strong>10:05 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Also, can we talk about the banner in the upper left-hand corner? <a href="http://twitter.com/coutortured" target="blank">@Coutortured</a> mentioned this on Twitter, and I think she's right: what's the connection between <em>Glee</em> and the fashion industry? Is there really any overlap between Gleeks and the kind of people Nuclear Wintour surrounds herself with? Now there's a Venn diagram I'd like to see.</p>
<p><strong>10:07 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>How did it take me seven minutes to open the magazine? First up: a Ralph Lauren Romance ad. It's the fragrance for women who like horse-riding, guitar-playing sensitive dudes.</p>
<p><strong>10:08 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Fuzzy swim caps in the Prada ad. Not appealing. Marion Cotillard is perfection in the Dior ad. The model in Ralph Lauren is wearing a fur-trimmed coat, lots of necklaces, and a very odd expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:10 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>More usual suspects: Gucci. Lancome skincare--it has a percentage in the product name, so it must be scientific and therefore effective! Fendi, whose bags are for artists, apparently. Dolce &amp; Gabbana, with stars and music notes all over their clothes. For those who want the juniors' section look, but have a lot more money to burn!</p>
<p><strong>10:13 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Six pages of Chanel ads. Their model clearly doesn't have eyeballs, as they aren't visible in any of these photos.</p>
<p><strong>10:14 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That stupid "doll lash" mascara ad AGAIN. I am seriously burning with hate for this stuff. Can we not aspire to look like inanimate objects, please?</p>
<p><strong>10:15 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ads, ads, ads. I want everything in the Burberry ads. (I don't believe in putting things "out into the universe," but can't hurt to try, right?) YSL has houndstooth. Bottega Veneta. Freaky, freaky Helena Bonham Carter for Marc Jacobs. Does this inspire you to buy high-end clothing?</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434c9187c970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434c9187c970c" title="HBC_MarcJacobs" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434c9187c970c-320wi" alt="HBC_MarcJacobs" /></a></p>
<p><strong>10:19 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The ad for Tom Ford's Violet Blonde is probably the first of his ads that I don't find repulsive, but then, it isn't starring him. Good work, Tom!</p>
<p><strong>10:20 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Donna Karan, Michael Kors, OdlR: reliably awesome. I covet. Then&nbsp;Clarins, Yurman, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:22 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hark! What is this is I see? The table of contents! I feel like a sailor spotting dry land.</p>
<p><strong>10:23 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(Is that overdramatic? Yeah, that's overdramatic. I withdraw the comment.)</p>
<p><strong>10:27 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>So, what have we got? A 9/11 memoir (naturally), a 94-year-old "art impresario and sexual dynamo," and this sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis takes to Africa for Dasha Zhukova's thirtieth birthday</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>10:30 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Back to ads! Dior fragrance (fold-out but no scent strip), MaxMara, and DKNY, which features a model in glasses. This gives bespectacled me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. In non-<em>Vogue </em>news, my cat would like to play. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:32 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Bally would like you to tease your hair high.</p>
<p><strong>10:33 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>UGH, this stupid Gap fold-out ad that's been everywhere lately. "This isn't supposed to be here." Yes, how very odd to find a clothing design studio in the fashion district! OMG, there isn't a buzzer! Someone brought their dog into the studio. It's soooo edgy and crazy. "Each hang tag tells a story"? Really, what the story is that? <em>The Tale of the Dull Mass-Produced Denim</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:35 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Lest that last paragraph made it sound like I only wear bespoke designer denim, I'll confess: I own Old Navy sweetheart-cut jeans. And I'm fine with it! I don't object to mass-produced mall store fashion, I just object to trying to make it sound like it's some rare, artisan-produced resource.</p>
<p><strong>10:37 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Nine West ads with Karen Elson: she's lovely, the clothes look like Burning Man costumes.</p>
<p><strong>10:38 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>An ad for a skincare brand called Sunday Riley. What? Who?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:39 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Excuse me, I need a tissue to wipe the drool off my mouth. This Proenza Schouler bag in the Nordstrom ad? LOVE. (The rest of the multi-page ad? Meh.)</p>
<p><strong>10:42 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>More ads, and my cat continues to whine for attention. I don't know why she can't just check out this Andrew Marc ad with me.</p>
<p><strong>10:43 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>All the sleeves in the aforementioned Andrew Marc ad cover the models' hands entirely. Ill-fitting clothes are so in for fall.</p>
<p><strong>10:45 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The cat is now sleeping. In case you care.</p>
<p><strong>10:46 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Jones New York promises its blazer will work for everyone. Because, you know, a blazer that fits the different shapes of the five models in its ad will surely flatter the full range of human female bodies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>10:47 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The Piperlime ad is a milestone: it includes the bazillionth (that's an estimate) pair of ankle boots in this issue so far. Good news for ankle-boot manufacturers, bad news for anyone whose legs aren't seven feet long.</p>
<p><strong>10:49 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The table of contents continues! Life with Andre, Stella McCartney, and lots of rich-people things!</p>
<p><strong>10:51 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>There's a six-page Calvin Klein ad, and the model is making the same face in each photo. Someone please make a GIF flipbook of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:52 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Today in things I didn't know existed: a site called Voguepedia.com, sponsored by Michael Kors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:55 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>First ad for Fashion's Night Out, starring a model named Arizona Muse. No word on whether that's her real name. Anyway, this is important, serious stuff! FNO is meant to "promote local retail and celebrate the fashion industry." You know, in case a whole magazine full of stuff to buy isn't self-congratulatory enough for the fashion industry.</p>
<p><strong>10:57 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Salvatore Ferragamo ad features a whole lot of houndstooth. It's very reminiscent of 1990, but I can't decide if that's a good or a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>11:00 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>One hour in. Where is the content? There <em>is</em>&nbsp;some, right? I'm not just reading 700-something pages of ads?</p>
<p><strong>11:01 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Content. Well, the table of contents continues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11:02 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>This is what awaits me on page 714 (should I live that long):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plum Sykes learns Tom Ford's Ten Beauty Commandments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do they fight to the death? Because that's pretty much the only way that article is going to leave me smiling.</p>
<p><strong>11:03 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Note to attorneys representing Ford and Sykes: kidding!</p>
<p><strong>11:04 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The models in the Valentino ad are blurry. Is fuzzy vision in for fall? Can I leave my glasses at home?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11:09 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, lost focus for a second there. No pun intended. (See previous entry.) Escada: yum. It's very subdued and elegant. When did that happen? I'm probably showing my age and total lack of fashion savvy here, but didn't Escada used to be known for insanely bright colors and patterns? When I was a teen, Escada clothes reminded me of, like, casino wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>11:12 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Someone please explain the outfit in this Jimmy Choo ad to me.</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f5cdaa970b-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f5cdaa970b" title="JimmyChoo_SeptVogue" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f5cdaa970b-320wi" alt="JimmyChoo_SeptVogue" /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:14 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The Dooney &amp; Bourke ad features a plain leather bag that retails for $385, presumably for all the teenagers who've now grown out of their heart-patterned D &amp; B bags from five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>11:15 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>More contents! That's four pages listing the contents, zero pages of actual content.</p>
<p><strong>11:18 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>You will NEVER guess what <em>Vogue </em>titled its Kate Moss wedding story. No, seriously. You'll never guess. Ready? It's called "Kiss Me, Kate." Isn't that original? I never would have expected that <em>Vogue </em>would co-opt the name of a well-known musical to title an article about a woman named Kate getting married. Now that's the kind of vision and originality I've come to expect from this magazine!</p>
<p><strong>11:19 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>
<p><strong>11:21 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Alert! I've been informed via Fritinancy's very helpful comment (below) that Sunday Riley is, in fact, an actual human being, and she thinks very highly of her own products. That's one question raised by this issue that is now mercifully put to rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11:24 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ad for Longchamp. Love the bags, hate the rich-sorority-girl stereotype that goes with them.</p>
<p><strong>11:25 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Now suffering from ad fatigue. Via Spiga, Brahmin, True Religion. H &amp; M is touting a $9.95 blouse in its ad, and that's just awesome. (Though I <em>do not</em>&nbsp;want to imagine what that blouse is made of and who made it that it can be sold so cheaply. Wait! Didn't I say earlier that I'm cool with mass-produced fashion? I am, but... Ethical/style/financial dilemma!)</p>
<p><strong>11:27 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>A promo for supplementary content on Vogue.com, which would be great HAD I SEEN ANY CONTENT AT ALL YET IN THIS ISSUE.</p>
<p><strong>11:28 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Giant pages-long Hilfiger ad called "Home with the Hilfigers." Looks like a Bret Easton Ellis book come to life, minus the brutal sex, graphic murders, and rampant drug use.</p>
<p><strong>11:31 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Remember that caffeine I mentioned in the video? Time to go get some more. I'm also going to use the next two minutes to try to banish the ensemble in this Aldo ad from my memory. Reverse polka dots? Different colored shoes? Why, Aldo? Why?</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae98d88970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae98d88970d" title="Aldo_SeptVogue" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae98d88970d-320wi" alt="Aldo_SeptVogue" /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:42 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Back to the magazine. After a Sephora ad (winged eyeliner is the thing, apparently), it's another promo for Vogue.com. Sigh.</p>
<p><strong>11:44 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Miu Miu ad starring Hailee Steinfeld. I have mixed feelings about a teen modeling high fashion, but I will say positive things about these ads: Steinfeld is not in sexy poses, the clothes she's wearing are more-or-less age appropriate, and while she's lying on her back in the final shot, it's decidedly not a dead-model pose. She's actually smiling! Good work, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>11:46 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Nearly two hours in, and I'm finally at Anna Wintour's "Letter from the Editor." Which, naturally, contains about 35 words and then cuts off mid-sentence to make room for more ads.</p>
<p><strong>11:48 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Wintour refers to Moss as this issue's "cover girl." Can we as a society put our heads together and come up for a term that means the same thing but doesn't include the word "girl"? Not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>11:50 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ralph Lauren ad features an Asian (or at least Asian-appearing) model wearing an obi belt and a dress with a dragon embroidered on the back. How do we feel about this?</p>
<p><strong>11:51 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Givenchy now officially targeting the narrow but lucrative segment of <em>Twilight</em>-loving trendsetters. I really hope this model doesn't hunt me down and bite me.</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f60396970b-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f60396970b" title="Givenchy_SeptVogue.jped" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015390f60396970b-320wi" alt="Givenchy_SeptVogue.jped" /></a></p>
<p><strong>11:55 a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Celine ad. Stella McCartney ad demonstrating how to wear a completely sheer dress--just pop an opaque blazer over the whole thing. Alexander McQueen ad model has light and, I don't know, shrapnel emanating from her head. Gorgeous but weird, which is probably the highest compliment one can pay a fashion designer.</p>
<p><strong>11:56 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>After a Chrysler ad, we're back to Anna.</p>
<p><strong>11:58 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>...and there it is. Wintour compares Kate Moss' wedding to Kate Middleton's, saying they're similar because both were "quite simply a moment when two people in love came together." Raise your hand if this comparison surprises you.</p>
<p><strong>12:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>What? No hands?</p>
<p><strong>12:01 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More ads. More ads. Tod's. Julianne Moore for Talbot's. Something called the Bellevue Collection, which is not an ad for the New York hospital. A whole gaggle of reality TV types for QVC: Heidi Klum, some Kardashians, and Rachel Zoe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:05 p.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Karl Lagerfeld for Macy's. Those are four words I was pretty sure I'd never have the occasion to string together.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:07 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Finally! The conclusion of the editor's letter.</p>
<p><strong>12:09 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Bo-ring. Wintour has effusive praise for the following: China, Mario Testino, Karlie Kloss (who, says the editor, should be a diplomat), and the cast of&nbsp;<em>Glee</em>, who she calls a "talented and exuberant bunch." Okay, but has she watched the show? What's funny is that she says they're the perfect people to film a PSA for Fashion's Night Out, "after designers and then models." Ouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:13 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>This is <em>just&nbsp;</em>what I look like when I snuggle with my cat:</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae9c576970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae9c576970d" title="Bulgari_SeptVogue" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ae9c576970d-320wi" alt="Bulgari_SeptVogue" /></a></p>
<p><strong>12:15 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>An ad for The Limited asks "How far can you go?" alongside a photo of a model in the produce aisle of a grocery store. She's already made it to the broccoli despite being way overdressed for grocery shopping; how much farther is she supposed to go?</p>
<p><strong>12:18 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Masthead.</p>
<p><strong>12:19 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Missoni for Target ad. That thing I said earlier about putting stuff out into the universe? Yeah, that applies here too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:21 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Gah, more ads. How many ads are there? So many that I'm actually looking forward to getting to the Plum Sykes/Tom Ford article.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:23 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Demi Moore in a campaign for Ann Taylor, including this quote: "The new Ann Taylor is for modern women who want to take on the world in style." Sure, Demi Moore said that--when she read it off a piece of paper some marketing flack had handed her.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:26 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"Talking Back: Letters from Readers." Let's see who's pissed at <em>Vogue</em> this month!</p>
<p><strong>12:28 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Commenter Grace has provided some deets on Arizona Muse. She exists!</p>
<p><strong>12:31 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>One letter-writer calls out <em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;for excessive Photoshop use in their Penelope Cruz editorial in the June issue. That's great you printed the letter, <em>Vogue</em>, but how about responding? Or changing?</p>
<p><strong>12:33 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ads again. The main takeaway: Vera Wang has affixed her name to every consumer good imaginable. Pretty sure she's going to make cars next.</p>
<p><strong>12:36 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>More reader letters. Did you spend your childhood in France? Then write up a memoir and send it to Vogue, which is apparently now in the business of printing such things. The Guess ad next to the letters page, despite being the same black-and-white photos of a bombshell motif that Guess has used for decades, is way more interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12:38 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More ads, more reader letters. Agony. I feel like a horse being broken.</p>
<p><strong>12:40 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ooooh. Stephanie Dean of Chicago wrote in with an epic takedown of Plum Sykes. Key sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I was going to read a piece about a fitness regimen to help my legs, and instead Sykes wasted my time boasting about her ability to be a debutante and wear short dresses while having a posh job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephanie Dean, I think we'd get along well.</p>
<p><strong>12:43 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>A few ads that I've already seen everywhere: Cover Girl, Honora pearls, and then finally! The Contributors page.</p>
<p><strong>12:45 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The Contributors page lists Karlie Kloss. We're listing models as contributors now?</p>
<p><strong>12:46 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Multi-page L'Oreal ad, Bloomingdale's has multi-colored fur (surprise! it's hideous!), still more contributor bios that I seriously can't bring myself to read, Chevy, and yet another page of contributors, with yet another boost for <em>Glee</em> from contributing editor Tabitha Simmons. She says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am now officially hooked and think it is a fantastic show.</p>

<p>At last! An actual article! This seems like a good place to take a break. When I return (in 40 minutes or so), "A Will to Live" by Lauren Manning. Whew.</p>
<p><strong>1:42 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I'm back and ready to start reading again. While I was away, I may or may not have listened to this for continued inspiration. Cheesy, yes. But if you follow me on Twitter, you know I have a weakness for 80s music.</p>
<p><iframe width="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/btPJPFnesV4" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>1:47 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>So, where was I? "A Will to Live" on page 376. Now reading.</p>
<p><strong>1:53 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Two pages into an autobiographical article about Lauren Manning's injury on Sept. 11 and her recovery. So, yeah, I'm not going to be able to snark on this.</p>
<p><strong>1:55 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>But I will snark on the ad placement in this article. Manning explains that, due to the extent of her injuries, she was left for dead by paramedics at the scene and, once in the hospital, was given an 18 percent chance of recovery. She says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I even received blessed water from the Kabbalah Centre and holy water from Lourdes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ad on the facing page is for La Mer, and it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond Miraculous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sensitive, <em>Vogue</em>.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Turns out that was an excerpt from a book. And while it was a gripping story, I often wonder how <em>Vogue</em> staffers envision the tone of this magazine: I mean, it's a little strange to go from reading about a woman being burned over a huge percentage of her body to an ad for an anti-aging cream. The switch from pictures of expensive clothing to a story about a woman fighting for her life is a jarring shift in perspective.</p>
<p><strong>2:02 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Up next? The 94-year-old "sex dynamo" promised in the TOC. Oh joy! (And see what I mean about the tone?)</p>
<p><strong>2:06 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, wow, this profile. Where do I even start? Well, here's the lede:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world's most glamourous art lecturer <em>[this is a thing?--ed.] </em>turned memoirist, Rosamond Bernier, who will be 95 in October, has tamed wild animals, flown her own plane, and befriended the likes of Henri Matisse, Leonard Bernstein, and Frida Kahlo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, basically, she's been very privileged and had famous friends, which makes her life the perfect fodder for this magazine.</p>
<p><strong>2:09 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>OMG.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possessed of a furious work ethic, she nevertheless claims a&nbsp;lifelong habit of breakfasting in bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2:10 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>OMG again.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composer Aaron Copland, resolutely homosexual, fell under her spell and remained a lifelong friend...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Resolutely homosexual"? One, that has uncomfortable implications about the very nature of being gay; and two, like it's strange that a gay man would be charmed by and develop a friendship with a straight woman?</p>
<p><strong>2:16 p.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I'm only skimming the rest, but this Elie Saab ad in the midst of the article seems more relatable than the rest of this thing.</p>

<p>Four pages of a Mulberry ad! Do you like to match your dress, belt, shoes, and bag? Then this is the brand for you, especially if you also enjoy standing on chairs.</p>
<p><strong>2:19 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ad for Architectural Digest's Amazing Kitchens app, which is like a litmus test for <em>Vogue</em> readers: are you in the obscenely wealthy demographic, or are you in the aspiring-to-be-obscenely wealthy demographic?</p>
<p><strong>2:21 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Publishing memories of a French childhood in <em>Vogue</em>: not just for readers! The next article is called "My France" by Chloe Malle.</p>
<p><strong>2:24 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm sure Chloe Malle is sincere, but this whole article reads like a series of <a href="http://twitter.com/humblebrag" target="_blank">humblebrags</a>. For instance:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking, Oh, Aunt Alicia has that [Louis XVI] chair!, as if it were a top-selling model from Crate &amp; Barrel.</p>

<p>Or:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"It Girl" Elle Fanning is so obsessed with fashion that "her near-total recall of runway stars would put modelizers twice her age to shame." Consider me shamed! Also, what the hell is a modelizer?</p>
<p><strong>2:47 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>An ad on the facing page helpfully informs us that Vera Wang is available to purchase at Saks, in case you were concerned whether her 14 billion branded items are available for sale. Thanks, Saks!</p>

<p>OMG, everyone! Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis is <em>Vogue</em>'s newest columnist! This is great!</p>
<p><strong>2:49 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea who&nbsp;Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis is.</p>
<p><strong>2:50 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ah, this is one of those columns that names people without providing any context whatsoever, like the average person is just supposed to know who Shala Monroque, Noor Fares, or Olympia Scarry are.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2:51 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'm well aware Google exists. I just can't be bothered because, really? Wouldn't <em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;be fawning all over the place if these people had notable accomplishments other than their pedigree?</p>
<p><strong>2:54 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>But at least the whole adventure was "unforgettable" for Elisabeth! Whoever <em>she </em>is.</p>
<p><strong>2:55 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More ads, this time a clump of brands that used to land at the front of the book: Alberta Ferretti, Moschino, Nina Ricci.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2:56 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Fashion content! Of course, I've already admitted to owning clothes from Old Navy, so you know, keep that in mind as I proceed to mock <em>Vogue</em>'s fashion editorials.</p>
<p><strong>2:58 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"Primary Cool" seems to be more or less the color-blocking trend that's been thrown at us for the last few months. I am in favor of wearing mismatching colors, but that might be because I have a very small wardrobe, but I'm just gonna pretend that I'm trendy.</p>
<p><strong>3:02 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to commenters Danielle and AnnabelleNYC, who have now clarified "modelizer" and the provenance of&nbsp;Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis. You all are a very helpful bunch! Can you follow me through life and feed me answers?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3:09 p.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Typepad just ate my last update. I will now attempt to recreate it.</p>
<p><strong>3:10 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The next few pages in brief: decorators, designer collaborations, Bryce Dallas Howard and a flock of pigeons for Kate Spade. Elettra Wiedemann went to Iceland, and while it sounds like a very pleasant trip, I'm not sure that it really merits coverage in <em>Vogue</em>. (Unless you are interested in learning that a total stranger is now "obsessed with rocks"? No?) Men's bow ties are featured, and there's a magenta-haired model in the ad for BCBG Max Azria. Whew. That was it.</p>
<p><strong>3:13 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Napoleon Perdis says "Not To Prime is a Crime!" Inconsistent capitalization aside, I find his advertising strategy compelling and therefore declare that Not To Read this Blog is a Crime!</p>
<p><strong>3:16 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More of the "Flash" pages in summary:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Colored lace is in. Kate Middleton is wearing it, so it must be true.</p>
<p>2. A Nike ad promises "Best. Bum. Ever." The ad goes on to say it puts "your curves out there, confidently, at their best." So pants supplant your personality, and your curves are distinct from you as a person? Nike, show your work. I'm not getting that answer <em>at all.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Something something "stories of the lives of people and the gardens they tend" something something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Bakelite jewelry.</p>
<p>5. Anklets + Clarks. In case ankle boots don't chop your legs off in an unflattering way, perhaps this combination will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3:24 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Page 500! Time for a celebratory drink of water! (As evidenced by "Eye of the Tiger" and now this, I know how to party!)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:29 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I have also opted for a caffeinated beverage whose name rhymes with Piet Smepsi, the manufacturers of which should consider sponsoring this blog, because without that brown bubbly goodness, I might never finish this liveblog. Also? Now that I've thought of it as "brown bubbly goodness," I don't ever want to drink it again. Ew.</p>
<p><strong>3:31 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>An article called "Hit Parade," about a "new crop of male tennis stars." Aha! Wintour's fascination with tennis players <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/08/anna_wintour_gives_roger_feder.html" target="_blank">continues</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:33 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I, however, have zero interest in tennis players, so I'm just going to look at the photos (what? they're cute!) and skip the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:35 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Next, something called "Shop, Girls!" (ugh) showcasing the many, many items you might want to purchase during Fashion's Night Out. Not before, not after, but that night! There's a $40 official t-shirt, a Tory Burch tote that's free with a $100 purchase (so not really free), and $227 FNO jeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:38 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>This "Flash" thing is never going to end, is it? The same page contains both a story about an innovative teacher and a brief about a golfer wearing all-orange at the British Open. Obviously those stories belong on the same page, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:42 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Life with Andre! YES.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:47 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Three measly paragraphs about Karl Lagerfeld? That's it? There aren't nearly enough of Andre's trademark convoluted, name-dropping sentences in this thing, though the article does open with "If I were writing my French Studies doctoral thesis at Brown University today..." Nice pat on the back there, ALT.</p>
<p><strong>3:49 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Oh wait, there's more after a few ads.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3:55 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's just that I've been reading <em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;all day, but pretty much everything in ALT's column made sense to me. Clearly I'm losing it.</p>
<p><strong>3:58 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The article titled "Country Strong" is not about the movie or Dolly Parton. Sadface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3:59 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to question writer Sarah Mower's journalistic integrity, but I find her claim that anniversary celebrations for Harris Tweed "broke out" last summer rather suspicious. Like people just spontaneously started celebrating? For Harris Tweed?</p>
<p><strong>4:04 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>This article makes it sound like tweed is a cult instead of a fabric. From the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Stella Tennant is a "tweed freak"</li>
<li>Mill owner Stephen Rendle says "They say looking at [tweed]'s better than drugs, you know!"</li>
<li>And Tennant "initiated" designer Dries Van Noten "into the wonders" of a particular mill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fashion people, it's official: I don't get you AT ALL. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4:09 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I've been at this for six hours, I'm well page 500 pages, and this article "Far from the Madding Crowd" describes its subject as the "personification of British sanity." So, yeah, that's getting skipped.</p>
<p><strong>4:12 p.m.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After a handful of random ads, I've arrived at "La Femme," a profile of new French <em>Vogue</em>&nbsp;editor Emmanuelle Alt. Now they're speaking my language.</p>
<p><strong>4:17 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Now attempting to read a 700-plus-page magazine with a cat in my lap.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4:20 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, the article contained a lot of the typical nonsense--for instance, Alt is so "grounded" she has to live in a house, not a high-rise apartment. But she does say something interesting about nudity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I respect women. These girls have parents who are looking at the magazine. A nude picture shouldn't carry a message of sexual fantasy. But I love nudity. I am super French. It's the body, it's sexuality, it's part of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4:22 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Hey, speaking of "these girls have parents," here's a photo of Dakota Fanning with a flower vase between her legs. It's not sexual, but it sure is suggestive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434cb0af0970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434cb0af0970c" title="OhLola-DakotaFanning_SeptVogue" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef015434cb0af0970c-320wi" alt="OhLola-DakotaFanning_SeptVogue" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4:27 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Only about 200 more pages to go. Only.&nbsp;BRB, crying softly.</p>
<p><strong>4:28 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Back to it! Now, Hamish Bowles on Elizabeth Taylor's jewelry. Which doesn't sound like it's going to help with the onset of ennui, does it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4:33 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>All right, I'll stop whining. BRING IT, HAMISH BOWLES. (That's a sentence no human being has ever before uttered.)</p>
<p><strong>4:38 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>So, like, our friend Hamish here once met Elizabeth Taylor, and he has to derail the story (about an auction of her jewelry) in order to drop it in. See:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collection is a potent evocation of a woman I waited hours in the Moroccan midday sun to see, at a 1989 press conference for her intimate friend Malcolm Forbes's seventieth-birthday party in Tangier. [boring sentence about hairpieces being woven] I was felled with violent sunstroke, but it was worth the violet-eyed vision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you found that palatable, perhaps you will enjoy the article! I don't think I need to tell you how I feel about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4:41 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More Piet Smepsi for everyone! Random ads. And an article called "Invincible," asking why the military look has remained "undefeated in our minds and closets"? Is this for real?</p>
<p><strong>4:43 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"So why haven't we fatigued of fatigues?"</p>
<p><strong>4:44 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Um, this article just referred to J. Crew's Jenna Lyons as "a general with a big view of many theaters of action." The author's dedicated to his metaphor, I'll give him that.</p>
<p><strong>4:46 p.m.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The military aspect of the parka," sys [designer Joseph] Altuzarra, "is associated with men, and I think this is part of the enduring appeal of the whole military trend--it kind of looks like you're wearing your boyfriend's jacket."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, because only men serve in the military!</p>
<p><strong>4:49 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Something something wealthy women sharing expensive clothes. Don't care. When do I get to Kate Moss' wedding?</p>
<p><strong>4:51 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Way more interested in the fact that <em>Teen Vogue</em> runs something called "Fashion University" (as seen in an ad) than Stella McCartney designing ballet costumes.</p>
<p><strong>4:52 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More from Sarah Mower on page 578! Now the writer who brought us rapturous tales of tweed is back with "Palette Cleansing," apparently because "we're clamoring for scarlet, shamrock, and tangerine." Um, no one calls green "shamrock," and is the "we" anyone other than Sarah Mower herself? Let's see!</p>
<p><strong>4:57 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>This article refers to the previous decade as the "noughties."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Style Ethics" &nbsp;explores the challenging world of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bare midriffs</span>&nbsp;organic wedding dresses. Kenneth Cole asks a bunch of rhetorical questions in his ad. The magazine's executive fashion editor is inspired by, among other things, a $4,400 pair of earrings. The beauty section explains that makeup should be considered part of "fall's high-wattage wardrobe," which is clearly a huge departure from every other season in the history of fashion, and Pat McGrath applied Swarovski crystals to models' eyes at a recent Dior show. Try it at home! (No, seriously, don't try that at home.)</p>
<p><strong>5:06 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>More Cover Girl ads. Guess they're doing well. An article about fragrance that says of Burberry's new scent, "You really don't need anything under that trench except perfume." An ad for Botox. An article about a hairstylist who is "shaking up the world of haute hair." Oh, okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>5:13 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>An article about hormone therapy. The "People Are Talking About" section, which describes Zooey Deschanel as part of the tradition of "glamourous goofballs." A horrifying ad for Katy Perry's perfume Purr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just a few paragraphs in and I'm already rolling my eyes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China has been confounding foreigners for centuries. Turns out they are not so "inscrutable" after all: Just like us, they long for $5,000 handbags covered in tiny logos.</p>

<p>I'm quite certain that article is full of eye-rolling goodness, but I just can't find it right now. On to "Playing to Type," which features "five distinct personalities" from the fall fashion collections. Which one are you?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Romantics wear floaty layers and have terrible hair</li>
<li>The Modernists are into sleek knits and shoe boots</li>
<li>The Bourgeoisie are pretty much exactly what you'd imagine from the name, but with worse hair</li>
<li>The Artisans, ditto, but with better hair</li>
<li>The Subversives, who are apparently "true individuals" because they wear Rick Owens? I don't get it.</li>

<p>FINALLY I HAVE ARRIVED AT "KISS ME KATE." WHY DID NO ONE WARN ME THAT HAMISH BOWLES WROTE THIS?</p>
<p><strong>5:38 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Ugh, can we get our references straight, <em>Vogue</em>? In the opening spread, these two are like F. Scott and Zelda. On the next, the flower girls are "pre-Raphaelite visions." Also, there are like forty of them.</p>
<p><strong>5:41 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Charming anecdote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I never did a hairy armpit," says Kate firmly of those late-eighties grunge moments. "You can look dirty, but you can't <em>be </em>dirty!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5:44 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Wow. Were you all aware that no one in the history of time has gotten married before? This article is fawning over every last detail like Kate Moss and Jamie Hince are the first wealthy, well-connected pair to tie the knot. Three things: Kate was inspired to get married by watching <em>Big Fat Gypsy Weddings</em>, because "these girls, they just spend their whole life waiting for that day--let's do it!"; her dress designer, John Galliano, says "she dared me to be John Galliano again," which is an extremely polite elision of the scandal over Galliano's anti-Semitic remarks; and "...Mrs. Jamie Hince is finally an honest woman." BARF.</p>
<p><strong>5:53 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"The Outsider," a profile of Jon Huntsman, photographed by Annie Leibovitz.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5:57 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>...which wouldn't be complete without a description of his wife's outfit and Huntsman's own looks. Of course. Oh, and Huntsman's wife, Mary Kaye, is "super fit." Good to know when voting!</p>
<p><strong>5:59 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Breaking! The next day Mary Kaye is wearing jogging shorts! Important!!!</p>
<p><strong>6:01 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Well, that wasn't too painful, though this next article surely will be. "Rooftop Playhouse" centers on "anti-trophy wife" Claude Wasserstein's Manhattan home. Not covered: is "anti-trophy wife" one of the world's worst expressions?</p>
<p><strong>6:03 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Did I mention Plum Sykes wrote this? And that there's still another Sykes article to go? I'm skimming.</p>
<p><strong>6:04 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Why I'm skimming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's discuss, I propose to Claude, having six Wasserstein children in your life and simultaneously having a house this neat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Plum, let's discuss. How could be that an incredibly wealthy family has a clean home? Do you think perhaps they might hire people to clean for that? Could that be a remote possibility?</p>
<p><strong>6:07 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The house does look very nice, though. Next up: "Changing of the Guard," about the new female head of the IMF.</p>
<p><strong>6:10 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>You know, when profiling the woman who took over the IMF in the wake of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest, it's always good to devote the SECOND PARAGRAPH to her appearance and say that she resembles "a glamourous headmistress her students half fall in love with, half fear." Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>6:12 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Just groaned aloud at this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Lagarde is also natural, open, and perfectly feminine.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, good! Wouldn't want an intelligent, powerful woman to not live up to every stereotype society has about femininity!</p>
<p><strong>6:15 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>And now we're discussing the secret of her "elegance," which naturally involves Chanel. Then, the article goes on to discuss the (recently dropped) charges against Strauss-Kahn, and somehow interprets Lagarde's statement that men should be raised to be self-sufficient (in terms of laundry, cooking, etc.) and that women should raise their children to respect women as saying that women have some responsibility in the overall state of affairs "among both men and women about the difference between seduction and force." Um, no. Can I break out the Michael Bluth GIF again?</p>
<p><strong>6:18 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><em>Vogue</em>'s food writer Jeffrey Steingarten is on the hunt for Mexican food. So am I! For the first time I may actually finish a Steingarten article. (No, seriously, PLEASE tell me where to find good Mexican food in New York.)</p>
<p><strong>6:20 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Foiled again. Steingarten's in Mexico. Shouldn't be so hard there, huh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>6:23 p.m.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These are ant eggs, and they were in season."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's where I stopped drooling.</p>
<p><strong>6:24 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>So close to being done. Next up, the Plum Sykes-Tom Ford Obnoxiousness Showdown. Then something about <em>Glee. </em>Then a couple of fashion spreads. Then I'm done.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Well, "The Ford Face" was unpleasant. We start with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If there is one man in the world I think every woman would literally die to have a makeup lesson from, it's Tom Ford."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And go to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ford is endearingly vain.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing. This sentence, by the way, is followed by a description of Ford's apparently marathon sessions of mirror-gazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there's this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ford admits he often feels the current Hollywood standard of beauty is "tragic." ..."Barbies. Real women shouldn't look at any of it or think about any of it... Women should do the same thing I did when starting my brand."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while I agree that Hollywood doesn't promote healthy, positive beauty standards, I'm even more put off by a man&nbsp;telling women that they should do what he did to deal with those unrealistic expectations. Particularly when that man peddles the same kind of unrealistic standards in a different form.</p>
<p><strong>6:36 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"Show Stoppers," with the cast of <em>Glee</em>. Styleite covered <a href="http://www.styleite.com/media/glee-vogue-photoshop/" target="_self">the myriad Photoshop errors in the accompanying photo.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;And I would like to mention this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of these fans seemed--how shall we put it?--far more like struggling New Directions recruits than lithe, blithe Cheerios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably these are the same fans <em>Vogue </em>is courting by making them the celebrity stars of Fashion's Night Out? Nice.</p>
<p><strong>6:39 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"My Generation," a fashion spread with Natalia Vodianova in mod-style, sixties-inspired fashions, and an actor named Sam Riley, who, based on his work here, apparently specializes in playing moody, pouty guys. Never look at the camera, Sam!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6:43 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>But the clothes are awesome. A printed OdlR dress? A buttery leather coat? (Sorry, I know "buttery" is straight out of <em>Lucky.</em>&nbsp;It's late. I'm tired.) It's all gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>6:44 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"Lofty Ambitions," wherein "fur-accented handbags and heels take ladylike elegance to unexpected new heights." So I'm pretty sure I'm going to hate this, because there's no quicker way to turn me off than to describe things as "ladylike." (And I say this as someone who wears skirts 90 percent of the time.)</p>
<p><strong>6:46 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Well, those shoes are <em>interesting</em>. I don't want to wear them or own them, but they're certainly interesting.</p>

<p><strong>6:47 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>"At Ease": If you've been dreaming of seeing model Jourdan Dunn in both sweats and fur coats, then you're in luck. If you haven't? Well, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>6:50 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>It's "One of a Kind," where in "four woman translate fall's defining trends from the runway to the real world." Ah, yes, because that usually works so well. Especially when the oldest of your "real women" is 26, one of them is a model, and one of them is an actress.</p>
<p><strong>6:53 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, wait, they have helpful quotes, too! Like "Cut is more important than color." Thanks for that, <em>Vogue</em>. Really useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6:54 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Aaahhhh! The last page! I might kiss it.</p>
<p><strong>6:55 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>No, I am not going to kiss it. Though if you have more than a grand to drop on a pair of velvet shoes, you might want to kiss it.</p>
<p><strong>6:56 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Clinique ad and...back cover! Missoni for Target! DONE!</p>
<p>Remember, you have until 5 p.m. EDT on Friday to tweet #vogueliveblog and http://bit.ly/vogueliveblog11 to be entered to win a copy of <em>The September Issue.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>And as always, THANK YOU. Thank you for reading and for cheering me on throughout the day--it helped so much! Cheers!</p>

<title>&lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/i&gt; Finds the Worst Possible Men to Give You Advice</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I’ve had <a href="http://www.glossedover.com/glossed_over/cosmopolitan/" target="_self">plenty of suggestions</a> for <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, but I think this might be a new one: Maybe, O sagacious editors of the only publication that reads like a parody of itself, the next time you seek <a href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ade7ccf970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Cosmopolitan_DiannaAgron_Sept2011" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ade7ccf970d" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8ade7ccf970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Cosmopolitan_DiannaAgron_Sept2011" /></a> out men to advise women on matters of sex, you could attempt to find guys who aren’t total dirtbags. They exist!</p>
<p>Instead, in September’s “Guys Answer Your Sex Questions in 20 Words or Less,” Cosmo managed to assemble a bumper crop of judgmental, objectifying men to advise their readership of young women.</p>
<p>Sure, you could argue that these men are just relating their own opinions, and that Cosmo is actually doing its readers a service by including these jerks’ full names, professions, and photos with their comments. You could also argue the moon is made of green cheese.</p>
<p>On to the article! First we have one David Good, who’s written a book entitled <em>The Man Code: A Woman’s Guide to Cracking the Tough Guy</em>. (I hope to one day write a book called <em>The Bullshit Code: A Woman’s Guide to Rejecting the Guy Who’s Seen Too Many James Bond Movies and, As a Result, Is Overly Invested in Stereotypes of Masculinity</em>. Literary agents, <a href="mailto:editor@glossedover.com" target="_self">email me</a>!) Here’s what Cosmo asked and how David answered:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Are unshaven legs (or other body parts) a turn-off?</strong>
<p>Hell, yes. Shave that. It’s not 1973 anymore.&#0160;--David</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah! It’s not 1973 anymore. Back then, when a person went into puberty, surging hormones caused hair to develop in certain areas, and now that it’s 2011--oh wait. That still happens. Will someone please notify David?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If it’s been a while since you got it on, can just seeing a woman in a tight shirt give you an erection?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be an XXL, and if a guy’s horny, he’ll find something about any girl to turn him on. --Patrick [Meagher, host of Cosmo Radio’s <em>Cocktails with Patrick</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I originally read this as Patrick referring to the hypothetical woman as “it” and “an XXL” and almost had a rage blackout. But then I realized he’s referring to the shirt. Still,&#0160;Patrick is&#0160;really pushing bro-code boundaries here. First, there’s&#0160;his admission that a woman needn’t be clad in tight clothing to arouse a man, which is something one would never figure out from reading the fashion pages of Cosmo. Then there’s the statement that he can find “something” about “any girl,”&#0160;which is supposed to be reassuring and instead sounds patronizing. “There, there, little Cosmo reader, some man will find you attractive, <em>if</em> he’s desert-island desperate!”&#0160;It’s like&#0160;he thinks of women as objects who exist solely to provide him with aesthetic pleasure, and that is <em>such</em> an original viewpoint for a radio host!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If a woman has sex with a guy early on, does he assume she is like this with every guy?</strong></p>
<p>He probably assumes you are. But if he likes you, he doesn’t care. --Wilder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! How is this guy, Wilder Weir, still “single-ish”? (No, really, that’s what the description says.) I mean, he’s clearly such a prize and all, what with his amazing ability to forgo judging the sexual proclivities of women who’ve deigned to sleep with him. If he <em>likes</em> you, that is. Ugh. (No word on why he’d be sleeping with you if he <em>doesn’t</em> like you, even though there’s an under-20-words answer for that, too.)</p>
<p>Look, I get that some men believe things I find objectionable. So do some women. That fact isn’t a problem. But it is a problem when a magazine that proclaims itself the official publication of the “fun, fearless female” parrots sexist, judgmental nonsense to its readers. And it is a problem to peddle harmful, outdated viewpoints about sex and gender using the not-so-subtle implication that these guys are experts and women who don’t conform to these men’s ideals will remain single forever. (Never mind that it completely ignores the women who--clutch my pearls!--aren’t even heterosexual.)</p>
<p>Admittedly, dropping the how-to-please-a-man mumbo-jumbo would require a major overhaul of the magazine. But getting rid of the men-are-from-Mars nonsense would be <em>Cosmopolitan</em>’s most fun, fearless act yet.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/glossedover/ZveU/~4/PM-84QK5rmY" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 10 Worst Fashion Moments in September's &lt;i&gt;Glamour&lt;/i&gt;</title>

<description>So much of Glamour’s content is smart: in this issue, the Hillary Clinton profile, the article about gendered workplace dynamics, and even the Rihanna interview are solid. But when thoughtful articles meet impossible fashion, Glamour starts to seem less like...</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8abaa946970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Glamour_Sept2011_Rihanna" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8abaa946970d" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef014e8abaa946970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Glamour_Sept2011_Rihanna" /></a></p>
<p>So much of <em>Glamour</em>’s content is smart: in this issue, the Hillary Clinton profile, the article about gendered workplace dynamics, and even the Rihanna interview are solid.</p>
<p>But when thoughtful articles meet impossible fashion, <em>Glamour</em> starts to seem less like a manual for a sophisticated adulthood and more like an anthropological study of an alien life form. Is this what women are supposed to be like? Am <em>I</em> supposed to be this way/want these things/care about this stuff?</p>
<p>I’m no fashion expert. I admit it! But I take issue with the way fashion is continually presented not as a way to express individual style but instead as a series of expensive, men-love-this-but-not-that necessities.</p>
<p>So here’s a list of the things in <em>Glamour</em>’s September issue that really chafed.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Lancome ad touting “the first doll lash mascara”</strong></p>
<p>Doll lashes: the new, impossible standard! When actual human lashes (or Latisse-enhanced lashes, or fake eyelashes, or the millions of existing mascaras) just won’t suffice.</p>
<p><strong>2. This actual headline: “Clothes You Can’t Move In: Do or Don’t?”&#0160;</strong></p>
<p>This is a real question? Glamour answers in a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_it_doesn%27t_fit,_you_must_acquit" target="_self">Johnnie Cochran-style rhymes</a>, with the upshot being it’s cool to wear binding&#0160;clothes if you have some bulky dudes to carry you around. Anyone know where I can get a few of those?</p>
<p><strong>3. On page 154, <em>Glamour</em> asks Jennifer Lopez to provide style advice for a law student who wants to be taken seriously.</strong></p>
<p>Like Jennifer Lopez would know how to dress for a conservative office environment? That makes as much sense as asking the Kardashians how to dress tactfully.</p>
<p><strong>4. Oh, wait! <em>Glamour</em> did just that!</strong> (That’s page 190 if you’re following along at home.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Here’s designer Rachel Roy on riding bikes: “I usually still wear dresses and my Indian thong sandals. Reserve sweats for working out.”</strong></p>
<p>Yes, how dare you wear athletic clothes for an athletic activity! To paraphrase a friend, “My biking shirts wick moisture and have three pockets to keep my hands free. Why <em>aren’t</em> they perfect for everyday?”</p>
<p><strong>6. The very concept of “This Man Will Make You Sexy” on page 162 </strong></p>
<p>Apparently sexiness is a quality bestowed upon you by a male fashion designer when you buy something incredibly expensive.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>7. And, on a similar note, “The Clothes I Love On Women Now” </strong></p>
<p>What’s problematic here is not that a man is being touted as an expert--he <em>is</em> a fashion designer, after all--but the messages he assigns to clothes. A white collar for “preppy innocence”? Show “some skin, not too much”? Barf.</p>
<p><strong>8. ...and still another in this series of Men Telling Women How to Wear Things They’ve Never Actually Worn Themselves! Page 170 brings us “How to Look Sexier in Your Heels.” </strong></p>
<p>A story I could actually use is more like “How to Walk Comfortably in Your Heels So You Can Think About Maybe Trying to Feel Sexy Instead of Concentrating on Remaining Upright, With Extra Tips for Negotiating Subway Stairs in a Pencil Skirt and Heels” but no such luck.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>9. “5 New Things to Do With Your Eyes!”</strong></p>
<p>In case you were getting tired of traditional ocular functions like seeing.</p>
<p><strong>10. In “London Calling!” <em>Glamour</em> quotes <a href="http://youtu.be/Ic5vxw3eijY" target="_self">a Kanye West lyric</a> to describe a coat:&#0160; </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something about this classic always looks luxe. “Look at this peacoat, tell me he’s broke!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coat on this page is made by Gucci. Good thing they clarified it <em>looks</em> luxe, because I sure wouldn’t expect that from a $4K designer piece.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/glossedover/ZveU/~4/VLfeTqr9aho" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>981: According to the cover, the number of “ways to look amazing this season” <a href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef0153909c282c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Lucky_JessicaAlba_Sept2011" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef0153909c282c970b" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef0153909c282c970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Lucky_JessicaAlba_Sept2011" /></a></p>
<p>Gazillions: Approximate number of words in this issue. For better or worse (and, in the case of the never-ending article about drunk shopping, it’s definitely worse), there is now actual text in this magazine.</p>
<p>24: Items retailing for less than $50 featured in “Classic Pieces for Every Day”</p>
<p>116: Page on which Jessica Alba’s “Post-Baby Shape-Up Plan” appears, almost entirely devoid of context. I know <em>Lucky</em> is new to this whole writing-complete-sentences-and-forming-paragraphs thing, but they couldn’t follow up on Alba’s statement that she drinks a lot of water because she’s “starving”?</p>
<p>$60: As listed in “City Guide,” the price of a “Carrie Bradshaw-style pink tutu” sold by a store in Los Angeles, like a “Carrie Bradshaw-style” anything is a good thing.</p>
<p>$375: Price of a satchel that is, according to “How To: Wear Color,” the “easiest way to add a shot of color.”&#0160;</p>
<p>Zero: Explanation of how “easy”&#0160;it is to spend $375 on a neon bag.</p>
<p>1, apparently: Words left out of the headline “Dress Like a French Girl. No, Really, a Real French Girl.” That word? “Wealthy,” unless it’s being French that somehow enables one to purchase a $550 dress and an $860 jacket. In which case, v<em>ive la France!</em></p>
<p>$250: Price of a cat-ear hood that Lucky suggests wearing “with a dose of irony, for the downtown hipster.” Behold <a href="http://storify.com/glossedover/the-case-of-the-cat-hat2" target="_blank">the amazingly awkward exchange</a> that ensued when I tweeted @LuckyMagazine about this ridiculous headgear! Veronica, aka <a href="twitter.com/duncandesign" target="_self">@duncandesign</a>, joined in to keep the conversation on track.</p>
<p>3: “Stylish New Yorkers” plucked from “the sidewalks of Soho” to model fall fashions in “Style on the Street.”</p>
<p>100: Percent of those random New Yorkers who are conventionally slim and pretty! Surprise!</p>
<p>Not 2: According to Jean Godfrey-June, the number of people permitted in the dressing rooms at Gilly &amp; Hicks, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch’s lingerie store. She says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(You can’t both go in [the dressing room]; the surroundings are so...provocative...that liaisons are rumored to have occurred in the dressing rooms, hence, a ban.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infinitely: How weird it is that Godfrey-June would mention this, considering that in the story she’s shopping with her daughter.</p>
<p>2:&#0160;Cover lines on the issue of <em>Lucky Kids</em>&#0160;stuck inside the back cover that are&#0160;uncomfortably reminiscent of the&#0160;<a href="http://www.styleite.com/media/thylane-loubry-blondeau/" target="_blank">controversy over 10-year-old model Thylane Blondeau</a>: “Dresses So Pretty You’ll Wish They Came in Your Size” and&#0160;“I Want My Kid’s Hair Color!” (Related reading: <a href="http://bit.ly/p527W5" target="_blank">this article</a> about fashion brands using child models to normalize eating disorders.)</p>
<p>0: Interest I had in pulling <em>Lucky Kids</em> out of the magazine--until I needed something to shield my laptop with during a sudden downpour.&#0160;</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/glossedover/ZveU/~4/WEjgWd7VV1I" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<title>&lt;i&gt;InStyle Makeover&lt;/i&gt;: Rita Hayworth's Ethnic Makeover Was "Worth It"</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I meet someone new and tell them about this blog, the responses I get usually fall into two categories. Most often I hear, “Oh! Totally! I stopped reading those magazines years ago.” And sometimes I get, “Well...what kinds of things do you write about, exactly?” <a href="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef0154343d087b970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="InstyleMakeover_Sept2011_RachelBilson" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d07cf53ef0154343d087b970c" src="http://www.glossedover.com/.a/6a00d8341d07cf53ef0154343d087b970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="InstyleMakeover_Sept2011_RachelBilson" /></a></p>
<p>From now on, when someone asks the latter, I’m just going to hand them “The Hollywood Hot Machine” from <em>InStyle Makeover</em>’s September issue. This single page manages to include pretty much everything that’s wrong with women’s magazines: obsession with the male gaze, extreme beauty regimens, impossibly strict diets, and a dash of shocking ignorance. Handy!</p>
<p>The article features six actresses who’ve made major adjustments to their appearances to launch their showbiz careers. We aren’t talking about going from a side part to a middle part here, you know? If the fact that these women had to dramatically change their hair, faces, bodies and even their names--or at least <em>felt</em> they had to--isn’t maddening enough for you, maybe you’ll hate the breezy tone <em>InStyle</em> uses to describe their transformations. I sure did!</p>
<p>For instance, the article says Joan Crawford (née Lucille LeSueur)&#0160;used “rigorous diet and exercise” to become “sleek.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Reportedly, she even chewed gum in an attempt to sharpen her jawline.</p>
<p>Apparently no celebrity plastic surgeons were available to comment on the merits of Orbit as a cosmetic technique. Try it at home, readers!</p>
<p>The article goes on to mention haircuts and wardrobe changes for Marilyn Monroe and Diana Ross, and says of Jane Fonda:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fonda’s first husband, Roger Vadim, directed her schoolgirl-to-sex-kitten makeover. He’d done the same for previous wife Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>And a man habitually directing his wives into “sex kitten” makeovers isn’t creepy or predatory at all!</p>
<p>Oh, and what about Jennifer Aniston?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yoga, hairstylist Chris McMillan, and a salad for lunch almost every day for 10 years helped Aniston morph into this honey-dipped goddess.</p>
<p>So we again have a man to thank. And of course there’s that salad-a-day for a decade thing. Is that a healthy diet, a reasonable approach to eating, or just something Aniston’s publicist made up? Who cares? The real message here is that she’s whippet-thin, as anyone who’s seen her wearing scanty underthings in&#0160;<em>Horrible Bosses</em> can tell you.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I’ve reserved the bulk of my outrage for the Rita Hayworth entry, which reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Painful but worth it: In two years, Margarita Cansino raised her hairline almost an inch with electrolysis. And when she went red, a star was born.</p>
<p>“Painful but worth it”? WHAT THE HELL. Do <em>InStyle</em>’s offices not have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" target="_self">access to Wikipedia</a>? I have to assume that’s the case, because obviously no one at the magazine knows why Hayworth had that electrolysis: at the behest of Columbia Pictures, to <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17501_5-celebrity-careers-launched-by-ethnic-makeovers.html" target="_self">make her appearance less Hispanic</a> and therefore more marketable. That’s also why she dyed her hair red and bleached her skin.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Incidentally, that second link has a context-sensitive ad for a skin-lightening treatment that reads “<em>InStyle</em> Award Winner!” Wow.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Celebrities change their appearances for all kinds of reasons, but praising a racially motivated, excrutiatingly painful cosmetic procedure as “worth it” is, at best, insensitive. (And at worst? I really don’t want to break out the “r” word.)&#0160;Did Hayworth look better than Cansino did? That’s subjective. But there are some ugly, ugly implications attached to glorifying a makeover designed to hide Hayworth’s heritage. I mean, what’s the reader takeaway supposed to be here? That everyone looks better as a white person? That the agony Hayworth must have gone through was “worth it” to not look Hispanic?</p>
<p>This is tricky territory, and&#0160;<em>InStyle</em> could have provided context or sidestepped those implications entirely.&#0160;But they didn’t, and that’s the problem. Articles like this propagate the idea that beauty is pain--and that beauty is determined by men, and it requires expensive, painful treatments, and it demands extreme, restrictive diets, and that only certain kinds of women (namely thin white women) are beautiful. Perhaps expecting<em> InStyle Makeover </em>to acknowledge as much is ridiculous.&#0160;</p>
<p>Still, it’s been more than 80 years since the picture of Lucille LeSueur on this page was taken. Eighty years after LeSueur tried to reshape her face by chewing gum, and Jennifer Aniston eats arugula every day.&#0160;<em>Eighty years.</em> That’s a long time for so little to have changed.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/glossedover/ZveU/~4/gf5tbsIhL5U" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is it the <em>Shape</em> cover featuring Audrina Patridge, who&#0160;is perhaps best known for hawking <a href="http://youtu.be/fw_fd5T7IaQ" target="_self">Carl’s Jr. burgers that she pretty clearly doesn&#39;t eat</a>, and who appears to have lost the entire right side of her body to the Photoshop bandit?</p>
<p>Or is it the <em>Seventeen</em> issue with Nina Dobrev,&#0160;because it’s a publication telling 12-year-olds how to acquire a rockin’ bikini body? (Let’s not even get into the missing chunk of her torso.)</p>
<p>I can’t decide, see, because I started trying to figure out why these magazines ostensibly devoted to fitness couldn’t find someone with serious muscle definition to put on the cover, and then I looked up how many professional women’s athletic leagues exist in the US, and then I learned there are <a href="http://www.titleix.info/10-Key-Areas-of-Title-IX/Athletics.aspx" target="_self">more than 170,000 women playing college sports</a>, and then I thought about Jillian Michaels and <em>Glee</em>’s professional dancer/actor Heather Morris (both of whom are famous enough to have landed magazine covers recently)&#0160;and, for that matter, the women on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>, and that I would consider any of them a more compelling fitness role model than Lauren Conrad’s neighbor from&#0160;<em>The Hills</em>, and then I tried to figure out why major media outlets would forgo women like that in favor of these two as the best examples of a healthy lifestyle, and I realized--of course!--it has more to do with newsstand sales than actual fitness, and that’s more or less when my brain exploded.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/glossedover/ZveU/~4/5Un4jKM7l6s" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>
