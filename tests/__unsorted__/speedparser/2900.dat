		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2011/08/19/a-hack-for-searching-for-tweets-by-date-with-help-from-google-spreadsheets/"><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3877" title="hack.001-001" src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hack.001-001.png" alt="" width="430" height="323" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/clive/">Clive</a> was the first round these parts to notice that the beloved Twitter Search (formerly known as search.twitter.com) appears to have been revamped, with certain search options apparently retired, notably the ability to specify a date range when searching. <strong>*sad face*</strong></p>
<p>You can see the search functions as they once were <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/search-twitter-advanced.jpg">here</a>, and the current version <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search-advanced">here</a>, now devoid of all date-based options.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all is not lost, since <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search">the search API</a> still allows you to specify a date range via the (undocumented) <code>since</code> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search#api-param-search_until"><code>until</code></a> parameters.</p>
<p>However, for some unfathomable reason (unfathomable, at least, to me), some folk appear to object to having to parse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> feeds with their own eyes, instead preferring the assistance of a helpful, friendly and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>It would be fairly straightforward to knock up an API-powered search form to restore some of the now-absent search options, however being strapped for time, I prefer the quick-and-dirty hack of just using Google Spreadsheets as a stopgap solution.</p>
<p>So, for those wishing to search for tweets within a specific timeframe, without harming their eyes, I give you my Google Spreadsheets based hack (fanfare, please!):</p>
<p><a href="http://j.mp/nmj5wM">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgwxfJ2RdQrudDN5a1pGcjJ3RXBHZm5uNEkxcEJTZ3c&amp;hl=en_US</a></p>
<p>You can make your own editable version of this, by just copying the spreadsheet (via the File &gt; Make a copy&#8230; drop-down menu).</p>
<p>The spreadsheet uses the clever, but little-known, <strong>ImportFeed</strong> function, to import the search results into the document, and the query is driven by the cells at the top of the spreadsheet. A little sprinkling of <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/articles/custom_function.html">Apps Script</a> ensures that the parameters are safely encoded for transit across the interwebs.</p>
<p>So, that’s my hack! I’m not expecting it to win any prizes for visual aesthetics, but it more or less does the trick for us!</p>
<p>Any other clever hacks out there for achieving this? Being the geek that I am, I’d love to hear about them in the comments&#8230; :)</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2011/04/19/measuring-the-relevance-and-alignment-of-your-twitter-audience/"><![CDATA[<p>We all know, it’s not just the <em>number</em> of followers on Twitter you have, but the <em>quality</em> of those followers, that matters. It’s much more meaningful to be followed by <a href="http://twitter.com/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> than your <a href="http://twitter.com/YourAuntBarbara">Auntie Barbara</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>But, how can we measure the quality of our audience effectively? One factor of quality that can be measured is the alignment between your followers’ interests and your own. By measuring this, we can see if we’re reaching the people we want to reach.</p>
<p>I’d like to introduce a simple but quite effective approach I’ve been playing with recently, which uses that marvelous, much-loved invention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Venn">John Venn</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagrams">Venn diagram</a>, to try and establish a method of measuring alignment and relevance.</p>
<p>By first harvesting sets of followers of select Twitter accounts (through Twitter’s <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/doc/">API</a>), and then overlaying those sets in Venn diagram fashion, we’re able to gain a quick, visible gauge of how closely aligned, or opposed, those Twitter accounts are. This gives us an instantly-understandable snapshot of how appealing one particular person, or brand, on Twitter is to the followers of another Twitter account, and helps us understand the size, quality and interests of our audience.</p>
<p><strong>A quick example to illustrate the idea&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @ladygaga, @katyperry and @RIHANNA by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5631917631_9800fee578_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5631917631/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5631917631_01a87bfb5e.jpg" alt="Followers of @ladygaga, @katyperry and @RIHANNA" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>This diagram represents the <strong>13.5 million</strong> people who follow either <a href="http://twitter.com/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/katyperry">Katy Perry</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/rihanna">Rihanna</a> on Twitter. We can see that Gaga has the largest fan base of all three, followed by Perry and then Rihanna, with <strong>1.8 million</strong> people following all three performers.</p>
<p>Looking more closely,  it’s interesting to note that while a sizable portion of Rihanna’s followers also follow either Perry or Gaga (<strong>68%</strong>), there is slightly more similarity, or <em>cohesion</em>, between Gaga/Perry fans than Perry/Rihanna fans (<strong>58%</strong> of Katy Perry’s followers also follow Lady Gaga, whereas <strong>35%</strong> of Perry fans follow Rihanna).  Maybe Katy Perry and Lady Gaga should perform a duet? Just imagine the pandemonium that would ensue! Well, I’m fairly certain <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/ross"><abbr title="Ross Breadmore">Ross</abbr></a> would rush out and buy the single, anyway.</p>
<p>So, here are some more variations on this theme (selected from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/sets/72157626526691196/show/">this Flickr photoset</a>), some are perhaps rather contrived, and others just plain geeky/silly/fun, but there are some serious applications thrown in too for good measure, so look out! :)</p>
<p><strong>First of all, let&#8217;s see how the followers of @<a href="http://twitter.com/darthvader">darthvader</a>, @<a href="http://twitter.com/lordpalpatine">lordpalpatine</a> (Vader’s boss) and @<a href="http://twitter.com/wwwfoecouk">wwwfoecouk</a> (Friends of the Earth) compare&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @darthvader, @LordPalpatine and @wwwfoecouk by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5632501258_8b54fa3766_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5632501258/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5632501258_0a01077805.jpg" alt="Followers of @darthvader, @LordPalpatine and @wwwfoecouk" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Here we see a mahoosive <strong>75%</strong> of Palpatine’s followers also follow Vader, indicating Vader’s evil antics appeal highly to fans of the Dark Side’s Emperor. Meanwhile, there’s not much love between this pair of evil fiends and Friends of the Earth, in fact the two are almost diametrically opposed. The fact that Vader and Palpatine aren’t best mates with the Earth, while disturbing, should not entirely surprise us. It’s just a good job Palpatine and Vader don’t actually exist, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Moving swiftly on&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @darthvader, @justinbieber and @ladygaga by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5632501162_c8e454b339_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5632501162/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5632501162_79bf3ebea7.jpg" alt="Followers of @darthvader, @justinbieber and @ladygaga" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>In terms of audience size, there’s little between the young upstart <a href="http://twitter.com/justinbieber">Bieber</a> and Lady Gaga, but it seems Gaga has a dark side that is more appealing to the Vader contingent.</p>
<p><strong>Next up&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @50cent, @english50cent and @queenlizii by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5021/5631917337_8b33a189e7_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5631917337/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5021/5631917337_899a3d48d2.jpg" alt="Followers of @50cent, @english50cent and @queenlizii" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Looks like the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/english50cent">English 50 Cent</a> is doing a fine job of translating <a href="http://twitter.com/50cent">Fiddy</a>’s tweets for followers of the <a href="http://twitter.com/queenlizii">Queen</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s see how love rivals @<a href="http://twitter.com/misskatieprice">misskatieprice</a> (AKA jordan), @<a href="http://twitter.com/MrPeterAndre">MrPeterAndre</a> and @<a href="http://twitter.com/Only1AlexReid">Only1AlexReid</a> fare&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @misskatieprice, @MrPeterAndre and @Only1AlexReid by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5631917179_1d72a87a18_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5631917179/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5631917179_aaf596a8c8.jpg" alt="Followers of @misskatieprice, @MrPeterAndre and @Only1AlexReid" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>With <strong>77.4%</strong> of his followers also following Miss Price and Mr Andre, is Alex Reid a mere pawn in the ongoing, tabloid-fuelled rift between the once happily married couple?</p>
<p><strong>Moving quickly on to slightly more credible territory&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of @arsenal, @persie_official and @FlyingEmirates by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5070/5631917065_9c73bd194f_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5631917065/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5070/5631917065_7c7106e875.jpg" alt="Followers of @arsenal, @persie_official and @FlyingEmirates" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Might <a href="http://twitter.com/FlyingEmirates">The Emirates Group</a> (official sponsors of Premiership giants <a href="http://twitter.com/arsenal">Arsenal</a>) hope for slightly more overlap with followers of the club and their star striker <a href="http://twitter.com/persie_official">Robin van Persie</a>?</p>
<p>If someone could just hurry up and invent a time machine, we could go back and benchmark and then monitor the affect, if any, this sponsorship deal has had on the appeal of Emirates to their target market.</p>
<p><strong>And now, let&#8217;s throw in a hashtag to spice things up a little&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a title="Followers of #c4thepromise, @mailonline and @guardian by NixonMcInnes, on Flickr" rel="shadowbox[tweetspot];content=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5632500656_39f82ffeec_o.png" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nixonmcinnes/5632500656/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5632500656_444e0c6aae.jpg" alt="Followers of #c4thepromise, @mailonline and @guardian" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Some hashtags naturally have finite lifespans, particularly hashtags for events and TV programmes. It’s possible, therefore, to apply this methodology to such hashtags, by capturing the conversation over the duration of the hashtag, and then pulling out the distinct set of contributors to the conversation.</p>
<p>We did just this with our <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-promise/articles/twitter-tracker">Datacopter</a> instance for Channel 4’s 4-part drama series <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-promise">The Promise</a> earlier this year, and here’s a snapshot at how that conversation mapped against followers of <a href="http://twitter.com/mailonline">The Daily Mail</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/guardian">The Guardian</a>. Interesting how the followers of these 2 daily nationals seem to be split in this particular conversation, with there being virtually no overlap between all 3 sets.</p>
<p><strong>Other possible uses</strong></p>
<p>These are some ideas <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/beth"><abbr title="Beth Granter">Beth</abbr></a> had for some other possible uses for analyses of this kind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor analysis</li>
<li>Audience persona profiling</li>
<li>Analysis of potential reach of key messages to specific audiences, e.g. comparison of followers with users of a hashtag relating to a PR crisis</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we welcome further insight and feedback in the comments below, but also feel free to leave requests for any other comparisons you’d like to see, I&#8217;ll try and cover as many as I can!</p>
<p>Tune in next time when I’ll introduce a technique for comparing similarity between any number of Twitter accounts, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering</a>!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2010/09/28/is-everybody-happy-measuring-happiness-in-the-workplace/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/renaissancechambara/2288556895/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2463" title="'Smiley detail' by renaissancechambara on Flickr" src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2288556895_5a9f918276_b-430x285.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="285" /></a></p>
<p>According to <a title="How workplace happiness can boost productivity | Psychology Today" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201007/how-workplace-happiness-can-boost-productivity">recent studies</a>, happiness in the workplace is positively correlated with productivity, so as happiness increases, productivity follows suit, but when unhappiness gains a foothold, productivity and, ultimately, the health of the business, suffer.</p>
<p>To this end (and also because <a href="http://spo.tl/fXFGf">We Care A Lot</a>) we&#8217;ve set up a simple &#8220;barometer of happiness”, or &#8220;happiness index&#8221; as we like to call it, that acts as an early warning system to quickly detect any potential outbreak of unhappiness in <a title="The team" href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/">the team</a>, so we can nip it in the bud. This happiness indicator gives an important perspective on the health of the business, and is arguably as important as any balance sheet, profit and loss statement, or cashflow report.</p>
<p>The first prototype, or version 0.1, has been live for a couple of months now and has provided some illuminating insight into our collective emotional condition (Tuesdays, for instance, are a regular, recurring low point in the week).</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the ground-breaking technology that makes all this possible?</p>
<p>The answer&#8230; A couple of buckets and a few dozen tennis balls. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0475-430w.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2447" title="Balls" src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0475-430w.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="688" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the day, as we leave the office, we each drop a tennis ball into either the Happy or Unhappy bucket, to capture how we felt, on balance, throughout the day. The following morning, the balls are counted (by either <a title="Max" href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/max/">Max</a>, or a band of merry pixies, I’m not sure which) and the totals scrawled on a piece of paper stuck to the door. At the end of each week, <a title="Pete" href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/pete/">Pete</a>, our industrious chairman, tots up the numbers and logs them in a Google spreadsheet. It’s poetry in motion.</p>
<p>To complete the feedback loop, we periodically fetch and process the data from the spreadsheet using <a title="Google App Engine" href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>, and display it on our internal, <a title="Geckoboard" href="http://geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a>-powered dashboard, keeping the data nice and visible, and allowing us to answer the all-important question: <strong>over time, as a group, are we becoming more or less happy?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of our Geckoboard instance, which runs continually in the office on a spare monitor, showing the latest results (along with other must-have information, such as rail times, what&#8217;s playing on <a title="The office stereo" href="http://twitter.com/nmstereo">the office stereo</a> and what&#8217;s being said about us on Twitter):</p>

<p>For the last few weeks, a few of us here have been locked away in the highest of the NM Towers, working away frantically scoping out, designing, prototyping and building 3 real-time visualizations to accompany <a href="http://www.channel4.com/">Channel 4&#8217;s</a> pre-budget Dispatches special, <a href="http://howtosavebillions.channel4.com/">How to Save £100 Billion LIVE</a>, which was aired on Monday evening. It&#8217;s been a privilege to work on, a highlight of my career even, but no small task by any means!</p>
<p>Just over 3 week&#8217;s ago, we were tasked with producing 3 visual representations of the conversation around the show, as it unraveled, in real-time, on Twitter, the goal being to give the audience at home a voice in the proceedings, and access to the collective thoughts and opinions of others watching, making it easy to follow the live TV show and online conversations, simultaneously.</p>
<p>We immediately set about defining how we might clearly and accurately represent the conversation visually, settling on slicing and dicing it from a few key angles: who&#8217;s talking, what are they saying, how much are they saying, and where are they saying it, complemented by some bite-sized, easily-digestible statistics, such as number of tweets, tweets per minutes, number of &#8216;tweeters&#8217; and most authoritative tweeter (hat tip: the awesome Infochimps <a href="http://trst.me/">trst.me</a> API).</p>
<p>Teaming up with local data visualization whizz kid, Mr. <a href="http://ollieglass.com/">Ollie Glass</a>, we got to work right away, first prototyping 2 proof of concepts using the <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> environment, and then iteratively testing and re-working until we were (mostly) satisfied. A few last minute deployment and integration issues kept us all on our toes (also, I&#8217;m not sure I helped massively by demanding a last minute complete rewrite of 2 out of the 3 visualizations), but after 3 week&#8217;s of grueling days and impossibly long nights, I&#8217;m incredibly happy with the results (*yay*), both from a technical, and a functional &#8217;social TV experiment&#8217; perspective! Go team! :)</p>
<p>I will happily follow-up with a technical &#8216;deep dive&#8217; if anyone shows even the slightest amount of interest (FYI: it involves helicopters, chimpanzees, lots of Sellotape and a jazz guitarist) but for now here&#8217;s a quick run-down of the data (visualized in a very neat list):</p>
<ul>
<li>Total tweets: 2,020</li>
<li>Total tweeters: 1,017</li>
<li>Top tweeter: Sunday Telegraph Business Editor, <a href="http://twitter.com/ahmedk123">@ahmedk123</a></li>
<li>Conversation velocity: a whopping 23TPM (Tweets Per Minute)</li>
</ul>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2010/01/07/crowd-sourcing-the-office-stereo-using-twitter-and-spotify/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joriel/2415728050/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1731" title="Grand Master and his Ghetto Blasters..." src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2415728050_c78ee32b67_o-430x430.jpg" alt="Grand Master and his Ghetto Blasters..." width="430" height="430" /></a></p>
<p>While idly experimenting with the newfangled, <em>real-time</em> <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation">Twitter Streaming API</a> yesterday, I decided to have a little bit of fun, to try and make life a little more interesting! In the interests of innovation and openness, I thought I would take some time out to share these experiments with you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Experiment #1</strong></p>
<p>A little Python script, <a href="http://gist.github.com/270452">tweet_speak.py</a>, that reads tweets aloud (using the OS X <tt>say</tt> command), from either a specified list of followees, or tracked keywords. Could be useful for some form of buzz-monitoring/alert-type system, as <a href="http://twitter.com/willmcinnes/status/7480039425">noted</a> by <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/people/will">Mr. Willeeumm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment #2</strong></p>
<p>This is where things get really interesting/silly (*delete as appropriate).</p>
<p>Building on Experiment #1, I setup a dedicated Twitter account for the office stereo, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmstereo">@nmstereo</a>, to which anyone can now <a href="http://twitter.com/steveWINton/status/7481739375">direct a song request</a>, via the form of a <a href="http://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2008/01/14/linking-to-spotify/">Spotify track URI</a>, which will then be dutifully played on the NixonMcInnes office stereo, e.g.</p>
<p><tt>@nmstereo spotify:track:3Zk68KkPWgvfx8Bs0gqYDw</tt></p>
<p>So, now, EVERYONE can join in the fun of the beloved, weekly Love Hour™ (every Wednesday, 3pm sharp, folks)!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won&#8217;t be able to hear the song you request (unless of course you&#8217;re in the office, duh!), but we&#8217;re sure to enjoy your selection and, fear not, we never censor anything on the office stereo!!!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how long we can keep this running for, currently it&#8217;s not going to scale very well, and if we get too many requests for <a href="spotify:track:4psRoaOLrAI1fiDWQHgiZX">It&#8217;s Raining Men</a>, then we may have to take it down, but, until then, let&#8217;s have a little fun, shall we? :)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (2010-01-08): Here&#8217;s the Python script, <a href="http://gist.github.com/271686">tweetify.py</a>, that we&#8217;re using to hook our stereo up to Twitter!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (2010-01-14): The Twitter/Spotify revolution continues with this @nmstereo clone, <a href="http://twitter.com/tweepify">@tweepify</a>!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (2010-01-20): Here&#8217;s a less spammy Web interface for requesting songs on @nmstereo (oh, and you can listen along, too!): <a href="http://nmstereo.appspot.com/">nmstereo.appspot.com</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (2010-01-22): Another implementation spotted in the wild: <a href="https://twitter.com/nlgit">@nlgit</a>. w00T!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2009/07/27/making-wordpress-navigation-more-usable-through-pagination-patterns/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pliabletrade/3758301047/" title="Leafing through the pages of the interwebs"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3466/3763298356_469145ef2e_o.jpg" width="430" height="172" alt="Leafing through the pages of the interwebs" /></a></p>
<p>An out-of-the-box WordPress installation provides traditional “previous – next” navigation for paging through lists of posts, as do the vast majority of the freely available WordPress themes. These little ‘previous’/’older’ and ‘next’/’newer’ links, that typically reside at the foot of a list of a WordPress posts page, are often the user’s only means of browsing archived content, and navigating your way through a very large set of such listings can quickly become cumbersome with this navigation method.</p>
<p>Pagination offers a more usable mechanism for navigating through a very large set of data, by providing direct access to content beyond the current page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.co.uk/2007/11/16/pagination-gallery-examples-and-good-practices/">Smashing Magazine</a> has provided some simple guidelines for creating usable pagination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide large clickable areas</li>
<li>Don’t use underlines</li>
<li>Identify the current page</li>
<li>Space out page links</li>
<li>Provide Previous and Next links</li>
<li>Use First and Last links (where applicable)</li>
<li>Put First and Last links on the outside</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I’m admittedly far from a being an expert in this area, I humbly suggest an eighth guideline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a subset of the full paged set centering around the current page</li>
</ul>
<p>This eighth guideline is exemplified by the pagination pattern employed by Flickr on its photostream pages.</p>
<p>To illustrate, a pagination control that encompasses the above guidelines, providing links to the first, previous, next, and last pages and centering on the current page being viewed might resemble the following mockup:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1252" title="Mockup of a pagination control" src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/pagination_mid_plain2.png" alt="Mockup of a pagination control" width="427" height="107" /></p>
<p>There are a myriad of variations of pagination patterns along this theme available, and you could do worse than start looking in the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=searchpagination">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a> for some inspiration.</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress…</p>
<p>Any intrepid WordPress theme developers out there may be interested to learn that we’ve developed a little plugin for WordPress, tentatively named ‘Proper Pagination’, that intends to ease the creation of pagination controls for WordPress listings pages.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">WordPress Loop</a> and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query">WP_Query</a>, this plugin attempts to stay out of the theme developer&#8217;s way, allowing her to create the markup needed by providing ‘template tags’ such as <tt>pp_has_pagination</tt>, <tt>pp_the_pagination</tt>, <tt>pp_the_first_page_permalink</tt>, <tt>pp_the_last_page_permalink</tt> and so on (pp_ is a prefix we use to effectively ‘namespace’ the global functions defined by this plugin).</p>
<p>A full list of the template tags, along with their respective descriptions, follows…</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>pp_has_pagination</tt> — determines whether the current &#8216;view&#8217; has any pagination to display, i.e. whether the content being browsed spans more than 1 page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_pagination</tt> — initiates the pagination context, should be called at the beginning of each loop iteration</li>
<li><tt>pp_rewind_pagination</tt> — resets the pagination context, so that the pagination loop can be iterated over multiple times</li>
<li><tt>pp_is_current_page</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, returns a boolean indicating whether the current loop iteration is for the current page</li>
<li><tt>pp_has_previous_page</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, returns a boolean indicating whether there is a previous page, e.g. when at page 1, there is no previous page</li>
<li><tt>pp_has_next_page</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next page, e.g. when at page N of N, there is no next page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_page_permalink</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the permalink for the current page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_previous_page_permalink</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the permalink for the previous page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_next_page_permalink</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the permalink for the next page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_first_page_permalink</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the permalink for the first page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_last_page_permalink</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the permalink for the last page</li>
<li><tt>pp_the_page_num</tt> — for use in the pagination loop, echos the page number of the current page being iterated over</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, here&#8217;s an example of how you might arrange those splendid template tags to achieve the desired pagination effect:</p>
<pre name="code" class="html">&lt;?php if (pp_has_pagination()) : ?&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;pagination&quot;&gt;

            &lt;!-- the previous page --&gt;
            &lt;?php pp_the_pagination(); if (pp_has_previous_page()) : ?&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php pp_the_previous_page_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot; class=&quot;prev&quot;&gt;newer stories&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;?php else : ?&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;current prev&quot;&gt;newer stories&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;?php endif; pp_rewind_pagination(); ?&gt;

            &lt;!-- the page links --&gt;
            &lt;?php while(pp_has_pagination()) : pp_the_pagination(); ?&gt;
                &lt;?php if (pp_is_current_page()) : ?&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;current&quot;&gt;&lt;?php pp_the_page_num(); ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;?php else : ?&gt;
                    &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php pp_the_page_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;?php pp_the_page_num(); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
            &lt;?php endwhile; pp_rewind_pagination(); ?&gt;

            &lt;!-- the next page --&gt;
            &lt;?php pp_the_pagination(); if (pp_has_next_page()) : ?&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php pp_the_next_page_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot; class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;older stories&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;?php else : ?&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;current next&quot;&gt;older stories&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;?php endif; pp_rewind_pagination(); ?&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Here at Nizomk Towers, we have been following, with keen interest, the conversations flying around teh internets about <a title="Solving the TinyUrl centralization problem (Scripting News)" href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/07/solvingTheTinyurlCentraliz.html" target="_blank">the</a> <a title="joshua's blog: on url shorteners" href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html" target="_blank">perils</a> <a title="URL Shortening Hinting - Laughing Meme" href="http://laughingmeme.org/2009/04/03/url-shortening-hinting/" target="_blank">of</a> <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>-shortening services, such as <a title="TinyURL.com" href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">TinyURL</a> <em>et al</em>. Apparently, with both the number of available URL-shortening services growing, along with the reliance on them, what we have is a ticking time bomb, just waiting to explode in our faces! Yikes!</p>
<p>As one <a title="Josh is right, URL shorteners are risky (Scripting News)" href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/04/03/joshIsRightUrlShortenersAr.html" target="_blank">Dave Winer</a> so wisely puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to prepare for the day when N of the URL shorteners go out of business. When that happens a large part of the web will die. It will not be a good day.</p></blockquote>
<p>There have been various dialogues about what can be done to tackle the issue, one proposal is to place the responsibilty of URL-shortening firmly in the hands of the owner of the long URL, who would dutifully publish a shortened version using a common and, one hopes, widely-adopted convention. This would then be revealed in much the same way that RSS feeds are currently announced and discovered.</p>
<p>One very clever &#8217;short URL auto-discovery&#8217; solution, <a href="http://revcanonical.appspot.com/">rev=canonical</a>,  has been proposed and implemented by <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/">Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a>, it&#8217;s not much more than a proof-of-concept at this stage, and would need widespread adoption to truly solve the issue, but we like the idea so much we thought we&#8217;d show our support by quickly throwing together a WordPress implementation and releasing it into the wild!</p>
<p>The source code for our plugin, <tt>wp_rev_canonical.php</tt>, is hosted on our <a href="http://github.com/nixmc/nm-wp-plugins/tree/master">GitHub repository</a>, and our own beloved website (yes, the one before your very eyes) is already serving blog post pages with included shortened URL goodness, so now any service that supports it can publish our super-cute shortened URLs wherever needed.</p>
<p>For example, the shortened URL for this blog post is <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/?p=1017">http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/?p=1017</a>, this is broadcast by the following markup in the <tt>head</tt> section of this webpage:</p>
<pre name="code" class="html">
&lt;link rev="canonical" href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/?p=1017" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate shorter" href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/?p=1017" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ideally, of course, the shortened URLs would be served from an alternative, shorter, snappier, domain name, you might notice that ours sadly aren&#8217;t.  We will be implementing this under our syllable-preserving pseudonym, nixmc.com, at the moment we are simply proving the concept, but hope to build on this in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>So, if your site is running WordPress, then you might like to download and install our plugin yourself, just <a href="http://github.com/nixmc/nm-wp-plugins/blob/d5bac2a0ead1cda5009fa967243b9fee8488bf91/wp_rev_canonical.php">grab it from GitHub</a>, upload to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder, make sure your theme supports <tt>wp_head</tt>, enable it, and before you know it, Internet-friendly short URLs are your new best friend! Yay!				<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/dp.SyntaxHighlighter/js/shBrushXml.js"></script><br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2008/05/20/coding-genetic-algorithms-at-flashbrighton/"><![CDATA[<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.flashbrighton.org/wordpress/" title="FlashBrighton">FlashBrighton</a> hosted a <em>Code-along </em>session<em>, </em>the primary objective of which was to develop a genetics algorithm collaboratively<em>. </em>Edd and I were there, desperately trying to follow the proceedings in our languages of choice, C# and Java, respectively.</p>
<p>At the risk of massively over-generalizing, from my understanding of last night&#8217;s session, the general pattern of a genetic algorithm is thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a random population</li>
<li>Evaluate the &#8216;fitness&#8217; of the members of the population</li>
<li>Destroy the &#8216;least fit&#8217; members of the population</li>
<li>To make up the numbers, the sad loss of aforementioned weaklings is replaced with mutations of the &#8216;most fit&#8217; members of the population</li>
</ul>
<p>To whet our appetites, we were given a quick demo of <a href="http://www.blprnt.com/smartrockets/" title="SmartRockets">SmartRockets</a>, a clever population of rockets that, over time, learn how to hit a random target.</p>
<p>So, with the groundwork covered, it was time to crack open our respective <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" title="Integrated Development Environment">IDEs</a> and attempt to follow along. As <abbr title="Genetics Algorithm">GA</abbr> <em>newbies</em>, we didn&#8217;t quite reach the lofty heights of the SmartRockets algorithm, but we did create a population of bit streams, whose goal was to eliminate all 0s in favour of 1s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flashbrighton.org/wordpress/?p=115" title="ActionScript version of Genetics Algorithm">Here&#8217;s</a> the ActionScript implementation and, for those that attended last night and are interested, my Java implementation of this algorithm is <a href="http://pastebin.com/f4b7394f5" title="Java version of Genetics Algorithm">here</a> (execute it using <a href="http://pastebin.com/df30e64c">this Java class</a>). And Edd&#8217;s C# implementation <a href="http://www.communecation.net/stuff/geneticmen_csharp.zip" title="C# version of Genetics Algorithm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, I had to leave before the end of the night, in the midst of everyone debating how to evaluate a population whose sole intent was to evolve into a certain colour (at least that was my understanding, had my head stuck in a cloud of 1s and 0s, so it was hard to tell!) &#8212; for anyone that was there, I&#8217;d love to see the end result of this discussion!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2008/04/25/building-micro-web-applications-using-wordpress-pages/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tochis/2382906259/" title="Expo2008: Squared &#038; Diagonal (on Flickr)"><img src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2440310579_9eb10aac9c_o.jpg" alt="Expo2008: Squared &#038; Diagonal on Flickr" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress Publishing Platform">WordPress</a> is a state-of-the-art publishing platform, and is one of the updisputed darlings of the Open Source and Web 2.0 world, it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;re all avid users of the platform here at NM towers.</p>
<p>With a little creativity and imagination, it&#8217;s relatively simple to build some additional functionality around the core content of your website, using WordPress as the application framework. It&#8217;s perhaps a little unconventional to do this, if I were faced with building a Web application from scratch, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t be the first <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django">choice</a> <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">to</a> <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/" title="Symfony">spring</a> <a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/" title="Grails">to</a> <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/" title="CakePHP">mind</a>, however there may be good reasons for choosing WordPress, despite the stiff competition. If the heart and soul of your website requires a solid publishing platform, but you want to tack on a few bells and whistles, then I would say WordPress is a viable option.</p>
<p>WordPress introduced the concept of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" title="WordPress Pages">Pages</a> way back in version 1.5, to allow for the creation and management of static content pages outside the normal blog chronology. This shifted WordPress away from a blogging platform, opening up new possibilities for using it as a CMS.</p>
<p>WordPress Pages are deceptively powerful little things, each page can be handled by a different template, and so is a potential window into a micro Web application. Having the ability to attach arbitrary bits of data to a page through <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields" title="Custom Fields">Custom Fields</a> strengthens this position.</p>
<p>I’d like to describe a few techniques I’ve found useful when using pages in this manner.</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>First of all, a quick word about abstraction: just because you can scatter complex PHP code throughout your page template, doesn’t mean you should. Be kind to your presentational layer: keep the templates lean and mean, abstract away the more complex PHP into your theme’s functions.php, essentially creating your own custom set of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/" title="Template Tags">Template Tags</a>. OK, rant over.</p>
<p><strong>Pretty URLs and Pagination</strong></p>
<p>WordPress has an internal rewrite rule engine that enables content to be accessed via pretty, search engine friendly URLs, or permalinks. In fact, you can create your own custom rewrite rules using this engine, as described over <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite" title="WP_Rewrite">here</a>. However, if you just need to provide pagination over your page-constrained app, then WordPress provides a lesser-known rewrite rule: Paged Pages. So, if you have a page that can be accessed by the permalink <tt>/gallery/</tt>, this page can automatically be accessed by the permalinks <tt>/gallery/page/1/</tt>, <tt>/gallery/page/2/</tt>, … <tt>/gallery/page/{N}/</tt>. Essentially this allows for your page to be <em>paged</em>. Sounds like nonsense I know, but in this context your page is acting as a micro application, and pagination is crucial when displaying large amounts of information. So WordPress does the difficult part for you. Your job is to handle the pagination withn your page template. The key is getting a handle on which page of the micro-app your visitors are viewing, fortunately WordPress has an internal Singleton class instance, <tt>$wp</tt>, which can tell us this, cue code snippet:</p>
<p>Here, the <tt>get_page()</tt> method of the <tt>GalleryController</tt> class examines the ‘paged’ element of the <tt>$wp->query_vars</tt> array, and performs some sanitization, ensuring the page is at least 1, and that it is an integer.</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">
/**
 * Controller class for the Gallery Page
 */
class GalleryController {

    // ...Code snipped...

    /**
     * Gets the current page of the gallery
     */
    private function get_page() {
        global $wp;
        // Sanitize the current page, make sure it's an int and that it is at
        // least 1, return 1 by default
        return isset($wp->query_vars['paged']) ?
            max(1, intval($wp->query_vars['paged'])) : 1;
    }

    // ...Code snipped...

}</pre>
<p>OK, the next piece of the pagination puzzle is to ensure our micro-app spews out the appropriate permalinks. We don’t want to hard-code the base part of the permalink (what WordPress calls the page ‘slug’) into our application, as these are editable through WordPress. Fortunately WordPress provides assistance here as well, through the ‘matched rule’ property, we can use the following method to get the base part of the URL, and then append the <tt>/page/{N}/</tt> part onto the base:</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">
    private function get_base() {
        global $wp;
        if (preg_match("|{$wp->matched_rule}|", $wp->request, $matches)) {
            return $matches[1];
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }</pre>
<p>Note, this approach also works if the gallery is a sub-page of another page, <tt>get_base()</tt> would return <tt>/parent/sub-page/</tt> in this instance, up to an arbitrary number of levels.  The issue of rendering the appropriate content on the appropriate page is all that remains, that would be handled by the internals of the controller for your app.</p>
<p><strong>Database</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, every good web app needs a good database API, and the WordPress API is intuitive and I&#8217;ve found it effortless to get to grips with. It can be accessed through the Singleton <tt>$wpdb</tt> instance, here are a few key methods you’ll probably want to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>get_var()</tt> &#8212; returns 1 variable from the database, given a SELECT statement</li>
<li><tt>get_col()</tt> &#8212; returns 1 column from the database, given a SELECT statement</li>
<li><tt>get_row()</tt> &#8212; returns 1 row from the database, given a SELECT statement</li>
<li><tt>get_results()</tt> &#8212; returns multiple rows from the database, given a SELECT statement</li>
<li><tt>update()</tt> &#8212; updates existing data, given a table name and an array representing the single row to be updated</li>
<li><tt>insert()</tt> &#8212; inserts a new row, given a table name and an array representing the new row</li>
<li><tt>query()</tt> &#8212; for executing any database queries, update() and insert() are essentially specific wrappers around query()</li>
<li><tt>prepare()</tt> &#8212; prepares a query for safe use, given a  SQL statement that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprintf#printf_format_placeholders" title="Sprintf syntax">sprintf</a> syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>That about wraps it up for now! We have the makings of an <abbr title="Model View Controller">MVC</abbr> approach using Pages and the WordPress API here, with the page template acting as the View, the controller class acting as the, errr, Controller, and the database API being used by a separate Model class. It probably needs fleshing out slightly, though!</p>
<p>I’ll publish links of our work that use this approach as and when they are available. In the meantime, does anyone else have examples of using WordPress in creative and innovative ways?

Could it be set to change the way we network and relate online?]]></summary>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/2008/04/01/buddypress-bringer-of-open-social-network-bliss/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2380635141_39d0416366_o.jpg" alt="BuddyPress - Bringer of Open Social Network Bliss?" /></p>
<p>Having become somewhat disillusioned with the mainstream social network fair on offer these days, and having seen one too many targeted ads for my liking (yes, I like Guitar Hero/no, I don&#8217;t want to buy the T-shirt), I&#8217;ve been eagerly following the developments of BuddyPress, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" title="Free">Free</a> open social network that&#8217;s powered by <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress MU">WordPress (MU version)</a>.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/03/backing-buddypress/" title="Backing BuddyPress">original announcement</a> of <a href="http://automattic.com/" title="Automattic">Automattic</a>&#8217;s involvement in the project, it looks like things have progressed nicely in a relatively short space of time. There&#8217;s a comprehensive <a href="http://buddypress.org/components/" title="BuddyPress Components">feature list</a> available, and early adopters can download the BuddyPress source code to toy around with.</p>
<p>I think it all looks rather appealing. WordPress MU itself has a proven track record, being the technology that powers the marvellously succesful wordpress.com blogging platform. BuddyPress is, and will likely remain, open in the original spirit of the Internet. No more intrusive ads and no more concerns over the ownership of your personal data and who exactly gets to look at it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think this will usher in the final days of the walled-garden social networks that currently have us locked in their grasp. I&#8217;d like to think this will bring us freedom to relate online, without being tied in to one particular network. I&#8217;d like to think this tool will enable me to befriend someone who doesn&#8217;t happen to share my social web app preference.</p>
<p>Maybe BuddyPress is destined to remain firmly in the domain of the geeks and hard core web enthusiasts. But maybe all it will take is a few visionary schools, colleges and other pioneering organizations to get the ball rolling and build their online communities around this promising tool to pave the way for others to follow suit.</p>
<p>The optimist in me likes to think so anyway!</p>
