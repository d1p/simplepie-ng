        <summary>Mother Nature has really spun the American League division series in the Bronx in favor of the Yankees. The rain poured down Friday suspending the game and now Justin Verlander will only pitch Game Three. A whole different scenario than having him pitch Games One and Five. I hate the suspended games rule in this situation for the postseason. It should only apply to games that are already official, which was the case in Game Five of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia. In the case of Game One, they should have just started over. As it was, they finished...</summary>

        <summary>If you&#39;re a fan of Yankees prospects in Western New York, there is going to be no shortage of opportunities for you see the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre club in 2012. The Baby Yankees are barnstorming next season while a $40 million renovation of PNC Field is completed, and announced a six-city schedule of &quot;home sites&quot; for the 72 home games on their schedule Friday afternoon. The biggest news in the arrangement is that six Scranton home games against the Bisons will be played in Coca-Cola Field, with the Bisons batting first as the visiting team and the Yankees batting as the...</summary>

        <summary>While the Red Sox are going through the process of not renewing Terry Francona&#39;s contract today (e.g. he&#39;s getting fired), the real focus of the baseball world is the start of the postseason. The American League division series opens on two fronts with the Rays and Rangers meeting in Texas and the Yankees and Tigers meeting in the Bronx. That&#39;s Justin Verlander and CC Sabathia and that&#39;s must-see TV. Right from the top, I&#39;ll put this out there: I got the Tigers and the Phillies in the World Series and I&#39;m taking the Phillies in six. Sorry, Yankees fans. If...</summary>

        <summary>I saw every minute of it, well past midnight, and I still can&#39;t believe it. No one has ever seen a baseball season finish like that. The Rays were once down seven runs and still a run short and a strike away from losing, the Red Sox were a strike away from winning, the Braves two outs away from winning. And every result changed. See you, chokers from Boston and Atlanta. Welcome to the playoffs, Rays and Cardinals. Take your places in home run history, Dan Johnson and Evan Longoria (showering fans at the Trop above).

Will we decide the wildcards tonight or get one-game playoffs Thursday in Tampa Bay and St. Louis? The schedule remains the same as the last two days -- Tampa hosting the Yankees and Boston at Baltimore, while the Braves host the Phillies and the Cardinals are in Houston. All night games.

The Bisons&#39; IL North rival, you may recall, announced last month they were likely going to barnstorm or at least find one predominant home in 2012 because PNC Field in Moosic, Pa., is being bulldozed and getting a $40 million renovation. The schedules have already been announced but no word where the team would play. You&#39;d think this would have all been arranged, rather than...</summary>

        <summary>That was one wacky Wednesday in the AL East. The division race is over as the Yankees got the combination they needed to clinch -- a sweep of the Rays in a day-night doubleheader coupled with yet another Red Sox loss to the Orioles. The Yankees took care of business in the Bronx with a pair of 4-2 wins, using seven relievers to piece together the first game and getting a two-run pinch single in the eighth from beleaguered veteran Jorge Posada to win the nightcap. Good friend of the blog Mike Vaccaro of the New York Post surveyed the...</summary>

        <summary>With a week to go in the MLB regular season, we can finally put a wrap on 2011 for the minor leagues. The Columbus Clippers did the honors Tuesday night, posting an 8-3 win over the Omaha Storm Chasers in the Triple-A National Championship Game at Isotopes Park in Albuquerque. It&#39;s the second straight title in the IL/PCL showdown for the Clippers -- and do I really need to remind you they&#39;re the Cleveland affiliate? Columbus won last year&#39;s game over Tacoma, 12-6, in Oklahoma City. Oddly enough, the Clippers overcame 3-0 deficits in both contests. Columbus and Sacramento (2007-2008)...</summary>

The Yankees&#39; closer pitched a perfect ninth inning in the Bombers&#39; 6-4 win over Minnesota to earn his MLB-record 602nd save. When it was over and Rivera had finished taking the congratulations of his teammates, they pushed him out to the mound and left him alone to take in the accolades from the roaring crowd. It was quite a scene. Reminded me of the Baltimore Orioles pushing Cal Ripken out of the dugout for his...</summary>
