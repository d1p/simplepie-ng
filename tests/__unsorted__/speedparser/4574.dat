From that day forward, I pretty much lived in the library waiting to get my exams finished, close a residence hall and go to Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I've discovered in two months has, yet again, completely flipped my life upside down. Well, that's probably somewhat of a massive exaggeration but you'll have to wait for everything to really come out soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney has truly been everything that I've hoped and dreamed about. Maybe because I've never really been there. That probably helps a lot to make me surprised at almost anything, really. But I remember those classic Disney moments that I can now share with everyone else in the world. Let me tell you, that was probably the most embarrassing thing about working initially. A guest would occasionally come up to me and ask me things about the parks and resorts and I would look at them, with a slightly confused look on my face, and tell them that I have no idea because this experience is my first experience to Florida/Walt Disney World.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most guests just look at me and say, "Why do you work here again?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I'm writing about my experiences in Florida, I'm actually back in Ohio hanging out with my family for the first time in a long time. It's good to be back home, with family. A home without a family in it doesn't make for a very comfortable experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a lot on my mind and not enough time nor energy to really express my thoughts, so I'll leave you all with this tidbit: I've been having a time of my life, and I would never change a single moment for anything that has happened here so far. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><comments>http://kuokid.xanga.com/753795384/two-months-in/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>62 Days</title><link>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745613504/62-days/</link><guid>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745613504/62-days/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2011 03:08:44 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zp1BYzIVi0U" frameborder="0" width="560" height="349"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kuokid.xanga.com/745613504/62-days/?cuttag=true#cuttaganchor"&gt;I will tell you one little secret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><comments>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745613504/62-days/#firstcomment</comments></item><item><title>68 Days</title><link>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745040270/68-days/</link><guid>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745040270/68-days/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 03:57:15 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;A re-introduction would probably be the most fitting in this case.&amp;nbsp;Hello everyone, my name is Michael Kuo. I'm a fourth year Accounting and Operations Management student, and I'm going to Disney World.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 68 days, I will be spending the next six months away from everything I've known and starting a new life. The reason I am going to Disney World is I am participating in the Disney College Program, which is an entry level position working at the Parks and Resorts. I will be working in Merchandising. Other than that, I don't really know what I'm doing down there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sift through my thoughts and try and get everything in order there are a few things that I really want to just get out that I think are relevant as I move onwards with this journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kuokid.xanga.com/745040270/68-days/?cuttag=true#cuttaganchor"&gt;More thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><comments>http://kuokid.xanga.com/745040270/68-days/#firstcomment</comments></item></channel></rss>
