			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-22-at-4.12.58-PM1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-581" title="erik jensen t-shirt" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-22-at-4.12.58-PM1-300x300.png" alt="erik jensen" width="300" height="300" /></a>Erik, our resident &#8220;angsty design/dev guy&#8221; needs a shirt, or 10. It&#8217;s getting out of hand over here.</p>
<p>As some of you may know, Erik left hearth and home in Reno, NV to come out to the big city and join the Zirtual team. Unfortunately when he headed west, he didn&#8217;t know how long he was going to stay for and only brought one, tiny backpack. As you can imagine by now his clean t-shirt supply is reaching frightening lows.</p>
<p>On top of that, some of his precious stash of Staffords have been disappearing, sucked into the abyss of a micro-closet that is our mini-studio in the TL (by far <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderloin,_San_Francisco">the best neighborhood</a> in this delightful little city).</p>
<p>Which leads me to writing this post. It has come to my attention that startups, and businesses of all sizes, seem to love slapping their logo on an American Apparel shirt and giving them away to the masses &#8212; this is quite fortunate for both of us, since you need someone to wear your clean shirts, and Erik simply needs clean shirts.</p>
<p>I benefit from this on a purely altruistic level.</p>
<p>The lovely people at <a href="http://postmates.com/">PostMates</a> recently gave Erik one of their delightfully designed shirts at <a href="http://angelpad.org/">AngelPad&#8217;s</a> office crawl &#8211; they&#8217;ve thrown their hat into the ring, now it&#8217;s your turn.</p>
<p>So send us your t-shirts &#8211; or heck, I&#8217;ll come to you (if you&#8217;re in the city) and pick them up personally. You&#8217;ll be clothing a hard working startup-er, he&#8217;ll be repping your brand, and I&#8217;ll link to all of you who donate your startup shirt in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Erik Jensen. Designer, Developer, Friend. Shirt size: M-L. Send or stop by:</p>
<p>425 Bush Street<br />
Suite 435<br />
San Francisco, CA 94108</p>
<p>Ping me to arrange a t-shirt-napping via twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/marenkate">@marenkate</a> or by emailing me maren(at)zirtual.com.</p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;re feeling really generous (and need some gosh darn assistance!) you can help put food into our mouths and clothes on our back by joining <a href="http://zirtual.com/get-started.php">Zirtual&#8217;s limited beta</a> (spots are filling up fast though, I warn you).</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/virtual_concierge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-570" title="virtual_concierge" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/virtual_concierge.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="276" /></a>If one thing is certain, it is that <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://zirtual.com/blog/swivel-zirtual-assistant/%E2%80%9C">Zirtual is not afraid to swivel when necessary</a>. We’ve changed from an <a href="%E2%80%9Chttp://virtualassistantboard.com/%E2%80%9C">overseas job board</a>, to a virtual assistant finder service, and now, finally, to a virtual concierge business, offering the benefits of Amex’s “black card” to the non super rich.</p>
<p>Throughout these changes, we have never turned away a paying customer, opting instead to learn from them as we grow. This allowed us the freedom to remain a bootstrapped startup while we tweaked our model and continued building. Each tweak we’ve made has brought us closer and closer to what will be a scalable, hundred-million dollar business model (<em>yah, we have big dreams</em>). Yet nothing has felt quite right… until now:<span id="more-569"></span></p>
<p>Today marks a pivotal point for our growing startup. Not only did we just submitted our Y-Combinator application, we’ve also ditched the pesky hourly pricing model and switched over to a monthly subscription which offers <em>unlimited</em> virtual concierge requests.</p>
<p>We realized how much of a pain-in-the-ass it is to keep track of hours and, as a service that <em>frees</em> your time, it was contradictory to ask our customers to pay <em>more </em>attention to time. With this new model, you get to forget about tracking hours and use your personal, dedicated assistant as much or as little as you need.</p>
<p>However, for the first time in Zirtual’s history, we’re become a little more exclusive. We’re restricting our service and offering a <a href="“http://zirtual.com/personal-concierge-beta.php”">limited private beta</a> for only 100 enthusiastic customers to test our virtual concierge service for an extremely discounted price: <em>$100/month</em>!</p>
<p>Yes, we realize that this is extremely low (<em>seriously, you should see people’s reactions when we tell them in person!</em>), but right now our focus is less on breaking the bank and more on experiential learning. We’re setting up a test—one with a hypothesis, an expected outcome, and a methodical framework—and plan to learn as much as possible from our 100 initial customers.</p>
<p>As of today, the sign-up for the private beta is open and we’ve already been selling fast. If you want in on this very limited private beta and get access to your very own dedicated, US-based, Zirtual Assistant for an absurdly low price, click <a href="“http://zirtual.com/personal-concierge-beta.php”">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you do sign up, in exchange for the discounted price, we ask for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>We strive to deliver a 24-hour turn around time for each concierge request, but at the beginning, we may be a tad slower. Also, we’ll need to know what your experience is like—is it meeting your expectations, how we can improve, etc.—so we can continually optimize our service.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, our beta has been open for a little less than an hour and we already have nine people signed up. Spots are going fast so if you’d like to test-drive our concierge service, head over to <a href="“http://zirtual.com">Zirtual’s homepage</a> to learn more.</p>

Zirtual&#8217;s ideal customer is the former and our ideal <a href="http://zirtual.com/">Zirtual Assistant</a> is the latter.</p>
<p>What people don&#8217;t seem to realize is that not only is our time incredibly valuable, but in reality it&#8217;s quite priceless. Like the<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qxSwJC3Ly0"> Kansas song</a> says &#8220;And all your money won&#8217;t another minute buy&#8221; &#8230; because time, like love and health is one of those rare resources in our world that cannot be purchased.</p>
<p>What we do have control over though is the where, how and what we spend our time on. This is where Zirtual comes into play and why I believe <em>(dare I say know)</em> that our vision is going to change the world and our company culture is going to rock people&#8217;s socks (for lack of a better expression).</p>
<p>Think about your time for a while&#8230; what do you spend it on? Do you spend the majority of your life doing low-level tasks that could easily be delegated to someone else? Or, do you spend your precious time on high-level things that will change the world, change your life or bring/others wealth/health/happiness/success?<span id="more-562"></span></p>
<p>Which camp do you fall into? Do you have more time than money? If so you need to be industrious and work hard to not only fill that time but to get to the second camp &#8211; that of people who have more money than time.</p>
<p>If you are blessed enough to have more money than time (even if the ratio isn&#8217;t huge) then take some of that money and invest it into freeing up more time. Time that you can use to pursue success, happiness, love, health or simply contentment.</p>
<p>People used to ask me what I wanted in life and I&#8217;d say &#8220;I want to build a big company&#8221;, now I realize how flawed my logic was. Getting rich and building a big company is just a symptom of my real goal with Zirtual &#8211; which is to change the world, by changing the way people treat their most priceless resource: their time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-07-at-4.15.23-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-554" title="what is your time worth" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-07-at-4.15.23-PM-300x300.png" alt="what is your time worth" width="300" height="300" /></a>What is your time worth?</p>
<p>This is a question that more people should be asking themselves on a daily basis.</p>
<p>There are two answers to this question and your gut reaction is very telling of you as an individual.</p>
<p>No answer is necessarily &#8220;right&#8221; but both should be able to quickly convince of how essential it is to delegate small tasks to a capable assistant in the pursuit of time-savings and increased productivity.</p>
<p>One answer is: <em>my time is priceless.</em></p>
<p>Second answer: <em>(what you earn in a month) / ( number of hours you work in a month) = $X</em></p>
<p>An example: Sally makes $6,000 a month as a graphic designer. She works 30 hours a week for a grand total of 120 hours a month. Sally&#8217;s time (seen from a purely dollar value ammount) is worth $50 an hour.</p>
<p>This means every time she does a task that she could delegate to someone else for less than $50 an hour she is not only losing money, but she is also eating into the set &amp; precious number of hours she has in her life to do everything she wants to do, to experience the world and to be happy. <span id="more-553"></span></p>
<p>Here are some examples of how over the last two days I&#8217;ve delegated tasks to my personal assistant saving me a grand total of 4.5 hours of my time &#8211; which I count as priceless.</p>
<p>1. Posting listings to cars.com, eBay &amp; Craigslist in order to sell my 2006 Lexus (any of you need a car?!). She did the Kelly Blue Book research, crafted compelling sales copy &amp; handled all the minutia of prepping a car for sale online. All I had to provide were the photos of the car, the mileage and VIN number.</p>
<p>Total time savings: 2 hours</p>
<p>2. Researching my little brother&#8217;s birthday gift. He said he wanted a watch and gave me no indictators past that. So I compiled his social network profiles, his blog &amp; some basic facts about my brother&#8217;s taste &amp; forwarded this on to my assistant. Her job, to find 4 watches under $150, online, that she thought fit his taste.</p>
<p>Once she did this I sent the top choices to my mother for a final confirmation on what matched my bro&#8217;s style the most, then I had my assistant use my CC (cloaked via Lastpass) to purchase the watch and send it to his house (who&#8217;s address I have in a google doc file she uses regularly) .</p>
<p>Total time savings: 1 hour</p>
<p>3. Lastly I had my PA go on HARO (helpareporterout.com) and post a listing for people willing to share their personal assistant success stories for Zirtual. She crafted the listing based on a few sentences I sent her with the requirements, she then posted it and filtered through the submissions of the next 3 days &#8211; choosing the top 5 that she thought were particularly compelling and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Total time savings: 1.5 hours</p>
<p>Because of my assistant I saved nearly 5 hours. Hours I can now use to grow my business, spend time with my visiting girlfriend and enjoy the eternal sunshine of the taskless mind.</p>
<p>If this sounds like the kind of life you want to live, check out our dedicated personal assistants who you can use to get things done by the hour, it&#8217;s as simple as signing up <a href="http://zirtual.com/get-started-za.php">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Executive-Assistant.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-538" title="personal assistant" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Executive-Assistant-224x300.gif" alt="personal assistant" width="224" height="300" /></a>What is a swivel? Well the dictionary has many definitions &#8211; but the one I liked the most was:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> to turn or swing on &#8211; or as if on &#8211; a pivot</p>
<p>Zirtual has had made 3 substantial changes/swivels since it&#8217;s inception in October of last year.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We used to be a job board.</strong> If you like hideous design and a ghost-town feel when you hit a homepage, check out the exact site that used to sit atop the Zirtual domain <a href="http://virtualassistantboard.com/">here. </a></li>
<li><strong>We ditched the zero &amp; got with a hero, kinda.</strong> After kicking the job board off into interweb no-man&#8217;s land Zirtual swallowed a side project of mine called &#8220;Virtual Zeta&#8221; &#8211; which had been running for a few months. We essentially took the Zirtual logo &amp; URL and slapped it on the virtual-assistant-finder business that was Virtual Zeta and never looked back. Why? Because I knew the ill-fated job board would never cut the mustard, so if I was going to pour all of my effort into a business I&#8217;d be damned if I didn&#8217;t love the branding and name.</li>
<li><strong>Changing tactics, increasing focus</strong>. Until a few days ago Zirtual&#8217;s business model revolved around the concept that for a one-time fee we would recruit a quality virtual assistant for you and provide you with lots of resources to make sure you two worked well together for the long run. We even hit ramen profitability with this model, but (and it&#8217;s a biggie) it was <strong>painfully non-scalable</strong> and the blurry focus of &#8220;any kind of virtual assistant&#8221; meant we were doomed. The following documents our biggest swivel to date:<span id="more-536"></span></li>
</ol>
<h2>The Zirtual Assistant swivel</h2>
<ul>
<li>We used to pander to people who wanted cheap, virtual labor (be it SEO, design, admin, outbound sales, etc.) but who called them &#8220;virtual assistants&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now offer ONE type of virtual assistant &#8220;cleverly&#8221; coined a <a href="http://zirtual.com/zirtual-assistant/">Zirtual Assistant</a> which is a virtual PA = personal assistant. This means they do personal assistant stuff, not design, not web tweaks, not affiliate marketing, assistant stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>We also aren&#8217;t pandering to people who want cheap labor anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead we are servicing people who want concierge treatment and who want a dedicated personal assistant without having to pay $60,000 a year for someone full time.</p>
<ul>
<li>We used to mainly source offshore labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now offer both offshore and onshore (within the U.S. and Canada) assistants and it seems as if onshore is actually more popular.</p>
<ul>
<li>We used to charge a one-time recruitment fee and then turn over the assistant we found to the customer and step back.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now sell <a href="http://zirtual.com/plans-and-pricing/">packages of monthly hours</a> in various denominations. You can get as few as 10 hours in a month or as many as 50. When you purchase these hours you&#8217;re assigned a dedicated Zirtual Assistant to whom you&#8217;ll delegate your tasks to over the next month.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t jive with them we&#8217;ll connect you with someone else. You don&#8217;t have to worry about tax issues or payment problems &#8211; instead you just buy the hours you&#8217;ll need in the month and then use them, simple as that.</p>
<h2>Would you rather save time or save money?</h2>
<p>This is a fascinating question to ask strangers. It immediately lets you know so much about them, right down to their income-range and views on the value of their life.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;d rather save time.<em> Hands down, any day.</em> You know why? Time is the only truly non-renewable resource. Every second you are losing time and there is no way to stop or even slow down that process.</p>
<p>Money is not a zero-sum game. There is no set amount of money in the world. You can one day have zero dollars and the next have a million. You can go from fabulously wealthy to broke. But you can always rest assured that money is out there, waiting to be had, if you just get clever and find a way to earn it.</p>
<p>Now we are in the business of saving time. For every 20 hours of small tasks you delegate to your assistant at $7 an hour (if they are offshore) or $20 (if they are within the U.S. or Canada) you are saving whatever your time is worth x 20 hours. Some people&#8217;s time is worth $100 an hour, some is worth $1000, but in reality everyone&#8217;s time is worth: priceless &#8211; because it&#8217;s the one thing we can&#8217;t get back, ever.</p>
<h2>Concierge businesses and wants v. needs</h2>
<p>Some of the hottest startups in San Francisco are based on wants, not needs.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need to order an <a href="http://www.uber.com/">uber cab</a> when there are taxi&#8217;s out there &#8211; but we want to.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need someone to pick up our groceries and laundry on <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a> &#8211; but we want to.</p>
<p>We definitely don&#8217;t need to check our social score on <a href="http://klout.com/home">Klout</a> &#8211; but gosh it feels good when we see a 50.</p>
<p>Wants are what make life worth living. Needs are what make life possible.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve moved into the &#8220;want&#8221; space &#8211; and I&#8217;m happy about it. I finally feel at home in my startup and I&#8217;m ridiculously excited about the future of Zirtual and about the ripple effect this &#8220;swivel&#8221; will have years down the road.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Over the last week I&#8217;ve had my virtual assistant go shopping for my little brother&#8217;s upcoming birthday (virtually of course), create a detailed report comparing and contrasting the differences between Thailand and Vietnam for an upcoming trip AND filter possible <a href="http://www.escapingthe9to5.com/virtual-startup/technical-soulmate/">CTO candidates</a> for Zirtual.</p>
<p>The best part was that I sent her links to my brother&#8217;s social profiles, his blog &amp; then gave her about a paragraph on the type of person he was and his style &#8211; she took it from there. My time commitment = 5 minutes. She spent nearly two hours finding a short list of the perfect gift options.</p>
<h2>Here is what 1.75 hours of my time saved looks like:</h2>
<p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-12-at-9.49.22-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" title="zirtual virtual assistant" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-12-at-9.49.22-AM.png" alt="zirtual virtual assistant" width="647" height="439" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally I will gain brownie points with my mother when I show her this &amp; tell her that Iyos (my assistant) can do the same exact thing for her whenever she needs present shopping help.<span id="more-520"></span>.</p>
<h2>Travel delegation</h2>
<p>Another example would be planning a trip. Some friends mentioned they wanted to go to Thailand or Vietnam this fall, so instead of trying to crowdsource the research for this trip (which with a large group is like herding kittens) I just delegated it to my virtual assistant. You&#8217;ll see two examples of of the guides she created below &#8211; feel free to use them yourself if you plan on traveling to either of these places anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Note: one guide was created by my virtual assistant who lives in the Philippines, the other was created by a virtual assistant who lives in San Francisco conveniently enough.</em></p>

<p>Yep, my epic laziness was overcome once again by the power of delegation! The best part of this is that all the hours I&#8217;ve saved now can go towards working on making Zirtual better and other high-level, high-yield tasks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><img class="alignleft" title="oh the places you'll go " src="http://cache2.allpostersimages.com/p/LRG/15/1569/VFXDD00Z/posters/dr-seuss-theodore-geisel-oh-the-places-you-ll-go.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="215" />I just created a new file in my desk&#8217;s filing cabinet, it&#8217;s reads: <em>Zirtual &#8211; Oh the places you&#8217;ll go</em>.</p>
<p>Behind my file I stacked 10 moleskin notebooks that have been documenting Zirtual&#8217;s progress since inception &#8211; back when I called it Virtual Assistant Services Inc. (how did I ever let that name walk out of my life??).</p>
<p>My <em>Oh the places you&#8217;ll go </em>file is designed to encourage me when I&#8217;m feeling low, to grant comic relief at stressful moments and most of all to honestly document the changes and &#8220;pivots&#8221; our company has made from birth to whenever &#8220;present day&#8221; is.</p>
<p>When I read through that file now (even though in startup years Zirtual is still a baby) it brings a smile to my face, because I can see how we&#8217;ve grown &amp; changed and that excites me immensely for the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Success is a journey, not a destination. &#8211; Ben Sweetland</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s good to measure how far you&#8217;ve come, even if there have been numerous flops along the road. Often we&#8217;re overly critical of where we&#8217;re at right at this second, and we can&#8217;t see the forest for the trees as the old saying goes.<span id="more-504"></span></p>
<p>Too often we measure our own success by other&#8217;s yard sticks and when that happens we completely lose site of how far we&#8217;ve come as people or as companies and where we&#8217;re going in the long run.</p>
<blockquote><p>Success is not a place at which one arrives but rather the spirit with which one undertakes and continues the journey. &#8211; Alex Noble</p></blockquote>
<p>Go pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oh-Places-Youll-Dr-Seuss/dp/0679805273">Oh the Places You&#8217;ll Go</a>&#8230; read it from time to time and let your inner child be encouraged by it&#8217;s optimism and call to action. We don&#8217;t know the places we&#8217;ll go, but we do know that if we believe with our body, heart &amp; soul that there is a bright, bright future ahead we&#8217;re bound to get there sooner than later.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m endlessly optimistic about our startup journey &amp; feel the same about those kindreds spirits who are making the same trip with us &#8211; best of luck &amp; God&#8217;s speed &#8211; we&#8217;ll see you at the finish line.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-29-at-5.15.02-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-495" title="failing forward" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-29-at-5.15.02-PM-300x223.png" alt="failing forward" width="300" height="223" /></a>I think the one thing in life I&#8217;ve consistently excelled at is failure, but my point of pride is that I keep failing &#8211; and failing forward. See there are two different kind of failure, the first type is what you do if you are a failure &#8211; you fail once and then swear you&#8217;ll never try again because the first attempt didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p>The second type of failure is repetitive, it&#8217;s refining and it&#8217;s a forward moving process that consists of hundreds of micro-failures. Surprisingly enough the second type is also what paves the road to success. Fail often enough, with enough brains to learn from each and adjust course as you go and one day you&#8217;ll end up smack in the middle of incredible success &#8211; knowing you failed your way to the top.</p>
<h2>Failing Forward</h2>
<p>There is an art to failing forward, that art consists of 3 key ingredients:<span id="more-490"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Goal orientation</strong> &#8211; you can&#8217;t reach your destination if you&#8217;ve never mapped it. Holding one consistent goal in your head and thrusting towards it no matter what may come your way is an essential key to success. If you have 7 competing goals or are unsure what your goal is you 100% will never reach it. You have to set a goal to achieve a goal.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous action </strong>- failing forward consists of constant movement. If you&#8217;re not constantly moving forward you&#8217;ll just fail and then lay there like a slug. This is just failure. Instead every time you fall down you must get up, dust yourself off and take another bold action or step towards the previously mentioned goal you hold dear.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong> &#8211; is the glue that holds the purposeful person together. Persistence is what will keep you going when anyone else would have surely quit. Persistence is what separates the weak from the strong and the strong from the mighty. Persistence is also surprisingly simple while at the same time incredibly hard &#8211; it takes the force of mind to never, ever give up on the solid goal you&#8217;ve set for yourself.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300  games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and  missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is  why I succeed. &#8211; Michael Jordan</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Mail_app.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-474" title="outsource inbox" src="http://zirtual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Mail_app-300x300.png" alt="outsource inbox" width="196" height="196" /></a>I just got off the phone with a few internet business friends and the fascinating topic of email delegation came up.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;ve always been so interested by the concept of outsourcing your inbox is because of people&#8217;s fierce reactions to both schools of thought. Some people hail delegating emails as the best thing since sliced bread, others go on a rampage about how much control you&#8217;ll lose if you disconnect from your inbox.</p>
<p>My take is somewhere in the happy middle. How much of your inbox and email activity you can delegate is only limited to the amount of comfort you feel towards letting go of the reigns so to speak and the proactive stance you&#8217;re willing to take to set up an outsourced inbox properly.</p>
<h2>Best practices for outsourcing your inbox</h2>
<ol>&nbsp;</p>
<li><strong>Set daily limits for checking your inbox.</strong> This will help decide for you just how extreme the delegation of your emails will be. I try to check my inbox once in the morning and once at night (ideally). If you often leave your inbox open all day and find yourself maniacally checking it then you may need to become very firm and set exact blocks of time when you check your inbox &#8211; anytime else if off limits.</li>
<li><strong>Go for inbox zero. </strong>I described <a href="http://www.escapingthe9to5.com/optimalism/inbox-zero/">inbox zero</a> at length in the linked to post. The gist is to focus on clearing your inbox entirely when you open it each morning/night. This means that every email must be opened once, dealt with in some actionable way (responded to, forwarded to an assistant, assigned in a task) and then deleted or filed in it&#8217;s proper place. You wouldn&#8217;t shove letters back in your mailbox after opening them, don&#8217;t open emails and then let them live in gmail-limbo till kingdom come.</li>
<li><strong>Unsubscribe from everything that isn&#8217;t amazing</strong>. I do this every few months, I&#8217;ll subscribe to one too many newsletters that come once too often and soon my inbox is flooded with interesting but irrelevant emails from companies like Hubspot, Groupon or my favorite business blogger. Do yourself a favor and unsubscribe early &amp; often. If you find yourself really missing those updates from LivingSocial you can always opt back in.</li>
<li><strong>Delegate the rest.</strong> The problem is that even if you set specific times to check your inbox, with &#8220;inbox zero&#8221; as your goal, you still may need help. Maybe 30 minutes a day won&#8217;t do your inbox justice, maybe you spend hours dealing with emails, responding, scheduling and dealing with things. This is where delegating to a virtual assistant comes in &#8211; and this is the part that can radically change your life.<span id="more-467"></span></li>
</ol>
<h2>How to delegate your inbox to a virtual assistant</h2>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s vital that you find the right assistant. You don&#8217;t want to train and teach an assistant how to handle your inbox if they&#8217;re going to be flaky or do a bad job. So it&#8217;s important that you either spend a good deal of time searching and testing to find the right one, or you can leave that job to us by having us <a href="http://zirtual.com/plans-and-pricing/">find a virtual assistant</a> for you (shameless plug, I know).</p>
<p><em>Second, it&#8217;s important that you understand your inbox.</em></p>
<p>This means you need to create internal procedure lists to deal with just about every type of email you receive. This may take a week or two of note taking and organizing on your part, but the hundreds of hours it will save you down the line is more than worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Types of procedure lists for delegating your inbox</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What to do with blog questions</li>
<li>What to do with &#8220;urgent&#8221; emails (also, what defines &#8220;urgent&#8221; to you)</li>
<li>How to handle &#8220;call me&#8221; emails (should your assistant send you a text with the gist &amp; the number, or leave it for the round up message)</li>
<li>What files to stick certain emails in</li>
<li>Delete unimportant emails or simply archive them?</li>
<li>What type of emails are actionable, how to discern what action(s) needs to be taken</li>
<li>What types of emails can your assistant respond to (should they do it &#8220;as you&#8221; or as your PA?)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The &#8220;special few&#8221; solution.</strong></p>
<p>This is personally what I use. It uses all of the above procedure lists to get my assistant to pretty much vet my inbox for me, respond to what she can and &#8220;flag&#8221; the most important emails for my attention. I check my emails in the morning and at night &#8211; with my assistant going through my inbox using the above methods this usually leaves me with a solid 30 minutes of important emails to respond to / deal with and it saves about 1.5 hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>The one page solution.</strong></p>
<p>I must admit, this idea was mostly inspired by Erica from <a href="http://www.erica.biz/">erica.biz </a>because before I heard her talking about it I would just go on once a day and review the emails &#8220;left&#8221; by my assistant &#8211; something that works but isn&#8217;t as ultimately efficient as this model.<em> Note: this may not be for everyone &#8211; it depends on the type of business you&#8217;re in and your comfort level.</em></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created enough procedure lists and have spent some time with your assistant making sure they have the hang of attacking your inbox the way you&#8217;d attack it &#8211; it&#8217;s time to move to the next step.</p>
<p>This one email or possibly Google doc will act as the one point of contact you have with your inbox, outside of sending emails. It will document and detail (only to the point necessary) everything that came through your inbox in the last 24 hour period (or weekend) and in the best case scenario each bullet point (previously an email) will be marked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actionable</li>
<li>Taken Care Of</li>
<li>Filed</li>
</ul>
<p>Actionable emails are the ones you want to pay the most attention to and with a great assistant they&#8217;ll be able to distil even the most complicated email into action points.</p>
<p>Either of these paths may work for you, but the most important part of outsourcing your inbox is having someone else doing all the &#8220;dirty work&#8221; that comes along with 50 emails a day for you. An example is how I forward most of my notification emails to my assistant, she then goes on 1and1 or Bluehost and deals with the simple tasks like re-registering a domain or changing my billing information &#8211; this saves me 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there &#8211; but all and all it adds up fast.</p>
<p>Quality of life is also important, when I don&#8217;t have to do 2 hours of busy work (that unfortunately has to be done) I&#8217;m happier and more productive in the rest of my day.</p>
<p>Take it from me and at least try delegating your inbox to a quality virtual assistant and if you need to hire a great VA please connect with us at Zirtual!</p>
