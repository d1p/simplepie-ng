    <description>Welcome to my blog. This is where I will be posting information on current projects, as well as personal work and tutorials that I record/write.&lt;br/&gt;I’ll also post up any interesting graphics related discoveries I make and links to other exciting or useful sites I stumble upon.</description>

It’s centred on using Cinema 4D but the basic ideas will be applicable in most packages. This is the first in a series of article/tutorials that covers the fundamentals of 3D.&lt;br/&gt;Check it out. It should be available in all good newsagents and online. Not sure about non UK release dates but it is published around the world.</description>

This is an early test from an animation I’m looking into doing. The final result wont be spheres, something much more interesting but I wanted to see how mograph works with Vue xStream. I have to say I’m pretty pleased with the workflow and results, so far.&lt;br/&gt;I’ll post progress when I make some.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other projects I’m working on are the light rig kit, with NIck Campbell. We are almost done with it now and getting some great feedback from the beta testers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A training series for mograph and after effects is in the works and looking good, so keep an eye out for that in the near future too.</description>

I may include a tutorial on the actual sound design if it would be of interest (let me know).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’m also planning some more tutorials on caustics and translucency (see image).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’d love to hear any requests, so if you are stuck with anything then please let me know.</description>

The idea is to get everybody involved and sharing. Feedback and tips are welcomed. In fact that’s what it’s all about. The more we share and help the more everybody can improve.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the month I will announce the winner, who will win a very cool prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shawn Foster (3dPhoenix) from c4davenue.com is also a plugin developer and is currently adding the finishing touches to a new product, which he has very kindly donated as the prize.&lt;br/&gt;Planet X generator lets you very easily create planets through to whole star systems with lots of functionality. It will even automatically texture your planets for you.&lt;br/&gt;There will be a web site for the plugin, which you will find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emberintherain.com/&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; and once a mac release is available I’ll post a review and tutorial for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So stop by the Facebook page, join and say hi.</description>

We have a new product coming out in the near future, which has it’s focus on realistic lighting.&lt;br/&gt;As part of the kit we will be supplying some models and scenes for you to test and mess around with.&lt;br/&gt;They will be a mix of different sized and types of object and isn’t finalised yet.&lt;br/&gt;Here is one of the options, set up with materials and lighting.&lt;br/&gt;It’s not quite finished yet but seeing as we are getting close I thought I’d share with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look out for more very soon...&lt;br/&gt;</description>

These videos are for you guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also a number of cool products coming out. I’ve been working hard on producing some properly useful tools for 3D/motion graphics artists and the first couple are nearly here. Some of you may have heard about the first which is so close. I’ve been working with Nick Campbell, of greyscalegorilla, and we have a lighting rig kit which will blow you away. Based on real world studio lighting the kit will add some real shine to your work with very little effort. Of course there will be a bunch of training to accompany the kit...&lt;br/&gt;Soon after will be the next kit but I’ll keep that under wraps for now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, once again, a huge thank you to you all and I hope you have a wonderful holiday. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See you all in the new year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rob&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;p.s My dog is called MoJo and she looked a bit festive...&lt;br/&gt;</description>

They will be a mix of reviews and tutorials and I’m happy to say that the first has now been released.&lt;br/&gt;Issue 10 is on news stands now and on page 90 is my review of Zbrush training provided by Escape Studios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another review coming up in issue 11 and starting in issue 12 is a series, of which I will reveal more details when I am allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you haven’t read the magazine before then I would recommend it. It has a more art/artist focus than 3D World, with lots of galleries, useful information and decent tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;It also manages to stay out of the whole ‘which software is best’ debate and stays neutral, aiming at the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plug over...</description>

I have something I think is quite special for that...</description>

Taking part in the challenges is a great way to get feedback on your work and to improve your skills. Also great to work to a deadline, if that’s something you’re not used to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also some great prizes up for grabs, as an incentive to get involved.</description>
