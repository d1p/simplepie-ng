Not a day goes by where another faked &#8220;humanitarian crisis&#8221; hits the media about Gazans and their desperate need for aid. Yet, we know this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. Act for Israel is concerned about the continued coordinated attempts to break Israel&#8217;s counter-terrorism naval blockade, and we are profiling the latest information from the Meir Amit Intelligence &amp; Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) to keep you abreast of every attempt the &#8220;peace activists&#8221; are making. This time the assault comes via plane:</p>
<p>
Dozens of organizations participating in the campaign to delegitimize Israel are planning a propaganda display at Israel&#8217;s Ben-Gurion International Airport, on or around July 8. Hundreds of activists/passengers are supposed to fly to Israel on regular commercial flights to participate in the display. After the event, activities are planned for Israel, Judea and Samaria until July 16.<sup>1</sup> Prominent among the organizers is the ISM, an extreme leftist network based in the United States specializing in sending activists to friction points in the territories.</p>
<p>
<strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
1. Dozens of anti-Israeli activists, networks and organizations, most of them Palestinian and some Western, <strong>are preparing a mass propaganda display at Israel&#8217;s Ben-Gurion International Airport on or around July 8</strong>. The event is called &#8220;Bienvenue Palestine&#8221; or &#8220;Fly-in Action&#8221; (or <em>Ahalan wasahalan fi Filastin</em> in Arabic, &#8220;Welcome to Palestine&#8221;). <strong>They are also planning a series of events</strong> (lasting until July 16) <strong>in Judea and Samaria and in Israel</strong> to show solidarity with the Palestinians and defame Israel.</p>
<p>
2. On or around July 8 <strong>hundreds of activists</strong> are supposed to arrive in Israel from <strong>around the world</strong>. The plan to confront the Israeli authorities at the airport by publicly announcing their intention to reach the Palestinian Authority-administered territories. The plan may escalate into a protest with a demand for the so-called &#8220;right of return,&#8221; and a <strong>protest against Israel&#8217;s preventing foreign nationals from freely entering the &#8220;occupied Palestinian territories.&#8221; </strong>The organizers intend to use passive resistance if an attempt is made to put them on planes to return them to their countries of origin, but past experience has shown that <strong>&#8220;passive resistance&#8221; can deteriorate into violence</strong>.</p>
<p>
3. <strong>They are supposed to leave Ben-Gurion Airport to engage in solidarity activities with the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria and in Israel</strong>. According to the campaign organizers, <strong>there will be a week&#8217;s worth of solidarity activities with Palestine</strong>, from planting olive trees <strong>to marches protesting the security fence and settlements</strong>. Such events, they claim, will be held in <strong>Ramallah</strong> (July 9), <strong>Bethlehem</strong> (July 10), <strong>Jenin</strong>, <strong>Nablus</strong> and the <strong>Galilee</strong> (July 11), <strong>Hebron</strong> and the <strong>Jordan Valley</strong> (July 12), the <strong>Negev</strong> and <strong>Lod</strong> (July 13), and <strong>Jerusalem</strong> (July 14-15).<sup>2</sup> A final event may also be held (July 16).</p>
<p>
4. The <strong>timing of the propaganda display</strong> and connected events is, according to the organizers, related to the decision of the International Court in the Hague according to which the security fence (the so-called &#8220;wall&#8221; and &#8220;apartheid wall&#8221; by the organizers) is illegal. However, in reality, the display and various events are part of the campaign to delegitimize Israel, and <strong>are another aspect of the anti-Israeli defamation propaganda campaign</strong>, with a series of events including Nakba Day and Naksa Day, and the current flotilla (whose participants and ships have run into many difficulties, and remain in the Piraeus and other Greek ports). The time tables of the various propaganda events and the flotilla may overlap as some of the ships eventually manage to sail.</p>
<p>
5.  Behind the propaganda and related events are <strong>dozens of networks and groups in Judea and Samaria and abroad</strong>. Most of them are <strong>Palestinian organizations from the Palestinian territories</strong><sup>3</sup> which have been joined by <strong>anti-Israeli American networks such as the International Solidarity Movement</strong> (ISM) and <strong>Al-Awda</strong> (&#8220;the return&#8221;). Both networks are active in the campaign to delegitimize Israel: the <strong>ISM</strong> sends activists from abroad to friction points in Judea and Samaria such as Bila&#8217;in and Ni&#8217;lin, and its senior members have key roles in the flotilla campaign as part of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM). <strong>Al-Awda</strong> specializes in disseminating the concept of the so-called &#8220;right of return&#8221; in collaboration with activists and other organizations. (See Appendix II)</p>
<p>
<strong>Significance</strong></p>
<p>
6. The fly-in is a new, as yet untried initiative, bringing activists and ordinary civilians to Ben-Gurion International Airport <strong>to protest and create a media circus.</strong> According to the plans, they will then be joined by <strong>Palestinian and foreign activists in Judea and Samaria</strong>, and according to the plan devised by the organizers, <strong>events will also be held within Israel</strong> (in the Galilee, the Negev and Jerusalem). The events are intended to create global public awareness for the so-called &#8220;right of return,&#8221; show solidarity with the Palestinians, protest the security fence and settlements and protest Israel&#8217;s banning foreign nationals from freely entering the &#8220;occupied Palestinian territories.&#8221; The planned event is a continuation of the flotilla, and <strong>under the present circumstances a replacement for the flotilla, which has encountered many difficulties</strong> (including broad international reservations concerning its objectives and conduct).</p>
<p>
7. According to announcements made by the organizers of the fly-in, <strong>the activists/passengers who arrive at Ben-Gurion Airport plan to defy the Israeli authorities in order to focus attention on the difficulties Israel poses for their reaching the Palestinian Authority-administered territories</strong>. They will claim they want to visit &#8220;Palestinian friends&#8221; and refuse to commit themselves in writing not to enter the territories. The organizers are of the opinion that that will present Israel with a challenge it will find hard to deal with.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>
8. The planners of the propaganda display <strong>are aware that they may be delayed at Ben-Gurion Airport by Israeli security forces and that they may be detained for a short period and later deported from Israel</strong> (some of them, like Paul Larudee, have practical experience). In our assessment they are <strong>preparing themselves for the possibility</strong> and have planned measures to make difficulties for Israel, for instance by <strong>refusing to board return flights, receiving legal advice </strong>(including from Israeli lawyers) and <strong>accompanying the events with a media campaign</strong></p>
<p>
9. We do not have concrete information about the practical status of the plan. <strong>As in the past, discrepancies may appear between the plans and the possibility of executing them</strong>.
<p align="center">
  <strong>Appendix I </strong></p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>The planned &#8220;Fly-in Action&#8221;<br />
  (Update to July 4, 2011)<br />
  </strong></p>
<p>
1. <strong>Between July 8 and 16, the campaign organizers plan to fly several hundred (500-600) activists/passengers from countries in Europe, North America, South America and other countries to Israel</strong>. They are supposed to arrive in Israel <strong>at the same time</strong> and announce their intention to visit the Palestinian territories (as opposed to the previous tactic of hiding their true intentions by claiming to be tourists). According to the organizers, the action will turn them from isolated individuals to a &#8220;collective&#8221; and their action to &#8220;a mass act of solidarity.&#8221;</p>
<p>
2. The <strong>organizers of the event are aware the activists/passengers may be stopped in the airport</strong> and deported from Israel, and the fly-in participants have been briefed regarding the possibility. It is possible that they have been instructed to <strong>refuse to board the return flights, run riot in the airport, make extensive use of legal tools and of the media, and be aided and supported by Israeli residents and organizations </strong>(which may come to the airport to welcome them).</p>
<p>
3. <strong>Dr. Paul Larudee</strong>, Paul Wilder according to his current passport, is an American and one of the founders of the ISM. Today he heads the Free Palestine Movement (FPM), an anti-Israeli network based on the West Coast. He is one of the initiators of the idea of using the &#8220;fly-in&#8221; campaign to obtain publicity for the so-called &#8220;right of return.&#8221; <strong>He is experienced in anti-Israeli activities and was detained and deported from Israel by the courts</strong> in 2006. He also participated in the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> flotilla, and was supposed to participate in the current flotilla.</p>
<p>
4. In a taped briefing (apparently from the beginning of May) posted on YouTube, Paul Larudee explained the general outline of his program. He claimed the names of the participants were kept secret but that several well-known individuals might join the project, among them Norman Finkelstein, an anti-Israeli American political scientist and critic of Alan Dershowitz; the British George Galloway (who heads Viva Palestina, an organization specializing in dispatching convoys to the Gaza Strip); and Mairead Maguire, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976.</p>
<p>
5. According to Larudee, anyone participating in the plan <strong>had to be prepared to be detained and spend up to two weeks in an Israeli jail</strong>. His demands on the participants were the following:</p>
<p>
1) Participants had to be <strong>citizens of countries which did not need a visa to enter Israel</strong>. He said he had a list of countries issued by the Israeli foreign ministry of countries whose citizens need an entrance visa for Israel.</p>
<p>
2) It was desirable that <strong>Palestinians arriving in Israel come from families expelled from villages inside the Green Line and who could &#8220;prove&#8221; their ancestry</strong> (to emphasize their claim to the &#8220;right of return&#8221;). According to a previous interview with Larudee on Hezbollah&#8217;s Al-Manar TV on July 16, 2010, the Palestinians would come with copies of deeds to their lands and photographs of their families who lived in Israel before 1948.</p>
<p>
3) Participants <strong>would have to be prepared to be detained and imprisoned</strong>. They would also have to use tactics of nonviolent resistance to prevent being deported, for example <strong>by stating that if they were forced on board they would violate airplane regulations</strong>, in which case the captain would not be able to fly them out.</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>Appendix II </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Profile of the three American networks participating in the fly-in propaganda display<br />
</strong></p>
<p>
1. The International Solidarity Movement (ISM)<sup>5</sup> is an anti-Israeli network of activists founded in the summer of 2001 by <strong>a group of extreme American leftists</strong>. They were joined by leftist Palestinian activists (primarily Christian) and several extreme leftist pro-Palestinian Israelis. The founders recruited volunteers from various Western countries, some of them Jews, on a platform of fundamental hostility to Israel and its policies towards the Palestinians. Four prominent ISM members are <strong>Huwaida Arraf</strong> (the leading figure in both the ISM and the FGM), her (Jewish) husband, <strong>Adam Shapiro</strong>, <strong>Greta Berlin</strong> and <strong>Paul Larudee</strong> (who quarreled with the FGM and founded a new organization on the West Coast called the Free Palestine Movement). <strong>Arraf, Shapiro and Berlin are currently in Athens and head the FGM, the umbrella network with a central role in the flotilla campaign</strong>.</p>
<p>
2. The ISM&#8217;s stated objective is to provide international support for the Palestinian cause and to demonstrate solidarity <strong>by using non-violent tactics which it refers to as &#8220;direct action&#8221;</strong> (a term taken from the lexicon of extreme leftist revolutionary and human rights movements). <strong>However, several times in the past such tactics deteriorated into violence directed against the Israeli security forces</strong>.</p>
<p>
3. Between 2001 and 2005, the years of the second intifada (the Palestinian terrorist campaign), ISM volunteers who came for short periods of time waged intensive activities in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip (the Palestinian territories). The volunteers began arriving in December 2001. They did not merely make do with helping the Palestinian population, <strong>but specialized in obstructing IDF operational activities</strong>.</p>
<p>
4. Their activities included: participating in Palestinian protest demonstrations and rallies, serving as human shields for terrorist operatives wanted by the Israeli security forces, locating themselves near IDF roadblocks throughout Judea and Samaria, providing the Palestinians (including terrorist operatives and their families) with financial, logistic and moral support, hindering the razing and sealing of houses of suicide bombers, holding protests along the security fence from Jenin to Jerusalem, etc. <strong>Two of what the ISM considered its peak activities (according to the movement website) were sending activists to serve as human shields at the entrances to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and to Arafat&#8217;s headquarters in Ramallah </strong>(in April 2002, during Israel&#8217;s anti-terrorist Operation Defensive Shield).</p>
<p>
5. <strong>After the second intifada senior ISM activists moved the focus of their activities and campaigns to the Gaza Strip</strong>, where Hamas was gaining a foothold before its violent takeover in June 2007. Four senior American ISM activists <strong>were key in founding an international pro-Hamas umbrella network called the Free Gaza Movement</strong> (FGM), which currently focuses on sending ships to the Gaza Strip for the stated purpose of &#8220;breaking the siege,&#8221; but in fact <strong>their actual objectives were to strengthen the de facto Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip and intensify the delegitimization of Israel</strong>.</p>
<p>
6. <strong>Besides its involvement in the flotilla campaign, since the end of the second intifada the ISM has been active in two main fields</strong>:</p>
<p>
A. <strong>Sending volunteers to protest demonstrations at focal points of Palestinian-Israeli friction, such as Bila’in</strong>: The activities <strong>are held in conjunction with local Palestinian popular committees. The committees are sponsored by the Palestinian Authority</strong>, which, since the sixth Fatah conference, held in August 2009, adopted a policy of &#8220;popular resistance.&#8221; The &#8220;popular resistance&#8221; is represented by the ISM (and the Palestinian Authority) as non-violent, <strong>but in reality it often employs well-organized, &#8220;soft&#8221; violence</strong>, such as throwing stones at and physically assaulting IDF soldiers, and the occasional Molotov cocktail. In many instances there have been casualties among both demonstrators and Israeli security forces. The &#8220;softly&#8221; violent activities are committed by Palestinians, but the presence of ISM and other foreign activists at the friction points heightens the tension, whips up emotions and encourages the demonstrators to violence, making it difficult for the Israeli security forces to act.</p>
<p>
B. <strong>Participation (with other activists and networks) in anti-Israeli activities in the United States and European and other countries worldwide</strong>: The activities include calls for boycotting Israel and its products and protests against its policies toward the Palestinians (especially a demand to lift the so-called &#8220;siege&#8221; of the Gaza Strip and to destroy the security fence). In protest demonstrations in various countries, Israel is repeatedly represented as racist, oppressive and employing a &#8220;policy of apartheid,&#8221; done to demonize Israel, subvert its legitimacy and turn it into a pariah state. <strong>Anti-Israeli activities include demonstrations in various cities, agitation on campuses, initiating pro-Palestinian &#8220;cultural&#8221; events</strong> and attempts to influence the centers of political power in various countries. ISM activists engage in anti-Israeli hate propaganda in the visual and digital media, via the Internet, and in books and plays.</p>
<p>
7. <strong>The ISM is a network without a formally defined hierarchy</strong>. <strong>It has a hard core of senior activists who formulate policy and direct the anti-Israeli campaigns activities of its supporters and volunteers</strong> in the territories and around the world. <strong>The ISM does not receive government funding</strong> and its volunteers pay their expenses out of their own pockets. <strong>Its activity is based in and focused on the United States</strong> (primarily the West Coast), Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip (Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Beit Sahour and Gaza City), <strong>several European countries</strong> (especially <strong>Britain</strong>, <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong>), and Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>
8. <strong>The anti-Israeli ISM ideology</strong>: The ISM frequently represents itself as against violence and in favor of human rights, as respecting international law and UN resolutions, and as striving for a &#8220;just peace.&#8221; However, an examination of its official publications and the statements made by its senior figures indicates that <strong>its orientation and ideology are anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist</strong>, adopting the Palestinians&#8217; most extreme demands. Its hostility to Israel is often based on <strong>a critical worldview of the United States and its policies, especially regarding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after the September 11 attacks</strong>. The ISM not only rejects the policies of every Israeli government (&#8220;the Israeli apartheid in Palestine&#8221;), but also <strong>the existence of Israel as a national homeland for the Jews</strong>. Publications and statements of ISM activists stress the implementation of the Palestinian refugees&#8217; &#8220;right of return&#8221; to Israel, reject the Oslo Accords, and make no mention of a two-state solution.</p>
<p>
9. <strong>There are many prominent important Jewish and Israeli figures in the ISM, and/or those who have some connection to the Jewish people and are proponents of anti-Israeli, anti-Zionist ideology</strong>: <strong>Adam Shapiro</strong>, one of the founders, is American, Jewish and married to <strong>Huwaida Arraf</strong>, the most prominent ISM personality. Her father is an Arab who was born in Israel. <strong>Neta Golan</strong>, another founder and senior activist in the territories, is an Israeli woman who married a Palestinian and lives in Ramallah. <strong>Greta Berlin</strong>, also a founder, was married to a Jew. <strong>In addition, the ISM is in contact with extreme leftists in Israel</strong>, some of whom are anarchists. They participated in ISM activities during its first years until they split and joined an organization called &#8220;Anarchists Against Fences.&#8221;</p>
<p>
10. <strong>Al-Awda</strong> (the &#8220;return;&#8221; its full name is the Palestinian Right to Return Coalition, PRRC), was established in April 2000 and is <strong>an anti-Israeli network based in the United States</strong>. Its general coordinator is Salman Abu Sitta, who founded the PRC, a parallel organization based in Britain.</p>
<p>
11. Like the British PRC, Al-Awda&#8217;s main objective is to promote the concept of the so-called &#8220;right of return&#8221; of the Palestinian refugees through intensive propaganda activities, including accusing Israel of slaughtering Palestinians and &#8220;ethnic cleansing.&#8221; <strong>Its demand to return the Palestinian refugees is intended to cause a change in Israel&#8217;s demography and nature as a Jewish state and to promote its overall goal of establishing a Palestinian state from the [Jordan] river to the [Mediterranean] sea.</strong></p>
<p>
12. Al-Awda&#8217;s activities include organizing demonstrations, hosting conferences and regional and international conventions, and organizing artistic events and tours. It also conducts political propaganda activities involving members of the United States Congress. Al-Awda collaborates with anti-Israeli organizations waging the campaign to delegitimize Israel. For example, in solidarity marches organized by Al-Awda in 2002, during the second intifada, the network distributed T-shirts to participants. The shirts read &#8220;Intifada – Palestine will be free from the river to the sea&#8221; (discoverthenetwork.org website). Or, for example, at a meeting of the organization in Toronto, Al-Awda objected to the Road Map and supported the second intifada.</p>
<p>
13. <strong>The Free Palestine Movement</strong> (FPM) is a <strong>California-based extreme leftist network</strong> with several branches around the United States. It represents itself as a human rights organization, but in reality it is an anti-Israeli network dealing with political propaganda with the objective of defaming the State of Israel and eroding its legitimization. In reality, its methods promote the Hamas political agenda.</p>
<p>
14. <strong>Dr. Paul Larudee</strong>, aka Paul Wilder, is the network&#8217;s most prominent member and the moving spirit behind its operations. He is a radical leftist American activist, <strong>hostile to Israel</strong>, with an Iranian father and an American mother. He holds a PhD in languages from Georgetown University. He was a cofounder of the Free Gaza Movement and the International Solidarity Movement, two organizations which play dominant roles in the international campaign being waged to delegitimize Israel.</p>

<p>
<sup>3</sup> For the list of organizations see the June 1 bulletin, above. Other groups have apparently joined them.</p>
<p>

In three words: they&#8217;re not helpful. The IDF transports 5,800 tons of aid a day to Gaza. This is nearly double the amount of aid the flotilla claims to carry. Act For Israel has emphasized the same sentiment as the countries below. Those interesting in aiding Gazans should go through existing channels already established via the Red Cross or UNRWA.  Based on the past experience with the Mavi Marmara, it appears the  flotillas only intent is to break the blockade established to prevent weapon smuggling to Hamas. Breaking the legal blockade is not an option either. Act For Israel asks you to continue exposing these &#8220;peace activists&#8221; who are desperately trying to turn the world against Israel as well as create an international crisis between the US and its ally, Israel.</p>
<p>Here is what many world leaders have stated to date about the flotilla:</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong>: “Unauthorized efforts to deliver aid are provocative and, ultimately, unhelpful to the people of Gaza. Canada recognizes Israel’s legitimate security concerns and its right to protect itself and its residents from attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups, including by preventing the smuggling of weapons.” <em>— Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird, May 28, 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>EU</strong>: “I don’t consider a flotilla to be the right response.” <em>—Catherine Ashton, EU High</em></p>
<p><strong>France</strong>: “[T]he boarding of any naval vessels which are known to have the intention of breaking the naval blockade imposed on Gaza is strongly discouraged, given the security risks associated with such an undertaking.” <em>—Official Statement</em></p>
<p><em>Commissioner for Foreign Policy</em></p>
<p><strong>Middle East Quartet</strong> (United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia) “&#8230;the Quartet strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the  people of Gaza to do so through established channels so that their cargo  can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings.”</p>
<p>“The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable five-year detention of Gilad Shalit.”</p>
<p><em>—</em>Spokesperson for the Quartet, July 2, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Turkey</strong>: “We are reconsidering our plans [about participating in the flotilla]. … From our point of view, the developments in neighboring Syria are critically important.” <em>—IHH Board Member Hüseyin Oruç, June 14</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>UN</strong>: “The secretary-general called on all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage such flotillas, which carry the potential to escalate into violent conflict.” <em>—Spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, May 27, 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>US</strong>: “[G]roups and individuals who seek to break  Israel’s maritime blockade of Gaza are taking irresponsible and  provocative actions. … We want to just reiterate that there are  established and efficient mechanisms for getting humanitarian assistance  through to Gaza.” <em>—U.S. State Department Spokesman Mark Toner, June 1, 2011</em></p>

<p>There still seems to be some lingering confusion of why Israel cannot allow ships whether friendly or not through its blockade. Act for Israel has said many times that in order for Israel&#8217;s blockade to be legal is must be consistently enforced. We believe this English translation of an interview in <a href="http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2011-06/seeblockade-gaza-interview" target="_blank">Zeit Online</a> with maritime law expert, Wolff Heintschel, further answers questions often raised when discussing why Israel must enforce its blockade:</p>
<p>Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg is an international and maritime law expert who teaches at Europa-Universität Viadrina in Frankfurt [Oder]. He has also served as an adviser to the Turkel Commission that Israel established in the summer of 2010. The commission has been tasked with determining how and why violence erupted on 31 May 2010 between passengers on the Gaza humanitarian convoy and Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> The deployment of Israeli forces in May of last year against a humanitarian convoy headed for Gaza unleashed cries of protest worldwide. Now a second and far larger international convoy is on its way to Gaza – a convoy that aims to break Israeli’s sea blockade of Gaza. Is this blockade even allowable from a legal standpoint?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg</strong>: Well that depends on how you characterize the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. When jurists come together, they often disagree on this matter. But there’s definitely a consensus on one thing – namely that what you have here is an armed conflict. Which means that the laws governing such conflicts apply; and under these laws, sea blockades are allowed.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE: </strong>But doesn’t the conflict also have to involve two or more states?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> Right. And the problem is that Palestine is not a state – at least not yet – which is why many feel that the conflict is not an international armed conflict. And if you take that view, then blockade laws don’t apply. But if you take an objective look at the relevant legal analyses, it’s readily apparent that the basic admissibility of the Israeli blockade has never been called into question.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> You yourself have characterized Israel’s action against the convoy in 2010 as being perfectly legitimate. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> If a blockade is allowable in this conflict, then it’s also allowable to take measures to set up such a blockade. There’s only one principle that characterizes a blockade: the principle of effectiveness. In other words, the blockade has to prevent ships from entering or leaving the blockade zone. If the blockade fails to do this even once, it is ineffective and thus immediately becomes legally ineffective as well.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> So this means that when it comes to this blockade, Israel is in a catch-22 situation, right?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> Right. The Israelis simply can’t afford to let any ship through, if they want to prevent another ship from passing through the blockade zone a few hours later.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> The operators of the 2010 humanitarian convoy said right from the outset that the ships were headed for Gaza. Didn’t saying this make them subject to criminal prosecution?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> The mere fact that they set sail for Gaza does not constitute a criminal act. But: if you come out and say, in a public forum, that you’re heading to Gaza for the express purpose of breaking the blockade, this is clear evidence of a blockade breaking attempt. And when that happens, the state that has imposed the blockade doesn’t need to wait until the ship in question reaches the 20 nautical mile boundary; instead, it’s got the right to intervene beforehand. Because the state that’s imposing the blockade is not only entitled but also duty bound to maintain its blockade.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE: </strong>What do you think the people onboard the current humanitarian convoy are going to be facing?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> Any ship that actually breaks the blockade simply has to reckon with the fact that that military force is going to be used against them. Plus the state that’s imposing the blockade is under no obligation to wait until someone actually crosses the blockade line. All that has to happen is for there to be clearly discernible intent – in which case measures can be taken long before the blockade line is crossed.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE: </strong>What form could or should such measures take?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg: </strong>Normally such measures unfold without any major problems. The state imposing the blockade stops the vessel, orders it to proceed to a specific port, inspects the ship’s cargo, and then turns the matter over to the courts. But if there’s resistance to the measures taken by the state that’s imposing the blockade, then this state needs to quell this opposition. Which means that any attempt to evade the blockade or the forces enforcing it needs to be met with reasonable force.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> In your view, was Israel’s reaction to the humanitarian convoy in 2010 a smart move given the humaniarian situation inGaza?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg: </strong>Well this is how it always is when it comes to such legal issues. In such situations, the actors don’t always act logically, or judiciously; nor are such actions necessarily the politically smart thing to do. A state that imposes a blockade is obligated to supply the civilian population in the blockaded zone with the goods they need in order to survive. But the Israelis have always done this. At the time of the humanitarian convoy in 2010, it was the same in that they said: Feel free to sail into the harbor; we guarantee that we’ll hand over your humanitarian cargo. But it was clear from the get-go that certain parties didn’t want that at all, because then they wouldn’t have achieved the same impact on public opinion.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> What would you advise the Israeli Prime Minister to do if the next humanitarian convoy approaches the boundary of the blockade zone?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> If the Prime Minister wants to maintain the blockade, then he’s simply got to enforce it. If he doesn’t enforce it, it’ll be a dead letter; and then he’d have to resort to other measures; and then the legal situation wouldn’t be so simple. Because then he’d have to invoke the right of self -efense, which is often invoked in cases where it’s simply not appropriate to do so. Our [Germany’s] anti-terrorism operations are a prime example of this.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> Do you think the Israelis are going to react to this second convoy the same way they reacted to the first one?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> I think Israel is better prepared this time around. Last time they tried to approach the convoy ships in rubber dinghies and then climb onboard from these dinghies, in order to take control of the ships. And then they used helicopters. I suspect that the Israeli forces were simply unprepared for the resistance they met from some of the passengers on board those ships and were taken completely by surprise.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> Is the legal situation now more touchy due to the fact that there’s already been a conflict with a convoy?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> I think the reverse is the case. I hope that the relevant legal principles won’t be misused again, since the law of armed conflict applies here – not a cockeyed human rights perspective. Also, Israel didn’t act at all capriciously the first time around. It would have been quite difficult for the Israelis to sink those ships without concerning themselves with the fate of the passengers and cargo onboard. Israel only took measures that were prescribed by law – namely preventing the ships from reaching Gaza. This was the most moderate measure available to them.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE: </strong>People are suffering in Gaza, even though they have access to the goods they need in order to survive. Isn’t it legitimate for people to want to help the citizens of Gaza?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> The motivation of the blockade breakers – regardless of whether they’re acting for virtuous or reprehensible reasons – is completely irrelevant from a legal standpoint. I, of course, have great respect for human rights activists who give of their time to pursue their goals, but you can’t get around the fact that there are certain legal boundaries. Also, I presume that these humanitarian actions are also publicity stunts aimed at mobilizing public opinion. No one would argue the fact that the citizens of Gaza have it really tough, compared to our own standards. But I don’t really see any pressing humanitarian need here.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> In your view, is there an alternative to these humanitarian convoys?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg:</strong> Sure there is. There are a few humanitarian organizations out there that have impeccable credentials that no one in their right mind would call into question – the most important one being the International Committee of the German Red Cross. If you really want to help the citizens of Gaza, you go to the Red Cross – an organization that the Israelis accept without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ZEIT ONLINE:</strong> The border crossing between Gaza and Egypt was recently reopened. Do you think this will have a counterproductive effect on the naval blockade?</p>
<p><strong>Heintschel von Heinegg</strong>: Israel has traditionally been able to rely on Egypt, and the border between Gaza and Egypt hasn’t been particularly permeable in the past. But this has changed. The strategic importance of the blockade in terms of protecting Israeli securityhas definitely declined. But nonetheless, the reliability of Israel’s maritime measures will not be affected in any way by the change in the status of the Gaza-Egypt border</p>

<p></strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Many may not realize an <a href="http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=1156&amp;ref=report" target="_blank">American victim of a Palestinian terror attack filed an unprecedented lawsuit</a> in Manhattan on June 15, 2011 to seize ships used by Islamic and anti-Israeli organizations to breach Israel’s coastal blockade of the Gaza Strip. The lawsuit asserts that furnishing and outfitting the ships creates hostilities against a US ally, which violates US law.</p>
</div>
<div>Upon determining whether the vessel constitutes material support for terrorism several other federal statues may apply including “informant statute” 18 U.S.C. <strong>§</strong> 960, which, prohibits knowingly providing, furnishing money for, or participating in, a “naval expedition or enterprise” against “the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United States is at peace;” and 18 U.S.C. <strong>§</strong> 962 which criminalizes the arming of any vessel meant “to cruise, or commit hostilities” against a nation friendly to the United States. While these statues are rarely used, they can be applied to modern cases of asymmetric warfare, including terrorism, with attendant risk of liability.  This allows the plaintiff (called an “informer”) to privately seize ships outfitted in the United States for use against a US ally. Some of the laws that pertain to aiding terrorist organizations are provided below:</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><a title="TITLE 18 - CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sup_01_18.html" target="_blank">TITLE 18</a> &gt; <a title="PART I - CRIMES" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sup_01_18_10_I.html">PART I</a> &gt; <a title="CHAPTER 113B - TERRORISM" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113B.html">CHAPTER 113B</a> &gt; § 2339B</div>
<p><strong>§ 2339B. Providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations</strong><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/HowCurrent.php/?tn=18&amp;fragid=T18F00956&amp;extid=usc_sec_18_00002339---B000-&amp;sourcedate=2010-06-28&amp;proctime=Tue%20Jun%2029%2010:11:46%202010"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/HowCurrent.php/?tn=18&amp;fragid=T18F00956&amp;extid=usc_sec_18_00002339---B000-&amp;sourcedate=2010-06-28&amp;proctime=Tue%20Jun%2029%2010:11:46%202010">How Current is This?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Prohibited Activities.— </strong></p>
<p>(1) <strong>Unlawful conduct.— </strong>Whoever knowingly provides material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both, and, if the death of any person results, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life. To violate this paragraph, a person must have knowledge that the organization is a designated terrorist organization (as defined in subsection (g)(6)), that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity (as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act), or that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism (as defined in section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989).</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Financial institutions.— </strong>Except as authorized by the Secretary, any financial institution that becomes aware that it has possession of, or control over, any funds in which a foreign terrorist organization, or its agent, has an interest, shall—</p>
<p>(A) retain possession of, or maintain control over, such funds; and</p>
<p>(B) report to the Secretary the existence of such funds in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Civil Penalty.— </strong>Any financial institution that knowingly fails to comply with subsection</p>
<p>(a)(2) shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount that is the greater of—</p>
<p>(A) $50,000 per violation; or</p>
<p>(B) twice the amount of which the financial institution was required under subsection (a)(2) to retain possession or control.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Injunction.— </strong>Whenever it appears to the Secretary or the Attorney General that any person is engaged in, or is about to engage in, any act that constitutes, or would constitute, a violation of this section, the Attorney General may initiate civil action in a district court of the United States to enjoin such violation.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Extraterritorial Jurisdiction.— </strong></p>
<p>(1) <strong>In general.— </strong>There is jurisdiction over an offense under subsection (a) if—</p>
<p>(A) an offender is a national of the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sup_01_8.html">8</a> U.S.C. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">1101</a> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html#a_22">(a)(22)</a>)) or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(20) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sup_01_8.html">8</a> U.S.C. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">1101</a> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html#a_20">(a)(20)</a>));</p>
<p>(B) an offender is a stateless person whose habitual residence is in the United States;</p>
<p>(C) after the conduct required for the offense occurs an offender is brought into or found in the United States, even if the conduct required for the offense occurs outside the United States;</p>
<p>(D) the offense occurs in whole or in part within the United States;</p>
<p>(E) the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce; or</p>
<p>(F) an offender aids or abets any person over whom jurisdiction exists under this paragraph in committing an offense under subsection (a) or conspires with any person over whom jurisdiction exists under this paragraph to commit an offense under subsection (a).</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Extraterritorial jurisdiction.— </strong>There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Investigations.— </strong></p>
<p>(1) <strong>In general.— </strong>The Attorney General shall conduct any investigation of a possible violation of this section, or of any license, order, or regulation issued pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Coordination with the department of the treasury.— </strong>The Attorney General shall work in coordination with the Secretary in investigations relating to—</p>
<p>(A) the compliance or noncompliance by a financial institution with the requirements of subsection (a)(2); and</p>
<p>(B) civil penalty proceedings authorized under subsection (b).</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Referral.— </strong>Any evidence of a criminal violation of this section arising in the course of an investigation by the Secretary or any other Federal agency shall be referred immediately to the Attorney General for further investigation. The Attorney General shall timely notify the Secretary of any action taken on referrals from the Secretary, and may refer investigations to the Secretary for remedial licensing or civil penalty action.</p>
<p>(f) <strong>Classified Information in Civil Proceedings Brought by the United States.— </strong></p>
<p>(1) <strong>Discovery of classified information by defendants.— </strong></p>
<p>(A) <strong>Request by united states.— </strong>In any civil proceeding under this section, upon request made ex parte and in writing by the United States, a court, upon a sufficient showing, may authorize the United States to—</p>
<p>(i) redact specified items of classified information from documents to be introduced into evidence or made available to the defendant through discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;</p>
<p>(ii) substitute a summary of the information for such classified documents; or</p>
<p>(iii) substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified information would tend to prove.</p>
<p>(B) <strong>Order granting request.— </strong>If the court enters an order granting a request under this paragraph, the entire text of the documents to which the request relates shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.</p>
<p>(C) <strong>Denial of request.— </strong>If the court enters an order denying a request of the United States under this paragraph, the United States may take an immediate, interlocutory appeal in accordance with paragraph (5). For purposes of such an appeal, the entire text of the documents to which the request relates, together with any transcripts of arguments made ex parte to the court in connection therewith, shall be maintained under seal and delivered to the appellate court.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Introduction of classified information; precautions by court.— </strong></p>
<p>(A) <strong>Exhibits.— </strong>To prevent unnecessary or inadvertent disclosure of classified information in a civil proceeding brought by the United States under this section, the United States may petition the court ex parte to admit, in lieu of classified writings, recordings, or photographs, one or more of the following:</p>
<p>(i) Copies of items from which classified information has been redacted.</p>
<p>(ii) Stipulations admitting relevant facts that specific classified information would tend to prove.</p>
<p>(iii) A declassified summary of the specific classified information.</p>
<p>(B) <strong>Determination by court.— </strong>The court shall grant a request under this paragraph if the court finds that the redacted item, stipulation, or summary is sufficient to allow the defendant to prepare a defense.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Taking of trial testimony.— </strong></p>
<p>(A) <strong>Objection.— </strong>During the examination of a witness in any civil proceeding brought by the United States under this subsection, the United States may object to any question or line of inquiry that may require the witness to disclose classified information not previously found to be admissible.</p>
<p>(B) <strong>Action by court.— </strong>In determining whether a response is admissible, the court shall take precautions to guard against the compromise of any classified information, including—</p>
<p>(i) permitting the United States to provide the court, ex parte, with a proffer of the witness’s response to the question or line of inquiry; and</p>
<p>(ii) requiring the defendant to provide the court with a proffer of the nature of the information that the defendant seeks to elicit.</p>
<p>(C) <strong>Obligation of defendant.— </strong>In any civil proceeding under this section, it shall be the defendant’s obligation to establish the relevance and materiality of any classified information sought to be introduced.</p>
<p>(4) <strong>Appeal.— </strong>If the court enters an order denying a request of the United States under this subsection, the United States may take an immediate interlocutory appeal in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Interlocutory appeal.— </strong></p>
<p>(A) <strong>Subject of appeal.— </strong>An interlocutory appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court—</p>
<p>(i) authorizing the disclosure of classified information;</p>
<p>(ii) imposing sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information; or</p>
<p>(iii) refusing a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information.</p>
<p>(B) <strong>Expedited consideration.— </strong></p>
<p>(i) <strong>In general.— </strong>An appeal taken pursuant to this paragraph, either before or during trial, shall be expedited by the court of appeals.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Appeals prior to trial.— </strong>If an appeal is of an order made prior to trial, an appeal shall be taken not later than 14 days after the decision or order appealed from, and the trial shall not commence until the appeal is resolved.</p>
<p>(iii) <strong>Appeals during trial.— </strong>If an appeal is taken during trial, the trial court shall adjourn the trial until the appeal is resolved, and the court of appeals—</p>
<p>(I) shall hear argument on such appeal not later than 4 days after the adjournment of the trial, excluding intermediate weekends and holidays;</p>
<p>(II) may dispense with written briefs other than the supporting materials previously submitted to the trial court;</p>
<p>(III) shall render its decision not later than 4 days after argument on appeal, excluding intermediate weekends and holidays; and</p>
<p>(IV) may dispense with the issuance of a written opinion in rendering its decision.</p>
<p>(C) <strong>Effect of ruling.— </strong>An interlocutory appeal and decision shall not affect the right of the defendant, in a subsequent appeal from a final judgment, to claim as error reversal by the trial court on remand of a ruling appealed from during trial.</p>
<p>(6) <strong>Construction.— </strong>Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders or asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privilege.</p>
<p>(g) <strong>Definitions.— </strong>As used in this section—</p>
<p>(1) the term “classified information” has the meaning given that term in section 1(a) of the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.);</p>
<p>(2) the term “financial institution” has the same meaning as in section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sec_31_00005312----000-.html">5312</a> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sec_31_00005312----000-.html#a_2">(a)(2)</a> of title <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sup_01_31.html">31</a>, United States Code;</p>
<p>(3) the term “funds” includes coin or currency of the United States or any other country, traveler’s checks, personal checks, bank checks, money orders, stocks, bonds, debentures, drafts, letters of credit, any other negotiable instrument, and any electronic representation of any of the foregoing;</p>
<p>(4) the term “material support or resources” has the same meaning given that term in section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002339---A000-.html">2339A</a> (including the definitions of “training” and “expert advice or assistance” in that section);</p>
<p>(5) the term “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Treasury; and</p>

Individuals who act entirely independently of the foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or objectives shall not be considered to be working under the foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Rule of Construction.— </strong>Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>(j) <strong>Exception.— </strong>No person may be prosecuted under this section in connection with the term “personnel”, “training”, or “expert advice or assistance” if the provision of that material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization was approved by the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
