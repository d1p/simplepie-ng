  <title>No news until there is</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/78481.html</link>
  <description>So, today&apos;s the day. Helen is 40 weeks today, and as predicted, we&apos;re still waiting. I think we&apos;re now completely ready: the table has been moved out the dining area to make room for the birthing pool, which was the last thing that needed doing. &lt;br /&gt;We keep doing the odd thing for the baby or her room, but it&apos;s all things that could easily have waited for a few weeks after birth. Things like putting up the sign on her door, sawing the end off the shoe rack so that we have a dedicated buggy area by the front door.&lt;br /&gt;Once the baby arrives, I imagine I&apos;ll be tweeting about little else for at least two weeks. For that I apologize to those not interested. It does, however, mean that those who are interested don&apos;t need to worry about missing the news: we&apos;ve been getting a lot of &quot;is there any news&quot; type communications. Believe me, when there is, you&apos;ll be hard pressed to miss it (and you&apos;ll probably end up wishing I&apos;d shut up about it). &lt;br /&gt;Just waiting.</description>

  <title>Swimming costs me 0.69p/m</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/78172.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PIBiYsNe3v0Frqs_Hw-a_A?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cFWqeHiV1ik/ToYosNGcdRI/AAAAAAAAabQ/uYZhnwYTIs4/s400/IMG_1309.JPG&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Just over a year ago I had a twinge in my back. It felt similar to the way it felt when I first &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/tag/sciatica&quot;&gt;slipped a disc&lt;/a&gt;, so I visited the osteopath that served me well then. Though there was little he could do for me (he&amp;#39;s since emigrated to Australia, to get away from me), he said one thing that I&amp;#39;d heard over and over again: &amp;quot;you should swim&amp;quot;. Pretty much every health professional who had advised me to do anything in that painful period of my life had advised me to swim. It&amp;#39;s aerobic exercise that strengthens the core abdominal muscles, manipulates the spine and is low impact. I realized that if everyone was saying it, there must be a good reason for it. Finally, on September 19th 2010, I bit the bullet and started going.&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, I went with Helen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finesseleisure.com/swimming-pool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hatfield Swim Centre&lt;/a&gt;, but I could only really go at the weekend if I went there, and it seemed like a waste of valuable weekend time. Thus I did some investigations and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gll.org/centre/marshall-st-leisure-centre.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marshall Street Leisure Centre&lt;/a&gt;, which is very close to both Oxford Circus tube and my work.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I&amp;#39;m lazy, and stingy, and have a short attention span. In order to go before work, I have to leave the house at 07:10, as opposed to 07:45. Marshall Street costs &amp;pound;5.30 a session, plus I get the tube there which costs another &amp;pound;1.90. Finally, it&amp;#39;s BORING. So boring. I therefore knew that I needed some way to keep my interest up if I was going to go on a (reasonably) regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;Enter my geekery, and weird love of logging things with spreadsheets. Ever since I started, I&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/MBbfF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kept track of how often I go&lt;/a&gt; and, more importantly, the running average of how often I go. This means that if I go a week without swimming, I can almost feel the graph taking a downturn, and it spurs me on to go.&lt;br /&gt;Do I enjoy swimming now? No, not really. It doesn&amp;#39;t bother me anymore (I&amp;#39;ve never been a particularly strong swimmer, and when at school this meant that I dreaded swimming), but I still find it boring. There are some characters that go, and they amuse me slightly. For example, there&amp;#39;s one guy who goes quite regularly that I&amp;#39;ve nicknamed The Thumper, because he does crawl and one arm slams down on the water so hard that I can hear it as soon as I enter the changing room. But people-watching only entertains so much; I&amp;#39;ve come up with various other things to keep me entertained. For a while, I did calculations in my head, but I soon realized that this distracted me from how many lengths I&amp;#39;d done. I tried basing the calculations on the current number of lengths, which worked for a while but eventually stopped that too. More recently, I&amp;#39;ve been doing something that&amp;#39;s slightly strange: each length I do, I visualize a different room from &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/y5ae6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the house I grew up in as a child&lt;/a&gt;. It works pretty well, because there&amp;#39;s lots to see in each room (or, I suppose, lots to remember), and I go through the house in the same order each time. This means that if I lose count of which length I&amp;#39;m on, I just have to think &amp;quot;have I been in the dining room yet?&amp;quot; or similar.&lt;br /&gt;The spreadsheet that I&amp;#39;ve done haven&amp;#39;t shown me anything particularly surprising, but it&amp;#39;s interesting to see. So far I&amp;#39;ve spent nearly &amp;pound;370 to swim just under 55km. Sounds like a long way, until I realize that nowadays I&amp;#39;m swimming 1km per session. You see, that&amp;#39;s what spreadsheets do to me: must go more often!</description>

  <title>Waiting</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/77947.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Q8nGvoGceK_-lgY4RMMWYg?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-icRA_ZOlnmQ/TnYYPA0FSqI/AAAAAAAAaUw/2lcHA6NXV_o/s640/pano.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We&amp;#39;re ready. At least, I think we are as ready as we ever will be. The room is painted (complete with pretty mural), the cot bed lies expectant (with cat net over the top, to stop Suki smothering Bushbaby). We even have new sofas for her to be sick on. The car seat base is fitted in the car. Tonight we inflated the birthing pool (see Facebook for photos), to make sure all the equipment is present and working. The cats appear to have increased their hunting: they know there will soon be another mouth to feed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So now we wait. I can cope with waiting generally (I&amp;#39;m more patient than Helen), but Helen is in pain a lot of the time, which makes it harder for both of us. We both have the number of the Delivery Suite at QEII in our phones, just in case. It&amp;#39;s unlikely she&amp;#39;ll be born before her due date (20%, according to our ante-natal teacher), but not impossible.&amp;nbsp;We&amp;#39;re both on a hair-trigger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a strange thing. I can&amp;#39;t think of any other situation where you know, with 100% certainty, that a huge, life-changing event is going to occur, and yet it could be any time over the next month.&amp;nbsp;</description>

  <title>&amp;lt;1,000 hours</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/77640.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AmKfjD7U_5wHdHY2TTFCdGZEa0hMc3h3Q3lSN0lOSEE&amp;amp;oid=3&amp;amp;zx=ctqncnlovip1&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/WUrBT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;There really is not long to go now&lt;/a&gt;*. I&amp;#39;ve got so behind, so much has happened since my last update (I&amp;#39;ve been distracted by getting my &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/Ujn5V&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt; ready to release: please try it!). &lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Time to note down my headings so I don&amp;#39;t forget again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amelie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to visit our friends who live near Chingford a few weeks ago. Coincidentally, the closest we&amp;#39;ve been to Tottenham for years happens to be the weekend that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the residents start rioting&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it was great to see their new home, and meet their lovely little baby girl Amelie. It felt very much like a &amp;quot;baby-training&amp;quot; weekend: a lot of the time was spent asking them questions, them explaining to us things that they&amp;#39;d learned and that there really wasn&amp;#39;t anything to be scared of, and playing with Amelie a lot. After Amelie&amp;#39;s bedtime, we did carry out some more adult pursuits. And by that I mean Wii archery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ante-natal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last saturday was our first NCT ante-natal class, at Burnham Green Village Hall. It boiled down to two things: some nice, local people who were in the same boat, and an awful lot of information thrown at us from 10:30 to 16:30. That said, the information wasn&amp;#39;t jammed together too tightly, and most of it sank in (which is unusual for me). We learnt about many aspects, from the bio-chemistry (hugely simplified, natch) to the classic of how to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;What staggered me was the difference in size of bumps, despite everyone being due within a one month period. One petite lady there was absolutely enormous: so much so that she said one of the things she was really looking forward to after the birth was being able to take a deep breath again.&lt;br /&gt;There were six expecting women there and five partners, and four of the couples (including us) sat in a group at lunch. A couple of interesting things came up. We discussed maternity leave: Helen had decided to go on maternity leave a week before the due date, but everyone else had taken longer: one lady had taken five weeks. Since then, Helen has decided that maybe she needs longer, and has moved to two weeks. Also, it turned out that of the four of us, only we knew the gender of their baby. This interested me, because as previously discussed we were very keen to know. There are enough surprises ahead, it was good to have one of them early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting of the Grandparents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 14th of August, we went to the outdoor Shakespeare performed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tlcm.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Lord Chamberlain&amp;#39;s Men&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Hatfield House. This year it was A Midsummer Night&amp;#39;s Dream: I&amp;#39;d forgotten how strange that play is. In previous years we had gone with my parents, and last year we went with Helen&amp;#39;s parents, so we decided that this year&amp;#39;s event was a good time for them to meet.&lt;br /&gt;We were slightly nervous. I don&amp;#39;t really know what about, but I think it&amp;#39;s natural to get nerves at what is, let&amp;#39;s face it, a very big event in our lives: our parents are, after all, the most important people in each of our respective lives. Naturally everything was fine: they seemed to get on well, as we knew they would really. At our house afterwards, my Dad was interested in Helen&amp;#39;s dad&amp;#39;s bees, and the two mothers were naturally very happy chatting about babies. And the show helped out by both not raining on us, and being really good (yet again).&lt;br /&gt;All grandparents have been asked what they want us to call them around Bushbaby (and thus, presumably, want Bushbaby to call them). I think only my Dad has given a reply so far: Paul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, we&amp;#39;ve been slowly collecting stuff that Bushbaby will need. We&amp;#39;ve now got most of the big things, we think. We&amp;#39;d been told how expensive having a baby is (not just by my work, who didn&amp;#39;t really want me to go part-time), so being me I decided to keep track of how much we were spending. I thought it might be useful for others planning a child so &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmKfjD7U_5wHdHY2TTFCdGZEa0hMc3h3Q3lSN0lOSEE&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;. The number of items marked &amp;quot;Ebay&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;car boot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;NCT sale&amp;quot; make it obvious that we&amp;#39;re being quite frugal, but not where it counts: car seats and mattresses, for example, always have to be bought new. I should also point out that although the clothes section is quite small on the chart, we&amp;#39;ve had a lot bought for us as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure whether the spreadsheet will carry on after the birth. I think so, but it will obviously get less and less clear as time goes on what is for the baby: for example, we&amp;#39;re not going to split our food bills into stuff we would have bought if we hadn&amp;#39;t had Bushbaby and stuff we wouldn&amp;#39;t have. But it will still be interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is assuming she&apos;s born on time, which there is (apparently) a 95% chance she won&apos;t be. Apparently around 25% are born before the due date, 5% on the due date, and 70% afterwards.</description>

  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Ph7qPPN-1ykYaAmbKUyuiQ?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rUjN5CZTiSs/TeVm9_APYnI/AAAAAAAAYPQ/p67xXq6K1kM/s400/genderscan_image05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We gave in. After work on the last day of May, we drove over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ultrasound-direct.com/babybond-pregnancy-scans/?gclid=CKqj0bfhlakCFUQOfAodn1IdtQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Babybond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/m93y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Buntingford&lt;/a&gt; and had a gender scan.&lt;br /&gt;The place was lovely, a really pleasant experience. It cost us &amp;pound;80, which is expensive, but we really felt like we were being treated well. It took quite a while for the operator to get a clear view, but eventually he told us... we&apos;re having a girl. But it wasn&apos;t a rushed thing just to find out and get us out, which they would have been perfectly entitled to do, the guy spent some time with us. I heard her heartbeat for the first time (146bpm, clearly a little unfit, should get out more), and the guy took several photos (click the one shown for more), despite her seeming to be fairly camera shy (she kept putting her hands up in front of her face). Just as the operator got a view good enough to let us know she was female, she made it very clear by starting to pee. It was all rather amusing really.&lt;br /&gt;We also got a 4D &amp;quot;free view&amp;quot;: I&apos;ve included the snap that he took. He didn&apos;t hide from us that this was to try and sell us a 4D scan later on (3D and time, for the uninitiated: silly, I know), but it didn&apos;t really work. The image in the pics is the best one he got, and it&apos;s not great. Though admittedly, you&apos;re supposed to do it around 27 weeks or so I think, and we&apos;re only 22.&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s good to have only half the number of names to trawl through. Ironically though, despite struggling with boys&apos; names to begin with, we had settled on one we both liked. Now we just need to do that with girls&apos; names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say we should be talking to her from now onwards, so I had a quick chat with her tonight. However, if she&apos;s getting used to sounds that she&apos;s hearing from outside now, I predict that the sound that will send her to sleep when she&apos;s born will be Suki&apos;s purr.</description>

  <title>Damage and reconstruction</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/77211.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/18kiqPEAgDqo2ZFLaH1ajA?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TdDlYjHCkvI/AAAAAAAAXO0/nYf3Xe-65jI/s400/IMG_6543.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Monday was just another day. Oh, except for the fact that we were &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/77024.html&quot;&gt;finding out the gender of our unborn child&lt;/a&gt;*, so I went &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/CqJG1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Hatfield with Helen. All was fine until I got my trousers out of the locker at the end, at which point I noticed the pocket holding my phone was upside-down. I noticed because there was a sharp crack as the monstrosity in the photo was created: somehow the phone not only fell out of the pocket, but also the little sock thing that came with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screen was truly shattered, as you can see, but astonishingly still worked. I worried about swiping over the cracks: I could feel small particles of glass coming off. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/hjsb/status/70034283783389184&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I thought I&apos;d have to get a new phone&lt;/a&gt;, but then I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://htcrepairs.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;htcrepairs.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;via a Google ad. I got a quote: &amp;pound;59.99 + &amp;pound;6 p&amp;amp;p. This seemed reasonable, and I couldn&apos;t find anyone else willing to so it, so on Tuesday morning I posted my phone to them by special delivery (I took my phone into work after the scan, but used it very little).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried vainly over the next three days to get my sim card into a spare phone. All three (!) of the spare phones in our house were locked to Vodafone (I&apos;m on 3), so we got them to unlock one. Even after we&apos;d managed that, and after a friend at work had brought in an unlocked phone for me to borrow, I was in no better state: the 3 network is only 3G, and neither phone was 3G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I gave up trying to get my normal sim card working, and ordered a new one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giffgaff.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;giffgaff&lt;/a&gt;. It worked perfectly in Helen&apos;s old phone, and I was resigned to use for some time (still considering whether to switch permanently).&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that knows me will know that I have wholeheartedly embraced the smartphone age, so I was interested to see how much it affected me to be untimely ripped from it. Answer: not that much. Sure, I couldn&apos;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72558.html&quot;&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; anything, inability to tweet on the move was annoying, and I couldn&apos;t listen to podcasts / play games on my journey (I had to go back to my Zen Micro to listen to music: still works like a charm, but seem unable to transfer new things onto it). But it was more just occasionally thinking &amp;quot;that&apos;s annoying&amp;quot; rather than anything more. That might well be because it was for a comparatively short time, I guess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, the doorbell rang on Friday morning and it was my beautifully repaired phone. I was slightly concerned, before it came back, that the craftsmanship might not be perfect from a small shop in Wimbledon (it turns out that htcrepairs is part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turnonyourmobile.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;turnonyourmobile&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/XigL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but I have nothing but praise. I would not have know it wasn&apos;t the original screen. There is a speck underneath, but that was there before: I think the replacement process moved it into a more prominent position, which is unfortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How would I change the way I use my phone? Will I get insurance? No. If my phone was insured, I would probably have paid way more than &amp;pound;70 in insurance at this point. Additionally, there would have been all the paper-work: I certainly would not have had my phone back in four days after breaking it. Will I get a hard case or similar? I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;ll look at the options, sure, but I like my phone being very easily accessible. I&apos;ll just be more careful with it when I&apos;m in swimming pool changing rooms, mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Which we never found out</description>

They do various tests, and take some measurements: for example, we now know that Bushbaby&apos;s thigh bone is 3mm long at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that hit me immediately was how detailed the ultrasound is. You can&apos;t really tell from the still images: hopefully you can see the profile of Bushbaby&apos;s face, but on that image you can also see the heart (the higher of the two black blobs). I&apos;m not sure what the other is, but at various points during the examination we were shown liver, kidneys, hands, feet, spine, mouth, even the four separate chambers of the heart. It really blew me away. And you just never get over seeing that little heart beating.&lt;br /&gt;What we couldn&apos;t be told, was the gender. The little one had their legs pressed firmly together, and the umbilical cord was in the way as well. We&apos;re wondering whether go for a private scan, we haven&apos;t decided yet how much we want to know.</description>

On the night of Sunday 1st May, Helen and I joined her sister Lizzy and Andy doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shine.cancerresearchuk.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shine walk&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester. For those that don&apos;t know, the Shine walk is a night-time half- or full-length walking marathon in aid of Cancer Research UK: 26 miles 385 yards for those (like us) that are foolish enough to do the full length version. I&apos;d raised quite a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sponsormetoshine.org/henrybush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sponsorship&lt;/a&gt; (there&apos;s still time to give if you want to), and I was looking forward to it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188605ctCh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here is my GPS track of the walk as we did it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our training was not as hard as it should have been: the longest walk we managed was around 8 miles. Really, we should have done something like 16 miles a few weeks before to get a proper idea of what 26 would be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our preparation on the day before seemed to mostly centre around food: we took (amongst other things): a box of flapjacks, five bananas, two tube of pringles, 500g of dried fruit and nuts, a tube of jaffa cakes, a bag of haribo, and various other sweeties. This I think was not necessary: while it&apos;s good to eat to keep up your energy, we had way too much. We ate a lot throughout the walk (we could happily have eaten less), and still came home with some flapjack, all the pringles, all the dried fruit and nut, and most of the jaffa cakes and sweets. We also carried 2 litres or so of liquid: again, sensible, but it turns out that at every pit stop on the route the organizers gave us plenty of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shine website gave us mixed messages about the start-time: some places said it started at 10pm, others at 11pm, but the most likely seemed to be 9pm, so we plumped to arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/4DiT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;G-Mex&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, I mean Manchester Central) at 8pm. We went inside to find about 7k people preparing to walk, which was way more than I expected: I kind of thought it would be 1k, tops. We were given bottles of water, a glow-stick, and an emergency foil blanket: this last one, I thought, was slightly silly. In the end, all four of us ended up using them. After an hour or so of warm up (both physiological and atmospheric), we were separated into power walkers, striders and strollers. We plumped for striders, but so did most other people, so we were near the back (there were maybe 1k people behind us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started at dusk: there were some pretty views as it got darker (for photos, click the one displayed), but then we were plunged into darkness.&amp;nbsp;The beginning of the evening was mostly dominated by queuing: we had to queue for twenty minutes to leave the building, and then after a mile or so there was a huge queue (about half an hour) to cross the first non-closed road (despite them releasing us in batches of 500). This was rather frustrating, but I can&apos;t quite see what they could do about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first pit stop was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188701rmqc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Salford Quays&lt;/a&gt;, and this really seemed to split people up: predominantly into people who needed the toilet and people who didn&apos;t. There were huge queues for the toilets here, and by the time we left we were pretty close to the end of the walkers.&lt;br /&gt;By the second pitstop, which was at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188702EW45&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Trafford Centre&lt;/a&gt;, we were starting to feel it. We were about 8 miles in at this point, so it was slightly worrying, but we pressed on. What I did realize when we got to the 3rd pitstop (at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188704DrRu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MUFC&lt;/a&gt;), was that I had been to the toilet at every single pitstop, including before the start. I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s a common issue, that long walks make you pee: might have to look it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188708H8a-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Curry mile&lt;/a&gt; was quite fun: we got there about 2am, which was the time that people were stumbling around into kebab shops. It was good to get some distraction, because it was at about this point that I theorized about why they do these things at night: it makes you feel incredibly lonely, even if you&apos;re with people. Perhaps this is to demonstrate some tiny fraction of the loneliness felt by cancer sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we progressed down Wilmslow Road, past my school, it started getting quiet, which exacerbated this. Pit stop 5 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188801Dsa8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tesco in Parrs Wood&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;seemed a hell of a long way from pitstop 4 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S188706A_K2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Whitworth Park&lt;/a&gt;): maybe this was because of that. I&apos;ll have to do some measuring on Google maps. By this point we knew something was wrong with Helen: she was in quite a lot of pain, and getting slower and slower. While we didn&apos;t have any particular deadline that we wanted to finish by, every time we stopped everyone started to get cold immediately, not something I&apos;d experienced before. We talked to the medic there: she didn&apos;t advise taking any painkillers (partly because Helen is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/tag/bushbaby&quot;&gt;18 weeks pregnant&lt;/a&gt;), but said that she would provide them of Helen definitely wanted them. She decided not to, and we carried on. We got slower and slower, and we all wrapped ourselves in our emergency blankets (which are remarkably effective, if you&apos;ve never had cause to use one). After 23.6 miles (according to the track I made on my phone), Helen couldn&apos;t go any further and we decided that we should flag down one of the buses of wardens that were driving up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was frustrating not to get to the end, but we still had nearly three miles to go: that would be an hour at normal walking speed, but considerably longer at the speed that we were going by that point. &lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&apos;t finish the full distance, I will pay back any of the sponsors that want me to. Having said that, I do intend to do a full marathon at some point in the near future: I think during the day, and with a little more training (as which this walk could be considered, if I do it soon), it would be easier. Also, I think keeping up a faster pace from the start would be better, as it would keep me warmer (and mean I finished sooner: we were out there for nine hours that night, but apparently some of the power walkers finished in five).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <title>Audiobooks and DRM</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/76293.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y3Ok5gG2CsnkDVfUk2u9uQ?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TbV0L1jLPlI/AAAAAAAAW2I/LrtOc-8Gub4/s400/IMG_6352.JPG&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You may or may not know that in the past few years, music downloads have gone through a massive shift from being predominantly DRM-encumbered to not being. This is a Very Good Thing. However, audiobooks (which I like to listen to) have not undergone any such transition. I&apos;m hoping it&apos;s just a matter of time, just like with movies.&amp;nbsp;I&apos;m not going to talk about what DRM is (a quick google will tell you), but just my brief and unordered thoughts about why DRM on audiobooks is bad, pointless, and the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, I should say, I&apos;m not completely against DRM. There is a place for it: if I rent a movie, for example, I don&apos;t care how DRM-ridden it is: so long as I can play it once, that&apos;s all that matters. The difference is when I &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; something. If I buy something, I should be able to do what I want with it. If I buy a physical book, it is my right to cut it up into individual words and paste them back in alphabetical order. OK, so that would be a strange thing to choose to do, but it&apos;s the principal. However, if I buy an audiobook from, say, Audible, I don&apos;t have the ability to do whatever I want with it. I can play it back on a limited (though admittedly large)&amp;nbsp;set of devices, and that&apos;s it. Well, technically that&apos;s not quite it. It&apos;s also possible to write them to CD, thus removing all DRM. So why not just provide it without DRM to begin with?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The only people that the DRM bothers is law-abiding people. By far the easiest way to&amp;nbsp;obtain any well-known audiobook is to pirate it. The thing that has saved the music industry from the threat of piracy is that it is now so easy to buy mp3 downloads. I have an Android phone, and there are at least three companies that have an app with which I can buy, download and play music within a few minutes. If only the same were true for audiobooks.&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of places that provide audiobooks in mp3 format (eg Naxos), but they are primarily out of copyright stuff. I have a subscription with emusic, but their list of books is unfortunately limited.&amp;nbsp;I want all of the Harry Potter books as audiobooks, and they have none of them. Thus, I&apos;m left with the only options left: buying the CDs, and ripping them. Utterly ridiculous. I found this one, my fifth out of the seven, this weekend at a car boot sale for &amp;pound;2: if I could buy them in mp3 format, I&apos;d have already bought them all, with a substantial amount going to the author, publisher and everyone else. As it is, they get nothing (despite my legal transaction). One day they&apos;ll learn.</description>

  <title>Nearly New</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/76153.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d197LajBJEbjCQStdu8kVw?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TalYRhuVRWI/AAAAAAAAWxs/7TfKLdiFugY/s400/IMG_20110416_094931.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not huge amounts have happened on the baby front. Helen went to a drop in centre on Monday, and apparently heard the baby&apos;s heart beating, which is mean! I would have gone if I&apos;d known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, we went to a &amp;quot;nearly-new sale&amp;quot; in Harpenden on Saturday morning. We got there 15 minutes early, and there were already two huge queues to go in (see photo): one for members (which thankfully we were in), and one for non-members. Once we were in there, what we discovered is that we have no real idea what we&apos;re doing. We stumbled around, picked up a few things that seemed sensible, but there were some people there who had obviously been planning their manoeuvres for weeks. I guess there were always going to be many people there that better knew what they were doing: those who have already had their baby, those who are on their second pregnancy, even those who are just further on than we are. All the same, it was a slightly rude awakening (as if we weren&apos;t scared enough already)</description>

  <title>Four networks in a year (nearly)</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/75999.html</link>
  <description>About a year ago, February 2010 I think, I bought my Nexus One. Since then, I&apos;ve swapped between networks like crazy: I&apos;m now on my 4th. This is me talking about what I did and didn&apos;t like about each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on O2 at the time, with no (or maybe a few MB) of data included in my contract. Because I was buying my phone outright, I decided to switch to a different provider. I don&apos;t feel I can talk too much about O2: despite being with them for 9 years or so (via Carphone Warehouse), I didn&apos;t have a smartphone with them. Much of the discussion from hereon in is about data, and so doesn&apos;t apply. What I can say is that Carphone Warehouse&apos;s online account site is horrific (or was a year ago), the worst I&apos;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first stop was T-Mobile (Febrary 2010): I&apos;d seen an advert for unlimited data when getting a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) SIM and topping up at least &amp;pound;10 a month. This sounded like a great deal, and to be fair it probably was. What I didn&apos;t get on with was PAYG in general. It meant I had to make calls out using Helen&apos;s phone (she had many more free minutes than she could use): not particularly bad, but it meant that we couldn&apos;t make calls at the same time, and that I couldn&apos;t make calls unless at home, or at least with her. Well, I could: I had the &amp;pound;10, but I soon learned that money didn&apos;t go far on PAYG. The data on T-Mobile was pretty good as I remember it: a few blackspots, and no 3G coverage in our house, but we have wifi there. I don&apos;t remember the &amp;quot;my account&amp;quot; website particularly: being PAYG it wasn&apos;t as important as contract ones. I do remember, however, it being a dramatic step up from the Carphone Warehouse one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was debating whether I really wanted to stay on PAYG, Helen got a call from Vodafone (her provider), saying that they could do her a good deal on an additional contract. They offered her (well, me) unlimited internet, lots of minutes and lots of texts for &amp;pound;15 per month, which I went for (around August 2010). I specifically remember the guy saying that the data was &amp;quot;effectively unlimited&amp;quot; and that there was a fair use cap of 500MB, but if you went over that they would just investigate your account to make sure you weren&apos;t using it unreasonably. It came as a bit of a shock, therefore, when I got my first text telling me that I was close to my limit, and that I would be charged &amp;pound;5 if I went over. I started getting this every month, so it became clear that 500MB wasn&apos;t enough for me. If I could have known how much of my allowance I&apos;d already used it might have been bearable, but the Vodafone online account thing was really shoddy: there is no way to find out how much data you have currently used, so it&apos;s impossible to plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;I figured that I needed more data than this contract gave me, so I called Vodafone to try and get more. Two interesting things came out of that call: firstly, they don&apos;t do any contracts with more than 500MB, and secondly, when I asked for my PAC, they told me I was on a one year contract, and it would cost &amp;pound;100 or so to leave. Throughout my network skipping, I was going for sim only contracts, and I made sure I got 30 day ones in case the service wasn&apos;t good, so this was too much. We went through all the paperwork we had for the contract, and none of it mentioned that it was 12 month. Helen was also having issues that they were getting her bill wrong every single month, so felt a little like we were waging war on them. Eventually, when we cced in the CEO to the emails, they relented and let me out (Helen was unfortunately (knowingly) locked in for another 9 months or so).&lt;br /&gt;I had to request my PAC three times, and was told I&apos;d get it within four business days every time, but never did. The last time I phoned up I threatened to bring the regulator in, and all of a sudden they could produce it there and then and give me my PAC over the phone. Funny how that happens. Anyway, by this point I&apos;d looked round the other providers for something around the &amp;pound;15 mark that would give me more than 500MB of data. The only provider I could find was 3, and after some consideration I went with them (March 2011): for &amp;pound;15, I got 300 minutes, 3000 texts, and 1GB of data. Also, 3 now do an &amp;quot;all-you-can-eat&amp;quot; data package, which gives me the opportunity to scale up without switching providers if I find I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, 3 have been good. Not perfect, but good. The biggest thing that has held me back from 3 in the past is their signal: being the smallest big provider (if that makes any sense), I&apos;ve been concerned that I might not get signal everywhere. I haven&apos;t been anywhere particularly out-of-the-way yet, but the signal on my average day is just as good (better, if you take into account that the data is always 3G) as any of the others. Their online account is great, the best I&apos;ve come across: in particular, it tells me up-to-the-minute how much data I&apos;ve used. Being a smaller company, they seem a little more agile than the others: they seem to have adapted much better and much more quickly to the smartphone revolution. The only issue that I&apos;ve had with them so far is that I called to turn on international roaming, and got a text saying it was on, and it was only when I was in Italy that I discovered that it wasn&apos;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all this swapping about, you know what I&apos;m really happy about? That I could. In this country we have the choice of multiple providers: as I understand it, in the US they have only two big ones, and there are two different standards, so I&apos;d have needed to change phones to swap between them. All UK providers are GSM, and the four I&apos;ve been through still doesn&apos;t account for Orange, or any of the smaller ones: Tesco, Virgin, etc. In addition to that, the rules regarding PACs makes it reasonably easy to move around but keep the same number: there&apos;s no way I would have been so prolific if I&apos;d had to get a new number every time.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully 3 will work out for me: despite being happy that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; jump around, I&apos;m in no hurry to do it again!</description>

  <description>If you&apos;re coming here to find out what&apos;s going on: Helen is pregnant. She&apos;s due on 3rd October, and we&apos;re both extraordinarily happy!&lt;br /&gt;For the last few weeks &amp;ndash; ever since we found out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72737.html&quot;&gt;February 4th&lt;/a&gt;, in fact &amp;ndash; I&apos;ve been blogging privately about what&apos;s going on. Nothing earth-shattering, but a good way for me to remember in years to come. We&apos;ve finally told everyone, and it&apos;s time to open up these blog posts. So here is a link to all the previously private blog posts:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/tag/bushbaby&quot;&gt;hjsb.livejournal.com/tag/bushbaby&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <title>The second first scan</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/75304.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ys5sWJj_ObvHdF984xmQ5WGFUhkdF1EO6vuaLjKoJqA?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TYtphf28FsI/AAAAAAAAWYg/DJoEuqr0Bpw/s288/ultrasound_wk12a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am writing this on a beautiful weekday afternoon. I feel rather guilty: the hospital is so efficient that I&apos;ve now got three more hours at home than I&apos;m used to.&amp;nbsp;As you may remember, when we came for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/74311.html&quot;&gt;our first scan&lt;/a&gt;, the CRL of the tiny one wasn&apos;t big enough for them to do all the tests they needed to, so we went back for another today. We were amazed at how much it had grown! CRL is now 59mm, which means it has tripled in size in the last three weeks. Impressive moves, little one. It seemed very settled, just lying on its back, occasionally wiggling an arm. The lady had to try to jiggle it about to try and get the angles that she needed to do her tests. Didn&apos;t seem very successful, but she got the angle she needed in the end.&lt;br /&gt;Helen got her &amp;quot;bounty bag&amp;quot; too, which had the sort of stuff you might expect in: a sample nappy, tiny tub of sudocrem, etc. It did amuse me that it also had a sample pack of ovaltine. In my head, they were trying to tell us that there&apos;s no getting away from it any more: we are officially old. Helen says it&apos;s because it&apos;s a non-caffeinated hot drink. Whatever.&lt;br /&gt;So now we&apos;re left with telling everyone. I think we&apos;re going to start tonight. Please don&apos;t be offended if you didn&apos;t receive a phone call: the wonder of twitter / facebook is that we can tell everyone all at once, and the ones that want to talk directly to us can do so.&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;ll be so much more real once everyone knows; at the moment there&apos;s an almost dream-like feel to that fact that most people don&apos;t know. I&apos;d make a rubbish spy.&amp;nbsp;</description>

  <title>Nexus One, battery life, Gingerbread</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/75251.html</link>
  <description>When I finally got the gingerbread update on my Nexus One, I was surprised to find that the battery life was waaaaay worse than it used to be: overnight, it would go from 100% to about 50%, and the battery report in settings (I love that, so useful, and it&apos;s even better in Gingerbread, ironically) told me that it was &amp;quot;Android OS&amp;quot; that was draining it.&amp;nbsp;A bit of research led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15057&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a bug report on the Android Google Code site&lt;/a&gt;. I know better than to assume that because the bug had been reported, that Google would fix it: the Google Code site seems to be pretty much just for people to vent their anger, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever seen a Google response on there. A couple of people said they had fixed it, so i tried a couple of things from the page: I tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15057#c168&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;emptying the cache&lt;/a&gt;, but that didn&apos;t seem to help. I finally tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15057#c11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changing the wifi to never sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and that seems to have sorted the problem (again, ironic: it&apos;s supposed to sleep to save power). I&apos;ll test it by leaving it to discharge overnight to check, but it&apos;s only lost about 10% this afternoon, and that&apos;s with some use.</description>

  <title>Alone and waiting</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/74853.html</link>
  <description>We told them! It was great being able to discuss it with people, albeit just a few. But it was decided that we shouldn&apos;t tell anyone else&amp;nbsp;until after Helen gets back from the states: she flew out yesterday, gets back in a week. It&apos;s strange being alone in our house at any time, but at &amp;nbsp;this time even more so.&lt;br /&gt;I worry about how many baby things the two grandmothers will have bought by the time the baby is actually born...</description>

  <title>The big day</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/74725.html</link>
  <description>Well, not the BIG day, but quite a big one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&apos;s the day we tell the first people. It was nearly yesterday: I was skyping with Pete, and when I went to show him some of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/spookypeanut/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;flickr photos&lt;/a&gt;,  he spotted that one of my tabs was entitled &quot;Paternity leave&quot;. I suppose I could have told him and sworn him to secrecy, but I chose to... well... make him think otherwise. I didn&apos;t actually &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;, I just said that we were thinking about it. Which is true. We&apos;re thinking about it A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&apos;re heading up to Helen&apos;s parents tonight to tell them, and then my parents are coming down tomorrow (to celebrate my Dad&apos;s 70th). I don&apos;t know when we&apos;ll get round to telling the rest of the world, ie when these posts will get opened up, but it won&apos;t be long now.</description>

  <title>The first scan</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/74311.html</link>
  <description>Helen had an appointment at the hospital on Monday: she got to ask all her questions. One of those was whether she&apos;d still be able to do the 26 mile Shine walk (oh, don&apos;t forget to &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/de4PM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sponsor me&lt;/a&gt;): the answer was yes, but be sensible (which is probably pretty much what we&apos;d have done anyway). And she came home with an unreasonably large volume of reading material. We&apos;ve started on it, but I hope there isn&apos;t a test at the end, I&apos;m never going to remember it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AxPjQmQ_oSuZCTnoIStB4mGFUhkdF1EO6vuaLjKoJqA?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TW46nc5OkCI/AAAAAAAAVc0/kKcGhkOTbPc/s288/ultrasound_wk8.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This morning we both (particularly Helen) had a slanging match with Vodafone. They lied to me when selling me my new contract (I moved to them in August), and they&apos;ve screwed up her bill (in their favour, shockingly) for the last four months or so. We went straight from that to our first ultrasound, also at the QEII hospital, and we forgot everything that had brought us down for the rest of the morning: it was pretty amazing. The appointment was surprisingly efficient: we went in just a few minutes late. We got a lovely little picture for a reasonable &amp;pound;3 (left), and seeing the baby moving was absolutely overwhelming. It turns out that the estimate that the GP and midwife had made of how far in we were (11 weeks 1 day) may have been a little high: our tiny little guy&apos;s CRL (crown to rump length) is only 22mm, which according to the lady who did the scan makes it more like 8 weeks 5 days. The early scan (at which they do various tests) can only be done if the CRL is over 45mm, so we&apos;ve got another one booked in a few weeks time. Must save up more pound coins before then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A peculiar quirk about not telling people for the first few weeks (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72737.html&quot;&gt;first tng post&lt;/a&gt;) is that we&apos;re happy for strangers to know. For example, today we went to the Plume of Feathers for lunch, and were happily talking about it; when we had friends over for dinner last week, we were concentrating hard on not giving anything away. It&apos;s completely the reverse of how things normally are.</description>

  <title>Not sure why I&apos;m posting this</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/74107.html</link>
  <description>Last week Helen went down to the new forest to help out her gran, who has just had a hip replacement, and her mum joined them later in the week. I thought that would be the end of the secrecy, I have to say: spending 24h a day with two women who have both done this three times. But she managed to hide it, or at least if she didn&apos;t, neither said anything.&lt;br /&gt;On the day she got back, we went to see Ben Folds in london (fabulous, btw, and best support act (Kate Miller Heidke) I&apos;ve seen since Duke Special). Where we would normally find a nice restaurant, helen requested Mcdonalds. Presumably that was a pregnancy related craving, but who knows?&lt;br /&gt;On Tuesday, Helen had her first bout if morning sickness. She said it was very strange: she left home absolutely fine, and got steadily more and more nauseous on the drive, but after she was actually sick, she was pretty much fine for the rest of the day (except incredibly tired). &lt;br /&gt;Helen told her line manager yesterday, which the NHS recommends you do asap. She said he was really good about it, I guess he was always going to be, that&apos;s his job after all! But what I think was good for her was that she had some practice in telling &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;. She has a few people she wants to tell in person, or at least over the phone, and I think that&apos;s tougher than it sounds. I&apos;m certainly not good with big news, good or bad.</description>

  <title>I like last.fm</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/73958.html</link>
  <description>I really do. But I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m going to pay for it. Here is their list of why I should:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Uninterrupted radio listening&lt;/strike&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Never listen on my desktop machine)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Play radio on your mobile app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Play radio on supported hardware platforms&lt;/strike&gt; (Don&apos;t have any (other than my mobile))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Ad-free browsing and streaming&lt;/strike&gt; (Ad blockers mean this is unnecessary)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Recent visitors to your profile&lt;/strike&gt; (I&apos;m not going to pretend I&apos;m not interested, but hardly important)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;A prestigious black icon&lt;/strike&gt; (Whoopdy-do)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;New! Access to our VIP zone with more charts, graphs and the latest from the Last.fm Labs&lt;/strike&gt; (Again, interested, but I&apos;m not gonna pay for it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So really, I&apos;m just paying for streaming to my mobile. Now, $3 a month is not that expensive (cheaper than the &amp;pound;3 a month they also offer: why would I choose something more expensive?), but all the same, if I&apos;m paying a music subscription service, would I not be better paying for one that lets me play whatever track I like, whenever I like (eg Spotify, We7)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much torn.</description>

  <title>All inclusive on Biyadhoo</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/73697.html</link>
  <description>We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=3.922078&amp;amp;lon=73.45677&amp;amp;zoom=18&amp;amp;layers=M&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Biyadhoo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in October, and because we didn&apos;t want to have to worry about any food or drink related expenditure while we were there, we went all-inclusive. I intended to blog about the whole trip when we got back*, but never got round to it. One of the things I was going to talk about was whether it was worth going all inclusive. I kept tabs while we were there on how much we *would* have spent, had we not gone all-inclusive. Here&apos;s the list:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 Coconut cooler (8.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9 Coke (2.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 Deep sea (8.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 Gin (4.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Gin fizz (7.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Lion (3.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 Pina colada (8.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Red wine (4.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 San miguel (4.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6 Sprite (2.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 Tonic (2.50)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7 Water, 1.5l (3.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 White wine (4.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Fishing (20.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Snorkeling (20.00)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The last two were two trips that were included, the rest were drinks, if you don&apos;t recognise the name it&apos;s probably a house cocktail. I don&apos;t actually remember what a lion was. Maybe a mis-typing.&lt;br /&gt;The total of that list is 327.50 USD: if I remember correctly, we paid around &amp;pound;200 to go all-inclusive. By today&apos;s exchange rate, I make it that we made the right choice by a huge &amp;pound;3.85. But you also have to factor in convenience, of never having to worry about it. But likewise, we might not have gone on the two trips if they hadn&apos;t been free. I think we still came out on top: maybe we wouldn&apos;t have done the trips, but they were enjoyable. And we had an absolutely fantastic time overall anyway, so it doesn&apos;t really matter. If you haven&apos;t seen my &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/VzfG6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/xqSmh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to take a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 12 word review: Mostly snorkelling or on beach (fabulous),&amp;nbsp;accommodation&amp;nbsp;naff, highlight was dolphin watching.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Should have been a tweet, but can&apos;t do that privately and release it later, so it&apos;s here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to the start of Brave New World for the first time. An appropriate, if especially creepy time to do so.</description>

  <title>Secrecy</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72999.html</link>
  <description>It&apos;s only been a few days, so obviously not much has happened from a baby development point of view (apparently: I have no first hand knowledge). What has been interesting has been the difficulty in keeping it secret from the rest of the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend Jenny and JJ came up, and we met Pete in London. We had a fantastic time: wildlife photographer exhibition, Ghost Stories, Wahaca, casino (where we came out up! Go us!). But the tricky bit was hiding the fact that Helen wasn&apos;t drinking. What we took to doing was swapping drinks occasionally, so yours truly ended up mildly sozzled. We&apos;re also wondering about next weekend, when we&apos;re planning a trip to another friends&apos;. What happens if they serve blue cheese, homemade mayonnaise, or meringue? And will I be able to stay sober enough to pass off the drink switching tactic again? Tune in again to find out.</description>

  <title>Two lines</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72737.html</link>
  <description>We&apos;ve been trying for a few months, so we didn&apos;t expect anything when Helen got up this morning to do a pregnancy test before I left for work. She stood back with her hands over her mouth, and I took a look: two lines. I didn&apos;t know what this meant at first, but I could guess. We sat there on the landing for a while, the kitties looking on. Our whole world just changed. For the better, of course, but still: things will never be the same again, and that leads to a little anxiety (read: we&apos;re scared shitless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;table style=&quot;width:auto;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OXeRskbEvcqkxOgv6pDkk2GFUhkdF1EO6vuaLjKoJqA?feat=embedwebsite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;192&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_FVgJG4Q0nAw/TU7sG7jwx3I/AAAAAAAAUQ0/uwsHyoXAdT8/s288/IMG_4703.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I expressed my happiness a couple of times today, and got some suspicious comments. No need to worry though, work has got the better of me today (we have lots of urgent stuff needed Right Now: otime needs tile rendering, for example), so my happiness has diminished to acceptable standard Friday levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen pointed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/pregnancycareplanner/pages/Dadshome.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NHS guide for Dads&lt;/a&gt;, which I&apos;m just about to have a read of*. That&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve written that word referring to myself and it&apos;s WEIRD. I also remember Cory Doctorow recommending a baby book on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;boingboing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;some time ago which I may have to look into. (EDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2008/10/13/twelve-hours-sleep-b.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;found it&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s kind of strange writing this now, knowing that no-one will read it for several months. For those unaware (I was until my friends started popping sprogs), it is considered inadvisable to let anyone know until three months in: the chances of loss in those months are significant, and the loss is hard enough without having to field &amp;quot;how&apos;s the baby&amp;quot; questions all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* EDIT: Have read. Now more terrified.</description>

  <title>Maps</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/72558.html</link>
  <description>Ever since I got my &lt;a href=&quot;http://hjsb.livejournal.com/69377.html&quot;&gt;Nexus One&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;ve been GPS tracking pretty much everywhere I go. After a couple of months I stopped tracking my commute, as it was basically identical every day, but otherwise I&apos;ve been pretty consistent throughout the year. &lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve collected a lot of maps now, but most of them were uploaded as &amp;quot;unlisted&amp;quot;: I realized the other day it was ridiculous that they were on tinternet but no-one could see them, so&amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve decided to open up many more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here&apos;s the full list - &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/PUfET&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/PUfET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maps are of all over the place, from the Maldives to Manchester. The ones I&apos;ve held back are the ones that basically point out exactly where I live, but I&apos;m not even sure about those ones: I may end up opening them up later. If someone wants to track down where I live, I&apos;m sure there are much easier ways than deducing it from a plethora of GPS traces.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the Google My Maps interface is a bit rubbish, and doesn&apos;t let you see all of the tracks on one page. The way to get round it (without hosting it myself) is a little ridiculous: if you copy the link address of &amp;quot;Open in Google Earth&amp;quot;, paste it into the Google Maps search box, you can see the whole thing in one interface (albeit with some weird spikey bits).&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of my favourites:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maldives (because the background is so different to the rest of my maps)&amp;nbsp;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/VzfG6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/VzfG6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Butterfly world (because you can see the tracks that they designed to look like bits of a butterfly) - &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/nbwJP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/nbwJP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Framestore lunch (because it shows the area I cover during my lunch break) -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/AptQf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/AptQf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whipsnade (because being such an open area, the GPS accuracy is very good) -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/0BUrr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/0BUrr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trains (because it makes me want to get the train &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; London, instead of just into or out of) -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/QhUmN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/QhUmN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;All comments welcome!</description>

  <title>My new toys</title>
  <link>http://hjsb.livejournal.com/71864.html</link>
  <description>&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have not been spending as much time as I&amp;nbsp;would like programming. Odd, you may think, I thought that&apos;s what you did all day at work? Well, two things:&amp;nbsp;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No, I script. While the difference is blurred these days, the practicality is that we script because everything needs to be done imminently, thus there is no real release schedule, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to work on my own things, in my own time, for the fun of it. I want programming to still be fun for me, and I&amp;nbsp;think a good way to do that is to work on something that I&amp;nbsp;find really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Hence I&apos;m going to spend (at least) two hours programming, twice a week. However, I don&apos;t really want to spend those hours in my current computer room:&amp;nbsp;not just because it&apos;s a state&amp;nbsp;(it is:&amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve set aside time for that too), but because I want to be downstairs with Helen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you have read so far are excuses for me to buy myself some new toys:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A laptop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A&amp;nbsp;NAS (Some NAS?&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;NAS&amp;nbsp;device?&amp;nbsp;You decide)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I went for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://is.gd/dx1Do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Acer Aspire 1410T from Aria&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://is.gd/dx1HN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LaCie Network Space 2 from Dabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The laptop is perfect. For less than &amp;pound;300 I&apos;ve got some that&apos;s small enough to be proper portable (I didn&apos;t want one of these enormous 15.6&amp;quot; things), while being able to do everything I&amp;nbsp;wanted it to. I honestly can&apos;t think of anything I&apos;d change about it. Oh, maybe I&apos;d put a DVI&amp;nbsp;port on it. That&apos;s literally it. Delivery was astonishingly fast too:&amp;nbsp;I got it delivered to a friend&apos;s house because there was always someone in, and it was delivered before 9am the following day (I&amp;nbsp;ordered it at a lunchtime), even though I&apos;d gone for the free delivery option.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I&amp;nbsp;did was remove all the crappy Windows programs that they put on it. I played with it a bit in Windows, but later that first evening I&amp;nbsp;put Ubuntu on it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I booted Ubuntu from a key and I&amp;nbsp;was astonished at how quickly it detected everything and was up and running. It&apos;s even better now I&apos;ve installed it.&amp;nbsp;It is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much faster in use than WIndows 7. The boot time is impressive too:&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;20sec (vs &amp;gt;30sec for Windows). And everything worked straight away:&amp;nbsp;It got me to update, ONCE, and there was a kernel change so it needed a reboot. I can&apos;t count the number of updates that Windows has done so far. There seem to be new ones every time I&amp;nbsp;log in, and they &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; need a reboot.&lt;br /&gt;The laptop is perfect because now I&amp;nbsp;can do whatever programming I&amp;nbsp;want, wherever I&amp;nbsp;want in the house. It&apos;s not going to be the quickest at compiling, but I doubt I&apos;ll be doing a full build of anything enormous very often.&lt;br /&gt;The NAS&amp;nbsp;is less clear cut. It does what I&amp;nbsp;want, and it was reasonably cheap. It works in Linux*, has a usb port on the front for another mass storage device to be plugged in and has a pretty good web interface (I haven&apos;t touched the CD that came with it, as is the case with most hardware I buy these days). But:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s slow. I mean proper slow. When&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;started rsyncing stuff across, I was getting 1MB/s. Not great. After a while it slowed down, and it finally settled at around 500kB/s. Generally this isn&apos;t going to matter:&amp;nbsp;I&apos;m rarely going to be adding new files to it:&amp;nbsp;just when&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;buy a new CD / game. But to start, I&amp;nbsp;want to copy about 500GB&amp;nbsp;of data to it. A quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;amp;channel=fs&amp;amp;q=500GB+%2F+500kB%2Fs&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google calculation&lt;/a&gt; tells me that it would take 12 days at that speed. And that&apos;s 24/7:&amp;nbsp;my computer is so noisy, and uses so much power, that&apos;s a massive waste. Eventually I came up with a workaround:&amp;nbsp;all my data happens to be on an external drive, so I&apos;ve plugged that directly into the Network&amp;nbsp;Space 2, and I&apos;m copying the file over directly. It&apos;s still not as quick as it really ought to be, but I should be able to get it all done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=500GB+%2F+6+hours+in+MB%2Fs&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6 hours&lt;/a&gt; or so at that speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can plug it directly into a computer, and copy files onto it using USB. Sounds good?&amp;nbsp;You can only copy file onto a USB&amp;nbsp;specific partition, not onto the network partition. How pointless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit:&amp;nbsp;also, it is a Windows Share, and thus it won&apos;t accept : ? *&amp;nbsp;etc in filenames. Which is a bit of a bitch (not exactly the devices fault though, I&amp;nbsp;guess). I hope I&amp;nbsp;don&apos;t have to resort to renaming all the files, but I&apos;m damned if I can find anything on Google that will help me do this from within rsync. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-12/msg00546.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the closest I&apos;ve found, but that&apos;s specific to cygwin I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It does look pretty though, and it quiet. Those are two of my requirements, as it&apos;s going to sit in the living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&amp;nbsp;To get it working, I&apos;m using this line in my fstab, in case anyone else needs it:&lt;br /&gt;//192.168.1.160/OpenShare/&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /media/openshare&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cifs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; guest,rw,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,credentials=/home/hjsb/.NAS.credentials&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid2-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>
