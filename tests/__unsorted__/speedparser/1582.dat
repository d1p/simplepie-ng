			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>You really can&#8217;t go wrong with a delicious hot dog once in a while.  I noticed Yankee Dogs before just passing through, and finally got to try it when we were walking down on Clematis St. with some friends.  We found out that the place hadn&#8217;t even had its grand opening yet, and their hot dogs are imported from Buffalo, NY!  Their hot dogs are a mix of smoked beef and pork.</p>
<p>Here are the hot dogs we ended up ordering&#8230;</p>
<p>This was their plain hot dog, topped with ketchup and mustard.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187" title="Plain Hot Dog" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yankeedog-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>This was the Chihuahua Dog, with chili, onions and guacamole.<br />

<p>Here was their signature hot dog, the Yankee Dog, which was topped with chili, onions, mustard and feta cheese.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-185" title="Yankee Dog" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yankeedog-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>We also got their version of Poutine, which was fries topped with gravy and cheese.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184" title="Poutine" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yankeedog-4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>Overall, the food was good and the owner was really friendly.  They&#8217;re open 24 hours and they also serve breakfast too.  Maybe next time!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>La Granja is one of my favorite cheap chicken spots in South Florida!  There are many locations throughout Florida, and even in Aruba!  The line is always long when I go here, and it&#8217;s for good reason:  the food is good, and cooked to order (with exception of the rotisserie chicken).  With rice and beans with the chicken, it makes a good, filling meal that doesn&#8217;t hurt your wallet.  In my opinion, this is probably the best place to eat if you&#8217;re on a budget and want to get your money&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>You can get a 1/4 chicken with rice and beans for less than $3.95!  There are even a variety of sauces you can try with the chicken, as well as a bar with an assortment of onion toppings.  I am personally a fan of the green sauce with onions in it, and top my rice and beans with it!  The flavor is tangy but goes well with the chicken.  In addition to chicken, they also serve grilled steak, grilled pork, seafood platters and sandwiches.</p>
<p>I usually get the grilled chicken with rice, beans, and fried bananas.  I usually never finish it and have to take the rest home &#8211; it&#8217;s THAT much food!<br />

<p>This is the 1/4 chicken with rice, beans, and fried bananas, topped with onions and jalapenos.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Hashi Sushi &#038; Thai was actually one of the very first restaurants I tried when I first moved to South Florida.  Since it was the closest sushi place to where I used to live, it was either a hit or miss.  Fortunately, it was a hit, and I&#8217;ve been here many times with my family and friends.  I love how they serve sushi, as well as Thai food, giving you different options.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of their Thai Iced Tea, so if you ever go, try that!  Our recent visit to Hashi was to celebrate my mother in law&#8217;s birthday, so we got a few dishes from their Thai menu.</p>
<p>My absolute favorite dish is their Chicken Pad Thai.  It&#8217;s even delicious the next day, reheated.  Amazing.<br />

<p>I didn&#8217;t try this Garlic Shrimp dish but it does look like it has a lot of flavor, based on how it looks!<br />
<img src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/hashi-garlicshrimp.jpg" alt="" title="Hashi Sushi &amp; Thai - Garlic Shrimp" width="400" height="497" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" /></p>
<p>The grilled fish was delicious, and love the presentation.  This fish was plentiful for 4 people!  The sauce was a garlic flavored sauce surrounding the fish at the bottom of the dish.<br />

<p>For dessert, we had the tempura fried ice cream.  You can&#8217;t go wrong with fried ice cream, it&#8217;s pretty darn good.  But, it must be eaten quickly, as it melts fast!<br />

<p>I&#8217;m never really disappointed when I come here.  The staff is very nice and make sure you&#8217;re taken care of.  If you&#8217;re looking for delicious food with pretty presentation, Hashi Sushi &#038; Thai is somewhere you definitely need to try!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I actually found out about this place from Yelp, after having a craving for some tacos.  Sure, I could have gone to Taco Bell, but we all know that it&#8217;s just not the same!  After trying the tacos here, I probably won&#8217;t ever go to Taco Bell again.  The tacos at Tacos al Carbon are inexpensive, and taste so good.  There are a lot of different varieties of meat you can choose from, such as shredded beef, shredded chicken, ground beef, spicy pork, and carne asada (to name a few).  I personally enjoyed the shredded beef and shredded chicken tacos &#8211; in a soft taco shell.  It was topped with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, and the flavors in the meats made the tacos even more flavorful.  I also had the rice and beans, which with 3 tacos is a good lunch just for $6.99.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" title="Tacos al Carbon Soft Tacos" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/tacosalcarbon-softtacos1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>My husband ordered hard shell tacos with carne asada meat, and ordered some guacamole.  The guacamole tasted fresh, although it could have been more flavorful.  As for the chips, they taste different from any tortilla chip that I&#8217;ve ever had, and could have been better.  But overall, the food was pretty good.  Also, if you&#8217;ve never tried the Mexican drink horchata, try it here!  Horchata is a rice drink with cinnamon flavors, although it is made differently in different countries.  I always enjoy this drink because I find it refreshing, and it just made my entire meal authentic and delicious.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" title="Tacos al Carbon Hard Tacos" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/tacosalcarbon-hardtacos.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>

<p>The cool thing about this place is that it&#8217;s open 24 hours, and you can either eat inside (which is quite small) or take out in their taco truck across the parking lot!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s been a while since we had Greek food, and we were looking for a place close by, so Chris&#8217; Taverna was perfect.  This was our first time here, but seeing all the good reviews assured us that we were going somewhere good.  When we got there, around lunch time, it was packed, which was definitely a good sign.  There is outdoor and indoor seating, but we opted to eat inside.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of gyros, so I ordered that with Greek fries, which are fries with feta cheese, oregano and parsley.  It also came with a side Greek salad and pita bread, which had a hint of garlic flavor to it.  </p>

<p>My husband got the Souvlaki platter with lemon herb potatoes, and it also came with a side Greek salad and pita bread.  He enjoyed it a lot, although he wished he got the Greek fries!  </p>

<p>We also got Baklava to go and it was a lot of dessert!  I wish I took a picture, but it was delish.  The food was great and plentiful, and the service was great.  I totally will go back to this place when I&#8217;m craving Greek food!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I love chicken wings!  Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t any Wing Stops in the Palm Beach area (my favorite place for wings), so the husband and I had to look for a wings place that wasn&#8217;t too far from us.  Luckily, with some skillful Google-ing, we found Teddy&#8217;s Wing Shack and checked it out.  This place is very casual, with outdoor and indoor seating.  I remember the decor indoors to be very vintage, which in my opinion was really cool.</p>
<p>As far as the wings go, there are a lot of sauces to choose from.  From the traditional mild, medium, and hot, there are other sauces such as lemon pepper, honey garlic, Jamaican jerk and coconut curry.  There are about 22 sauces on their menu.  Since I am allergic to blue cheese, I got the ranch dressing and it was green!  I thought that was interesting, but it didn&#8217;t taste any different.  I ordered the wings and fries combo with lemon pepper, and my husband got ribs and medium sauce wings.  The lemon pepper wings were pretty good, as they weren&#8217;t too salty.  The medium sauce wings had the right spiciness.  The waffle fries were good, but they were just a tad too crunchy.  I didn&#8217;t get a chance to try the ribs but the husband did like them, but not loved.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126" title="Teddy's Wing Shack Ribs &amp; Wings" src="http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/teddys-wing-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the mood for wings, and in the West Palm Beach area, this is the place to go.  The prices are relatively inexpensive and you have a bunch of wing sauce to choose from!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When we first moved to the area, I wondered if there were any good bagel places.  I love me a bagel every now and then.  My absolute favorite is a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese.  Luckily, we stumbled upon Strathmore Bagels and go there for our bagel fix, usually on the weekends.  They even have other breakfast dishes like Challah French toast, omelets and bagel sandwiches.  A favorite breakfast order of mine is The Not So Hungry, which is one egg (made however you want), home fries, 1 pancake, your choice of bagel, toast or bialy, strip of bacon and sausage.  It&#8217;s a lot for someone who is considered &#8220;not so hungry!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s definitely a must try if you&#8217;re in the Wellington area.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The <a href="http://www.rusticinn.com/" target="_blank" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.rusticinn.com/?referer=');">Rustic Inn</a> has a bit of history, and I love places like that.  It&#8217;s been around since 1955 and started as a hole in the wall saloon.  The place is known for their World Famous Garlic Crabs so of course when we went there for the first time, I had to try them.  My husband and I went there for his birthday last year and loved it.  So this time, we tagged along with my husband&#8217;s parents since they&#8217;ve never been.</p>
<p>When we got there, we noticed that there is plenty of seating!  Good thing we got there before 6pm.  It was Saturday, so we had anticipated there would be a lot of people.  We sat by the Intracostal and saw a bunch of boats go by as we ate.  I got the garlic crabs, while my husband got the crab sampler.  The garlic crabs were definitely delicious, but it is pretty much understood that when you go for crabs, be prepared to use your hands, wear a bib and get down and dirty.  And also keep in mind you&#8217;ll be cracking crabs for a couple hours!  Seriously!  I was digging in and didn&#8217;t really care that the garlic butter was dripping down my arms.</p>
<p>If you like crabs, then you definitely need to try out this place.  I think the prices are fair for crabs and it&#8217;s definitely a fun time.  Ooh, and their lime pie is awesome!  It tastes so rich and the crust is delicious!  Get that for dessert! <img src='http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s been a while since my last blog post, so I have a bunch of catching up to do!  Yes, another yogurt post!  I seriously think there is crack in fro yo.  I heard about Yogurtland and wanted to try it for a while, but since it&#8217;s a bit far from me, I had to wait a bit.  Whenever I&#8217;m in the Broward area, I try to find a reason to go to Coral Springs so I can get some delicious yogurt!  The first time I went, it was super packed!  Yogurtland is located in a plaza next to a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice so you&#8217;re sure to find a thriving plaza when you go here.</p>
<p>There are so many varieties of Yogurt, you can&#8217;t help to try more than one!  And for $0.30 an ounce, you can definitely get your money&#8217;s worth!  I love the Chocolate Coconut Truffle,  Taro, and of course the Original Tart flavor with my favorite toppings:  strawberries and mochi! <img src='http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

I&#8217;m really hoping for a Yogurtland to open in the West Palm Beach area&#8230; who wants to buy a franchise with me?  <img src='http://www.southfloridafoodguide.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
