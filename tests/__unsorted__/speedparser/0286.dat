<p><em>Tegan Alexandria</em></p>
<p><em>Born October 13, 2010</em></p>
<p><em>At 5:10 p.m.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://laborluv.com/"><em>At Labor of Love Birth Center in Lutz, Florida</em></a></p>
<p><em>Into the hands of her father and midwives Andrea and Bea</em></p>
<p><em>7 pounds, 12 ounces; 21 inches</em></p>
<p>Long ago, I wrote an entire entry dedicated to the reasons I chose natural birth and how I committed to it by choosing the best in prenatal care at a birth center. Though I never posted it, I&#8217;ll sum it up for you quickly: it&#8217;s the standard of care for all of the other developed nations; <a href="http://www.theunnecesarean.com/blog/2010/3/21/florida-cesarean-rates-by-hospital-2008.html">Tampa-area hospitals have a 40%+ rate of C-sections</a>; quicker recovery times; immediate bonding that supports easy breastfeeding. I highly recommend <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7e5-npisacsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=henci+goer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rfGU3B_808&amp;sig=xVbXAciyKWVFpjuhkflUCK7XIoE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y27HTP2bNaHc8gTQ9sTdAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Henci Goer&#8217;s </a><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7e5-npisacsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=henci+goer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rfGU3B_808&amp;sig=xVbXAciyKWVFpjuhkflUCK7XIoE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y27HTP2bNaHc8gTQ9sTdAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>The Thinking Women&#8217;s Guide to a Better Birth</em></a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the laws and medical models of the United States don&#8217;t support midwives or birth centers, so though I had easily passed non-stress tests on Monday October 11, the 42-week mark on Wednesday October 13 was the legal deadline for me to have the baby in a birth center in Florida. Since my alternative was to go to a hospital and get pumped full of <a href="http://www.birthingnaturally.net/barp/pitocin.html">pitocin</a>, the midwives started a natural course for induction over the weekend. I started taking <a href="http://imherbalist.com/prod-mom.asp?showproduct=44">a blend of herbs to start labor</a>. On Sunday, Bea was at the birth center for another birth, so she offered to sweep my membranes. I took her up on it. After meeting with the OB on Monday for the non-stress test dilated at 3 cm, she recommended I take castor oil to start induction. The midwives agreed that I should try it in the morning.</p>
<p>So on Tuesday October 12 at 5 a.m., I downed an entire milkshake mixed with a bottle of castor oil. The consistency and flavor was no problem mixed into a shake. It definitely started the contractions! By 11 a.m., I headed up to the birth center to meet with Andrea. We checked into the birthing suite, and started additional herbs. James and I went for walks around the neighborhood for the afternoon. Though I was having regular contractions, I wasn&#8217;t making much progress. We talked about it, and decided to go home at 9 p.m. The midwives told us to get sleep, and I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to. They recommended I take some Benadryl to sleep. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t work, and instead I felt the incredible urge to sleep while fighting true labor. At 2 a.m., we called Andrea and met back at the birth center at 3.</p>
<p>It was at 4 a.m. on Wednesday that my water broke while on the birthing ball. I labored until about 10 a.m., when I was about 7 cm dilated and able to get into the tub. The tub was the most amazing thing ever! The contractions melted away, and James and I nearly napped in the tub to a full 10 cm. At about 2 p.m., after being way too relaxed to push, I was asked to get out of the tub. The bed ended up being the most effective place for me to push, but since I was so exhausted from the castor oil, Benadryl and being awake with contractions since 5 a.m. the morning before, the pushing wasn&#8217;t going so well. It took 3 and a half hours of pushing, but finally she arrived with her fist at her head at 5:10 p.m., 36 hours after it all began.</p>
<div id="attachment_234" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-8.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-234" title="photo-8" src="../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-8-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><br />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Our first picture together, right after Tegan was laid on my chest!</p></div>
<p>The experience of being there for it all was incredible, as she was immediately laid upon my chest. Not long after, she began breastfeeding with no latching problems. She&#8217;s still a champion feeder, up to 8 pounds, 8 ounces at her 2-week appointment! I needed no stitches, and was able to go home at about 10 that night. My mom came up to meet her and hold her as I took a shower. James was awesome for a first time dad, showing off his cloth diapering and swaddling skills, impressing the birth assistants. She was perfectly fine and healthy for her lateness. In fact, she was still covered in vernix! James was 4 weeks late and I was 3, so the midwives decided that it&#8217;s genetically normal for me to make late babies (whether the state of Florida likes it or not).</p>
<p>Though the birth was long and made more difficult by the induction, I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. Tegan was born perfectly, the way she was meant to, surrounded by love. We are so lucky to have such a healthy girl and be able to stick to our birth plan!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tegan-painting-by-alexis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-216" title="tegan painting by alexis" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tegan-painting-by-alexis-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a>Yesterday, my wonderful colleagues in the English department surprised me with a baby shower! Silly me brought papers for a meeting, but everyone else was there for the delicious pumpkin and cream cheese cake. I&#8217;m really lucky to have their support, even though I teach photography!</p>
<p>Today, my yearbook staff pulled off H.S.B.S., a.k.a. their code for Hanks&#8217;s Secret Baby Shower. At the end of third period, I had a note asking me to see an administrator immediately at the beginning of fourth period. After a long, productive conversation with my APA, I went back upstairs to a text message panicking that eDesign crashed. I get into the dark room, where they all had surprise me with tons of food, presents, balloons, a cake and a giant card. I really have the best yearbook staff ever! They had been planning this for weeks, and pulled it off without dropping any hints to me. Apparently, they had a ton of the faculty involved, and one of my former photographers, Tina, came back to join too! My Odyssey of the Mind teams even got in on the fun. The Mario-themed painting shown here was painted by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Alexis-Marie-Photography/114101511967115?ref=ts">one of my amazingly talented photographers</a>, and is going on the door to the room.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much again! I will miss you all when I&#8217;m gone, but be glad knowing I have such strong support while I&#8217;m away. Wednesday is my last day at school, and I&#8217;m extremely lucky to have John as my sub while I&#8217;m away. He is so involved with the students and passionate about photography as well. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2058245&amp;id=1416747687&amp;page=5">Thanks for posting these shower pictures!</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I got my last piece of &#8220;fluff mail&#8221; to round out our cloth diaper stash, and now I&#8217;m excited to show it off! Cloth diapers aren&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.pinstripesandpolkadots.com/myths.htm">cloth and pins anymore</a>. In fact, I don&#8217;t even have any pins nor do I intend on buying any. It&#8217;s all easy velcro and adjustable inserts depending on what you&#8217;re using them for. Not only is it environmentally friendly to keep all those disposable diapers out of the landfill, but you also <a href="http://cdretailercooperative.blogspot.com/2010/07/can-you-really-save-money-with-cloth.html" target="_blank">save a ton of money doing it</a>. There&#8217;s health benefits too, like less diaper rash and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36972785/" target="_blank">no strange chemicals on her rear 24/7</a>. Besides for an extra load of laundry every couple of days, it&#8217;s just as convenient. You can read more for yourself if you&#8217;re interested in the links at the end, but let&#8217;s get to Tegan&#8217;s stash!</p>
<p>If you remember the tour of the nursery, there were four color bins on the changing table:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-170" title="diapers 002" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-002-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Starting in the yellow bin is the newborn stash. Why buy a separate newborn stash of diapers, when the rest of them are one-size fits all? They&#8217;ll fit perfectly right from the beginning, ensuring that there are no leaks (and yes, you do get less leaks with cloth diapers).</p>
<p>The core of this system is the prefold. This is a cloth with a thick center panel that just needs a quick fold to be ready to use. We chose <a href="http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/diapers.htm" target="_blank">Green Mountain Diaper&#8217;s organic prefolds</a> due to their great reputation for absorbency and durability. These aren&#8217;t yet washed, but when they are, they shrink slightly in size and quilt up real fluffy.</p>
<p><img src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-003-300x200.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-005-300x200.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s two ways to use these. One is to just fold them in thirds and lay them in the cover. Velcro the cover on just like a disposable, and you&#8217;re done! <a href="http://www.theecofriendlyfamily.com/2009/11/check-out-spankin-new-thirsties-duo.html" target="_blank">The Thirsties covers are also adjustable by snaps to grow with a newborn from 6 to 18 pounds</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-172" title="diapers 004" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-004-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-174" title="diapers 006" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-006-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-175" title="diapers 007" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-007-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-176" title="diapers 008" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-008-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>I dug around Erica&#8217;s stuff in the garage until I found a Tigger stuffed animal to experiment on for the sake of the blog. Here he is modeling the prefold with Thirsties wrap:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-179" title="diapers 011" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-011-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-178" title="diapers 010" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-010-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The other way is to Snappi it on. It&#8217;s a little plastic/rubber grip tool that keeps it all together. You can put a cover on over this, or just let her go with the prefold and Snappi. <a href="http://www.theecofriendlyfamily.com/2009/08/prefold-picture-tutorial.html">There&#8217;s a ton of different folds you can do for different scenarios too</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-180" title="diapers 012" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-012-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181" title="diapers 013" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-013-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Honestly, when we intended on cloth diapering, we thought even that was slightly too complicated, folding a piece of cloth and velcroing the top. Bumgenius diapers are what we can&#8217;t wait to use. Our stash of 18 fills the blue and green bins. Look at all the beautiful colors they come in:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-182" title="diapers 014" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-014-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" title="diapers 015" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-015-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>They just came out with a <a href="http://www.cottonbabies.com/product_info.php?cPath=98&#038;products_id=2424">new 4.0 system too</a>, so we got the 3.0s at a great price. They are one size, with snaps that adjust from 7 to 35 pounds, so they&#8217;ll grow with Tegan.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pocket in the back that you can stuff inserts into to adjust the absorbency. They come with a newborn insert, and a one-size doubler that adjusts. The best part is, you can keep using those old prefolds by stuffing them in for super-nighttime diapers! (To keep it super-simple for James, we&#8217;ll just pick one color for nighttime and have them pre-stuffed at the right absorbency.)</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-184" title="diapers 016" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-016-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-017.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-185" title="diapers 017" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-017-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-186" title="diapers 018" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-018-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>And here it is on, modeled again by Tigger:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-019.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-187" title="diapers 019" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-019-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188" title="diapers 020" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-020-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-189" title="diapers 021" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diapers-021-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>With an average of $1750-$2400 spent on disposables for one child, I&#8217;m already saving money. And I&#8217;ll never have to worry about buying another diaper again, or late-night runs to pick up more disposables and wipes, or dirty diaper pails. </p>
<p>Just throw these in a wet bag, and dump the wet bag with all the diapers in the washer. When solid poop starts coming, spray it off into the toilet, and throw it right in the wet bag. It&#8217;s really that easy. For a detergent, you can use what you&#8217;d use on baby clothes anyways. <a href="http://www.diaperjungle.com/detergent-chart.html" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a great chart that rates different options.</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about cloth diapering, here&#8217;s some great links. It seems really overwhelming, but all you need to find is a newborn solution and an infant/toddler solution that works for you:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cottonbabies.com/clothdiapers.php" target="_blank">http://www.cottonbabies.com/clothdiapers.php</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinstripesandpolkadots.com/basics.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pinstripesandpolkadots.com/basics.htm</a></p>
<p>So, no worries about trying to make a diaper cake for me, as we&#8217;re ready for fluffy butts. We do still need a wipes warmer for the cloth wipes, a toilet sprayer and a wipe solution, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?ie=UTF8&#038;type=baby&#038;id=3H0I3ZLZL8CGJ" target="_blank">if you check out the Amazon registry</a>. As for the red bin, that&#8217;s another secret stash I&#8217;m collecting for another post, another time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just in time for the third trimester, here&#8217;s your first tour of the nursery! We love it because we know it&#8217;ll transition into a great playroom as Tegan grows older. And it&#8217;s tons of fun!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the posts leading up to this, the base of the room is a <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/2010/06/24/painting-the-nursery/">magnetic chalkboard</a>, and <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/2010/06/16/making-mario-icon-tiles/">the tiles bordering the room were handcrafted by me.</a></p>
<p>The decals re-creating the classic Super Mario Bros. are <a href="http://www.whatisblik.com/shop/explore/super-mario-bros" target="_blank">made by Blik</a>. It took two packages to make it around the room. We start on the left wall and rotate around the room:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-133" title="finished10" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished10-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-134" title="finished1" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-135" title="finished11" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished11-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-136" title="finished9" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished9-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>The only American item up there is the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geek-kids/7-13-years/bce5/" target="_blank">Super Mario chess set, available at Think Geek</a>. The rest is made by Banpresto and imported from Japan. On the bookcase, the mushroom is a coin bank. The question mark block dings with a coin noise whenever you hit the bottom. The starman lights up as a steady lamp or blinks and plays the invincibility theme. The 1up on the shelf has a solar panel and it waves back and forth whenever light hits it. The mushroom pillow on the glider is a 2D flat pillow.</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-137" title="finished2" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-154" title="finished" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-139" title="finished6" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished6-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The Mario plush figures hanging from the mobile and fan pulls are also by Banpresto, &#8220;For use only as prize in Japan&#8221; (that was the only English on any of the tags from Japan!). The Mario blanket is by made by <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/20564907/personalized-super-mario-blanket-you?ref=sr_gallery_3&amp;ga_search_query=mario+blanket&amp;ga_search_type=tag_title_description" target="_blank">SewSassyHeirlooms on Etsy</a>, and is absolutely beautiful! She custom makes them in your choice of colors too.</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-140" title="finished3" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished13.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-141" title="finished13" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished13-e1277777784733-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-142" title="finished5" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished5-e1277777851378-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-143" title="finished4" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/finished4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The original Super Mario Bros. game was found on eBay, and then I shadowboxed it. It hangs right above the light switch when you enter.</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nursery.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-156" title="nursery" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nursery-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s about 300 degrees panoramic view of the Mario scene:</p>
<p><a href="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nurserypano1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-159" title="nurserypano1" src="http://teganalexandria.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nurserypano1-1024x157.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this mini-tour of the nursery, and come by to visit it soon! The 360-degree view really makes you feel like you&#8217;re inside the game.</p>
